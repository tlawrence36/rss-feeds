      "Swedish slow TV hit \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d has become a phenomenon",
      "Before Swedish slow TV hit \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d began airing Tuesday, Ulla Malmgren stocked up on coffee and prepared meals. She doesn't want to miss a moment of the 20-day, 24-hour event.",
      "\u201cSleep? Forget it. I don\u2019t sleep,\u201d she said.",
      "Malmgren, 62, isn't alone. The show, called \u201c Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen \u201d in Swedish and sometimes translated as \u201cThe Great Elk Trek\u201d in English, began in 2019 with nearly a million people watching. In 2024, the production hit 9 million viewers on SVT Play, the streaming platform for national broadcaster SVT.",
      "The livestream kicked off a week ahead of schedule due to warm weather and early moose movement. Malmgren was ready.",
      "From now until May 4, the livestream's remote cameras will capture dozens of moose as they swim across the \u00c5ngerman River, some 300 kilometers (187 miles) northwest of Stockholm, in the annual spring migration toward summer grazing pastures.",
      "Not much happens for hours at a time, and fans say that's the beauty of it.",
      "\u201cI feel relaxed, but at the same time I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a moose, oh! What if there\u2019s a moose? I can\u2019t go to the toilet!\u2019\u201d said William Garp Liljefors, 20, who has collected more than 150 moose plush toys since 2020.",
      "\u201cThe Great Moose Migration\" is part of a trend that began in 2009 with Norwegian public broadcaster NRK's minute-by-minute airing of a seven-hour train trip across the southern part of the country.",
      "The slow TV style of programming has spread, with productions in the United Kingdom, China and elsewhere. The central Dutch city of Utrecht, for example, installed a \u201c fish doorbell \u201d on a river lock that lets livestream viewers alert authorities to fish being held up as they migrate to spawning grounds.",
      "Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University in Sweden, said slow TV has roots in reality television but lacks the staging and therefore feels more authentic for viewers. The productions allow the audience to relax and watch the journey unfold.",
      "\u201cIt became, in a strange way, gripping because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,\" she said. \"But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.\u201d",
      "As an expert and a fan of \u201cThe Great Moose Migration,\u201d Hill said the livestream helps her slow down her day by following the natural rhythms of spring.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely a moment to have a calm, atmospheric setting in my own home, and I really appreciate it,\u201d she said.",
      "The calming effect extends to the crew, according to Johan Erhag, SVT's project manager for \u201cThe Great Moose Migration.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone who works with it goes down in their normal stress,\u201d he said.",
      "The moose have walked the route for thousands of years, making it easy for the crew to know where to lay some 20,000 meters (almost 12 miles) of cable and position 26 remote cameras and seven night cameras. A drone is also used.",
      "The crew of up to 15 people works out of SVT\u2019s control room in Ume\u00e5, producing the show at a distance to avoid interfering with the migration.",
      "SVT won't say how much the production costs, but Erhag said it's cheap when accounting for the 506 hours of footage aired last year.",
      "Erhag said Swedes have always been fascinated by the roughly 300,000 moose roaming in their woods. The Scandinavian country's largest animal is known as \u201cKing of the Forest.\u201d A bull moose can reach 210 centimeters (6 feet 10 inches) at shoulder height and weigh 450 kilograms (992 pounds).",
      "Despite their size, the herbivores are typically shy and solitary.",
      "\u201cWe actually don\u2019t see it very often. You often see it when you\u2019re out driving maybe once or twice in your life,\u201d Erhag said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one thing why it has been so, so popular. And then you bring in the nature to everyone\u2019s living room.\"",
      "Hanna Sandberg, 36, first began watching the show in 2019, though she didn't spot any moose. She tuned in the following year, finally saw some and got hooked.",
      "\u201cYou can watch them and be a part of their natural habitat in a way that you could never be otherwise,\u201d she said.",
      "After hours of showing an empty forest, a camera captures footage of a moose approaching the riverbank. Suddenly, slow TV turns urgent.",
      "The push alert hits SVT's app \u2014 \u201cF\u00f6rsta \u00e4lgarna i bild!\u201d which translates to \u201cFirst moose on camera!\u201d \u2014 as viewers worldwide tune in. The livestream's chat explodes as commenters type encouragement for the animal, now making its way into the water.",
      "\u201dI would actually like to be a little fly on the wall in every household that watches the moose migration. Because I think there is about a million people saying about the same thing: \u2018Go on! Yes, you can do it!\u2019\" Malmgren said.",
      "Mega-fans like Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, are committed to watching as many hours as possible.",
      "\u201cI was late to school because I saw moose and my teacher was like, \u2018What, you saw moose in the city?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018No, it\u2019s on the TV,\u2019\u201d Garp Liljefors said.",
      "Malmgren said friends and family have learned not to bother her when the moose are on the move.",
      "\u201cWhen someone asks me, \u2018What are you doing? Oh, never mind, it\u2019s the great migration,\u2019\" she said. \"They know.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Five years after Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and hauled to jail in handcuffs, the disgraced movie mogul returns to a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday for a new trial covering the very same allegations",
      "NEW YORK -- Five years after Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and hauled to jail in handcuffs, the former movie mogul returns to a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday for a new trial covering the very same allegations \u2014 plus one that hasn't been tried before.",
      "It isn\u2019t double jeopardy, but rather a legal redo after a New York appeals court overturned the landmark #MeToo verdict a year ago.",
      "The state\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s convictions and 23-year prison sentence and ordered a new trial after finding that the original one was tilted by \u201cegregious\u201d judicial rulings and prejudicial testimony.",
      "Jury selection could take a few days. Opening statements and the start of testimony are expected next week. Judge Curtis Farber said that in addition to 12 jurors, six alternates will be picked. Prosecutors expect the retrial to last a month.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Weinstein\u2019s retrial:",
      "In some ways, the new trial will be two trials spliced into one.",
      "Weinstein, 73, faces charges involving two women from his original trial in 2020, Jessica Mann and Miriam Haley, and he\u2019s being tried for the first time on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t in the first case.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone. Prosecutors are not allowed to retry Weinstein on certain counts that he was acquitted of during his first trial, including charges of predatory sexual assault and one count of first-degree rape.",
      "The judicial reboot will play out in a different climate than Weinstein\u2019s first trial, which drew intense media attention and saw protesters chanting \u201crapist\u201d outside the courthouse.",
      "The #MeToo movement, spawned by scores of allegations in 2017 against the ex-studio boss, has evolved and ebbed over time, and Weinstein has since been convicted in a separate rape case in Los Angeles \u2014 a verdict he is also appealing.",
      "While some stars are still facing a legal reckoning for alleged sexual misconduct \u2013 like Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who is set to go to trial next month \u2013 the drumbeat of allegations against powerful figures has abated from #MeToo\u2019s early days.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on two charges from his original trial: one count of criminal sex act for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and one count of third-degree rape for allegedly assaulting an aspiring actor in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Haley, a former production assistant on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway,\u201d testified at the 2020 trial that he pushed her onto a bed at his Manhattan apartment in June 2006 and forced oral sex on her, undeterred by her kicks and pleas of, \u201cNo, please don\u2019t do this, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, acknowledged that she kept in touch with Weinstein, exchanged warm messages with him, and accepted an invitation to his hotel room two weeks after the alleged assault, where he pulled her into bed for sex. Under New York law applicable at the time, Weinstein has not being charged with rape in connection with Haley\u2019s allegations.",
      "Mann, who said she saw Weinstein as a \u201cpseudo father\u201d figure as she pursued an acting career after a rough upbringing, testified at the 2020 trial that he trapped her in a hotel room in March 2013, ordered her to undress as he loomed over her, and then raped her. She alleges that Weinstein raped her again eight months later at a Beverly Hills hotel, where she worked as a hairdresser.",
      "Mann also kept in touch with Weinstein after the alleged assault, testifying that she sent him flattering emails, because \u201chis ego was so fragile,\u201d she said, and it \u201cmade me feel safe, worshipping him in this sense.\u201d",
      "In addition to Haley and Mann, Weinstein is also charged with one count of criminal sex act for allegedly forcing oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "That woman, who was not part of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, has not been named publicly. The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann have done.",
      "Prosecutors said that the woman came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein's conviction, but revisited them and secured a new indictment after the first verdict was thrown out.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors shouldn't have waited nearly five years to bring the additional charge.",
      "New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction in April 2024.",
      "In a 4-3 decision, the court said then-Judge James Burke had denied Weinstein a fully fair trial by letting three women testify about allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case and his decision to let prosecutors confront Weinstein, if he had testified, over his history of brutish behavior.",
      "The court labeled the allegations against Weinstein \u201cappalling, shameful, repulsive conduct\u201d but warned that \u201cdestroying a defendant\u2019s character under the guise of prosecutorial need\u201d did not justify some trial evidence and testimony. Burke\u2019s term expired at the end of 2022, and he is no longer a judge.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Court of Appeals Judge Madeline Singas wrote that her colleagues in the majority were continuing a \u201cdisturbing trend of overturning juries\u2019 guilty verdicts in cases involving sexual violence.\u201d",
      "The ruling came at \u201cthe expense and safety of women,\u201d she wrote.",

      "SAN ANTONIO -- A Texas rapper who performed as Tay-K and was best known for his 2017 single \u201cThe Race\u201d was convicted of murder for a second time after a jury found him guilty of fatally shooting a San Antonio man.",
      "Taymor McIntyre faces up to life in prison with the possibility of parole for the killing of 23-year-old Mark Anthony Saldivar in 2017. McIntyre had already been been serving a 55-year sentence over a separate fatal shooting.",
      "Prosecutors said that McIntyre shot Saldivar after the rapper tried to rob him. Authorities said McIntyre had picked up Saldivar, who was a photographer, in a car after asking him to take photos of the rapper for a new song.",
      "McIntyre\u2019s attorneys had criticized the police investigation of the shooting, alleging the case relied too much on self-serving statements from witnesses in the car when the shooting happened.",
      "\u201cTaymor McIntyre is not guilty of capital murder, murder, or manslaughter, and the reason for that is very simple,\u201d John Hunter, one of McIntyre\u2019s attorneys, told jurors during closing arguments last week. \u201cYou have to do it right. You have to do the work. And this case clearly demonstrates the work wasn\u2019t done.\u201d",
      "The jury found McIntyre not guilty of capital murder, which would have meant a life sentence without the chance of parole. The jury will now hear evidence in the trial\u2019s punishment phase before deciding on a sentence.",
      "McIntyre was also convicted in 2019 for the shooting death of 21-year-old Ethan Walker during a home invasion in 2016 in Mansfield, southeast of Fort Worth, Texas.",
      "McIntyre recorded \u201cThe Race\" while he was on the run from authorities for the home invasion.",

      "In its vaults, the museum preserves 15,000 artifacts seized or confiscated from the black market over the years by a police unit focused on the protection of cultural heritage. It is the loot of raiders who for decades have targeted sites from classical antiquity in southern Italy, such as Pompeii and Herculaneum. Some even used underwater metal detectors, GPS, sonar and drones to extract treasures from the shipwrecks and archaeological sites submerged in the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "From its repository, the museum selected 600 pieces to display for visitors. Among them is a statue that had been in an apartment building's courtyard since the early 20th century until its theft in the 1980s, and which was found in 2009. There are artifacts from Pompeii that a French archaeologist bought from a local farmer in the 1990s for 50,000 lire (about $28 today). There are also ancient ceramics, coins, bronzes, marbles, pottery, furnishings, weapons and armor dating from the Archaic Period (approximately 650 to 480 BC) to the Middle Ages.",
      "\u201cIt is a beautiful exhibition that tells a beautiful story, a story also of redemption for our stolen archaeological artifacts, which often find their way into private property or even international museums,\" Massimo Osanna, the head of national museums at Italy\u2019s culture ministry, who helped curate the exhibition, said in an interview. \"Thanks to the work of the public prosecutor\u2019s office and the police, together with the ministry, (these artifacts) are finally coming home and to light.\u201d",
      "In 2023, the latest year for which there are complete records, the police unit recovered over 100,000 artifacts which it estimates are worth a total 264 million euros ($299 million).",

      "Before she kicks off her upcoming world tour, Katy Perry is reaching for the stars",
      "ONTARIO, Calif. -- After a long day of rehearsing for her upcoming world tour, Katy Perry decided to peruse a few books to help her unwind before bed.",
      "\u201cI was listening to \u2018Cosmos\u2019 by Carl Sagan and reading a book on string theory,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in astrophysics and interested in astronomy and astrology and the stars. We are all made of stardust and we all come from the stars.\u201d",
      "But the pop superstar was motivated by more than just curiosity. On Monday, she will join Jeff Bezos\u2019 fiancee Lauren Sanchez, journalist Gayle King and three other women on an all-female Blue Origin spaceflight. Perry spoke with The Associated Press at her Southern California rehearsal space on Wednesday, days before she was set to leave for training in Texas.",
      "\u201cI am talking to myself every day and going, \u2018You\u2019re brave, you\u2019re bold, you are doing this for the next generation to inspire so many different people but especially young girls to go, \u201cI\u2019ll go to space in the future.\u201d No limitations,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Perry said she has been \u201cpsychologically\u201d preparing for the spaceflight by reading work from the late Sagan and other scientists.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really excited about the engineering of it all. I\u2019m excited to learn more about STEM and just the math about what it takes to accomplish this type of thing,\u201d she said.",
      "An all-female spaceflight seems an apt endeavor for the 40-year-old Perry, whose collection of hits include songs about extraterrestrials (\u201cE.T.\u201d) and fireworks shooting across the sky (\u201cFirework\u201d), as well as feminist anthems like her 2013 hit, \u201cRoar,\u201d and \u201cWOMAN\u2019S WORLD,\u201d off her most recent album.",
      "Perry said that whenever she is doing something new or daunting, she looks inward for strength and confidence.",
      "\u201cUsing that feminine divine that I was born with and definitely unlocked when I had my daughter even more. It leveled up for sure. Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,\u201d she said. Her daughter, Daisy, 4, joined Perry before her rehearsal.",
      "Bezos\u2019 rocket company Blue Origin announced the crew in February. Sanchez, a helicopter pilot and former TV journalist, picked the women who will join her on a 10-minute spaceflight from West Texas aboard a New Shepard rocket. Perry, Sanchez and King will be joined by Aisha Bowe, a former NASA rocket scientist who now heads an engineering firm, research scientist Amanda Nguyen and movie producer Kerianne Flynn.",
      "\u201cI am feeling so grateful and grounded and honored to be invited and included with this incredible group of women,\u201d Perry said. Whenever she gets nervous about the trip, she reminds herself how important it is.",
      "Blue Origin has flown tourists on short hops to space since 2021, after Bezos climbed aboard with his brother for the inaugural trip; the upcoming trip will be the company's 11th human spaceflight. Some passengers have received free rides, while others have paid a hefty sum to experience weightlessness. The company declined to comment on who is footing the bill for Monday's flight.",
      "The news of the upcoming trip has not been without critiques, most recently from actor Olivia Munn, who bemoaned the mission's cost and publicity. But Perry believes an all-women crew \u2014 the first since Valentina Tereshkova\u2019s solo spaceflight in 1963 \u2014 has historic ramifications.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an important moment for the future of commercial space travel and for humanity in general and for women all around,\u201d she said, citing the fact that only about 11% of the people who have gone to space have been women. \u201cI\u2019m excited for that number to be even more equal after this flight. And I just feel like, \u2018Put us in coach.\u2019\u201d",

      "The 51-year-old Lauren, identified by police as Jillian Shriner and listed as Jillian Lauren Shriner in jail records, had injuries that were not life threatening after the shooting in the northeast Los Angeles neighborhood of Eagle Rock on Thursday, the LAPD said in a statement.",
      "Her representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment and there is no indication Scott Shriner was involved in the incident. Weezer is scheduled to play the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on Saturday.",
      "Police said they were assisting California Highway Patrol officers in their search for three suspects from a misdemeanor hit-and-run. Lauren was not among the suspects. But while pursuing one of them who had reportedly been running through a backyard, police came upon Lauren in the front yard of her neighboring residence, holding a handgun.",
      "They ordered her several times to drop the gun, but she refused, and pointed it at them, police allege. They did not say whether she fired the gun, but said she was hit by police gunfire and fled into her home, where they took her into custody then took her to a hospital.",
      "A 9-millimeter handgun was recovered from Shriner\u2019s home, the police statement said.",
      "She was later booked and was being held on $1 million bail, LA County jail records showed.",
      "Lauren has not made a court appearance, and it was not immediately clear whether she has hired a lawyer. There were no immediate responses to an email to her manager and a message left on her author website. There was also no response to an email seeking comment from a representative for Weezer.",
      "Lauren is the author of two bestselling memoirs, 2010's \u201cSome Girls: My Life in a Harem\u201d and 2015's \u201cEverything You Ever Wanted.\u201d",

      "Lawyers for 40 women who accused writer and director James Toback of sexual abuse over a 35-year span say they have been awarded $1.68 billion from a New York jury",
      "A New York jury on Wednesday awarded $1.68 billion in damages to 40 women who accused writer and director James Toback of sexual abuse and other crimes over a span of 35 years, according to lawyers representing the plaintiffs.",
      "The decision stems from a lawsuit filed in Manhattan in 2022 after New York state instituted a one-year window for people to file lawsuits over sexual assault claims even if they took place decades ago.",
      "It marks one of the largest jury awards since the advent of the #MeToo movement, as well as in New York state history, said attorney Brad Beckworth, of the law firm Nix Patterson LLP, in an interview. The plaintiffs, he said, believe such a large verdict will send a message to powerful individuals \u201cwho don't treat women appropriately.\u201d",
      "The court had not yet released documentation of the verdict as of Wednesday night. Beckworth said the verdict included $280 million in compensatory damages and $1.4 billion for punitive damages to the plaintiffs.",
      "\u201cThis verdict is about justice,\u201d Beckworth said in a statement. \u201cBut more importantly, It\u2019s about taking power back from the abusers \u2014 and their and enablers \u2014 and returning it to those he tried to control and silence.\u201d",
      "Beckworth said the abuse took place between 1979 and 2014.",
      "Toback was nominated for an Oscar for writing 1991\u2032s \u201cBugsy,\u201d and his career in Hollywood has spanned more than 40 years. Accusations that he engaged in years of sexual abuse surfaced in late 2017 as the #MeToo movement gained attention. They were first reported by the Los Angeles Times.",
      "In 2018, Los Angeles prosecutors said the statutes of limitations had expired in five cases they reviewed, and declined to bring criminal charges against Toback.",
      "The plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit in New York a few days after the state's Adult Survivors Act went into effect. The lawyers said they discovered a pattern of Toback attempting to lure young women on the streets of New York into meeting him by falsely promising roles in his films and then subjecting them to sexual acts, threats and psychological coercion.",
      "Mary Monahan, a lead plaintiff in the case, called the jury award \u201cvalidation\u201d for her and the other women.",
      "\u201cFor decades, I carried this trauma in silence, and today, a jury believed me. Believed us. That changes everything,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis verdict is more than a number \u2014 it\u2019s a declaration. We are not disposable. We are not liars. We are not collateral damage in someone else\u2019s power trip. The world knows now what we\u2019ve always known: what he did was real.\u201d",
      "Toback, 80, who most recently had represented himself, denied numerous times in court documents that he \u201ccommitted any sexual offense\u201d and that \u201cany sexual encounter or contact between Plaintiffs and Defendant was consensual.\u201d",
      "He also argued that New York's law extending the statute of limitations on sexual abuse cases violated his constitutional rights.",
      "A message sent to an email address listed for him seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "In January, the judge in the case entered a default judgment against Toback, who had failed to appear in court when ordered to do so. The judge then scheduled a trial for only damages last month to determine how much Toback had to pay the women.",

      "Smart phones have largely been a bit of a buzzkill for horror films, leading filmmakers to find all kinds of reasons \u2014 dead batteries, no service \u2014 to strand potential prey. But at least since 1949\u2019s \u201cSorry, Wrong Number,\u201d phones have also been a reliable conduit for terror capable of reaching into the home, or your pocket. \u201cDrop,\u201d a silly but suspenseful new thriller, carries on the tradition of \u201cWhen a Stranger Calls\" and \u201cPhone Booth\u201d by situating its tension around mysterious, threatening phone messages.",
      "Violet ( Meghann Fahy ), a widow with a young child, is on her first date in years. After three months of texting, she has hesitantly agreed to finally meet Henry (Brandon Sklenar) for dinner. When they sit down in a fancy restaurant high up a sleek Chicago high-rise, he\u2019s charming and relaxed. But Violet, like countless dates before her, can\u2019t stay off her phone.",
      "In Violet\u2019s case, though, the distraction is legitimate. She keeps getting messages dropped to her phone threatening her son, who\u2019s at home with Violet\u2019s sister (Violett Beane), unless she does what he says, including killing her date. In her home security cameras she can see a man with his face covered brandishing a gun.",
      "\u201cDrop,\u201d directed by Christopher Landon (\u201cHappy Death Day\u201d), doesn\u2019t differ greatly from the large swath of high-concept, low-budget thrillers that regularly flood theaters. But it\u2019s a taut little movie, almost totally set in the restaurant, with a just keen enough sense of plausible and preposterous. It knows to keep the pressure-cooker plot moving while not overstaying its welcome. At a nifty 95 minutes, \u201cDrop\u201d knows when to hang up.",
      "As if adding a digital twist to the old line \u201cThe call is coming from inside the house,\u201d Violet is getting message from an app called DigiDrop that can only be sent from a person within 50 feet. That means everyone in the restaurant \u2014 the bro who bumps into her, the cheesy waiter, the kind bartender \u2014 is a suspect. With her terrorizer watching her every move and prohibiting her from breathing a word to anyone, Violet is stuck rooted to her table when every fiber of her being wants to rescue her son.",
      "A considerable help to the film are the grounded screen presences of Fahy (\u201cThe White Lotus\u201d) and Sklenar (\u201c1923\u201d), both small-screen breakouts who here show movie-star poise. As the plot unspools, there are, naturally, quibbles one could make. Would a mother, with a masked gunman outside her toddler\u2019s door be able to feign interest in a duck salad? Does the highly orchestrated trap laid for her match the motives of the criminal mastermind? And while we're asking questions, could we not someday get a phone-themed thriller titled \u201cButt Dial\u201d?",
      "But if \u201cDrop\u201d is invariably quite a bit less than realistic, it has a whiff of metaphor. Violet isn\u2019t just stepping back into the dating pool as a single mom, she\u2019s trying to shake the past trauma of spousal abuse. Going on a date with Henry, whom she met on an app, is a kind of crap shoot. Will going out with a stranger met online end in love or violence?",
      "You could also read \u201cDrop\u201d as an extreme version of a more ubiquitous scourge. This is a movie where the bad guy, for nearly the duration of the movie, is nothing but text messages. (They are typically flashed large across the screen.) As Violet grows increasingly preoccupied and frantic, she could be just about anyone \u2014 a workaholic after hours, a teenager, a desperate Knicks fan watching the score \u2014 whose attention is held prisoner by her phone. How much of the terror of \u201cDrop\u201d would have existed at all, if she had just put it on silent?",
      "\"Drop,\u201d a Universal Pictures release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for strong violent content, suicide, some strong language and sexual references. Running time: 95 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "This year, the theme \u2014 \u201cTailored For You\" \u2014 is focused on classic tailoring. As always, the dress code is inspired by the spring exhibit at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d is the first Met show to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first in more than 20 years to have a menswear theme. The show looks at the evolution of Black style over the centuries through the lens of dandyism.",

      "Not everyone knows that the gala is actually a fundraiser for the Costume Institute, the only self-funding department at the Met. Last year the evening brought in a whopping sum of more than $26 million to the museum's coffers.",
      "Definitely not. It started in 1948 as a Manhattan society midnight supper \u2013 held at various places like the Waldorf Astoria and the Rainbow Room. It took many years before it turned into a global event and one of the starriest nights of the year.",

      "The code is meant to be a guide, not a hard rule, and loose interpretation is encouraged. Sometimes, that interpretation extends not only to what guests put on, but what they take off. Lady Gaga did a 16-minute striptease on the gala carpet in 2019. Jared Leto spent the evening in 2023 carrying around his huge cat head, a tribute to Karl Lagerfeld's beloved pet.",
      "Guests enter the museum and walk past an enormous flower arrangement in the museum\u2019s grand lobby \u2013 always a talking point. Often there is an an orchestra playing nearby. At the top of the grand staircase, Wintour and her co-hosts form a receiving line. Guests then head either to cocktails or to view the exhibit. Cocktails are followed by dinner.

      "The roof of an iconic nightclub in the capital of the Dominican Republic collapsed nearly an hour after a merengue concert began, killing at least 98 people and injuring at least 160",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- The roof of an iconic nightclub in the capital of the Dominican Republic collapsed nearly an hour after a merengue concert began, killing at least 98 people and injuring at least 160. Politicians and athletes were among those at Jet Set in Santo Domingo when disaster struck Tuesday.",
      "Officials said it\u2019s too early to determine why the roof fell.",
      "Rescue crews searched for survivors in the rubble through the night as a crowd of people awaiting word from their loved ones waited anxiously nearby.",
      "The roof collapsed nearly an hour after the merengue concert headed by Rubby P\u00e9rez began at Jet Set, which was known for hosting merengue parties every Monday that drew international and national artists and high-profile Dominicans.",
      "A video posted on social media shows parts of the roof falling as people began to move away seconds before the entire roof fell.",
      "Nelsy Cruz, the governor of Monte Cristi province and sister of seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star Nelson Cruz, was the first person to alert Dominican President Luis Abinader about the disaster. She called him and said she was buried under the debris, according to first lady Raquel Abraje.",
      "Nelsy Cruz later died at the hospital from her injuries, officials said.",
      "Authorities say it\u2019s too early to determine why the roof fell. Firefighters removed blocks of broken concrete and created makeshift planks to try and reach survivors buried under the debris.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how often government officials inspect buildings in the Dominican Republic and when the last inspection was done at Jet Set.",
      "A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Public Works told The Associated Press that all officials were on scene and not available. She referred questions to the mayor\u2019s office.",
      "A spokesperson for the mayor\u2019s office could not be reached for comment.",
      "The owners of Jet Set, who issued a statement saying they were cooperating with authorities, could not be immediately reached for comment.",
      "Relatives of merengue singer Rubby P\u00e9rez, who was performing when the roof collapsed, said earlier that he was rescued. But Juan Manuel M\u00e9ndez, director of the Center of Emergency Operations, said late Tuesday afternoon that information \u201cturned out to be false.\u201d He said rescue crews were still looking for P\u00e9rez.",
      "Meanwhile, the singer\u2019s manager, Enrique Paulino, whose shirt was spattered with blood, said the group\u2019s saxophonist died.",
      "The Professional Baseball League of the Dominican Republic posted on X that former MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel died. Officials had earlier rescued Dotel from the debris and transported him to a hospital. Also killed was Dominican baseball player Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera, said Satosky Terrero, league spokesman.",
      "It\u2019s an iconic nightclub in southern Santo Domingo that has operated for nearly five decades. It was known for its \u201cJet Set Mondays\u201d that featured local and international artists.",
      "The club opened in 1973 as a club and restaurant, becoming the most popular venue of its kind in the Dominican Republic, according to List\u00edn Diario, a local newspaper.",
      "It later moved from the place where it originally opened, celebrating its first anniversary with merengue and salsa icon Johnny Ventura.",
      "The club underwent renovations in 2010 and 2015, and it was struck by lightning in 2023, according to the newspaper.",
      "General admission tickets for Monday\u2019s concert with Rubby P\u00e9rez were $32, while the VIP ones were $40, according to the club\u2019s website.",
      "Rescue crews were to continue looking for survivors through the night.",
      "While an in-depth investigation into the collapse is expected, authorities have not yet commented on what might have caused the roof to fall, including any potential preliminary findings.",
      "Prosecutor Rosalba Ramos told TV station CDN that while \u201ceveryone wants to know\u201d what happened, authorities were still focused on finding survivors.",

      "A new study has found that fewer people crossed state lines for abortions in 2024 than the previous year",
      "Fewer people crossed state lines to obtain abortions in 2024 than a year earlier, a new survey has found.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, estimates in a report released Tuesday that the overall number of clinician-provided abortions in states where it's legal rose by less than 1% from 2023 to 2024.",
      "But the number of people crossing state lines for abortions dropped by about 9%.",
      "The report, based on a monthly survey of providers, is the latest look at how the abortion landscape in the U.S. has evolved since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022 in a ruling that eliminated a national constitutional right to abortion and opened the door to state bans and restrictions.",
      "Guttmacher estimates there were 1.04 million abortions in 2024, up about 1% from its total the previous year.",
      "Multiple studies have found that the total number of abortions in the U.S. has risen since Dobbs, despite some states implementing bans.",
      "Twelve states currently enforce abortion bans with limited exceptions at all stages of pregnancy. Four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "Guttmacher's tally does not capture self-managed abortions such as people obtaining abortion pills from community networks, foreign pharmacies or through telehealth from medical providers in states that have laws intended to protect those who send pills into places with bans. There\u2019s a court battle over the constitutionality of such laws. But another survey found that the number of telehealth pills being sent into states with bans has been growing and accounted for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S. by the summer of 2024.",
      "Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist at Guttmacher, said even though the number of abortions is up, it's likely some people who would like to end their pregnancies are not able to.",
      "\u201cWe know that some people are accessing abortion through telehealth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know it\u2019s not an option for everybody.\u201d",
      "The number of people crossing state lines for abortions dropped to about 155,000 from nearly 170,000.",
      "The year-to-year impact varies by state.",
      "For instance, about 1 in 8 abortions in Florida in the first half of 2023 were provided to people coming from out of state. By the second half of 2024 \u2014 when a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy took effect \u2014 only about 1 in 50 were for people from another state.",
      "More people traveled to states including Virginia and New York after the Florida law took hold.",
      "A drop in people traveling to Minnesota could be linked to abortions being offered again in clinics in Wisconsin.",
      "Most abortions in Kansas are provided to people from elsewhere and the number grew as clinic capacity expanded.",
      "A working paper released in March provided different insight into the impact of the bans.",
      "It found that birth rates rose from 2020 to 2023 in counties farther from abortion clinics. Rates rose faster for Black and Hispanic women, those with lower education levels, and people who are unmarried.",
      "\u201cThe takeaway is that distance still matters,\u201d said Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economic professor and one of the authors of the working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t obvious that that would be the case.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese bans are more than just policies; these are direct attacks on bodily autonomy,\" said Regina Davis Moss, president and CEO of In Our Own Voice: National Black Women\u2019s Reproductive Justice Agenda.",
      "The bans also exacerbate the huge disparities in maternal mortality for Black women in the U.S, she said. Black women died around the time of childbirth at a rate nearly 3.5 times higher than white women in 2023.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be faced with increasing numbers of births, which is going to increase the maternal mortality rate, the infant mortality rate and inequities in care,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very upsetting and sad.\u201d",
      "Bree Wallace, director of case management at the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund in Florida, which helps with the logistics and costs of abortions, said people who consider getting an abortion don\u2019t always know their options.",
      "\u201cMany people don\u2019t know their choices or think that it\u2019s just not possible to go out of state,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people hear \u2018ban\u2019 or \u2018six-week ban\u2019 in their state and that\u2019s it.\u201d",

      "A man has been arrested near UnitedHealthcare\u2019s headquarters after threatening violence",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A man was arrested near UnitedHealthcare\u2019s headquarters in Minnesota after threatening violence, months after the company's CEO was killed, authorities said Monday.",
      "The man was spotted around 11 a.m. in a parking lot outside of the UnitedHealthcare corporate campus in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka. City spokesman Andy Wittenborg said the man contacted the FBI's field office in Minneapolis once he arrived, and an FBI negotiator made contact with him by phone.",
      "\u201cWhile the investigation is still in its early stages, there is currently no indication that the individual had specific grievances against UnitedHealthcare,\u201d Wittenborg said in a statement.",
      "City police and the FBI coordinated their response and had steady contact with the man, successfully encouraging him to peacefully surrender to authorities after about an hour with no threat to the public, Wittenborg said. The man, who'd had previous contacts with Minnetonka police, had showed up at a security checkpoint where he was not supposed to be.",
      "Wittenborg said the incident had nothing to do with the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was shot to death in New York City on Dec. 4 as he was walking to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan. The man accused of killing him, Luigi Mangione, 26, pleaded not guilty in December to state murder and terror charges.",
      "News helicopter video of the aftermath showed over a dozen law enforcement vehicles from multiple agencies at the scene, as well as an ambulance that was standing by. There were no reports of injuries.",
      "The CEO\u2019s killing and ensuing manhunt leading to Mangione\u2019s arrest rattled the business community, with some health insurers hastily switching to remote work or online shareholder meetings. It also galvanized health insurance critics \u2014 some of whom rallied around Mangione as a stand-in for frustrations over coverage denials and hefty medical bills.",
      "Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind. Police say the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase commonly used to describe insurer tactics to avoid paying claims.",
      "Mangione also faces federal charges, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said earlier this month she has directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty.",

    "story": [
      "The measles outbreak in West Texas didn\u2019t happen just by chance",
      "The measles outbreak in West Texas didn\u2019t happen just by chance.",
      "The easily preventable disease, declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, ripped through communities sprawling across more than 20 Texas counties in part because health departments were starved of the funding needed to run vaccine programs, officials say.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a strong immunization program that can really do a lot of boots-on-the-ground work for years,\u201d said Katherine Wells, the health director in Lubbock, a 90-minute drive from the outbreak's epicenter.",
      "Immunization programs nationwide have been left brittle by years of stagnant funding by federal, state and local governments. In Texas and elsewhere, this helped set the stage for the measles outbreak and fueled its spread. Now cuts to federal funding threaten efforts to prevent more cases and outbreaks.",
      "Health departments got an influx of cash to deal with COVID-19, but it wasn\u2019t enough to make up for years of neglect. On top of that, trust in vaccines has eroded. Health officials warn the situation is primed to get worse.",
      "Recent cuts by the Trump administration have pulled billions of dollars in COVID-19 related funding \u2014 $2 billion of it slated for immunization programs for various diseases. Overseeing the cuts is Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who rose to prominence leading an anti-vaccine movement. While Kennedy has said he wants his agency to prevent future outbreaks, he's also declined to deliver a consistent and forceful message that would help do so \u2014 encouraging people to vaccinate their children against measles while reminding them it is safe.",
      "At the same time, lawmakers in Texas and about two-thirds of states have introduced legislation this year that would make it easier to opt out of vaccines or otherwise put up barriers to ensuring more people get shots, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. That further undercuts efforts to keep infectious diseases at bay, health officials said.",
      "The more than 700 measles cases reported this year in the U.S. have already surpassed last year\u2019s total. The vast majority \u2014 more than 540 \u2014 are in Texas, but cases have popped up in 23 other states. Two Texas children have died. A 6-year-old girl from Gaines County, the center of the outbreak, died in February, the first measles death in the U.S. in a decade. An 8-year-old girl from the same town, Seminole, died earlier this month.",
      "Children in the U.S. are generally required to be vaccinated to go to school, which in the past ensured vaccination rates stayed high enough to prevent infectious diseases like measles from spreading. But a growing number of parents have been skipping the shots for their kids. The share of children exempted from vaccine requirements has reached an all-time high, and just 92.7% of kindergartners got their required shots in 2023. That\u2019s well below the 95% coverage level that keeps diseases at bay.",
      "Keeping vaccination rates high requires vigilance, commitment and money.",
      "Though the outbreak in Texas started in Mennonite communities that have been resistant to vaccines and distrustful of government intervention, it quickly jumped to other places with low vaccination rates. There are similar under-vaccinated pockets across the country that could provide the tinder that sparks another outbreak.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a hurricane over warm water in the Caribbean,\u201d said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development in Houston. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s warm water, the hurricane will continue to accelerate. In this case, the warm water is the unvaccinated kids.\u201d",
      "Lubbock receives a $254,000 immunization grant from the state annually that can be used for staff, outreach, advertising, education and other elements of a vaccine program. That hasn\u2019t increased in at least 15 years as the population grew.",
      "It used to be enough for three nurses, an administrative assistant, advertising and even goodies to give out at health fairs, Wells said. \u201cNow it covers a nurse, a quarter of a nurse, a little bit of an admin assistant, and basically nothing else.\u201d",
      "Texas has among the lowest per capita state funding for public health in the nation, just $17 per person in 2023, according to the State Health Access Data Assistance Center.",
      "Vaccines are among the most successful tools in public health\u2019s arsenal, preventing debilitating illnesses and lowering the need for expensive medical care. Childhood vaccines prevent 4 million deaths worldwide each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which says the measles vaccine will save some 19 million lives by 2030.",
      "U.S. immunization programs are funded by a variable mix of federal, state and local money. Federal money is sent to every state, which then decides how much to send to local health departments.",
      "The stagnant immunization grant funding in Texas has made it harder for local health departments to keep their programs going. Lubbock\u2019s health department, for example, doesn't have the money to pay for targeted Facebook ads to encourage vaccinations or do robust community outreach to build trust.",
      "In Andrews County, which borders Gaines County, the biggest cost of its immunization program is personnel. But while everything has gotten more expensive, the grant hasn't changed, Health Director Gordon Mattimoe said. That shifts the burden to county governments. Some kick in more money, some don\u2019t. His did.",
      "The problem: keeping people safe from outbreaks requires high vaccination rates across a broad region, and germs don\u2019t stop at county borders.",
      "Andrews County, population 18,000, offers a walk-in vaccine clinic Monday through Friday, but other West Texas communities don\u2019t. More than half the people who come to the clinic travel from other counties, Mattimoe said, including much larger places and Gaines County.",
      "Some had to drive an hour or more. They did so because they had trouble getting shots in their home county due to long waits, lack of providers and other issues, Mattimoe said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re unable to obtain it in the place that they live. ... People are overflowing, over to here,\u201d Mattimoe said. \u201cThere\u2019s an access issue.\u201d",
      "That makes it more likely people won\u2019t get their shots.",
      "In Gaines County just 82% of kindergartners were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella. Even in Andrews County, where, at 97%, the vaccination rate is above the 95% threshold for preventing outbreaks, it has slipped two percentage points since 2020.",
      "The health departments millions of Americans depend on for their shots largely rely on two federal programs: Vaccines for Children and Section 317 of the Public Health Services Act. Vaccines for Children mostly provides the actual vaccines. Section 317 provides grants for vaccines but also to run programs and get shots into arms.",
      "About half of kids qualify for Vaccines for Children, a safety-net program created in response to a 1989-1991 measles epidemic that sickened 55,000 people and killed 123. Section 317 money sent to state and local health departments pays for vaccines as well as nurses, outreach and advertising.",
      "Health departments generally use the programs in tandem, and since the pandemic they\u2019ve often been allowed to supplement it with COVID-19 funds.",
      "The 317 funds have been flat for years, even as costs of everything from salaries to vaccines went up. A 2023 CDC report to Congress estimated $1.6 billion was needed to fully fund a comprehensive 317 vaccine program. Last year, Congress approved less than half that: $682 million.",
      "This, along with insufficient state and local funding, forces hard choices. Dr. Kelly Moore, a preventive medicine specialist, said she faced this dilemma when directing Tennessee's immunization program from 2004 to 2018.",
      "\u201cWhat diseases can we afford to prevent and how many people can we afford to protect? Those decisions have to be made every year by every state,\u201d said Moore, who now runs the advocacy group Immunize.org.",
      "A rural clinic may have to be closed, or evening and weekend hours eliminated, she said. \u201cIt becomes difficult for them to staff the clinics they have and difficult for the people in those communities to access them, especially if they\u2019re the working poor.\u201d",
      "At the same time, health officials say more funding is needed to fight misinformation and mistrust about vaccines. In a 2023 survey by the National Association of County and City Health Officials, 80% of local health departments reported vaccine hesitancy among patients or their parents in the previous year, up from 56% in 2017.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t invest in education, it becomes even more difficult to get these diseases under control,\" Moore said.",
      "Facing these headwinds, things got much worse in March when Kennedy\u2019s health department canceled billions of dollars in state and local funding. After 23 states sued, a judge put a hold on the cuts for now in those states but not in Texas or other states that didn\u2019t join the lawsuit.",
      "But local health departments are not taking chances and are moving to cut services.",
      "HHS said the money, allocated through COVID-19 initiatives, was cut because the pandemic was over. But CDC had allowed the money to be used to shore up public health infrastructure generally, including immunization programs.",
      "Before he was confirmed as health secretary, Kennedy vowed not to take vaccines away. But in Texas, his department\u2019s cuts mean state and local health departments are losing $125 million in immunization-related federal funding as they deal with the measles outbreak. A spokesperson for the federal health department did not respond to an AP request for comment.",
      "Dallas County, 350 miles from where the outbreak began, had to cancel more than 50 immunization clinics, including at schools with low measles vaccination rates, said Dr. Philip Huang, the county\u2019s health director.",
      "Near the center of the outbreak, Lubbock\u2019s health department said seven jobs are on the line because they were paid by those grants. Included in the affected work are immunizations.",
      "Across the border in New Mexico, where the outbreak has spread, the state lost grants that funded vaccine education.",
      "It's still unclear how the recently announced $2 billion in cuts will affect immunization programs across the country, but details are starting to trickle out from some states.",
      "Washington state, for example, would lose about $20 million in vaccination-related funding. Officials were forced to pause mobile vaccine efforts on their \u201cCare-A-Van,\u201d which has administered more than 6,800 COVID-19 vaccines, 3,900 flu vaccines and 5,700 childhood vaccines since July. The state also had to cancel more than 100 vaccine clinics scheduled through June, including more than 35 at schools.",
      "Connecticut health officials estimate if the cuts stand, they will lose $26 million for immunization. Among other reductions, this means canceling 43 contracts with local health departments to increase vaccination rates and raise confidence in vaccines, losing vaccination clinics and mobile outreach in underserved neighborhoods, and stopping the distribution of vaccine-related educational materials.",
      "Several of the 23 states suing the federal government, including Minnesota, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, cite losses to vaccine programs.",
      "As the cuts further cripple already struggling health departments, alongside increasingly prominent and powerful anti-vaccine voices, doctors worry that vaccine hesitancy will keep spreading. And measles and other viruses will too.",
      "\u201cMy whole life\u2019s purpose is to keep people from suffering. And vaccines are a tremendous way to do that,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t invest in them to get them in arms, then we don\u2019t see their benefits.\u201d",

      "Santoro said his son first met Karenna Groff as a freshman studying at MIT. Groff, who grew up in Weston, Massachusetts, was an All-American soccer player studying biomedical engineering. Santoro, a math major from New Jersey, played lacrosse for the school.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Karenna Groff co-founded openPPE, helping to create a new design of masks for essential workers. In 2023, she received the prestigious NCAA woman of the year award for the previous year for her on- and off-field accomplishments.",
      "\u201cReally, this recognition is a testament to my MIT women\u2019s soccer family and all of the guidance, support, and friendship they have provided for me over the years,\u201d she said in an interview at the time.",
      "After graduating, Santoro and Groff moved to Manhattan, where Groff enrolled in medical school at New York University and Santoro worked as an investment associate for Silver Point, a hedge fund based in Greenwich, Connecticut.",
      "India-born Saini was an accomplished pelvic surgeon and the founder of Boston Pelvic Health and Wellness, according to the family statement. She trained in medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, where she met Michael Groff, who became a distinguished neurosurgeon and experienced pilot, the statement said.",
      "On Saturday morning, they all headed to Westchester County Airport in White Plains, a suburb of New York City, where they boarded Michael Groff's private plane, according to John Santoro.",
      "They were set to land at Columbia County Airport but crashed roughly 10 miles (16 kilometers) to the south. The plane was \u201ccompressed, buckled and embedded in the terrain\u201d of a muddy agricultural field, Inman said.",
      "The pilot was flying under instrument flight rules, rather than visual flight rules, but it was too soon to determine if reduced visibility from weather conditions were a factor, he said.",
      "The plane had been sold a year ago and had an upgraded cockpit with newer technology that was certified to Federal Aviation Administration standards, according to the NTSB.",
      "Investigators expect to be at the crash site for about a week and a full accident report could take between 12 and 24 months to complete, Inman said.",
      "Funeral arrangements were underway, Santoro said.",
      "\u201cThe 25 years we had with James were the best years of our lives,\u201d he added, \u201cand the joy and love he brought us will be enough to last a lifetime.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A key program using traditional medicine and foods to tackle chronic disease in Native American and Alaska Native communities has been gutted in the federal health layoffs",
      "CHANDLER, Ariz. -- CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spent time in tribal communities in Arizona and New Mexico this week highlighting ways they are trying to prevent chronic disease among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, something he has said is one of his top priorities.",
      "But Kennedy didn't appear to publicly address a Native health program using traditional medicine and foods to tackle disproportionate rates of conditions like diabetes and liver disease. The program, called Healthy Tribes, was gutted in this month's federal health layoffs.",
      "Some Native leaders say they are having trouble grasping the dissonance between Kennedy's words and his actions. With little information, they wonder if Healthy Tribes is part of the Trump administration's push to end diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. There also is confusion about what and who is left at the 11-year-old program, which was part of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under Kennedy's agency, and doled out $32.5 million a year.",
      "Tribal leaders and health officials told The Associated Press that cuts to the Healthy Tribes program are another violation of the federal government\u2019s legal obligation, or trust responsibility, to tribal nations under treaties, law and other acts. That includes funding for health care through the Indian Health Service, as well as education and public safety for citizens of the 574 federally recognized tribes.",
      "But federal funding has long fallen short of meeting those needs, leaving tribal governments to rely on additional grants and programs like Healthy Tribes.",
      "\u201cSo many layers of communications of collaboration and partnerships have just been turned off,\u201d said Onawa Miller, a Quechan Indian Nation citizen and director of tribal public health for United South and Eastern Tribes, which serves 33 tribes in those regions of the U.S. She said her organization already has received its annual $2 million in Healthy Tribes funding.",
      "Several tribal facilities received an email from a CDC employee April 1 notifying them that the positions of many people who staffed the Healthy Tribes program had been eliminated \u201cas part of the reduction in force efforts at CDC.\u201d",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees union, which represents thousands of workers at the CDC in Atlanta, said more than 30 civil servant jobs were or are being eliminated. That includes 11 positions in the Healthy Tribes program and others in the larger Division of Population Health.",
      "An email sent to the account of Healthy Tribes director Dr. Julianna Reece, an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation, was met with an automated reply: \u201cDue to the recent HHS reduction in force, I have been placed on administrative leave and will be separated from the agency on June 2nd.\u201d Reece did not respond to requests for comment sent to her federal and personal email accounts.",
      "Part of the government upheaval in the past several weeks includes top officials at the National Institutes of Health being offered transfers to Indian Health Service offices far from Washington, D.C. The National Indian Health Board also has said the government eliminated key staff and programs at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health\u2019s Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health.",
      "The government is required to consult with tribes on decisions impacting them, like mass layoffs in February at the Indian Health Service that were rescinded hours later, and tribal leaders have warned the Trump administration that such consultations are not happening. In some cases tribes can take legal action against the U.S. for failing to meet its trust responsibilities.",
      "\u201cIt is a violation of trust, without a doubt,\u201d said W. Ron Allen, chairman of the Jamestown S\u2019Klallam Tribe in Washington state.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not answer questions related to the Healthy Tribes cuts but told the AP in an email that the Indian Health Service was not impacted by this month's workforce reductions and there are no plans to consolidate any of its offices.",
      "Kennedy's swing through the Southwest included a visit to a community health center in metro Phoenix that provides physical and mental health care to Native people and a hike with the Navajo Nation president. He also moderated a panel at the Tribal Self-Governance Conference, held on the Gila River Indian Reservation in Arizona, but didn't take questions from the audience, tribal leaders on stage or journalists.",
      "Allen said he had a constructive conversation with Kennedy, reminding him IHS is already underfunded and understaffed and that tribes rely on additional federal grants and programs.",
      "\u201cYour issue is to reduce the central office, and so we\u2019re OK with that, but move the functions that serve the tribes out to the tribes,\u201d Allen said he told Kennedy. \u201cBecause if we don\u2019t have those resources, how are we gonna make our communities healthy? He agrees.\u201d",
      "Research shows Native Americans have shorter life expectancies than other ethnic groups, and the Indian Health Service says they face higher mortality rates from chronic conditions like diabetes and liver disease.",
      "In Seattle, Healthy Tribes money pays for a program called GATHER, which focuses on integrating traditional tribal medicine practices into health care. Providers at the Seattle Indian Health Board can use medicine made from plants grown in a community garden. A traditional Native medicine apprentice or healer is a part of a patient's care team.",
      "Seattle Indian Health Board President Esther Lucero, a descendant of the Navajo Nation, said her staff meets with people from the CDC and other Healthy Tribes grantees bimonthly to discuss project updates and ensure compliance with grants. But after last week's layoffs, they are having trouble contacting anyone.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t actually administer the dollars, how are you going to actually get them out to the programs?\u201d she said. \u201cWith this current administration, it\u2019s almost like every day we receive an unexpected notice, and then we will get a follow-up notice that says ... you need to move forward as usual.\u201d",
      "Lycia Ortega, interim CEO of Los Angeles-based United American Indian Involvement, echoed concerns about the ambiguous and somewhat confusing messages. Her organization uses Healthy Tribes money to foster connections between younger people and elders in Native American and Alaska Native communities.",
      "Native communities have had to push back against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to cut programs that might be considered DEI initiatives, she said, with the help of lawyers, policy experts and watchdogs who point out areas where the government might not be honoring the trust responsibility.",
      "Native people \u201chave a distinct political power,\u201d said Ortega, a citizen of the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, but \u201cthere are policymakers who see tribes as a threat rather than a partner.\u201d",
      "Stephen Roe Lewis, governor of the Gila River Indian Community, said he told Kennedy privately that consulting with and engaging in respectful partnerships with tribes is key to fulfilling the federal government\u2019s trust responsibilities.",
      "Since the Trump administration began making massive cuts to the federal workforce, many tribal leaders have had to clarify with newly appointed federal officials that services to tribes are not based on race but rather on the political status of tribal nations.",
      "\u201cI made it very clear, we are not DEI \u2014 as tribal nations, as a political entity,\" he said.",

      "He was also quick to rebuke media who tried to interview him in English during the 2007 Rugby World Cup, which was held in France.",

      "The mix-up was discovered in February when the clinic in the city of Brisbane found that the birth parents had one too many embryos in storage, said the provider, Monash IVF, in a statement supplied Friday. Staff discovered an embryo from another patient had been mistakenly thawed and transferred to the birth mother, a spokesperson said.",
      "Australia news outlets reported the baby was born in 2024.",
      "The company, one of Australia\u2019s biggest IVF providers, said an initial investigation had not uncovered any other such errors. Its statement didn\u2019t identify the patients involved or divulge details about the child's custody.",
      "\u201cAll of us at Monash IVF are devastated and we apologise to everyone involved,\u201d said CEO Michael Knaap. \u201cWe will continue to support the patients through this extremely distressing time.\u201d",
      "The \u201chuman error\u201d was made \u201cdespite strict laboratory safety protocols being in place,\u201d the statement said. The company said it had reported the episode to the relevant regulator in the state of Queensland.",
      "Monash IVF opened in 1971 and sees patients in dozens of locations throughout Australia. Last year, the firm settled a class action lawsuit from more than 700 patients, making no admission of liability, after claims its clinics destroyed potentially viable embryos.",
      "The clinic paid a settlement of 56 million Australian dollars ($35 million).",
      "Rare cases of embryo mix-ups have been reported before, including in the United States, Britain, Israel and Europe. A woman in the U.S. state of Georgia in February filed a lawsuit against a fertility clinic after she gave birth to a stranger\u2019s baby.",

      "Public officials in 16 states and the District of Columbia are suing the Trump administration to restore access to federal pandemic relief funding for schools",
      "Public officials in 16 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration Thursday to restore access to pandemic relief aid for schools, saying the Education Department's abrupt halt of hundreds of millions of dollars of promised funding will force cuts to vital services.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by a coalition of 16 Democratic attorneys general, led by New York\u2019s Letitia James, plus Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, also a Democrat. It claims the administration's refusal to release the aid violates federal law because it reversed a prior decision to allow states to access the money through March 2026.",
      "States were notified late last month that the Education Department would not honor deadline extensions granted by the Biden administration to spend the remainder of COVID relief aid approved by by Congress to help schools and students recover from the lasting impacts of the pandemic. Schools were supposed to spend the last of the relief by January but many sought, and were granted, more time.",
      "In announcing the reversal, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said schools had \u201cample time\u201d to spend the money, but the agency would consider requests for extensions for individual projects. The department did not say how much money is left of the total $189 billion approved.",
      "New York state lost access to $134 million, James' office said in a press release. It said the relief funding has supported repairs and improvements to school buildings and the purchase of library books, playground equipment and wheelchair-accessible buses. Districts also relied on the aid for programs and services for homeless students, as well as tutoring for students who fell behind because of missed classroom time.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s latest attack on our schools will hurt our most vulnerable students and make it harder for them to thrive,\u201d James said. \u201cCutting school systems\u2019 access to vital resources that our students and teachers rely on is outrageous and illegal.\u201d",

      "Outdoor enthusiasts are worried about the loss of their favorite vistas as President Donald Trump's administration considers weakening a 26-year-old rule designed to improve visibility over national parks and wilderness areas",
      "During a hike in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1995, Don Barger climbed Chilhowee Mountain hoping to gaze across the valley below. All he saw was a wall of gray haze.",
      "Today, he said, he can see some 50 miles (80 kilometers) across that same valley to the Cumberland Mountains.",
      "A 26-year-old federal regulation known as the regional haze rule has helped cut down on pollution over national parks, wilderness areas and tribal reservations, restoring some of the nation's most spectacular natural vistas for outdoor lovers like Barger. But conservationists fear those gains may be lost after President Donald Trump's administration announced in March the rule is among dozens of landmark environmental regulations that it plans to roll back.",
      "\u201cIt means a promise that was made to the American public is lost,\u201d Barger, 74, said. \u201cMore and more generations of people are going to grow up as ignorant as I was, not realizing what I'm missing and not seeing.\u201d",
      "Haze forms when small particles of air pollution, such as sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides, scatter and absorb sunlight, blurring views and decreasing visibility.",
      "Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1977 to make restoring and maintaining visibility a goal for 156 national parks, wilderness areas, wildlife refuges and tribal reservations across 36 states. That includes places like the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee; Grand Canyon National Park; Glacier National Park; and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.",
      "After years of drafting and litigation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted regulations known as the regional haze rule in 1999 to implement the amendments.",
      "The rule calls for attaining natural visibility conditions by the year 2064 and mandates that states come up with plans that include limitations on emissions, compliance schedules and monitoring strategies. Older facilities that emit pollution, such as coal-fired power plants, must adopt mitigation technology such as scrubbers or shut down periodically to decrease overall annual emissions.",
      "The states' plans have been plagued with delays as the EPA approves parts of them and rejects others. For example, two big oil- and coal-producing states, North Dakota and Wyoming, and industry groups filed petitions in federal court in January seeking review of EPA decisions rejecting their plans, according to the Harvard Law School's Environmental and Energy Law Program.",
      "The rule works in conjunction with other federal antipollution regulations, but it's been crucial in clearing the skies over national parks and wilderness areas.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of data from a nationwide network of monitoring sites from 1999, when the rule was implemented, through 2023 shows 93% of the parks and wilderness areas have seen improved air quality on clear days. No parks or wilderness areas have seen any notable worsening in visibility.",
      "Visibility in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was twice as good on a typical clear day in 2023 as it was in 1999, marking the biggest improvement among the national parks.",
      "The EPA estimates that between 2007 and 2018 the rule has cut 500,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and 300,000 tons of nitrous oxides annually. The average visual range has increased from 90 miles to 120 miles (144 kilometers to 193 kilometers) in some western parks and from 50 to 70 miles (80 kilometers to 112 kilometers) in some eastern parks, according to the Harvard program.",
      "Trump's EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced March 12 that the agency would look to roll back 31 landmark environmental regulations, including the regional haze rule. Zeldin called the announcement the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in American history\u201d and said in an essay published in the Wall Street Journal that the administration is \u201cdriving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment on the regional haze rule, the EPA said they want to better account for pollution from outside the U.S. and from natural sources and avoid unnecessary burdens for states and industry.",
      "In a cost-benefit analysis of the rule before it took effect, the EPA found it would cost energy producers up to $98 billion by 2025 while providing about $344 billion in benefits such as health care savings.",
      "Producers argue that the haze rule has done its job and it doesn't make sense to continue to impose costs on them.",
      "\u201cThis is a matter of diminishing returns,\u201d said Jonathan Fortner, interim president and CEO of the Lignite Energy Council, which advocates for North Dakota's coal industry. \u201cThe air is clean, the data proves it, and the science backs that up. The rule's being misapplied, not because we disagree with clean air goals, but because we're already there.\u201d",
      "Two federal properties in North Dakota are subject to the rule, the Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge and Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The AP analysis found both sites have seen dramatic visibility improvements over the five years from 2019 to 2023.",
      "EPA officials did not respond to an AP request for a list of power plants that have closed due to the regional haze rule. A number of energy industry groups did not return repeated requests for comment, including the U.S. Energy Association and the National Utility Contractors Association.",
      "Advocates of the rule say eliminating it could lead to reduced tourism and the economic boom visitors bring to national park regions. The National Park Service estimates 325 million people visited national parks in 2023, spending $26.4 billion in gateway communities.",
      "Nothing appears likely to change overnight. Conservationists expect the Trump administration to pursue a rollback through language revisions in the rule, a process that would require a public comment period and would likely trigger court challenges that could last years.",
      "\u201cI've watched the Great Smoky Mountains National Park emerge from the chemical haze that once enshrouded it and was getting worse,\u201d Barger said. \u201cIt's just this visceral sense of place.

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is reversing course on its requirement for all staffers to report to the office",
      "WASHINGTON -- Weeks after ordering all Food and Drug Administration employees back into the office, the agency is reversing course, allowing some of its most prized staffers to work remotely amid worries that recent layoffs and resignations could jeopardize basic functions, like approving new medicines.",
      "An internal email obtained by The Associated Press states that FDA leadership are \u201callowing review staff and supervisors to resume telework\u201d at least two days a week. The policy shift was confirmed by three FDA staffers who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency matters.",
      "The message was sent Tuesday to some of the FDA\u2019s hundreds of drug reviewers. Staffers said a similar policy was communicated to reviewers who handle vaccines, biotech drugs, medical devices and tobacco products\u2014 although not always in writing.",
      "It\u2019s the latest example of the Trump administration\u2019s chaotic approach to overhauling the federal health workforce, which has included firings, a scramble to rehire some employees, and then additional layoffs last week of an estimated 3,400 staffers, or more than 15% of the agency\u2019s workforce. When FDA employees were called back to the agency's Maryland headquarters last month they confronted overflowing parking lots, crowded offices and broken or missing supplies.",
      "A spokeswoman for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the administration is returning to \u201cpre-COVID telework arrangements for reviewers, whose read and write work output is tracked in 15-minute increments to ensure productivity and accountability.\u201d",
      "While many agencies switched to telework during the pandemic, the FDA began embracing the practice nearly two decades earlier. The flexibility was seen as a competitive perk for recruiting employees who can often earn more working in industry.",
      "Last week's cuts included entire offices focusing on FDA policy and regulations, most of the agency\u2019s communication staff and teams that support food inspectors and investigators. Senior officials overseeing tobacco, new drugs, vaccines and other products have also been dismissed or forced to resign. Staffers have described rank-and-file employees \u201cpouring\u201d out of the agency.",
      "Former FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler called the cuts \"devastating, haphazard, thoughtless and chaotic\" during a House hearing on Wednesday.",
      "When Kennedy announced plans to eliminate 10,000 staffers across the federal health workforce, he noted that FDA medical reviewers and safety inspectors wouldn't be impacted.",
      "In February, HHS was forced to recall some probationary employees who were fired, including hundreds of medical reviewers at FDA, whose salaries are largely funded by industry fees, not federal dollars.",
      "But last week\u2019s cuts combined with resignations and retirements have raised a new threat: that FDA funding could fall so low that it short circuits a long-standing system in which companies help fund much of the agency's operations.",
      "Nearly half the FDA's nearly $7 billion budget comes from fees collected from drug, device and tobacco companies. The agency uses the money to hire thousands of extra staffers to quickly and efficiently review new products. For example, about 70% of the FDA\u2019s drug program is financed by user-fee agreements, which must be reauthorized by Congress every five years.",
      "But the agreements stipulate that if FDA\u2019s federal funding falls below set levels, companies are no longer required to pay fees and, in some cases, can claw back their money. The threshold requirements are designed to ensure Congress continues funding FDA, rather than relying entirely on the private sector.",
      "FDA and industry groups are supposed to begin negotiations later this year to renew several user-fee agreements, including those for drugs and devices.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the agency nor regulated industry can afford for \u2018user fees\u2019 not to be reauthorized,\u201d said Michael Gaba, an attorney who advises FDA-regulated companies.",
      "Whatever the reasoning behind the telework shift, former government officials say it\u2019s a sign that recently confirmed FDA Commissioner Marty Makary is trying to retain and rebuild staffing and resources. Makary made his first appearance at FDA's headquarters last Wednesday, one day after the mass layoffs. According to the memo obtained by the AP, Makary signed off on the return to telework.",
      "\u201cDr. Makary needs to rebuild teams and restart the engine of productivity lost to weeks of job insecurity, uncertainty and shortages of team members,\u201d said Steven Grossman, a former HHS official. \u201cTurning commuting time back into work time is a great first step in achieving both.\u201d",

      "The Muslim minority group was seen as a privileged minority under the rule of the Alawite Assad family, but since Bashar Assad \u2019s government fell late last year members have feared revenge from the country\u2019s Sunni majority.",
      "The new government promised to protect minority groups, but when a group of Assad loyalists attacked security forces near the coastal city of Latakia last month, it sparked a counteroffensive that took a brutal toll on the coastal region\u2019s largely Alawite population.",
      "Britain-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates that more than 1,700 people, most of them civilians, were killed in March. While no official figures have been released by the government, other human rights groups have given similar estimates. It was the worst violence since an insurgency led by Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham overthrew Assad last December.",
      "Rights groups reported widespread revenge killings as militants from Syria's Sunni majority targeted Alawites, regardless of whether they were involved in the insurgency.",
      "\u201cSeveral people told me that when these militia members entered their home, in addition to asking if they were Alawite or Sunni, they blamed them for what happened to them under the former Assad government,\u201d said Diana Semaan, Amnesty International\u2019s Syria researcher who investigated dozens of killings that took place in Baniyas and spoke to eyewitnesses and survivors.",
      "While there has not been another outbreak of violence on the same scale, Alawites continue to report incidents of harassment, shakedowns and sometimes worse.",
      "An Alawite who lives in the Latakia area said there are still regular attacks targeting Alawites, most of whom had nothing to do with the Assad government or security forces.",

      "\u201cHe would pass the checkpoints on his motorcycle every day. He and the guards would even greet each other,\" he said.",

      "Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Observatory, said 42 people have died in sectarian killings since the Muslim feast of Eid el-Fitr that marks the end of Ramadan on March 30.",
      "\u201cThe killings, did not stop but now they are individual acts,\u201d Abdurrahman said.",
      "Mohammed Saleh, an activist from the central city of Homs who spent 17 years imprisoned during the rule of Bashar Assad and his father because of his opposition to the government, said victims of the attacks included Alawites who opposed Assad\u2019s rule. Saleh said 18 people he knew personally who had previously been detained by Assad\u2019s forces were killed in last month\u2019s attacks.",
      "Saleh said he is worried that Syria is turning from one dictatorship to another.",
      "\u201cWhat we want is to have serious national army and security agencies whose job is to protect everyone and that they include everyone and not be made up of one sect or one religion,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cThere cannot be a state for everyone when security agencies belong to one sect.\u201d",
      "One high school in the city of Baniyas in Tartus province, posted a list on Facebook of almost 80 teachers, students and relatives and alumni who were killed in attacks over the past month.",
      "A video widely shared on social media showed the bodies of two young men with their mother standing by them, as the person filming scolded her and said her sons deserved to die because they were Alawite.",
      "Alawites and other Syrians from coastal areas are fleeing into Lebanon through unofficial border crossings, some carrying babies and helping tired elderly people and pregnant women as they cross over a river dividing the two countries.",
      "Some 30,000 Alawite Syrians have fled to Lebanon over the past month, the United Nation\u2019s refugee agency says, scattered in some 30 towns and villages in northern Lebanon. While there is little assistance for them in Lebanon, many don\u2019t feel safe enough to go back.",
      "Ongoing attacks have been a major letdown for Syrians who hoped that Assad's sudden fall would spell an end to violence against the country's many religious and ethnic groups after over a decade a war that killed hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "The new government has promised to create an inclusive state that holds perpetrators of crimes to account, and interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has vowed to hold the perpetrators of recent attacks to justice and set up a committee to investigate the attacks.",

      "Swedish slow TV hit \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d has become a phenomenon",
      "Before Swedish slow TV hit \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d began airing Tuesday, Ulla Malmgren stocked up on coffee and prepared meals. She doesn't want to miss a moment of the 20-day, 24-hour event.",
      "\u201cSleep? Forget it. I don\u2019t sleep,\u201d she said.",
      "Malmgren, 62, isn't alone. The show, called \u201c Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen \u201d in Swedish and sometimes translated as \u201cThe Great Elk Trek\u201d in English, began in 2019 with nearly a million people watching. In 2024, the production hit 9 million viewers on SVT Play, the streaming platform for national broadcaster SVT.",
      "The livestream kicked off a week ahead of schedule due to warm weather and early moose movement. Malmgren was ready.",
      "From now until May 4, the livestream's remote cameras will capture dozens of moose as they swim across the \u00c5ngerman River, some 300 kilometers (187 miles) northwest of Stockholm, in the annual spring migration toward summer grazing pastures.",
      "Not much happens for hours at a time, and fans say that's the beauty of it.",
      "\u201cI feel relaxed, but at the same time I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a moose, oh! What if there\u2019s a moose? I can\u2019t go to the toilet!\u2019\u201d said William Garp Liljefors, 20, who has collected more than 150 moose plush toys since 2020.",
      "\u201cThe Great Moose Migration\" is part of a trend that began in 2009 with Norwegian public broadcaster NRK's minute-by-minute airing of a seven-hour train trip across the southern part of the country.",
      "The slow TV style of programming has spread, with productions in the United Kingdom, China and elsewhere. The central Dutch city of Utrecht, for example, installed a \u201c fish doorbell \u201d on a river lock that lets livestream viewers alert authorities to fish being held up as they migrate to spawning grounds.",
      "Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University in Sweden, said slow TV has roots in reality television but lacks the staging and therefore feels more authentic for viewers. The productions allow the audience to relax and watch the journey unfold.",
      "\u201cIt became, in a strange way, gripping because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,\" she said. \"But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.\u201d",
      "As an expert and a fan of \u201cThe Great Moose Migration,\u201d Hill said the livestream helps her slow down her day by following the natural rhythms of spring.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely a moment to have a calm, atmospheric setting in my own home, and I really appreciate it,\u201d she said.",
      "The calming effect extends to the crew, according to Johan Erhag, SVT's project manager for \u201cThe Great Moose Migration.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone who works with it goes down in their normal stress,\u201d he said.",
      "The moose have walked the route for thousands of years, making it easy for the crew to know where to lay some 20,000 meters (almost 12 miles) of cable and position 26 remote cameras and seven night cameras. A drone is also used.",
      "The crew of up to 15 people works out of SVT\u2019s control room in Ume\u00e5, producing the show at a distance to avoid interfering with the migration.",
      "SVT won't say how much the production costs, but Erhag said it's cheap when accounting for the 506 hours of footage aired last year.",
      "Erhag said Swedes have always been fascinated by the roughly 300,000 moose roaming in their woods. The Scandinavian country's largest animal is known as \u201cKing of the Forest.\u201d A bull moose can reach 210 centimeters (6 feet 10 inches) at shoulder height and weigh 450 kilograms (992 pounds).",
      "Despite their size, the herbivores are typically shy and solitary.",
      "\u201cWe actually don\u2019t see it very often. You often see it when you\u2019re out driving maybe once or twice in your life,\u201d Erhag said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one thing why it has been so, so popular. And then you bring in the nature to everyone\u2019s living room.\"",
      "Hanna Sandberg, 36, first began watching the show in 2019, though she didn't spot any moose. She tuned in the following year, finally saw some and got hooked.",
      "\u201cYou can watch them and be a part of their natural habitat in a way that you could never be otherwise,\u201d she said.",
      "After hours of showing an empty forest, a camera captures footage of a moose approaching the riverbank. Suddenly, slow TV turns urgent.",
      "The push alert hits SVT's app \u2014 \u201cF\u00f6rsta \u00e4lgarna i bild!\u201d which translates to \u201cFirst moose on camera!\u201d \u2014 as viewers worldwide tune in. The livestream's chat explodes as commenters type encouragement for the animal, now making its way into the water.",
      "\u201dI would actually like to be a little fly on the wall in every household that watches the moose migration. Because I think there is about a million people saying about the same thing: \u2018Go on! Yes, you can do it!\u2019\" Malmgren said.",
      "Mega-fans like Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, are committed to watching as many hours as possible.",

      "Sudan's civil war marks the end of its second year on Tuesday, and the fighting, atrocities and famine are only mounting",
      "CAIRO -- As Sudan marks two years of civil war on Tuesday, atrocities and famine are only mounting in what the U.N. says is the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.",
      "Last month, the Sudanese military secured a major victory by recapturing the capital of Khartoum from its rival, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. But that has only moved the war into a new phase that could end up with a de facto partition of the country.",
      "On Friday and Saturday, RSF fighters and their allies rampaged in two refugee camps in the western Darfur region, killing at least 300 people. The Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps, which shelter some 700,000 Sudanese who fled their homes, have both been stricken with famine, and aid workers cannot reach them because of the fighting.",
      "Half the population of 50 million faces hunger. The World Food Program has confirmed famine in 10 locations and says it could spread, putting millions in danger of starvation.",
      "\u201cThis abominable conflict has continued for two years too long,\u201d said Kashif Shafique, country director for Relief International Sudan, the last aid group still working in the Zamzam camp. Nine of its workers were killed in the RSF attack.",
      "He said the world needs to press for a ceasefire. \u201cEvery moment we wait, more lives hang in the balance,\u201d he said. \u201cHumanity must prevail.\u201d",
      "Here is what is happening as the war enters its third year:",
      "The war erupted on April 15, 2023, with pitched battles between the military and the RSF in the streets of Khartoum that quickly spread to other parts of the country.",
      "It was the culmination of months of tension between the head of the military, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, and the RSF\u2019s commander, Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo. The two were once allies in suppressing Sudan\u2019s movement for democracy and civilian rule but turned on each other in a struggle for power.",
      "The fighting has been brutal. Large parts of Khartoum have been wrecked. Nearly 13 million people have fled their homes, 4 million of them streaming into neighboring countries. At least 20,000 people have been recorded killed, but the true toll is probably far higher.",
      "Both sides have been accused of atrocities, and the RSF fighters have been notorious for attacking villages in Darfur, carrying out mass killings of civilians and rapes of women.",
      "The military\u2019s recapture of Khartoum in late March was a major symbolic victory. It allowed Burhan to return to the capital for the first time since the war started and declare a new government, boosting his standing.",
      "But experts say the RSF consolidated its hold on the areas it still controls \u2014 a vast stretch of western and southern Sudan, including the Darfur and Kordofan regions. The military holds much of the north, east and center.",
      "\u201cThe reality on the ground already resembles a de facto partition,\u201d said Federico Donelli, an assistant professor of international relations at Universit\u00e0 di Trieste in Italy.",
      "Donelli said it\u2019s possible the two sides could seek a ceasefire now. But more likely, he said, the military will keep trying to move on RSF-held territory.",
      "Neither side appears able to defeat the other.",
      "\u201cBoth parties are suffering from combat fatigue,\u201d said Suliman Baldo, director of the Sudan Transparency and Policy Tracker.",
      "The RSF is weakened by internal fissures and \u201clacks political legitimacy within the country,\u201d said Sharath Srinivasan, professor of international politics at Cambridge University.",
      "But it has strong access to weapons and resources, bolstered by support from the United Arab Emirates, Chad, Uganda, Kenya, South Sudan and Ethiopia, he said.",
      "\u201cWithout understanding the complex regional geopolitics of this war, it is easy to underplay the RSF\u2019s resilience and ability to strike back,\u201d said Srinivasan, author of \u201dWhen Peace Kills Politics: International Intervention and Unending Wars in the Sudans.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people trapped by the fighting face hunger and starvation. So far, the epicenter of famine has been in the North Darfur province and particularly the Zamzam camp. The RSF has been besieging the camp as it wages an offensive on El Fasher, the regional capital and the last main position of the military in the Darfur region.",
      "Amna Suliman, a mother of four living in the camp, said people have resorted to eating grass and tree leaves.",
      "\u201cWe have no choice,\u201d she said in a recent phone interview. \u201cWe live in fear, with no communication, no food, and no hope.\u201d",
      "Since famine was first declared in Zamzam in August, it has spread to other parts of the province and nearby South Kordofan province.",
      "The WFP warned this week that 17 other locations will also soon fall into famine \u2014 including other parts of the Darfur region but also places in central and south Sudan \u2014 because aid workers cannot reach them.",
      "\u201cThe situation is very dire,\u201d said Adam Yao, deputy representative of the U.N. Food and Agricultural Agency in Sudan.",
      "Already, at least 25 million people, more than half of the country\u2019s population, face acute hunger, including 638,000 who face catastrophic hunger, the most dire rating used by aid agencies, according to the WFP. Some 3.6 million children are acutely malnourished.",
      "In other areas, the military\u2019s capture of territory allowed aid groups to reach refugees and displaced people who have been largely cut off from aid for two years.",
      "Sudan has been hit by multiple outbreaks of cholera, malaria and dengue in the past two years. The latest cholera outbreak in March killed about 100 people and sickened over 2,700 others in the White Nile province, according to the Health Ministry.",
      "The economy has been decimated, with a 40% drop in GDP, according to the United Nations\u2019 Development Program, UNDP. Full-time employment has been halved and almost 20% of urban households reported that they have no income at all, it said.",
      "At the same time, U.N. agencies and aid groups have faced funding cuts from major donors, including the United States. Only 6.3% of the $4.2 billion required for humanitarian assistance in Sudan this year has been received as of March, said Clementine Nkweta-Salami, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Sudan.",
      "\u201cThe reductions come at a time when the needs in Sudan have never been greater, with more than half of the population hungry and famine spreading,\u201d she said.",
      "About 400,000 people managed to return to their hometowns in areas retaken by the military around Khartoum and nearby Gezira province, according to the U.N. migration agency.",
      "Many found their homes destroyed and looted. They depend largely on local charities for food.",
      "Abdel-Raham Tajel-Ser, a father of three children, returned in February to his neighborhood in Khartoum\u2019s sister city of Omdurman after 22 months of displacement.",
      "The 46-year-old civil servant said he found his house, which had been occupied by the RSF, severely damaged and looted.",
      "\u201cIt was a dream,\u201d he said of his return, adding that his life in the largely destroyed neighborhood with almost no electricity or communications is \u201cmuch better than living as a refugee or a displaced person.\u201d",

      "The one-day conference, hosted by Britain, France, Germany, the European Union and the African Union, has modest ambitions. It is not an attempt to negotiate peace, but an effort to relieve what the United Nations calls the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.",
      "Attendees include officials from Western nations, international institutions and neighboring countries \u2013 but no one from Sudan. Neither the Sudanese government nor the rival paramilitary it is fighting has been invited.",
      "\u201cThe brutal war in Sudan has devastated the lives of millions \u2013 and yet much of the world continues to look away,\u201d said British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who visited Chad\u2019s border with Sudan in January. \u201cWe need to act now to stop the crisis from becoming an all-out catastrophe, ensuring aid gets to those who need it the most.\u201d",
      "Sudan plunged into war on April 15, 2023, after simmering tensions between the Sudanese military and a paramilitary organization known as the Rapid Support Forces. Fighting broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread across the country, killing at least 20,000 people \u2013 though the number is likely far higher.",
      "Over 300 civilians were killed in a burst of intense fighting in the western region of Darfur on Friday and Saturday, according to the U.N.",
      "Last month the Sudanese military regained control over Khartoum, a major symbolic victory in the war. But the RSF still controls most of Darfur and some other areas.",
      "The war has driven parts of the country into famine and pushed more than 14 million people from their homes, with more than 3 million fleeing the country, to neighboring countries including Chad and Egypt. Both sides in the war have been accused of committing war crimes.",
      "The World Food Program says nearly 25 million people \u2014 half of Sudan\u2019s population \u2014 face extreme hunger.",
      "Aid agency Oxfam said the humanitarian catastrophe risks becoming a regional crisis, with fighting spilling into neighboring countries. It said that in South Sudan, itself wracked by recent war, \u201cthe arrival of people fleeing Sudan\u2019s conflict has put more pressure on already scarce resources, which is deepening local tensions and threatening the fragile peace.\u201d",
      "The U.S., which recently cut almost all its foreign aid, is expected to be represented at the London conference.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, Lammy announced 120 million pounds ($158 million) in funding for the coming year to deliver food for 650,000 people in Sudan, from Britain\u2019s increasingly limited foreign aid budget.",
      "In February the U.K. cut its aid budget from 0.5% of Gross Domestic Product to 0.3% to fund an increase in military spending. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said Sudan, along with Ukraine and Gaza, will remain a priority for British aid.",

      "ACCRA, Ghana -- A newly created regulatory body for gold exports from Ghana announced Monday that foreigners would no longer be allowed to buy or trade artisanaly mined gold in the country, Africa\u2019s biggest gold producer.",
      "Starting May 1, gold must be bought with licenses from the new Ghana Gold Board, also known as GoldBod, according to a statement from the new body. Licenses previously issued by the Precious Minerals Marketing Co., which used to market minerals produced in the country, will no longer be valid.",
      "The statement said beginning next month no entity can purchase or deal in gold in the country apart from GoldBod, which was created to oversee gold trading and maximize revenue from its export.",
      "Under the law, GoldBod becomes the sole buyer, seller, assayer and exporter of all gold produced by licensed small-scale miners in Ghana, and those who do so without a license from the board will be charged criminally.",
      "Traditionally, local and foreign companies with export licenses had been able to buy and export gold from small-scale Ghanaian miners.",
      "On March 29, Parliament passed the Ghana Gold Board bill, which was signed into law by President John Dramani Mahama on April 2.",
      "Prince Kwame Minkah, spokesman for GoldBod, told The Associated Press that \"the trading activities of GoldBod is expected to culminate into building the needed reserves to enhance our forex and by extension deal with gold smuggling.\u201d",
      "The chronic challenge of illegal gold mining \u2014 known locally as \u201cgalamsey\u201d \u2014 was a major issue during Ghana\u2019s presidential election campaign last year and a source of concern for voters, triggering protests and criticism against the outgoing government.",
      "Ghana is the world\u2019s sixth largest gold producer, but the commodity has been increasingly mined illegally as people become more desperate to find jobs in a crumbling economy. The mining has polluted rivers and other parts of the environment, despite government actions to clamp down on the practice.",
      "Speaking before Parliament passed the bill, Minister of Finance Dr. Cassiel Ato Forson, said: \u201cThe GoldBod will ensure that Ghana harnesses the entire gold value chain \u2014 from extraction to refining, value addition, and marketing \u2014 both locally and internationally.\u201d",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Haiti\u2019s government announced Monday that it approved what it called a \u201cwar budget\u201d of $275,000 aimed at alleviating the country\u2019s crisis as gang violence surges.",
      "Nearly 40% of the money will go toward Haiti\u2019s police and military \u201cto fight the armed groups that threaten national stability,\u201d while nearly 20% will go to fortify the border the country shares with the Dominican Republic, Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council said in a statement.",
      "Another 16% will go to social programs, including those focused on education, health and humanitarian assistance. The council said the special budget reflects the state\u2019s commitment to act decisively and target the growing insecurity.",
      "The additional money, however, is not expected to alleviate the lack of resources hitting a U.N.-backed mission, led by Kenyan police, which is struggling to help local authorities quell gang violence.",
      "Gangs that control at least 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince, continue to attack communities surrounding it.",

Police officers at the Mirebalais police station and local prison fled during the attacks, it said.",

      "Staff and patients at the Mirebalais University Hospital also were evacuated.",
      "At least 60 people died following the attacks launched on March 30 and 31, including gang members and escaped inmates, according to the human rights group.",
      "Meanwhile, the neighboring town of Saut-d\u2019Eau fell to gangs on the afternoon of April 3, activists said.",
      "\u201cSome say this was facilitated by the redeployment of law enforcement to Mirebalais, leaving Saut-d\u2019Eau vulnerable,\u201d the group said last week.",
      "Two nuns and one police officer were among those killed during the attacks, while two journalists remain missing.",
      "\u201cBy ignoring the (central region's) collapse the transitional authorities show they have no real plan to restore citizens\u2019 rights and public safety,\u201d the human rights group said. \u201cThe absence of state response has turned the police into firefighters \u2014 constantly reacting without strategic direction \u2014 while towns fall one after another.\u201d",
      "The group noted that civilians and self-defense groups in both towns \u201chad repeatedly raised alarms that were ignored.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, more than 260 people were killed in another gang attack on two communities in Haiti\u2019s capital in late January, according to the U.N. political mission in Haiti that questioned the delay in response by authorities.",
      "The attacks occurred in Kenscoff and parts of Carrefour. Another community in Kenscoff was attacked over the weekend, with at least one police officer missing and several others injured, according to SPNH-17, a police union.",
      "Overall, from Jan. 1 to March 27, more than 1,500 people have been reported killed across Haiti, and 572 others injured, the U.N. mission said. Gang violence has also left more than 1 million people homeless in recent years, according to the U.N.",

      "President Bola Tinubu also said he has ordered an investigation over the late Sunday night attack on the Zike community, extending his condolences to the victims and their families.",

That conflict, now Africa\u2019s longest struggle with militancy, has also spilled into Nigeria\u2019s northern neighbors.",

      "Hungary\u2019s parliament has passed an amendment to the constitution that allows the government to ban public events by LGBTQ+ communities",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Hungary\u2019s parliament on Monday passed an amendment to the constitution that allows the government to ban public events by LGBTQ+ communities, a decision that legal scholars and critics call another step toward authoritarianism by the populist government.",
      "The amendment, which required a two-thirds vote, passed along party lines with 140 votes for and 21 against. It was proposed by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition led by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.",
      "Ahead of the vote \u2014 the final step for the amendment \u2014 opposition politicians and other protesters attempted to blockade the entrance to a parliament parking garage. Police physically removed demonstrators, who had used zip ties to bind themselves together.",
      "The amendment declares that children\u2019s rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any right other than the right to life, including that to peacefully assemble. Hungary's contentious \u201cchild protection\u201d legislation prohibits the \u201cdepiction or promotion\u201d of homosexuality to minors aged under 18.",
      "The amendment codifies a law fast-tracked through parliament in March that bans public events held by LGBTQ+ communities, including the popular Pride event in Budapest that draws thousands annually.",
      "That law also allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify people who attend prohibited events \u2014 such as Budapest Pride \u2014 and can come with fines of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546).",
      "D\u00e1vid Bed\u0151, a lawmaker with the opposition Momentum party who participated in the attempted blockade, said before the vote that Orb\u00e1n and Fidesz for the past 15 years \u201chave been dismantling democracy and the rule of law, and in the past two or three months, we see that this process has been sped up.\u201d",
      "He said as elections approach in 2026 and Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party lags in the polls behind a popular new challenger from the opposition, \u201cthey will do everything in their power to stay in power.\u201d",
      "Opposition lawmakers used air horns to disrupt the vote, which continued after a few moments.",
      "Hungary\u2019s government has campaigned against LGBTQ+ communities in recent years, and argues its \u201cchild protection\u201d policies, which forbid the availability to minors of any material that mentions homosexuality, are needed to protect children from what it calls \u201cwoke ideology\" and \u201cgender madness.\u201d",
      "Critics say the measures do little to protect children and are being used to distract from more serious problems facing the country and mobilize Orb\u00e1n\u2019s right-wing base ahead of elections.",
      "\u201cThis whole endeavor which we see launched by the government, it has nothing to do with children\u2019s rights,\u201d said D\u00e1nel D\u00f6brentey, a lawyer with the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, calling it \"pure propaganda.\u201d",
      "The new amendment also states that the constitution recognizes two sexes, male and female, an expansion of an earlier amendment that prohibits same-sex adoption by stating that a mother is a woman and a father is a man.",
      "The declaration provides a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of transgender people, as well as ignoring the existence of intersex individuals who are born with sexual characteristics that do not align with binary conceptions of male and female.",
      "In a statement on Monday, government spokesperson Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs wrote that the change is \u201cnot an attack on individual self-expression, but a clarification that legal norms are based on biological reality.\u201d",
      "D\u00f6brentey, the lawyer, said it was \u201ca clear message\u201d for transgender and intersex people: \u201cIt is definitely and purely and strictly about humiliating people and excluding them, not just from the national community, but even from the community of human beings.\"",
      "The amendment is the 15th to Hungary\u2019s constitution since Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party unilaterally authored and approved it in 2011.",
      "\u00c1d\u00e1m Remport, a lawyer with the HCLU, said that while Hungary has used facial recognition tools since 2015 to assist police in criminal investigations and finding missing persons, the recent law banning Pride allows the technology to be used in a much broader and problematic manner. That includes for monitoring and deterring political protests.",
      "\u201cOne of the most fundamental problems is its invasiveness, just the sheer scale of the intrusion that happens when you apply mass surveillance to a crowd,\u201d Remport said.",
      "\u201cMore salient in this case is the effect on the freedom of assembly, specifically the chilling effect that arises when people are scared to go out and show their political or ideological beliefs for fear of being persecuted,\u201d he added.",
      "The amendment passed Monday also allows for Hungarians who hold dual citizenship in a non-European Economic Area country to have their citizenship suspended for up to 10 years if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security.",
      "Hungary has taken steps in recent months to protect its national sovereignty from what it claims are foreign efforts to influence its politics or even topple Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government.",
      "The self-described \u201cilliberal\u201d leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary\u2019s sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors.",
      "In a speech laden with conspiracy theories in March, Orb\u00e1n compared people who work for such groups to insects, and pledged to \u201celiminate the entire shadow army\u201d of foreign-funded \u201cpoliticians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists.\u201d",

      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed a former deputy finance minister as a special envoy to the United States after the ambassador was expelled last month",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- South African President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed a former deputy finance minister as a special envoy to the United States on Monday after the ambassador was expelled last month by the Trump administration.",
      "Ramaphosa said Mcebisi Jonas' appointment would help South Africa rebuild its relationship with the U.S., which has deteriorated swiftly since President Donald Trump took office.",
      "Trump has accused the Black-led South African government of mistreating a white minority at home and also criticized its foreign policy as anti-American. He signed an executive order in February cutting U.S. funding to South Africa over those issues.",
      "Trump continued his criticism in a Truth Social post this weekend, when he said the U.S. did not want to attend the Group of 20 summit this year if it were held in South Africa, as scheduled. South Africa holds the rotational presidency of the G20 group of developed and developing nations and is due to host world leaders and top diplomats for a summit in Johannesburg in November.",
      "\u201cIs this where we want to be for the G20? I don\u2019t think so!\u201d Trump posted on Saturday.",
      "In his post, Trump repeated his claim that South Africa was allowing land to be seized from white farmers \u201cand then killing them and their families.\u201d",
      "The South African government has denied white farmers are having their land seized or are victims of race-based killings, as Trump and his South African-born adviser Elon Musk have claimed. South Africa says those claims are based on misinformation.",
      "South Africa has passed a contentious new land expropriation law that allows land to be taken by the government without compensation if it's in the public interest. That has been criticized by some white minority groups as targeting their land, though no land has yet been taken under the law.",
      "Trump's executive order also criticized South Africa for lodging a case at the International Court of Justice accusing U.S. ally Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The Trump administration said South Africa is pursuing anti-American foreign policies and supporting the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Iran.",
      "South Africa's ambassador to the U.S. was expelled in March over a talk he gave on a webinar organized by a think tank. In the talk, which he defended as an explanation of the new political dynamics in the U.S., Ebrahim Rasool said Trump was launching \u201can assault on incumbency \u2014 those who are in power\u201d and said the Make America Great Again movement was partly a result of a \u201csupremacist instinct.\u201d",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Rasool was a \u201crace-baiting politician\u201d who hates Trump, declared him persona non grata and ordered him to leave the U.S. Rasool returned to South Africa to a hero's welcome from supporters.",
      "South Africa hasn't appointed a new ambassador.",

      "LONDON -- China has warned the U.K. government to treat the Chinese owners of British Steel fairly or risk undermining investor confidence in the country, two days after British authorities took control of the company.",
      "China\u2019s Foreign Ministry made the comment on Monday as government-appointed managers raced to prevent British Steel from shutting down the last two blast furnaces in Britain that make so-called virgin steel from raw materials.",
      "Parliament on Saturday passed legislation authorizing the government to take control of the company and its Scunthorpe steelworks from Jingye Group, which has owned British Steel since 2020. Jingye still owns the company but British authorities have taken control of day-to-day operations.",
      "\u201cWe hope the British government treats Chinese enterprises investing and operating in the U.K. fairly and justly, protects their legitimate rights and interests, and avoids politicizing and over-securitizing economic and trade cooperation, so as not to affect the confidence of Chinese enterprises in investing and cooperating in the U.K.,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokeperson Lin Jian said during the weekly press conference in Beijing.",
      "The U.K. government on Monday installed a new executive team at British Steel with the aim of ensuring \u201cconsistent and professional leadership\u201d of the Scunthorpe works in northeastern England, British Steel said in a statement.",
      "Two longtime British Steel executives, Allan Bell and Lisa Coulson, were named as the company\u2019s interim chief executive and chief commercial officer. The appointments were approved by Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds.",
      "Bell, who has worked at Scunthorpe for 14 years, said his main goal was to ensure continued steel production at the plant.",
      "\u201cOur immediate priorities are securing the raw materials we need to continue blast furnace operations, ensuring we have the dedicated personnel to run those furnaces, and maintaining the highest levels of health and safety for our workforce,\u201d Bell said in the statement.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday took the dramatic step of recalling Parliament from its spring recess to pass emergency legislation authorizing the government to take control of British Steel. Authorities were concerned about the plant\u2019s future after Jingye stopped ordering the iron ore and coking coal needed to keep the furnaces operating.",
      "Once blast furnaces are shut down, it is difficult and expensive to restart them, raising concerns that Britain might lose the ability to make high-quality virgin steel needed by builders and railroads as the government tries to spur economic growth. Other British steelmakers are already in the process of shifting to electric arc furnaces that make steel from scrap metal.",

      "In response, EU foreign ministers imposed asset freezes and travel bans on three judges, two prosecutors and two prison officials, including Hedayatollah Farzadi, who is in charge of the notorious Evin Prison, which was previously targeted with sanctions.",
      "The bloc claims that Farzadi is \u201cdirectly responsible for severe violations of political prisoners\u2019 human rights, in particular for restricting their communication and visitation rights and for arbitrarily ordering solitary confinement.\u201d",
      "The EU also froze the assets of Shiraz Central Prison. It said \u201cseveral hostages from European countries have been unlawfully detained in this prison, where their access to a fair trial has been denied and where they have experienced severe violations of their most basic rights.\u201d",
      "The first branch of the Revolutionary Court of Shiraz in Fars province was targeted too, with the EU noting its role in \u201cunjust trials and executions of political dissidents and persecution of individuals from minority communities.\u201d",

      "At the time, the conventional wisdom was that Sunak would call an election in the fall, but he surprised people in May when he set the date for July 4th.

      "BRUSSELS -- European officials condemned Monday Russia's deadly missile attack on Ukraine's Sumy that killed and wounded scores, accusing Moscow of committing war crimes and demonstrating disregard for Washington-led efforts to end the war.",
      "Ukrainian officials said two ballistic missiles on Sunday morning hit the heart of Sumy, a city about 30 kilometers away from Ukraine's border with Russia, as people gathered to celebrate Palm Sunday, killing at least 34 and wounding 117. It is the second large-scale attack to claim civilian lives in just over a week.",
      "Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, whose country holds the European Union\u2019s rotating presidency, said that the recent attacks are \u201cRussia\u2019s mocking answer\u201d to Kyiv\u2019s agreement to a ceasefire proposed by the U.S. administration over a month ago.",
      "\u201cI hope that President Trump, the U.S. administration, see that the leader of Russia is mocking their goodwill, and I hope the right decisions are taken,\u201d Sikorski told reporters Monday in Luxembourg, where EU foreign ministers met.",
      "Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen noted that the attack on Sumy came shortly after Trump\u2019s envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Saint Petersburg for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. It demonstrates that \u201cRussia shows full disregard for the peace process, but also that Russia has zero regard for human life.\u201d",
      "Lithuania\u2019s foreign minister Kestutis Budrys said the Russian strike used cluster munitions to target civilians in what he called \u201ca war crime by definition.\u201d",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said the attack shows that Putin has no intention of agreeing to a ceasefire. \u201cHe must therefore be forced to do so, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m calling on the European Union to take the toughest sanctions against Russia to suffocate its economy and prevent it from fueling its war effort.\"",

      "The head of the Ukrainian president\u2019s office, Andriy Yermak, said cluster munitions were used to kill as many people as possible. The Associated Press was unable to verify that claim.",
      "The attack on Sumy followed a deadly April 4 missile strike on Zelenskyy\u2019s hometown of Kryvyi Rih that killed some 20 people, including nine children.",
      "Zelenskyy called for a global response to the attack. \u201cTalks have never stopped ballistic missiles and aerial bombs. What\u2019s needed is an attitude toward Russia that a terrorist deserves,\u201d he said.",
      "Asking about the attack, Trump said late Sunday evening that he was trying to get the war stopped. \u201cI think it was terrible and I was told they made a mistake, but I think it\u2019s a horrible thing.

      "PARIS -- France's foreign minister said Monday that Algerian authorities gave 12 French state officials 48 hours to leave the country.",
      "Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot denounced the decision, saying it appeared as \"a response to the arrest of three Algerian nationals suspected of serious offenses on French soil.\u201d",
      "French counterterrorism prosecutors said the Algerians were arrested Friday and handed preliminary charges of \u201ckidnapping or arbitrary detention \u2026 in connection with a terrorist undertaking.\u201d They are allegedly involved in the April 2024 kidnapping of an Algerian influencer, Amir Boukhors, or Amir DZ, a known critic of the Algerian government with 1.1 million followers on TikTok.",

      "He said he saw a car in front of his home, with four people he said were acting like false police officers. Some wore police armbands and put him in handcuffs. They brought him to a remote place in the Paris region. \u201cThat's when I felt and confirmed that they were kidnappers. I had fallen into the trap,\u201d he said.",
      "He was told he would be meeting an Algerian official, which never happened, and was later released, the influencer said.",
      "According to French media, Boukhors lives in France since 2016 and was granted the status of political refugee in 2023.",
      "Relations between France and Algeria sharply deteriorated last summer when France shifted its position to support Morocco\u2019s autonomy plan for Western Sahara \u2014 a disputed territory claimed by the pro-independence Polisario Front, which receives support from Algiers and is based in refugee camps in southeastern Algeria.",
      "Tensions further peaked after Algeria arrested French-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal, who is an outspoken critic of Islamism and the Algerian regime, in November. He has since been sentenced to five years in prison.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Yoon Suk Yeol's legal saga is far from over.",
      "Ten days after he was ousted from office over his martial law declaration, the former conservative South Korean president appeared for the first time at his criminal trial Monday on high-stakes rebellion charges.",
      "Yoon's baffling decision to declare military rule and send troops to Seoul streets in December made him the country's first president to be indicted while in office. If convicted of rebellion, he could face a life sentence, or theoretically the death penalty.",
      "Here is what to know about the trial, which could take as long as two to three years:",
      "When the Constitutional Court upheld the parliament's impeachment of Yoon and removed him from office, it stated Yoon's violation of the constitution and other laws was too grave to be tolerated and \u201cbetrayed public confidence.\" It said Yoon's martial law enactment \u201ccaused confusion in the society, economy, politics, diplomacy and all other areas.\u201d",
      "Given the ruling, there is \u201ca low possibility\u201d for the criminal court to issue a different verdict so Yoon will likely be convicted on rebellion charges, said Park SungBae, a lawyer who specializes in criminal law.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court is currently reviewing whether Yoon's martial law imposition amounted to an act of masterminding a rebellion, a grave charge whose conviction carries only two sentences \u2014 the capital punishment or life imprisonment.",
      "Yoon has denied the rebellion charges brought by prosecutors in January. Yoon maintained his decree was a desperate yet peaceful attempt to raise public awareness about how the \u201canti-state\u201d liberal opposition was allegedly abusing its legislative majority to obstruct his agenda and complicate state affairs.",
      "\u201cThe fact that they built a rebellion charge over an event that lasted only a few hours and was resolved non-violently after the National Assembly\u2019s demand to lift the measures was immediately accepted \u2026 doesn\u2019t align with proper legal reasoning,\u201d Yoon said Monday at the court, according to Yonhap news agency.",
      "Some observers earlier said Yoon\u2019s rebellion charges were debatable as his decree didn't lead to major violence or cause any serious civilian casualties.",
      "The main issue in Yoon's criminal trial is whether his deployment of hundreds of troops to the National Assembly and election commission offices constituted an illegal attempt to shut down those institutions.",
      "While a president has no constitutional authority to shutter the legislature \u2014 even under martial law \u2014 Yoon\u2019s martial law command did declare a suspension of all political activities at the National Assembly.",
      "Yoon has defended his actions, saying he never attempted to paralyze the National Assembly and had always planned to accept the outcome if lawmakers voted to lift martial law \u2014 which they did just hours after its declaration. His claims contradict the testimonies of some military commanders, who say Yoon ordered them to drag lawmakers out of the chamber to prevent them from voting against his decree.",
      "The Seoul court will focus on \u201cdetermining whether there was an intent to undermine constitutional order, and individually assess a broad range of specific actions, including the circumstances under which the military and police forces were deployed,\u201d said Yang Hong-seok, a lawyer.",
      "Yoon's dismissal prompted a June 3 snap election to choose his successor, who will be given a full five-year term.",
      "Observes say Yoon will likely influence his People Power Party's selection of its presidential candidate, as he would want someone who can stand up for him and pardon him if he's convicted.",
      "In a public message last week, Yoon expressed gratitude to his supporters and stressed that he will \u201ccontinue to do my utmost\u201d to build the \u201cfree and prosperous Republic of Korea that we have dreamed of together.\"",
      "Yoon no longer enjoys presidential immunity from most criminal prosecutions. Experts say prosecutors could subsequently charge him with abuse of power and other crimes related to his martial law decree.",
      "Park said Yoon's trial at the Seoul district court is expected to last one-two years as there are too many witnesses to question and too many documents to examine. Yang said he expects a verdict within a year, given how crucial the case is.",
      "Appeals can send Yoon's case to a higher court and then the Supreme Court, but their verdicts won\u2019t likely take more than a year altogether, Park said.",

      "The intricate motif means the egg will ultimately be a gift from a godparent to their godchild, to bestow diligence and a good work ethic upon the youngster.",
      "The tradition of decorating Easter eggs is part of the culture of the Slavic-speaking Sorbian ethnic minority in Germany. Modern-day Sorbs are descended from Slavic tribes in Central and Eastern Europe who settled in Germany some 1,500 years ago.",
      "About 60,000 Sorbs currently live in Germany, split between the federal states of Saxony and Brandenburg.",
      "Stephanie Bierholdt, an employee at the Sorbian Cultural Center in Schleife, a town just 16 kilometers (10 miles) from the Polish border, said Easter is the biggest holiday of the year for Sorbs and people travel home to celebrate with their loved ones.",
      "\u201cThe best thing is that this tradition is still alive in families,\u201d she said.",
      "Bierholdt, Hanusch and other members of Schleife's Sorbian community gathered at the cultural center April 6, two weeks ahead of the holiday, to celebrate their heritage through the Easter eggs and traditional folk costumes, songs and dances. Sorbian egg-decorating dates back to the Middle Ages.",
      "Hanusch, wearing the red folk costume and bonnet of an unmarried woman (married women wear green), was among more than 30 artisans selling their Easter eggs at the cultural center. Her prices ranged from the cheapest decorated chicken egg for 7 euros ($7.72) up to 90 euros ($99.28) for a painted emu egg.",
      "The decorating can take between 90 minutes and six hours, depending on the techniques used, the motif and size of the egg. The artisans use a needle or the tip of a goose feather quill, cut in different ways, to draw the designs.",
      "The egg artisans said the worldwide bird flu outbreak, and subsequent egg shortage and price hikes, have not yet affected their rituals \u2014 though they added that it\u2019s always best to get eggs directly from a farmer rather than a supermarket.",
      "Hanusch, who is Sorbian on her father's side, is learning to speak the Slavic language. She said she and other Sorbian children start decorating Easter eggs as young as two, from when they can first hold a pencil. Many only do it during the Easter season throughout childhood, but Hanusch continued with the skill and became a teacher to others, including her niece.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a valuable cultural asset that needs to be preserved,\u201d she said. \"It would be a shame if it were to become extinct.\u201d",

      "Siddiq faces a number of allegations of corruption involving her family in Bangladesh, but her aunt Hasina\u2019s Bangladesh Awami League party said the charges are politically motivated to destroy the reputation of the prominent family. Hasina\u2019s father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, is Bangladesh\u2019s independence leader. The country gained independence in 1971 under his leadership after a nine-month war against Pakistan.",

Hasina accused Bangladesh's interim administration headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus of backing mobs to attack her followers across the country. The home affairs adviser says they are trying to restore order in the country.",
      "The BBC quoted Siddiq\u2019s lawyers saying the charges against Siddiq were \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d",
      "Siddiq, who was responsible for tackling corruption in financial markets, was named in December in an anti-corruption investigation in Bangladesh against Hasina. The investigation alleged that Siddiq\u2019s family was involved in brokering a 2013 deal with Russia for a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh in which large sums of money were said to have been embezzled.",
      "Siddiq quit as minister in January amid controversy. She said she had been cleared of wrongdoing but that the issue was becoming \u201ca distraction from the work of the government.\u201d",
      "Siddiq, 42, is a former local councilor who was elected lawmaker for a north London district in 2015. She was appointed to the government after Prime Minister Keir Starmer's center-left Labor Party won a landslide election victory in July last year.",

      "QUITO, Ecuador -- Daniel Noboa stunned voters in 2023 when he won a snap election for a 16-month presidency after only a brief stint as a lawmaker and with no established political machinery.",
      "No longer a political neophyte, the conservative millionaire defeated the protegee of Ecuador\u2019s most influential recent president for a second time and earned four years in office with Sunday's election victory.",
      "The new term will allow Noboa, 37 and heir to a fortune built on the banana trade, to continue some of his no-holds-barred crimefighting  strategies that part of the electorate finds appealing but which have tested the limits of laws and norms of governing.",
      "\u201cA huge hug to all the Ecuadorians who always believed in this young president,\u201d he told supporters after the National Electoral Council said results showed an \u201cirreversible trend\u201d in his favor. \u201cEcuador wants to be different... it wants to move forward.\u201d",
      "Noboa opened an event organizing company when he was 18 and then joined his father\u2019s Noboa Corp., where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial areas. He began his political career in 2021, when he won a seat in the National Assembly and chaired its Economic Development Commission.",
      "Noboa defeated leftist lawyer Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez in the October 2023 runoff of a snap election triggered by the decision of then-President Guillermo Lasso to dissolve the National Assembly and shorten his own mandate as a result. Noboa defeated her again in Sunday's runoff election.",
      "Figures released by Ecuador\u2019s National Electoral Council showed Noboa receiving 55.8% of the vote with more than 92% of ballots counted, while Gonz\u00e1lez earned 44%. However, Gonz\u00e1lez, the mentee of former President Rafael Correa, vowed to seek a recount over what she described as \u201cgrotesque\u201d electoral fraud.",
      "Under Noboa's watch, the homicide rate dropped from 46.18 per 100,000 people in 2023, to 38.76 per 100,000 people in 2024. But despite the decrease, the rate remained far higher than the 6.85 homicides per 100,000 people seen in 2019.",
      "During his brief first term, Noboa has sought to establish a friendly relationship with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Grace Jaramillo, an Andean region expert and professor at the University of British Columbia, said these efforts played a role in some voters\u2019 decisions.",
      "\u201cThe majority of Ecuadorians have migrant relatives and know well that a scenario with Gonz\u00e1lez, a leftist, would be terrible for deportations,\u201d Jaramillo said. \u201ct\u2019s an issue that touches every middle- and working-class home... Showing closeness to Trump was crucial for many families.\u201d",
      "Noboa's crime-fighting strategies have been questioned inside and outside the South American country.",
      "Ecuador has been under a state of internal armed conflict since he declared it in January 2024 in order to mobilize the military in certain places, including prisons, where organized crime has taken hold. To the shock and bewilderment of world leaders, Noboa also authorized last year\u2019s police raid on Mexico\u2019s embassy in the capital, Quito, to arrest former Vice President  Jorge Glas, a convicted criminal and fugitive who had been living there for months.",
      "Further, he entrusted presidential powers while campaigning earlier this year to a government official, unelected Vice President Ver\u00f3nica Abad, as required by the Ecuadorian Code of Democracy.",

      "Noboa and Abad began feuding before taking office. The origins of the dispute are unknown, but shortly after becoming president, Noboa dispatched Abad to serve as ambassador to Israel, effectively isolating her from his administration.

His sister and her newborn are waiting for him to pick them up from a hospital. He has had no luck finding a ride there, so he is still helping fishermen get boats out of the water and weigh what little they caught.",
      "The fishermen are all struggling, like most everyone in Venezuela, whose protracted crisis continues to evolve, entering a critical phase in recent weeks by further gutting people\u2019s purchasing power and laying the groundwork for a recession. This latest chapter in the 12-year crisis even prompted President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to declare an \u201ceconomic emergency\" last week.",
      "Tired, hungry and worried, the fishermen don't complain and keep to their tasks, or nap, under a hut with a view of an oil tanker on Lake Maracaibo. They know they are lucky to have a source of income, unreliable as it is, in 2025.",

      "Venezuelans emerged from the pandemic to fully stocked grocery stores and the U.S. dollar as the dominant currency for everyday transactions. They left behind years of bartering, lining up for hours outside supermarkets or even fighting on the streets for flour, rice, bread or other food items. They also stopped carrying bricks of worthless bolivar bills to pay for necessities.",
      "Those changes were the result of government decisions that eased price controls on basic goods and allowed consumers and businesses to use greenbacks without restrictions. They also occurred because the government used the Venezuelan Central Bank to inject millions of dollars into the foreign currency exchange market every week and prop up the bolivar.",
      "Those government measures helped end a yearslong cycle of hyperinflation, which had reached 130,000% in 2018. Gross domestic product grew 8% in 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund, after the economy shrank about 80% between 2014 and 2020.",
      "Maduro and his government began touting an economic renaissance of sorts. In the capital, Caracas, imported goods stores, restaurants, department stores and other businesses began to pop-up seemingly overnight. The use of ride-hailing and food-delivery apps proliferated. Some families in poor neighborhoods ventured into business ownership operating hot dog carts and other food stands.",
      "But the growth mostly concentrated in Caracas, and communities across the country, including Maracaibo, which prides itself in being the heart of the oil industry, did not see major gains.",
      "\u201cIf you pay more attention to those main avenues\u2026 you\u2019ll see that most of the businesses are closed,\u201d Luis Medina, 21, said pointing to an avenue in downtown Maracaibo. \u201cThere\u2019s a Subway that\u2019s closed, for example, and next to it is a Movistar (cellphone store), which is also closed. Next to it is an international restaurant, El Gaucho, originally from Argentina, which is closed, too.\"",
      "Like people in other Latin American countries \u2013 and long before their nation came undone in 2013 \u2013 Venezuelans have used the U.S. dollar as a safe haven asset and see the exchange rate as a measure of the economy\u2019s health.",
      "Maduro\u2019s government began using cash reserves in 2021 to artificially lower the exchange rate, making people at one point pay 3.50 bolivars for $1. That led to roughly 67% of retail transactions being made in foreign currency.",
      "The rate grew slowly, and by 2023, Maduro\u2019s efforts to inject dollars into the economy were aided by energy giant Chevron, which started regularly selling millions to banks to get bolivars to pay bills after the U.S. government let it to restart operations in Venezuela. The infusion of dollars allowed the government to maintain the rate around 35 bolivars to $1 through mid-2024, when the warnings of economists materialized.",
      "\u201cSo many of us said that \u2026 sooner or later, it was going to be unsustainable,\u201d economics professor Leonardo Vera said. \u201cIt was already evident in July that there were shortages of foreign currency in the official market in the face of growing demand, and those who couldn\u2019t get foreign currency began to move to the black market, a very small market where when a surge in demand arrives\u2026 the price goes up.\u201d",
      "This month, the official rate reached 70 bolivars to $1, but the black market hit 100 bolivars to $1 last month.",
      "Vera explained that factors influencing the price include Maduro\u2019s reelection claim, the results of the U.S. election and the decision of the Trump administration to revoke Chevron\u2019s permit to pump and export Venezuelan oil.",
      "The Biden administration granted Chevron\u2019s permit in late 2022 after Maduro agreed to work with Venezuela\u2019s political opposition toward a democratic election. But the election, which took place in July 2024, was neither fair nor free, and Maduro was sworn in in January for a third six-year term despite credible evidence that his opponent got more votes.",
      "Before the official and black market rates grew apart considerably, formal and informal businesses applied the government\u2019s rate for transactions. These days, however, informal businesses, such as the food markets where the majority of Venezuelans buy groceries, favor the black market\u2019s rate, making some goods unaffordable.",
      "Prices have also increased at formal businesses, including grocery and hardware stores, because companies are setting them based on the expected higher cost to replenish their inventories.",
      "Economist Pedro Palma said Venezuela's inflation rate could be between 180% and 200%. He warned that people will cut spending because salaries will not keep up with inflation and some could even lose their jobs.",
      "\u201cWe have a truly dramatic outlook: on the one hand, skyrocketing inflation; on the other, the prospect of a very significant recession,\" Palma said.",
      "Maduro last week sent a decree to the ruling-party controlled National Assembly seeking powers to enact emergency measures to \u201cdefend the national economy,\u201d including suspending tax collections and establishing \u201cmechanisms and percentages for mandatory purchases of national production to promote import substitution.\u201d",
      "He attributed the decision mostly to the impact of the U.S. tariffs on the global economy, but Venezuela\u2019s latest economic troubles predated Trump\u2019s announcement. Weeks earlier, he also announced the shortening of state employees' workweek, effectively giving them ample time to pick up second jobs to complement their approximately $1.65 monthly minimum wage and $100 monthly stipends.",
      "But companies generally are not hiring, and some businesses are now paying employees in bolivars instead of dollars, which has increased the demand for greenbacks in the black market as exchange houses limit the sums available to the public.",
      "The latest economic developments were the greatest fears of many Venezuelans ahead of last year\u2019s presidential election. So much so that a nationwide poll conducted before the election showed that roughly a fourth of people were thinking about migrating, primarily for economic reasons.",
      "Nowadays, though, people largely appear to have abandoned that idea partly because of Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Taxi driver Jonatan Urdaneta has transported migrants from the bus station in Maracaibo to the nearest border crossing with Colombia for two years. For about 18 months, he made two roundtrips a day and so did dozens of other drivers. He can now go a day without a single trip.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s looking very bleak,\u201d Urdaneta, 27, said of his income prospects, standing next to his 1984 Ford sedan. \u201cLet\u2019s hope this improves when God allows.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration has taken its next steps toward imposing more tariffs on key imports, launching investigations into imports of computer chips and products that contain them, chip making equipment and pharmaceuticals",
      "BANGKOK -- The Trump administration has taken its next steps toward imposing more tariffs on key imports, launching investigations into imports of computer chips, chip making equipment and pharmaceuticals.",
      "The Department of Commerce posted notices about the probes late Monday on the Federal Register, seeking public comment within three weeks. It had not formally announced them earlier.",
      "Although President Donald Trump paused most of his biggest tariff hikes last week for 90 days, apart from those for imports from China, he has said he still plans tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips.",
      "The Commerce Department said it is investigating how imports of computer chips, equipment to make them and products that contain them \u2014 which include many daily necessities such as cars, refrigerators, smart phones and other items \u2014 affect national security. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 permits the president to order tariffs for the sake of national security.",
      "The probe includes assessing the potential for U.S. domestic production of computer chips to meet U.S. demand and the role of foreign manufacturing and assembly, testing and packaging in meeting those needs.",
      "Among other aspects of the entire computer chip supply chain, the government intends to also study the risks of having computer chip production concentrated in other places and the impact on U.S. competitiveness from foreign government subsidies, \u201cforeign unfair trade practices and state-sponsored overcapacity.\u201d",
      "After Trump said electronics would not be included in what his administration calls \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs of up to 50% on some nations, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explained in an interview on ABC News that pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and autos will be handled with \u201csector specific\u201d tariffs.",
      "\u201cAnd those are not available for negotiation,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cThey are just going to be part of making sure we reshore the core national security items that need to be made in this country. We need to make medicine in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make semiconductors.\u201d",
      "The investigation into pharmaceutical imports includes ingredients used to make such drugs and touches on many of the same aspects of relying on imports to make them.",
      "Asked about his plans for more tariffs on pharmaceuticals, Trump said Monday, \u201cYeah, we're going to be doing that.\u201d",
      "He said it would be in the \u201cnot too distant future.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing it because we want to make our own drugs,\u201d he said.",
      "More than 70% of the materials, or active pharmaceutical ingredients, used to make medicines made in the United States are produced in other countries, with India, the European Union and China leading suppliers. The U.S. produces about a fifth of all pharmaceuticals made worldwide, but consumes about 45%, far more than any other country.",
      "The U.S. also is a major producer of semiconductors, but only in some areas. It relies heavily on imports from Taiwan and South Korea for certain kinds of advanced chips. In particular, Taiwan dominates advanced logic chip production at 92% of all fabrication capacity according to the International Trade Administration, with South Korea making 8%.",
      "Products like laptops, smartphones and the components needed to make them accounted for nearly $174 billion in U.S. imports from China last year. The administration's plans suggest that such electronics will still be taxed by previous (non-\u201creciprocal\u201d) tariffs \u2014 and potentially under additional, sector-specific levies.",
      "Although major computer chip makers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. are investing heavily in U.S. manufacturing facilities, partly due to incentives put in place during former President Joe Biden's time in office, the costly process of changing entire supply chains would take years.",
      "Separately, the Commerce Department said Monday that it was withdrawing from a 2019 agreement that had suspended an antidumping investigation into imports of fresh tomatoes from Mexico, effective in 90 days. It said the current arrangement failed to protect U.S. growers from \u201cunfairly priced\u201d imports of tomatoes. Most tomatoes from Mexico will be subject to a 20.91% tariff, it said.",

      "If your life has been upended by a wildfire, hurricane, flood, tornado, or another disaster this past year, the IRS recognizes you may need more time to file your taxes and grants you an automatic extension",
      "NEW YORK -- If your life has been upended by a wildfire, hurricane, flood, tornado, or another disaster this past year, the IRS recognizes that you may need more time to file your taxes and grants you an automatic extension beyond the normal filing deadline, which is Tuesday.",
      "You're also permitted to write off a certain amount of loss due to disaster, reducing your tax burden. That could be damaged property, lost income, or small business losses.",
      "\u201cIt can feel really daunting and overwhelming, after you\u2019ve already lost your home or your vehicle, to tackle that project (of loss write-off). It can take time and a lot of energy,\u201d said Alison Flores, manager at the Tax Institute for H&R Block. \u201cWe see people be hesitant to tackle that, and so they leave that loss on the table.\u201d",
      "In the wake of a disaster, people are also more vulnerable to scams, so be extra vigilant as you prepare your taxes, even with the extra time of an IRS extension.",
      "\u201cScammers often pose as representatives of the IRS or FEMA to exploit victims of disasters,\u201d said Misty Erickson, tax content program manager at the National Association of Tax Professionals. \u201cCommon scams include false promises of tax refunds, fake charities soliciting donations, and phishing attempts requesting personal or financial information.\u201d",
      "Here's what you should know:",
      "The IRS keeps an official list online of all disaster locations that qualify you for an extension to file.",
      "For the past year, individuals and businesses affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton qualify for tax relief, as well as disaster victims in parts of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Mexico, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Alaska.",
      "Taxpayers in these areas have until May 1 to file returns and make payments, and there's no need to do any additional paperwork to receive that extra two week grace period. Filers also have the option to request additional extensions to October 15, but interest will accrue if any money due isn't paid by May 1.",
      "Individuals and businesses in southern California affected by wildfires and straight-line winds also qualify for automatic extensions due to disaster. Taxpayers in the relevant counties have until Oct. 15 to file returns and make payments.",
      "Any interest or fees that normally accrue on late payments won't accrue during disaster extensions. Most direct disaster relief is also not counted as income, and so is not taxed.",
      "While nothing is easy in the first days and weeks following a disaster, a few choices can help when seeking insurance reimbursement and at tax time.",
      "\u201cWe recommend saving media coverage,\u201d said Flores. \u201cIf your neighborhood was on the news showing the disaster, write down what date that was or record that copy. Anything that substantiates your losses and what condition your property was in is helpful.\u201d",
      "According to the IRS, other steps include:",
      "\u2014 Taking photographs of damaged property or belongings to document and calculate the amount of your loss.",
      "\u2014 Keeping receipts for associated expenses, including contracted work on property damaged by disaster.",
      "\u2014 Keeping records of the original value of any property, including a home, car, jewelry, or big credit card purchases.",
      "Filing your insurance claims as soon as possible is also important, as you deduct any insurance reimbursement from disaster losses claimed on your tax return.",
      "\u201cWhen we look at a loss, it\u2019s often damage to your home, furnishings inside your home, vehicles, that kind of thing,\u201d Flores said. \u201cMost of the time, people will have home insurance and auto insurance, and file claims. That\u2019s the first step. The tax deduction is for loss that\u2019s not paid for or reimbursed by your insurance.\u201d",
      "The IRS calls this kind of disaster relief \u201ccasualty loss.\" Claiming casualty loss doesn't result in dollar-for-dollar reimbursement, but it does lower your tax burden, which can mean more cash to help pay for recovery.",
      "Form 4684, which you include when you file your return, walks you through the relevant steps for calculating your casualty write-off.",
      "Victims of disasters may deduct their losses in either the year they suffered the loss or in the previous year \u2014 in that case, by filing an amended return.",
      "In the wake of a disaster, it's normal to feel vulnerable and to listen to voices that promise relief. But scammers often target disaster victims for exactly this reason.",
      "\u201cTaxpayers should be cautious of unsolicited phone calls, emails or texts claiming to be from the IRS or relief agencies,\u201d said Erickson. \u201cThe IRS never initiates contact via email, text, or social media to request sensitive information. When in doubt, taxpayers should verify correspondence by calling official numbers directly.\u201d",
      "According to the IRS, you should watch out for:",
      "\u2014 Big paydays: The promise of more money than you think sounds reasonable. Bad advisers may make outlandish statements about available credits.",
      "\u2014 Threats and demands: Any pressure to pay for tax help \u201cnow or else,\u201d mentions of arrest or deportation, or refusals to let you question or appeal the taxes they say you owe.",
      "\u2014 Suspicious or misspelled website links that aren't IRS.gov.",
      "Scammers may say that they want to \u201chelp\u201d you file casualty loss claims or to get big refunds. Always rely on official IRS government websites and beware fishy offers of help with high price-tags or sensational promises.",

      "China's exports jumped 12.4% in March from a year earlier in a last minute flurry of activity as companies rushed to beat President Donald Trump's hefty increases in U.S. tariffs",
      "BANGKOK -- China's exports jumped 12.4% in March from a year earlier in a last-minute flurry of activity as companies rushed to beat increases in U.S. tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, and analysts forecast sharp setbacks ahead.",
      "Imports fell 4.3% to $211.3 billion in March, the customs administration reported, far exceeded by exports worth $313.9 billion, leaving a trade surplus of $102.6 billion.",
      "\u201cBut shipments are set to drop back over the coming months and quarters,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. \u201cWe think it could be years before Chinese exports regain current levels.\u201d",
      "China's trade surplus surged to a record $992.2 billion in 2024 and its exports climbed 5.4%, helping to make up for sluggish growth at home as the country slowly recovers from a crisis in its property market and lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "After taking office, Trump first ordered a 10% increase in tariffs on imports from China. He later raised that to 20%. Now, China is facing 145% tariffs on most of its exports to the United States, based on the most recent revisions in Trump\u2019s trade policies. China has responded with 125% tariffs on U.S. products and other measures meant to pinch the U.S. where it hurts most, such as controls on exports of critical minerals needed in high-tech manufacturing, such as electric vehicle production.",
      "China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States was $27.6 billion in March as its exports rose 4.5%. It logged a surplus of $76.6 billion with the U.S. in January-March even though exports were up only 2.3% the first two months of the year.",
      "\u201cSavvy U.S. importers likely saw tariff hikes coming in April onward and frontloaded imports,\u201d ING Economics said in a report, but that trend is likely to fall off as importers use up their inventories while they watch for the latest twists and turns in unpredictable U.S. trade policy.",
      "\u201cAs a result, it\u2019s likely that direct trade between the U.S. and China will crater starting in April,\u201d it said.",
      "Trade data already show some impact from the higher tariffs, with exports of lower value-added items like shoes and clothing falling, while shipments of computer chips, household appliances and vehicles surged. China\u2019s biggest exports in the first three months of the year were electronic machinery, a broad category that includes smart phones and laptops, and high-tech products, the report shows.",
      "China\u2019s exports of rare earths fell nearly 11% in the first quarter of the year as Beijing tightened controls on the strategically vital materials used in electric vehicles and other high-tech products.",
      "The customs data showed total exports from the world\u2019s second largest economy rose 5.8% in the first three months of the year from a year earlier while imports sank 7%, leaving a trade surplus of $273 billion.",
      "Late Friday, Trump exempted most computer-related goods from the higher China-specific tariffs, including laptops, smartphones and the components needed to make them, though his administration says he plans to announce those within days. Such products accounted for nearly $174 billion in U.S. imports from China last year.",
      "Still, the harsh U.S. tariffs on Chinese products have raised questions about whether exporters might end up diverting their goods to other overseas markets as they give up on selling to American consumers due to the more than doubling of import duties.",
      "The biggest increases in exports in March were to China's Southeast Asian neighbors, which saw the dollar value of shipments from China jump 8% in March from a year earlier. Exports to Africa rose more than 11% and those to India by nearly 14%.",
      "A customs administration spokesperson, Lyu Daliang, said China was facing a \u201ccomplex and severe external situation\u201d but that the sky would not fall. He pointed to China\u2019s diversified export options and huge domestic market.",
      "When asked about falling Chinese imports, he told reporters in Beijing that China has been the world\u2019s second largest importer for 16 straight years, increasing its share of global imports from about 8% to 10.5%.",
      "\u201cAt present and in the future, China\u2019s import growth space is huge, and the large Chinese market is always a great opportunity for the world,\u201d he said.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping was visiting Vietnam on Monday as part of a regional tour that also will take him to Malaysia and Cambodia, giving him an opportunity to firm up trade ties with other Asian countries that also are facing potentially steep tariffs, though last week Trump delayed enforcing them by 90 days.",
      "China's exports to Vietnam jumped nearly 17% last month from a year earlier, while its imports fell 2.7%.",

      "China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping says no one wins in a trade war as he kicked off a diplomatic tour of Southeast Asia with a trip to Vietnam",
      "HANOI, Vietnam -- China's leader Xi Jinping said no one wins in a trade war as he kicked off a diplomatic tour of Southeast Asia on Monday, reiterating China's commitment to global trade in contrast with U.S. President Donald Trump's latest tariffs moves.",
      "Although Trump has paused some tariffs, he has kept in place 145% duties on China, the world's second-largest economy.",
      "\u201cThere are no winners in a trade war, or a tariff war,\u201d Xi wrote in an editorial jointly published in Vietnamese and Chinese official media. \u201cOur two countries should resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment.\u201d",
      "Xi's visit lets China show Southeast Asia it is a \u201cresponsible superpower in the way that contrasts with the way the U.S. under President Donald Trump presents to the whole world,\" said Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute.",
      "Xi was greeted on the tarmac by Vietnam's President Luong Cuong at the start of his two-day visit, a mark of honor not often given to visitors, said Nguyen Thanh Trung, a professor of Vietnamese studies at Fulbright University Vietnam. Students of a drum art group performed as women waved the red and yellow Chinese and Communist Party flags.",
      "While Xi\u2019s trip likely was planned earlier, it has become significant because of the tariff fight between China and the U.S. The visit offers a path for Beijing to shore up its alliances and find solutions for the high trade barrier that the U.S. has imposed on Chinese exports.",
      "In Vietnam, Xi will meet with Vietnam\u2019s Communist Party General Secretary To Lam, his counterpart, as well as the Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh.",
      "\u201cThe trip to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia is all about how China can really insulate itself against the from Trump,\u201d said Nguyen Khac Giang, pointing out that since Xi became the president in 2013, he has only visited Vietnam twice.",
      "The timing of the visit sends a \u201cstrong political message that Southeast Asia is important to China,\u201d said Huong Le-Thu of the International Crisis Group think tank. She said that given the severity of Trump's tariffs and despite the 90-day pause, Southeast Asian nations were anxious that the tariffs, if implemented, could complicate their development.",
      "Vietnam is experienced at balancing its relations with the U.S and China. It is run under a communist, one-party system like China but has had a strong relationship with the U.S.",
      "In 2023, it was the only country that received both U.S. President Joe Biden and China\u2019s Xi Jinping. That year it also upgraded the U.S. to its highest diplomatic level, the same as China and Russia.",
      "Vietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries of countries trying to decouple their supply chains from China, as businesses moved here. China is its biggest trading partner, and China-Vietnam trade surged 14.6% year-on-year in 2024, according to Chinese state media.",
      "But the intensification of the trade war has put Vietnam in a \u201cvery precarious situation\u201d given the impression in the U.S. that Vietnam is serving as a backdoor for Chinese goods, said Giang, the analyst at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute. Vietnam had been hit with 46% tariffs under Trump's order before the 90-day pause.",
      "China and Vietnam have real long-term differences, including territorial disputes in the South China Sea, where Vietnam has faced off with China\u2019s coast guard but does not often publicize the confrontations.",

      "LONDON -- Chinese companies will have to clear a \u201chigh trust bar\u201d when investing in key sectors in the U.K., the country's business secretary said Sunday, a day after he took effective control of Britain\u2019s last remaining factory that makes steel from scratch from its Chinese owners.",
      "Jonathan Reynolds said Jingye Group, which has owned British Steel since 2020, had not been negotiating \u201cin good faith\u201d with the government in recent months over the future of the heavily loss-making steel works in Scunthorpe in the north of England.",
      "Reynolds said it had become clear on Thursday that Jingye would not accept any financial offer from the government and that it was the company's intention to close the blast furnaces \u201ccome what may,\u201d while keeping the more profitable steel mill operations and supplying them from China.",
      "In an interview with Sky News on Sunday, he declined to accuse the company of deliberately sabotaging the business at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party, but did accept that there is now a \u201chigh trust bar\u201d to bringing Chinese investment into the U.K.",
      "\u201cI personally wouldn't bring a Chinese company into our steel sector,\u201d he said. \u201cI think steel is a very sensitive area.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer summoned lawmakers back to Parliament on Saturday to back a bill primarily aimed at blocking Jingye from closing the two blast furnaces. The bill, which is now law, gives Reynolds the power to direct British Steel's board and workforce, ensure its 3,000 workers get paid and order the raw materials necessary to keep the blast furnaces running.",
      "The British government had been under pressure to act after Jingye\u2019s recent decision to cancel orders for the iron pellets used in the blast furnaces. Without them and other raw materials, such as coking coal, the furnaces would likely have to shut for good, potentially within days, as they are extremely difficult and expensive to restart once cooled.",
      "That would mean the U.K., which in the late 19th century was the world\u2019s steelmaking powerhouse, would be the only country in the Group of Seven industrial nations without the capacity to make its own steel from scratch rather than from recycled material, which use greener electric arc furnaces rather than blast furnaces.",
      "The repercussions would be huge for industries like construction, defense and rail and make the country dependent on foreign sources for so-called virgin steel, a vulnerability that lawmakers from all political parties balked at.",
      "In a separate interview with the BBC, Reynolds declined to give a full guarantee that British Steel will be able to secure enough raw materials in time to keep the blast furnaces going.",
      "He said he would not \u201cmake my situation or the nation\u2019s situation more difficult\u201d by commenting on specific commercial details.",
      "\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t acted, the blast furnaces were gone, steel production in the U.K., primary steel producing, would have gone,\" he said. \"So we\u2019ve given ourselves the opportunity, we are in control of the site, my officials are on site right now to give us a chance to do that.\u201d",

      "Many of Silicon Valley's most prominent tech leaders have embraced President Donald Trump in his second term",
      "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Like many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons used to think of himself as a relatively apolitical guy.",
      "The only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Donald Trump\u2019s first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company\u2019s Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google\u2019s co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them.",
      "Last weekend was Lyons' second, also against Trump, but it had a very different feel.",
      "The man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who would not give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley\u2019s environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several had joined Trump at his January inauguration.",
      "To Lyons, 54, the change says as much about what\u2019s happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,\u201d Lyons said.",
      "The tech industry's political allegiances remain divided. But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry\u2019s everyday workers have remained liberal \u2014 but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. Their mood is in stark contrast to the prominent tech leaders who have embraced a conservative populist ideology.",
      "\u201cI think you're seeing a real gap between the leadership elite here in Silicon Valley and their workforce,\u201d said Ann Skeet, who helps run a center at Santa Clara University studying the ethics of the tech industry.",
      "\u201cThe shift hasn\u2019t been for a lot of people,\u201d said Lenny Siegel, a former mayor of Mountain View and longtime liberal activist in the valley. \u201cIt\u2019s a handful of people who\u2019ve gotten the attention.\u201d",
      "The biggest example of that is Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest person and CEO of the world\u2019s best-known electric car company who has taken on a prominent role slashing federal agencies in Trump's administration. Musk has been joined by several tech billionaires, including investor David Sacks, who helped fundraise for Trump's campaign and became the White House\u2019s artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, and venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended Trump's inauguration in Washington.",
      "Zuckerberg began praising Trump after the then-candidate, angered over money Zuckerberg steered toward local election offices in some states in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, threatened last summer to imprison him. Zuckerberg also donated $1 million to the president's inauguration fund and co-hosted an inauguration reception for billionaire Republican donors.",
      "Trump has filled a number of his administration's posts with billionaires and his support from wealthy tech leaders led Democratic President Joe Biden to warn that the United States risked becoming an oligarchy ruled by elites. During Trump's first term, the valley and its leaders were a bulwark of resistance to the Republican, especially over immigration, given that the industry draws its workforce from around the globe.",
      "It's against that backdrop that thousands of people attended the recent rally at a downtown San Jose park to protest the actions of Trump and Musk.",
      "Santa Clara County, which comprises most of Silicon Valley, swung 8 percentage points toward Trump in November election against Democrat Kamala Harris, matching the shift across California. Even with that swing, the county voted 68% to 28% for the then-vice president and remains a Democratic stronghold.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still in the belly of the beast,\u201d said Dave Johnson, the new executive director of the Santa Clara GOP, who said the party has gained some new members in the county but few from the tech industry. \u201cIf the lake was frozen, there\u2019s a little glimmer on top. I would not say there are cracks in the ice.\u201d",
      "The valley has long leaned Democratic, but with an unusual political mix: a general dislike of getting too involved in Washington\u2019s business coupled with an at-times contradictory mix of libertarian individualism, Bay Area activism and belief in the ability of science to solve the world\u2019s problems.",
      "That has persisted even as the tech industry has changed.",
      "The tech boom was fueled by scrappy startups that catered to their workers\u2019 dreams of changing the world for the better. Google\u2019s motto was \u201cdon\u2019t be evil,\u201d a phrase it removed from its code of conduct by 2018, when it and other companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had grown into multinational behemoths. The companies have had layoffs in recent years, a shock to an industry that not long ago seemed poised for unlimited growth.",
      "Entrepreneurs once dreamed of building startups that would change the world, said Jan English-Lueck, a San Jose State University professor who has been studying Silicon Valley culture for more than 20 years.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d she said, \u201cif you\u2019re part of a startup, you\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll be absorbed in a way that\u2019s profitable.\u201d",
      "Even before some prominent tech leaders shifted toward Trump, there was mounting discontent among some in the industry over its direction. IdaRose Sylvester runs a business promoting a Silicon Valley-style approach to entrepreneurs in other countries.",
      "\u201cI feel sick to my stomach now,\u201d she said.",
      "Sylvester was already disenchanted with the growing inequality in the valley and the environmental cost of all the energy needed to power crypto, AI and data centers. She took part in protests against Trump in 2017, but felt that energy fade once he lost the 2020 election to Biden.",
      "\u201cI saw a lot of people get out of politics once Biden won. There was a feeling it was all OK,\u201d Sylvester said. \u201cIt was not all OK.\u201d",

      "At first glance, the one in downtown San Jose could have been a typical anti-Trump protest anywhere. A large crowd of largely middle-age and older people carried signs against the president and Musk while chanting against oligarchs.",

      "Taxes may not be the first thing on your mind when you celebrate a joyous occasion like a marriage or a new baby",
      "NEW YORK -- Taxes may not be the first thing on your mind when you celebrate a joyous occasion like a marriage or a new baby. But once you return from your honeymoon or while your newborn is napping, you'll need to spend some time thinking about them.",
      "Keeping your documents organized, updating your withholding and knowing which tax credits you're eligible for are some crucial steps as couples and parents navigate tax season, said Henry Grzes, lead manager of tax practice & ethics for the American Institute of CPAs.",
      "The deadline to file your 2024 taxes is Tuesday. If you run out of time, you can file for an extension until Oct. 15.",
      "Here are some expert recommendations if you are filing taxes as a newlywed or new parent.",
      "Keeping your tax documents organized is a great practice regardless of your filing year. Having your tax documents in a folder on your personal computer, even if it\u2019s pictures of the documents, can help you have everything in the same place, said Tyler Horn, a certified financial planner and head of planning at Origin, a financial planning app.",
      "\u201cJust take a picture with your phone, send it and keep it in that secure folder on your computer. That way you have everything together,\u201d Horn said.",
      "It's also good to keep your records for the future. The IRS recommends that you keep your documents for at least three years and up to seven depending on your situation.",
      "If you changed your last name, you will need to make sure your government documents reflect this. Your tax return must match your Social Security number so, if you choose to change your name, you\u2019ll need to make a change with the Social Security Administration.",
      "Oftentimes, people forget to make this change ahead of time, which leads them to make mistakes on their tax returns.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s something that people don\u2019t necessarily think about and when they do think about it sometimes it\u2019s it\u2019s too late,\u201d Grzes said.",
      "You can find out more about how to change your name on the Social Security Administration\u2019s website.",
      "One of the biggest changes, for tax purposes, when you get married is whether you choose to file your taxes jointly or separately, Horn said.",
      "To make this decision, each couple should take a look at their specific situation. In most cases, filing jointly might make the most sense but it\u2019s not always that case, Horn said. One of the benefits of filing jointly is that it gives you access to new tax credits and deductions.",
      "It\u2019s important to know that if a couple is married as of Dec. 31, the law indicates that the couple was married for the entire year, Grzes said. So, if you got married in the summer, in the eyes of the IRS you have been married the full year.",
      "You can read more about each filing status on the IRS website.",
      "If you\u2019re planning to file taxes jointly with your spouse, you must update your W-4 form with your employer. Updating your W-4 is meant to reflect your new filing status, from single to married, as well as updating your tax withholding.",
      "Knowing what tax credits and deductions you qualify for is very important when filing your taxes, Horn said. Relevant tax credits for married couples include the Earned Income, American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning tax credits.",
      "When it comes to deductions, you can either opt for a standard deduction or itemize. Itemizing generally only makes sense if your itemized deductions add up to more than the current standard deduction of $29,200 for a married couple.",
      "In some cases, a person that qualifies for the Earned Income Credit as a single filer will no longer qualify if they file jointly with their spouse, Grzes said. To avoid surprises when you\u2019re filing your taxes, Grzes recommends that you work with a tax professional ahead of time.",
      "It\u2019s important that you obtain a social security number for your child as soon as you can, Grzes said. The first time you file taxes after you\u2019ve had your new baby, you will be able to apply for several new tax credits, but you can only do so if you claim them as a dependent.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to claim your child as a dependent, you have to have a Social Security number and put that number on the return. Otherwise, the IRS is going to deny you,\" Grzes said.",
      "Usually, hospitals let you apply for a Social Security number registration. However, you can also apply online or at your local Social Security office.",
      "To alleviate some of the expenses of having children, the IRS offers several tax credits, including the Child Tax Credit, Childcare Credit and Adoption Credit. Parents also continue to qualify for the Earned Income Credit, which will continue to be based on your earned income and the number of children you have.",
      "\u201cThe Earned Income Credit clearly provides a significant refund and by having a child, you could increase the amount of income that you could earn and still qualify for that credit,\u201d Grzes said.",
      "Parents can benefit from opening tax-free accounts such as a flexible spending account or a 529 account.",
      "A flexible spending account (FSA), allows you to set aside pre-tax dollars to pay for healthcare and childcare costs, while the 529 account lets you set money aside for education expenses.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s worth making sure you are maximizing your tax opportunities,\u201d Grzes said.",

      "The 145% tariff from the U.S. and the retaliatory 125% tariff from China are putting businesses doing trade between the U.S. and China on edge",
      "When the first two rounds of 10% tariffs hit, Zou Guoqing, a Chinese exporter, groaned but didn't find the barriers insurmountable. He gave up some of his profits and offered his client, a snow-bike factory in Nebraska, price cuts ranging from 5% to 10%. It seemed to work: The factory agreed to a new order of molds and parts.",
      "But when President Donald Trump announced an additional 34% universal tariff on Chinese goods on April 2, Zou, who\u2019s been exporting to the U.S. for more than a decade, was incredulous.",
      "\u201cThere's not a thread of feasibility,\" said Zou, who does business in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo. \u201cIt looks like I would have no choice but give up trading with the U.S.\u201d",
      "Then came 50% more from Trump, followed by another hike \u2014 pushing the universal tariff on Chinese goods to the sky-high 145%, and Zou said he now could only hope that the two leaders can communicate. \u201cWe are pausing the shipments,\" he said, \u201cuntil the leaders talk.\u201d",
      "The 145% tariff from the United States and the retaliatory 125% tariff from China are putting businesses doing trade between the U.S. and China on edge. They're fretting not only about their next orders, but also the viability of their business if there's no quick relief. Experts are worried the decades-long trade ties that have underpinned the relationship between the world's two largest economies could be unraveling.",
      "If the high tariff is sustained for the next six months or longer, \u201cthat would actually lead to a real effective decoupling between the American and Chinese economies,\u201d said Chen Zhiwu, professor of finance at Hong Kong University Business School.",
      "Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s GeoEconomics Center, said the sky-high tariff, if kept in place, amounts to \u201calmost a trade embargo,\u201d making it impossible for China to export low-value items such as apparel to the U.S. It also would force U.S. businesses to source elsewhere, away from China, if there should be alternatives, he said.",
      "In China, the central tariff office flat-out declared there was \u201cno possibility for market acceptance\" of U.S. goods exported to China\u201d at the current tariff level.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s pretty worried,\u201d said Hu Jianlong, founder of Brands Factory, a consultancy that works with Chinese companies trying to break into overseas markets. \u201cAt this point in time, there\u2019s no good way forward. This situation has not resolved ... there's no final number. And so everyone\u2019s still waiting to see how this will develop.\u201d",
      "The high-stakes tariff war has come more than 20 years after China \u2014 with the help of the United States \u2014 joined the World Trade Organization and began to see its economy soar on luring foreign investments and exporting to the U.S. and other Western markets. By last year, China-U.S. trade was $582 billion, but tensions have flared over China's widening trade imbalance with the U.S. That led to the first tariff skirmish during the first Trump term.",
      "The trade deficit has since narrowed but stayed stubbornly high, at a time when the U.S. and other Western markets have also grown concerned about another onslaught of Chinese products such as electric vehicles.",
      "During his four-year term, former President Joe Biden stressed that the U.S. was not trying to decouple from China but to \u201cde-risk.\" He took the \u201csmall-yard, high-fence\u201d approach, under which his administration put up barriers in targeted sectors such as advanced chips, artificial intelligence and quantum computing that have national security implications.",
      "Now, Trump is declaring universal tariffs on all Chinese goods but has said he's also willing to talk with Beijing. It remains unclear what his goals might be.",
      "\u201cWhat are they looking for in those negotiations? How much is it possible to reduce these tariffs? What are the other demands apart from China removing its retaliatory tariffs that the United States wants to put forward. We don't know what that would be,\u201d said Greta Peisch, who served as the general counsel for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in 2021-2024.",
      "The message from China's leadership is loud and clear. It will talk only when the U.S. stops \u201cmaximum pressure and capricious and destructive behavior,\" said Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson.",
      "Li Cheng, professor of political science at the University of Hong Kong, said the Chinese leadership is upset over being singled out by Trump when the U.S. president paused \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs for 90 days for all other countries. Beijing wants to make sure that \u201cDonald Trump not state one thing in the morning and say other things in the evening,\" Li said, and that Trump's policies on China are not hijacked by his anti-China, hawkish advisers.",
      "With no leadership-level negotiations in the immediate future, businesses are exploring their options.",
      "Lisa Li, who works in sales for an athletic wear manufacturer in the northern Chinese province of Hebei, said her business was negotiating with clients over whether they could split the increased costs. It's too early to say if her company is to give up on the U.S. market, she said, but it will \u201cdefinitely expand other avenues for sales,\u201d such as in Australia or Europe.",
      "In the eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou, a manufacturing hub, a holiday lights maker was less optimistic. Bo, who shared only his surname out of concern for retaliation, said he could \u201conly give up\u201d if the tariff hikes were here to stay because other markets might not work.",
      "\u201cIn the past few years, the European market has been in a slump,\u201d Bo said. \u201cSo we had wanted to try and develop our business in the United States.\u201d",
      "In Hong Kong, Danny Lau, who runs an aluminum-coating factory in the nearby southern Chinese city of Dongguan, said one of his U.S clients would keep buying from him for an ongoing project but was unsure about the next project. Another client told Lau that the chances are slim to strike a deal when tariffs are so high. Lau has been exploring other markets, but he says it's not easy because some may find his high-quality products too expensive.",
      "At a port in the Chinese city of Shanghai, ships heading to the U.S. had almost vanished by Thursday, the day after Trump's tariff on China took effect, according to a report by the financial news site Caixin. Major shipping lines were drastically cutting back on trans-Pacific routes, the report said.",
      "For the longer term, the tariff war is likely to prompt Chinese businesses to diversify their supply chains and move part of their manufacturing capacity outside of China, and even to the United States, said Hu, the consultant.",
      "Some might follow in the footsteps of the Tianjin steelmaking business, which gave up trading with the U.S. after both Trump and Biden raised tariffs on Chinese steel. \u201cThe best plan is to not come into contact,\u201d said David Yu, who works in the company's foreign sales department.",
      "However, not everyone is ready to give up on the U.S. market. Zou, the exporter in Ningbo, describes the U.S. market as \u201creliable and without finicky demands.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's the best market on Earth,\u201d he said. \"I am waiting for the rainbow after the storm.\u201d",

      "The steep hike, compared to a 2.4% inflation rate for February, surprised financial analysts and worried Argentines who have become increasingly concerned that President Javier Milei's progress on lowering price increases might be stalling. The last time inflation rose this much on a monthly basis was in August 2024, when prices jumped 4.2%.",
      "The inflation numbers come at a critical juncture for South America's second-biggest economy. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund announced a new $20 billion loan agreement with Argentina. The IMF\u2019s executive board is expected to vote on the program later Friday.",
      "While Milei considers the IMF deal crucial to his efforts to stabilize Argentina's long troubled economy, the still-vague agreement has spread jitters among traders who expect that Argentina will have to impose a new monetary and foreign-exchange policy as a condition of receiving the cash.

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping global tariffs could cause planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to drop temporarily, but that won\u2019t help the climate long-term",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping global tariffs have stirred widespread anxiety about a severe economic downturn -- and curiosity, for some, about how it might affect the world\u2019s warming climate.",
      "Experts say a slowdown in international trade might have a brief and slight benefit in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which come in part from fuels like gas and oil that are used to move goods around the world via ships, planes and vehicles. But any such benefit in reducing emissions, which cause climate change, will be swamped by sharply rising costs worldwide that will hurt efforts to transition to green energies.",
      "\u201cI would say it might help the climate in the first year or two if we have a downturn in economic activity or a recession, which no one wants,\u201d said Rob Jackson, head of the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who monitor greenhouse gas emissions yearly. \u201cBut it will hurt the climate long-term because tariffs impact clean tech more than most other industries because of trade with China.",
      "\u201cAny emissions reduction would be temporary,\" said Dan Jasper, senior policy advisor at Project Drawdown. \u201cI'm deeply skeptical that this would have positive impacts on climate change and in particular the energy transition.\u201d",
      "Climate experts have closely studied changes in world economic activity the last century, from the Great Depression to the recent coronavirus pandemic, looking for insights to help shape policies to reduce carbon emissions. A major U.S.-China trade war would be a very different dynamic than other recent slowdowns, as China produces much of the equipment needed for a transition to renewable energies, such as solar panels.",
      "Trump imposed, then suspended for 90 days, import taxes on dozens of countries Wednesday. He escalated his trade war with China, raising tariffs on its products to well above 100%. China makes more than 80% of the world\u2019s solar panels.",
      "The tariffs could slow global trade and economic activity. Carbon dioxide emissions dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and during the global financial crisis in 2009, then rebounded within a year.",
      "Jackson said he expects at most a 1% drop in emissions if full tariffs are implemented \u2014 significant, but far less than the 5.7% that his group calculated for the pandemic's first year. And Jackson noted that the world can't reach net-zero carbon emissions to try to limit future warming without structural changes, namely replacing fossil energy and manufacturing with clean renewable energy.",
      "\u201cA drop in emissions is important. But it boomerangs back to the same levels or keeps increasing afterwards,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we really haven\u2019t done anything meaningful to address climate issues.\u201d",
      "Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, also thinks there could be a slight, temporary drop in greenhouse gas emissions if tariffs paralyze businesses and people aren't working. But, he said, the higher prices for components for new renewable energy facilities will make some not economical to build and there will be far fewer imports of electric vehicles, both of which will lead to more emissions.",
      "The transition to electric vehicles is an important part of the shift to clean energy to reduce emissions from road transport. The United States is a top importer of EVs and China is a top exporter.",
      "Renewable energy investor Excelsior Energy Capital announced Tuesday that it has raised just over $1 billion to continue investing equity in solar, energy storage, wind and other energy transition projects across the United States. Co-founder and managing partner Chris Moakley said they need stability and predictable costs \u2014 tariffs cause volatility.",
      "\u201cIf there is an increase in tariffs, I think there\u2019s going to be a time where we will have a slowdown,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall economics of these investments and transactions, there's going to need to be a reset.\u201d",
      "Grid-scale batteries and solar panels, as well as power transformers, are among the hardest hit by price increases on imports, said David Shepheard, partner and energy expert at the global consultant Baringa.",
      "Combining batteries with green energy is a fast-growing climate solution. Batteries allow renewables to replace fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal, while keeping a steady flow of power when sources like wind and solar are not producing. Shepheard calculated a 55% price increase for grid-scale batteries if the tariffs are fully implemented on China, where about 80% of these batteries are manufactured, undermining the case for using solar and battery storage to satisfy a surging demand for electricity.",
      "If prices for renewables increase, the United States will turn more to fossil fuels, tying the nation to carbon-emitting power sources for decades, Shepheard added.",
      "President Joe Biden sought to lock in a trajectory for reducing the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Trump began reversing the country\u2019s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. He's also moved aggressively against clean energy technologies, including halting offshore wind lease sales in federal waters, canceling clean energy loans and threatening action against states' climate laws.",

      "NEW YORK -- JPMorgan\u2019s net income rose 9% to $14.6 billion in the first quarter and the New York bank beat Wall Street\u2019s profit and revenue targets, but it's chief executive warned of global economic uncertainties ahead due to President Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing trade war and other geopolitical tensions.",
      "CEO Jamie Dimon said a strong performance by the bank\u2019s markets division helped lift it to another strong quarter, but added trade tensions to his list of potential negatives facing the bank and broader economy.",
      "JPMorgan\u2019s earnings per share rose to $5.07 per share from $4.44 a year ago. The result beat Wall Street profit projections of $4.63 a share, according to the data firm FactSet. Total managed revenue hit $46 billion, up from the $41.9 billion a year ago. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $44 billion.",
      "Trump\u2019s herky-jerky tariff increases \u2014 currently bumped up by 10% for most U.S. trading partners and 145% for China \u2014 have sent financial markets into dizzying fluctuations for weeks and created an enormous amount of uncertainty about where the global economy is headed. That\u2019s bad for banks, which thrive on stability and healthy consumers and businesses borrowing money.",
      "JPMorgan\u2019s trading desk thrived in the first three months of 2025, helped by the market's volatility, even before Trump rolled out his massive \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs on April 2.",
      "The bank\u2019s markets revenue rose 21% in the period, with equities revenue up 48% from a year ago.",
      "With regard to China, which further escalated its tariffs on imports from the U.S. to 125%, JPMorgan executives said it was too early to make any long-term projections or statements about the impact of the ongoing trade war on its business there.",
      "\u201cWe really have to see how things play out,\" said Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum. \u201dIn the near term, that business is performing fine and we are not seeing any effect.\"",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles-area residents whose homes survived the Eaton wildfire in January face a whole different set of struggles to their neighbors whose homes were burned to the ground",
      "All sense of survivors\u2019 guilt was fleeting for those residents whose homes remained standing after wildfires ripped through the Los Angeles area three months ago.",
      "Many worried that smoke from the Eaton wildfire that destroyed more than 9,000 structures and killed 18 people may have carried toxins, including lead, asbestos and heavy metals, into their homes. But they struggled to convince their insurers to test their properties to ensure it was safe to return.",
      "Nicole Maccalla, a data scientist, said embers burned more than half of her roof, several windows and eaves were damaged, and her house in Altadena was left filled with ash, debris, soot and damaged appliances. She said her insurance adjuster said USAA would pay for contamination testing, but after choosing a company and coming back with the results, her claim was rejected. The adjuster said the company only covered testing in homes with major damage.",
      "\u201cEvery single item is a battle,\u201d said Maccalla. \u201cIt\u2019s denials and appeals and denials and appeals, and you wait weeks and weeks and weeks for responses.\u201d",
      "Maccalla and others banded together as Eaton Fire Residents Unite, sharing environmental testing data and compiling the results in an online map. Of 81 homes tested so far for lead, all show elevated levels, according to the group.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve already had multiple people reach out and say: \u2018Thank you for publishing this map \u2026 because my insurance company has changed their mind and approved testing,\u2019\u201d said Maccalla, who helped design the data collection to verify results and maintain privacy.",
      "Many homeowners paid privately for the testing after their insurance companies refused, revealing gaps in coverage. The group hopes the data will help residents who can\u2019t afford it to convince their insurers to cover testing and remediation.",
      "\u201cIf I can prove my community is not fit for human habitation then maybe I can show my home won\u2019t be,\u201d said Jane Lawton Potelle, founder of Eaton Fire Residents Unite.",
      "It's not easy to understand how and when it is safe to return home, Lawton Potelle said. The fine print of insurance policies can be frustrating and confusing, and the government has not stepped in to help.",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has no plans to conduct widespread environmental testing. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is tracking environmental testing largely by academic researchers and a handful from government agencies, but most studies assess outdoor contamination.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven't standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don't torch the property.",
      "California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara released a bulletin in March that put the onus on companies to properly investigate reported smoke damage, saying they cannot deny such claims without investigating thoroughly, including paying for professional testing as warranted. But many residents have been left to fight for coverage anyway.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute that represents many major insurance companies, said it's hard to compare neighbors because every claim is unique due to each home\u2019s physical structure, actual damage and defined insurance coverage limits.",
      "\u201cIt can vary and insurance companies are sensitive to what the claim is,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cYou have to work with your insurance companies and be reasonable about what may have happened.\u201d",
      "Dave Jones, director of the Climate Risk Initiative at University of California, Berkeley, and former state insurance commissioner, said testing should be covered even though some insurance companies disagree.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable for people to have some kind of environmental test done so that their home is safe and their property is safe,\" Jones said. \"We\u2019re talking about very catastrophically high temperature fires where all sorts of materials are melted and some of them become toxic.\"",
      "The state's insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over how it handles smoke damage claims. A 2017 change to the FAIR Plan limited coverage to \u201cpermanent physical changes,\u201d meaning smoke damage must be visible or detectable without lab testing for claims to be approved. State officials said that threshold was too high and illegal, and ordered a change.",
      "Dylan Schaffer, an attorney leading a class action lawsuit challenging FAIR Plan\u2019s threshold, said he was surprised private carriers are disputing similar fire damage claims.",
      "\u201cThe damage is not due to smoke, the damage is contamination from fire,\u201d Schaffer said. \u201cThey make it complicated because it saves them money.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Altadena residents on the FAIR Plan say their claims are still being denied. Jones believes the debate will only end when lawmakers take action.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean declined to comment on the ongoing litigation and individual cases, but said the FAIR Plan pays all covered claims based on the adjusters\u2019 recommendations.",
      "\u201cOur policy, like many others, requires direct physical loss for there to be coverage,\u201d McLean said.",
      "Lawton Potelle said the first inkling that her house might be toxic came after meeting with her AAA insurance adjuster in the days after the fire. Even though she had worn a mask, her chest still ached and her voice rasped, and she wondered whether her home was safe for her 11-year-old.",
      "Stephanie Wilcox said her toddler\u2019s pediatrician recommended testing their home. Her Farmers Insurance policy includes coverage for lead and asbestos in addition to her wildfire coverage, but after multiple denials, she paid out of pocket.",
      "\u201cAfter the initial inspection, (Farmers) had told us remediation would cost about $12,000 and that it would be habitable, like we could move back in tomorrow,\u201d she said. \"But now there\u2019s no way.\u201d",
      "She plans to ask for a new estimate including lead abatement and other costs, citing the results.",
      "Similarly, Zach Bailey asked in late January for contamination testing. The house he shares with his wife and toddler sits in an island of largely spared homes among blocks wiped out by the fire. After months of denials, State Farm agreed to pay for lead and asbestos testing because the remediation company cited federal worker safety regulations.",
      "It shouldn't have been that hard, he said.",
      "\u201cIt feels like the insurance companies should have a playbook at this point,\" he said. \u201cThey should have a process to keep people safe because this isn\u2019t the first disaster like this.\u201d",

      "The visit comes at a complex moment for Europe and China. The tariffs announced last week \u2014 and then paused \u2014 by U.S. President Donald Trump could mean that the European Union pursues more trade with China \u2014 the world\u2019s third-largest consumer market after the United States and the EU.",

And this is clear, the world needs both China and the United States to talk.\u201d",

      "Musk and Saudi Arabia have had a complicated history. Back in 2018, the Tesla CEO claimed he had secured funding from the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund to take the company private. That deal never happened, leading to lingering tensions.",
      "With the launch of its first showroom and service center in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, Tesla makes its long-anticipated entry into the Saudi market.

      "American shrimpers have been hammered in recent years by cheap imports flooding the U.S. market and restaurants, driving down prices to the point that profits are razor thin or shrimpers are losing money and struggling to stay afloat.",
      "Tariffs, they hope, could level the playing field and help their businesses not just survive but thrive.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been tough the last several years that we\u2019ve tried to fight through this,\" said Reed Bowers, owner of Bowers Shrimp Farm in Palacios, Texas. Tough times meant difficult choices for many. \"Cutting people off, laying people off, or reduce hours or reduce wages ... whatever we can do to survive.\"",
      "Since 2021, the price of imported shrimp has dropped by more than $1.5 billion, according to the Southern Shrimpers Alliance trade association, causing the U.S. shrimp industry to lose nearly 50% of its market value.",
      "The shrimpers alliance complains that the overseas industry has benefitted from billions of dollars invested in shrimp aquaculture, cheap or even forced labor, use of antibiotics banned in the U.S., and few or no environment regulations.",
      "More than 90% of shrimp consumed in the U.S. is imported, according to the alliance.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a believer in free trade. I\u2019m a believer fair trade,\u201d Bowers said. \"So if you\u2019re gonna sell into the United States, I think it\u2019s very important to get the same rules and regulations that I have to have as a farmer here in the United States.\u201d",
      "Craig Wallis, owner of W&W Dock & Ice, has been in the business since 1975 and noted that back then shrimpers would run their trawlers 12 months a year.",
      "Not anymore. That's no longer affordable as Gulf shrimpers compete with cheaper product coming in from South America, China and India.",
      "Wallis says he's only able to run his shrimp boats about half the year, yet \u201cthe bills keep coming every month.\u201d",
      "\"We don\u2019t get any subsidies here. We don\u2019t need any help from the government. What we get for our product is what we have to make it on,\u201d he said.",
      "Wallis, who noted he voted for Trump, has watched the back-and-forth on tariffs in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know where the tariffs are going to be settled at,\" he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s definitely going to help.\"",
      "But Trump's tariffs will also force shrimpers to balance the higher costs of equipment, such as trawl cables, webbing, chains and shackles. Some of those items have recently been increasing in price, Wallis said.",
      "\"We got be careful that there\u2019s a good balance,\u201d he said.",
      "If the American shrimping industry collapses, Wallis sees a future where foreign trawlers are operating in the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump renamed the \u201c Gulf of America. \u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hanging on to have something when I retire,\u201d said Wallis, who is 72. \u201cIf it keeps going like it is, it\u2019s taken away from my retirement that I\u2019ve worked for all my life.\u201d",
      "Phan Tran's family used to be shrimpers but quit the boats around 25 years ago to open Tran's Family Restaurant, a place they literally built themselves.",
      "\u201cIt was just my dad, me and one welder,\u201d Tran said.",
      "Tran said he doesn't want to serve imported shrimp to his customers. He doesn't know what shortcuts foreign shrimper firms take.",
      "\u201cThe taste, the size, you could tell the texture of the shrimp, everything. ... Domestic shrimp versus imported shrimp, you could tell the difference,\u201d Tran said, adding he'll be buying straight from the day's catch at the dock, \u201cas long as we have the restaurant business.\u201d",
      "Tariffs will help keep the market fair for local shrimpers, Tran said.",
      "\u201cWe used to have a sign on our window here that says, \u2018friends don\u2019t let friends eat imported shrimp,\u2019\" Tran said. \u201cAnd a few people got a little offended by it, so we had to take it off. (But) that's a true statement that we stand by here.\u201d",
      "Bowers, the shrimp farm owner, hopes seafood tariffs have a positive ripple effect across the industry for American producers.",
      "\u201cI think the price of imported seafood is gonna come up,\" he said. \u201cAnd as that price comes up, it\u2019ll make our seafood, our shrimp, more affordable for everybody else.\u201d",

      "Attorneys working on the legal settlement designed to reshape college sports filed a brief that did not offer changes a judge suggested regarding roster limits, reiterating the benefit the limits provide to some athletes and the havoc a late change to ...",
      "Attorneys working on the $2.8 billion legal settlement designed to reshape college sports filed a brief Monday night that did not include changes a judge suggested regarding team roster limits, saying such a late change to that rule would create havoc.",
      "The plan on the table, the attorneys said, \u201cis a vast improvement over the status quo\u201d and the offered only a few tweaks to the sprawling deal announced last year that will clear the way for schools to begin sharing millions in revenue with their athletes and pay hundreds of millions more to former and current athletes who said they were illegally prevented from earning money.",
      "The filing came in response to U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken's suggestion last week that the terms of the roster limit rules be adjusted \u201cto grandfather in a group of rostered people\u201d set to lose their spots on teams if the caps come into play.",
      "The defendants \u2014 the NCAA and the nation's five largest conferences \u2014 said such a move would \u201ccause significant disruption.\u201d They said countless roster moves have already been made in anticipation of the settlement going into effect on July 1.",
      "\u201cThese decisions, in turn, cascaded into tens of thousands of decisions by individual student-athletes,\u201d the attorneys said. \u201cMany kept their pre-existing roster spots (and may now receive scholarships), because the roster limits were designed to capture the average number of participants across a season and thereby minimize disruptions from the transition. Some transferred to new schools to seek roster spots and enhanced opportunities for athletic competition. ... while implementing a \u2018grandfather\u2019 provision might benefit some athletes, it would, at the same time, upset the settled expectations, enrollment decisions and other preparations of numerous other student-athletes and member institutions.\u201d",
      "Wilken has already granted preliminary approval of the settlement. In addition to asking for Monday's adjustments from attorneys on both sides of the case, Wilken has asked for objectors to respond to the new brief on Tuesday.",
      "Attorneys expect her final decision on the settlement to come in a matter of weeks, with the July 1 deadline bearing down.",
      "In what was supposed to be the final hearing a week ago, more than a dozen athletes and their lawyers outlines their objections to to the terms.",
      "Of all the arguments over the deal, which sets a template for schools to pay athletes directly for use of their name, image and likeness and outlines $2.78 billion in back pay to athletes who played before NIL, those about roster limits appeared to make the biggest impact on Wilken.",
      "Under current rules, schools must adhere to a scholarship limit in each sport, but there are no roster limits. There are spots for walk-ons and partial scholarship recipients, all of whom can later qualify for aid.",
      "The new rules propose roster limits and make everyone eligible for scholarships. It could increase the total amount of aid available but is expected to cost athletes thousands of roster spots across the country as schools look to cut expenses to absorb higher costs.",
      "One example: Some women's swim teams currently divide 14 scholarships among 40 or more athletes. Under the new rules, most rosters would be capped at 30, but all those players could receive full rides.",
      "Wilken said figuring out a way to delay implementation wouldn't be that expensive and \u201cwould save a lot of good will and angst and unhappiness from a lot of students and their parents, so why not just do it?\u201d",
      "In their filing, attorneys said it would be too \u201cunworkable,\u201d with athletes perhaps seeking to start over after making a change: \u201cAnd every additional \u2018round\u2019 of re-dos permitted would create a new set of potentially affected student-athletes who might want re-dos themselves; with thousands if not more individual decisions having been made on the understanding the roster limits would likely go in effect in less than three months.\u201d",
      "The brief also argued that one of the most overlooked parts of the roster limits is how much more aid would go to athletes.",
      "\u201cIndeed, while it is unfortunate that a small number of athletes may ultimately have lost roster spots as a result of the settlement, the settlement afforded them an opportunity to compete for scholarships (or larger scholarships) and additional compensation and benefits that were not previously available,\u201d they attorneys wrote.",
      "The brief sought to address other concerns of the judge:",
      "\u2014 By agreeing to clarify that future Division I athletes -- they are covered under the 10-year term of the settlement even if they are not yet in college -- will have a chance to object to the deal and not release any claims until they have a chance to be heard or until their 60-day objection window ends. The defendants are hoping to avoid an endless series of court challenges over the same issues of athlete compensation.",
      "\u201cCollege sports would be entirely unmanageable if individual future college athletes (or groups of future athletes) pursued different types of injunctive relief year over year over year,\u201d the filing said. The settlement \u201cworks only if it is durable and applicable to all current and future class members.\u201d",
      "\u2014 By addressing what some objectors said were glitches in the system athletes use to calculate damages claims and asking the judge to OK a claims extension to May 16. A week ago, LSU gymnast and influencer Olivia Dunne told Wilken that the settlement hardly acknowledges her true value and potential earning power; the Monday filing said she would be among those receiving an updated allocation.",

We also ran the bases well and took our walks \u2026 I think it\u2019s just the mentality of this team that we\u2019re gonna fight to the end no matter what the score is.\u201d",
      "Michael Busch, once a top prospect in the Dodgers\u2019 farm system, had four hits, including a homer and two doubles, and drove in three runs. The first baseman is batting .308 (12 for 39) with three homers, six doubles and 11 RBIs in 10 career games against the Dodgers.",
      "Ian Happ had three hits and scored two runs, and Miguel Amaya replaced the injured Seiya Suzuki (right-wrist pain) in the fifth inning and homered among his two hits and drove in three runs.",
      "Kelly keyed a five-run seventh inning by with a homer 384 feet over the left-field wall against Dodgers reliever Ben Casparius, and then crushed a 391-foot homer on a floater from infielder-turned-pitcher Miguel Rojas for a two-run shot in the ninth.",
      "\u201cYou have to take a quick swing, not a big swing,\u201d Kelly said, when asked how hard it is to homer off a 40-mph pitch. \u201cYou have to find the right timing of it.\u201d",
      "The Cubs pushed their major league-league-leading run total to 112, which is 21 more than the second-place New York Yankees (91), and they have outscored opponents by 41 runs, a margin nearly twice as much as any other team.",
      "Busch, who homered off Dodgers starter Roki Sasaki for a 1-0 lead in the second, came within inches of a monster game when he was robbed of a grand slam by center fielder Andy Pages to end the third.",
      "\u201cI saw him (make the catch) \u2014 unfortunately,\u201d said Busch, a former minor league teammate of Pages. \u201cHe\u2019s a good player. I didn\u2019t want him to do that, so we\u2019re gonna have to have a conversation.\u201d",
      "Sasaki (0-1) left with a 1-0 deficit after allowing one run and four hits in five innings, striking out three and walking two. However, the Cubs then broke through against a Dodgers bullpen that entered with a 2.15 ERA, the fourth-best mark in baseball.",
      "Busch doubled and scored on Justin Turner\u2019s RBI single off Casparius for a 2-0 lead in the sixth, and Amaya (single), Busch (single), Dansby Swanson (single) and Nico Hoerner (sacrifice fly) drove in runs after Kelly\u2019s leadoff homer in the seventh.",
      "Kyle Tucker had a two-run single and Amaya a two-run homer in the eighth, and the Cubs teed off on Rojas in the ninth.",
      "The offensive outburst backed a superb start by Cubs right-hander Ben Brown, who used only two pitches \u2014 a four-seam fastball that averaged 95.6 mph and a knuckle-curve that averaged 86.9 mph \u2014 to blank the Dodgers on five hits in six innings, striking out five and walking none.",
      "Brown (2-1) gave up five runs and seven hits in four innings of his previous start, a no-decision against San Diego.",
      "\u201cJust trying to do the exact opposite of last week,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis past week was a grind working on things, mentally going through things, but I put in that effort, and it obviously showed tonight.",
      "\u201cI was able to slow the game down, slow the heart rate down, execute pitch by pitch and go back to where I was last year \u2026 when my stuff is there, we can get through lineups like that.\u201d",

      "Two judges scored the fight 49-46 and the other had it 48-47.",
      "Volkanovski (27-4) had successfully defended his belt four times before losing to Israel Makhachev on Feb. 11, 2023.",
      "Now he has it back.",
      "President Donald Trump, a longtime friend of UFC President and CEO Dana White and a fan of the sport, watched from the front row. Shaquille O'Neal approached Trump and shook his hand. Cabinet officials Tulsi Gabbard, Marco Rubio and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also were in attendance as was X (formerly Twitter) owner and White House adviser Elon Musk.",
      "In the co-main event, No. 12 lightweight contender Paddy Pimblett continued this rise with a technical knockout of No. 7 Michael Chandler at 3:07 of the third round. Plimbett, a 30-year-old from Liverpool, England, has won all seven of his bouts since moving to the organization, giving him a 23-3 record overall.",
      "\u201cI want that world title,\u201d Pimblett said. \u201cSome say I'll never be champ, I'll never get run, I'll never be in the top 10. But what now?\u201d",
      "At nearly 39, Chandler has some decisions to making after winning just two of his most recent seven bouts. He is 23-10.",
      "Featherweight Bryce Mitchell, who fought for the first time since praising Adolf Hitler and denying the Holocaust on a podcast, was also on the card. He later backed off his comments and though White heavily criticized Mitchell, he didn\u2019t discipline him.",
      "Mitchell was little match for Jean Silva in their featherweight fight. Silva won by submission with a guillotine choke with 1:08 left in the second round.",
      "Volkanovski, despite getting cut below his right eye in the second and being floored by an overhand right in that round, dominated the first three rounds. But Lopes' glove caught Volkanovski's other eye in the fourth round and then pounced, but failed to put him away.",
      "That set up the fifth round and, barring a knockout, Volkanovski appeared on his way to victory even though Lopes spent much of the fight verbally challenging him and inviting him to box. Theatrics to the contrary, Volkanovski was the aggressor.",
      "Volkanovski had hoped to get another shot at Ilia Topuria and avenge his loss from more than a year ago at UFC 298. But Topuria moved up to the lightweight division, leaving the featherweight class vacant.",
      "In stepped Lopes, the third-ranked challenger, to take on Volkanovski.",
      "This was the 10th consecutive title fight for Volkanovski, the 36-year-old top-ranked contender from Australia. Lopes, a 30-year-old from Brazil, was in first title bout.",
      "Volkanovski was a -160 favorite at BetMGM Sportsbook to defeat Lopes (26-7), whose five-match winning streak ended.",
      "In preparing for Lopes, Volkanovski said he fully committed himself by beginning training camp earlier than usual and focusing on the workout recovery process and dieting in addition to the physical demands. He said he has never been this lean going into a bout.",
      "Volkanovski had plenty of reason for wanting to get to work. He took an extended layoff after losing in February 2024 to Topuria. More than that, he\u2019s coming off defeats in three of his past four fights, including losing the two most recent matches. All four fights occurred in less than a year, so he was much more rested.",

      "Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump\u2019s Federal Trade Commission\u2019s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: \u2018It is better to buy than compete.\u2019 True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \u201cneutralize perceived competitive threats,\u201d the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "\u201cUnable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company\u2019s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,\u201d the FTC says.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \u201cacqui-hires\u201d \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "\u201cThe FTC already has the difficult task, whether it\u2019s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we\u2019re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,\u201d said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \u201cAnd I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.\u201d",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC\u2019s lawsuit \u201cdefies reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission\u2019s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC \u201cmust prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.\" This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram.",
      "Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.",
      "Boasberg \u201cseems to be skeptical\u201d of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a \u201cfact question,\" which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market.",
      "While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram.",
      "\u201cInstagram is now Meta\u2019s biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company\u2019s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. \u201cThe trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn\u2019t where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.\u201d",
      "But Meta isn't the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google's case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August.",
      "\u201cA big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it\u2019s an open question whether the judgment developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing \u2014 these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cAnd this will be a case that speaks directly to that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been predicting its barrage of tariffs targeting China will push Apple into manufacturing the iPhone in the U",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- President Donald Trump's administration has been predicting its barrage of tariffs targeting China will push Apple into manufacturing the iPhone in the United States for the first time.",
      "But that's an unlikely scenario even with U.S tariffs now standing at 145% on products made in China \u2014 the country where Apple has manufactured most of its iPhones since the first model hit the market 18 years ago.",
      "The disincentives for Apple shifting its production domestically include a complex supply chain that it began building in China during the 1990s. It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product.",
      "\u201cThe concept of making iPhones in the U.S. is a non-starter,\u201d asserted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, reflecting a widely held view in the investment community that tracks Apple's every move. He estimated that the current $1,000 price tag for an iPhone made in China, or India, would soar to more than $3,000 if production shifted to the U.S. And he believes that moving production domestically likely couldn't be done until, at the earliest, 2028. \u201cPrice points would move so dramatically, it's hard to comprehend.\u201d",
      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment Wednesday. The Cupertino, California, company has yet to publicly discuss its response to Trump\u2019s tariffs on China, but the topic may come up on May 1 when Apple CEO Tim Cook is scheduled to field questions from analysts during a quarterly conference call to discuss the company\u2019s financial results and strategy.",
      "And there is no doubt the China tariffs will be a hot-button issue given Apple\u2019s stock price has dropped by nearly 20% and lowered the company\u2019s market value by $600 billion since Trump began increasing them on April 2.",
      "If the tariffs hold, Apple is widely expected to eventually raise the prices on iPhones and other popular products because the Silicon Valley\u2019s supply chain is so heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets caught in the crossfire of the escalating trade war.",
      "The big question is how long Apple might be willing to hold the line on its current prices before the tariffs\u2019 toll on the company\u2019s profit margins become too much to bear and consumers are asked to shoulder some of the burden.",
      "One of the main reasons that Apple has wiggle room to hold the line on its current iPhone pricing while the China tariffs remain in place is because the company continues to reap huge profit margins from the revenue generated by the subscriptions and other services tied to its product, said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee. That division, which collected $96 billion in revenue during Apple\u2019s last fiscal year, remains untouched by Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cApple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\u201d Chatterjee said.",
      "Apple tried to appease Trump in February by announcing plans to spend $500 billion and hire 20,000 people in the U.S. through 2028, but none of it was tied to making an iPhone domestically. Instead, Apple pledged to fund a Houston data center for computer servers powering artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology the company is expanding into as part of an industrywide craze.",
      "When asked this week about whether Trump believes Apple intends to build iPhones in the U.S., White House Press Secretary Karoline Levitt pointed to Apple's investment promise as evidence that the company thinks it could be done. \u201cIf Apple didn\u2019t think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn\u2019t have put up that big chunk of change,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also predicted tariffs would force a manufacturing shift during an April 6 appearance on a CBS news program. \u201cThe army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,\u201d Lutnick said.",
      "But during a 2017 appearance at a conference in China, Cook expressed doubt about whether the U.S. labor pool had enough workers with the vocational skills required to do the painstaking and tedious work that Lutnick was discussing.",
      "\u201cIn the U.S. you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I\u2019m not sure we could fill the room,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIn China, you could fill multiple football fields.\u201d",
      "Trump also tried to pressure Apple, to no avail, into shifting iPhone production to the U.S. during his first term as president. But the administration ultimately exempted the iPhone from the tariffs he imposed on China back then \u2014 a period when Apple had announced a commitment to invest $350 billion in the U.S. Trump's first-term tariffs on China also prompted Apple to begin a process that led to some of its current iPhones being made in India and some of its other products being manufactured in Vietnam.",
      "Cook also took the president on a 2019 tour of a Texas plant where Apple had been assembling some of its Mac computers since 2013. Shortly after finishing that our, Trump took credit for the plant that Apple had opened while Barack Obama was president. \"Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America,\u201d Trump posted on Nov. 19, 2019.",

      "President Donald Trump offered some financial advice on Wednesday morning that ended up making a lot of money for any lucky investor who listened to him",
      "NEW YORK -- When Donald Trump offered some financial advice Wednesday morning, stocks were wavering between gains and losses.",
      "But that was about to change.",
      "\u201cTHIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT,\u201d he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social at 9:37 a.m.",
      "Less than four hours later, Trump announced a 90-day pause on nearly all his tariffs. Stocks soared on the news, closing up 9.5% by the end of trading. The market, measured by the S&P 500, gained back about $4 trillion, or 70%, of the value it had lost over the previous four trading days.",
      "It was a prescient call by the president. Maybe too prescient.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s loving this, this control over markets, but he better be careful,\u201d said Trump critic and former White House ethics lawyer, Richard Painter, noting that securities law prohibits trading on insider information or helping others do so. \u201cThe people who bought when they saw that post made a lot of money.\u201d",
      "The question is, Was Trump already contemplating the tariff pause when he made that post?",
      "Asked about when he arrived at his decision, Trump gave a muddled answer.",
      "\u201cI would say this morning,\" he said. \u201cOver the last few days, I\u2019ve been thinking about it.\u201d",
      "He then added, \u201cFairly early this morning.\u201d",
      "Asked for clarification on the timing in an email to the White House later, a spokesperson didn't answer directly but defended Trump's post as part of his job.",
      "\u201cIt is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security in the face of nonstop media fearmongering,\" wrote White House spokesman Kush Desai.",
      "Another curiosity of the posting was Trump's signoff with his initials.",
      "DJT is also the stock symbol for Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of the president's social media platform Truth Social.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if Trump was saying buying stocks in general, or Trump Media in particular. The White House was asked, but didn\u2019t address that either. Trump includes \u201cDJT\u201d on his posts intermittently, typically to emphasize that he has personally written the message.",
      "The ambiguity about what Trump meant didn't stop people from pouring money into that stock.",
      "Trump Media closed up 22.67%, soaring twice as much as the broader market, a stunning performance by a company that lost $400 million last year and is seemingly unaffected by whether tariffs would be imposed or paused.",
      "Trump\u2019s 53% ownership stake in the company, now in a trust controlled by his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., rose by $415 million on the day.",
      "Trump Media was bested, albeit by only two-hundreds of a percentage point, by another Trump administration stock pick \u2014 Elon Musk's Tesla.",
      "Last month, Trump held an extraordinary news conference outside the White House praising the company and its cars. That was followed by a Fox TV appearance by his commerce secretary urging viewers to buy the stock.",
      "Tesla's surge Wednesday added $20 billion to Musk\u2019s fortunes.",
      "Kathleen Clark, a government ethics law expert at Washington University School of Law, says Trump's post in other administrations would have been investigated, but is not likely not to trigger any reaction, save for maybe more Truth Social viewers.",
      "\u201cHe's sending the message that he can effectively and with impunity manipulate the market,\u201d she said, \u201cAs in: Watch this space for future stock tips.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Microsoft says it's \u201cslowing or pausing\u201d some of data center construction, including a $1 billion project in Ohio",
      "Microsoft said it is \u201cslowing or pausing\u201d some of its data center construction, including a $1 billion project in Ohio, the latest sign that the demand for artificial intelligence technology that drove a massive infrastructure expansion might not need quite as many powerful computers as expected.",
      "The tech giant confirmed this week that it is halting early-stage projects on rural land it owns in central Ohio's Licking County, outside of Columbus, and will reserve two of the three sites for farmland.",
      "\u201cIn recent years, demand for our cloud and AI services grew more than we could have ever anticipated and to meet this opportunity, we began executing the largest and most ambitious infrastructure scaling project in our history,\u201d said Noelle Walsh, the president of Microsoft's cloud operations, in a post on LinkedIn.",
      "Walsh said \u201cany significant new endeavor at this size and scale requires agility and refinement as we learn and grow with our customers. What this means is that we are slowing or pausing some early-stage projects.\u201d",
      "Microsoft didn't say Wednesday what other projects it has slowed outside of Ohio, but in late December it revealed it was pausing the later phases of a large data center project in Wisconsin.",
      "Analysts with TD Cowen reported earlier this year that Microsoft was also scaling back some of its international data center expansion and canceling some leases in the U.S. for use of data centers operated by other companies.",
      "Other analysts for months have tied some of the changes to a shift in Microsoft's close relationship with its business partner OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT.",
      "\u201cOpenAI was moving in one direction\u201d by prioritizing the development of ever-more advanced AI systems, which require vast computing resources to train on troves of data, while \u201cMicrosoft may not have been moving that same direction,\u201d said Craig Ellis, director of research at B. Riley Securities.",
      "The two companies announced on Jan. 21 that they were altering the agreement that had made Microsoft the exclusive provider of OpenAI's computing power, enabling the smaller company to build its own capacity, \u201cprimarily for research and training of models.\u201d It was the same day that newly inaugurated President Donald Trump touted OpenAI's partnership with Oracle and SoftBank to pledge $500 billion in new AI infrastructure in the U.S., starting with a data center in Texas.",
      "Microsoft has long built data centers around the world to run its cloud computing services. The generative AI boom accelerated the demand for such facilities, both to train new AI systems and to keep them running as millions of people start using chatbots and other AI tools at work and home.",
      "The computing it takes to run AI tools is expensive and requires a large amount of electricity \u2014 so much so that Trump this week cited AI needs as part of the justification for using his emergency authorities to boost the U.S. coal industry, a reliable but polluting energy source. Tech companies have also sought to tap into nuclear power, including a proposed Microsoft-backed revival of the shuttered Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, which would feed an electricity grid supplying data centers in Ohio as well as Virginia, the nation's biggest data center hub.",
      "Microsoft said it still plans to spend more than $80 billion globally to expand its AI infrastructure this fiscal year, which ends in June, and has already doubled its data center capacity over the past three years.",
      "\u201cWhile we may strategically pace our plans, we will continue to grow strongly and allocate investments that stay aligned with business priorities and customer demand,\u201d Walsh said.",
      "The Ohio pause nevertheless came as a disappointment to local officials.",
      "Licking County has also attracted data center investments from Microsoft rivals Google and Meta Platforms and a highly anticipated semiconductor factory from Intel, though the struggling chipmaker in February pushed back the expected completion date for the project's first stage to 2030.",

      "Thanks to a mouse watching clips from \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d scientists have created the largest functional map of a brain to date",
      "WASHINGTON -- Thanks to a mouse watching clips from \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d scientists have created the largest functional map of a brain to date \u2013 a diagram of the wiring connecting 84,000 neurons as they fire off messages.",
      "Using a piece of that mouse\u2019s brain about the size of a poppy seed, the researchers identified those neurons and traced how they communicated via branch-like fibers through a surprising 500 million junctions called synapses.",
      "The massive dataset, published Wednesday by the journal Nature, marks a step toward unraveling the mystery of how our brains work. The data, assembled in a 3D reconstruction colored to delineate different brain circuitry, is open to scientists worldwide for additional research \u2013 and for the simply curious to take a peek.",
      "\u201cIt definitely inspires a sense of awe, just like looking at pictures of the galaxies,\u201d said Forrest Collman of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, one of the project\u2019s leading researchers. \u201cYou get a sense of how complicated you are. We\u2019re looking at one tiny part ... of a mouse\u2019s brain and the beauty and complexity that you can see in these actual neurons and the hundreds of millions of connections between them.\u201d",
      "How we think, feel, see, talk and move are due to neurons, or nerve cells, in the brain \u2013 how they\u2019re activated and send messages to each other. Scientists have long known those signals move from one neuron along fibers called axons and dendrites, using synapses to jump to the next neuron. But there\u2019s less known about the networks of neurons that perform certain tasks and how disruptions of that wiring could play a role in Alzheimer's, autism or other disorders.",
      "\u201cYou can make a thousand hypotheses about how brain cells might do their job but you can\u2019t test those hypotheses unless you know perhaps the most fundamental thing \u2013 how are those cells wired together,\u201d said Allen Institute scientist Clay Reid, who helped pioneer electron microscopy to study neural connections.",
      "With the new project, a global team of more than 150 researchers mapped neural connections that Collman compares to tangled pieces of spaghetti winding through part of the mouse brain responsible for vision.",
      "The first step: Show a mouse video snippets of sci-fi movies, sports, animation and nature.",
      "A team at Baylor College of Medicine did just that, using a mouse engineered with a gene that makes its neurons glow when they\u2019re active. The researchers used a laser-powered microscope to record how individual cells in the animal\u2019s visual cortex lit up as they processed the images flashing by.",
      "Next, scientists at the Allen Institute analyzed that small piece of brain tissue, using a special tool to shave it into more than 25,000 layers, each far thinner than a human hair. With electron microscopes, they took nearly 100 million high-resolution images of those sections, illuminating those spaghetti-like fibers and painstakingly reassembling the data in 3D.",
      "Finally, Princeton University scientists used artificial intelligence to trace all that wiring and \u201cpaint each of the individual wires a different color so that we can identify them individually,\u201d Collman explained.",
      "They estimated that microscopic wiring, if laid out, would measure more than 3 miles (5 kilometers). Importantly, matching up all that anatomy with the activity in the mouse's brain as it watched movies allowed researchers to trace how the circuitry worked.",
      "The Princeton researchers also created digital 3D copies of the data that other scientists can use in developing new studies.",
      "Could this kind of mapping help scientists eventually find treatments for brain diseases? The researchers call it a foundational step, like how the Human Genome Project that provided the first gene mapping eventually led to gene-based treatments. Mapping a full mouse brain is one next goal.",
      "\u201cThe technologies developed by this project will give us our first chance to really identify some kind of abnormal pattern of connectivity that gives rise to a disorder,\u201d another of the project's leading researchers, Princeton neuroscientist and computer scientist Sebastian Seung, said in a statement.",
      "The work \u201cmarks a major leap forwards and offers an invaluable community resource for future discoveries,\u201d wrote Harvard neuroscientists Mariela Petkova and Gregor Schuhknecht, who weren\u2019t involved in the project.",
      "The huge and publicly shared data \u201cwill help to unravel the complex neural networks underlying cognition and behavior,\u201d they added.",

      "China became the first country to land on the moon\u2019s far side last year. The Chang\u2019e 6 spacecraft scooped up the volcanic rock and dirt from the ancient, sprawling South Pole-Aitken basin, one of the largest impact craters in the solar system.",
      "The Chinese Academy of Sciences\u2019 Sen Hu said he and his team received 5 grams of soil samples, then selected 578 particles for detailed analysis using electron microscopes.",
      "They estimated the water abundance at less than 1.5 micrograms per gram, on the dry end of what\u2019s been found in samples gathered over past decades from the moon\u2019s near side. Measurements on samples from the near side have ranged between 1 microgram and 200 micrograms per gram.",
      "Given the limited sampling, it\u2019s uncertain how widespread this dry condition might be, the scientists noted in their study published in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cMore far side samples are required for testing and further unraveling\" how much water there is, Hu said in an email.",
      "It\u2019s possible the impact that created this basin may have blasted water elements to the near side, leaving the far side depleted. Another possibility is that the vertical distribution of water could be different between the two hemispheres.",

This frozen water could be used for drinking, cooking and making rocket fuel.",

      "A Columbia University student who co-founded, with Mahmoud Khalil, a university organization called Palestinian Student Union was arrested Monday by Department of Homeland Security agents, his attorney told ABC News.",
      "Mohsen Mahdawi, a permanent resident of the U.S., was arrested and detained after attending his naturalization interview in Vermont.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Sessions subsequently granted Mahdawi's attorneys a temporary restraining order barring the government from moving Mahdawi out of District of Vermont \"pending further order\" from the court.",
      "At Columbia University, Mahdawi was an \"outspoken critic of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and an activist and organizer in student protests on Columbia's campus until March of 2024, after which he took a step back and has not been involved in organizing,\" according to a habeas petition obtained by ABC News.",
      "Mahdawi's attorneys called his arrest \"unlawful\" and said it violates the First Amendment.",

      "According to his habeas petition, Mahdawi was born and raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank, until 2014 when he moved to the United States. He has been a legal resident for the last 10 years and is expected to graduate from Columbia next month.",

      "Khalil, a green card holder and permanent legal resident who is married to an American citizen, was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at his Columbia housing in March after helping lead protests at Columbia over the war in Gaza.

      "Some of the Democratic Party\u2019s core political groups are preparing for the possibility that President Donald Trump\u2019s allies may soon launch criminal investigations that could handicap Democratic infrastructure",
      "NEW YORK -- As President Donald Trump pushes the historical boundaries of executive power, some of the Democratic Party's core political institutions are preparing for the possibility that the federal government may soon launch criminal investigations against them.",
      "The Democrats' dominant national fundraising platform, ActBlue, and the party's largest protest group, Indivisible, are working with their attorneys for just such a scenario, according to officials within both organizations. Trump's top political allies have suggested both groups should face prosecution.",
      "Other Democratic allies are planning for Trump-backed legal crackdowns as well. Wary of antagonizing the president, most prefer to stay anonymous for now.",
      "\u201cEvery one of our clients is concerned about being arbitrarily targeted by the Trump administration. We are going to great lengths to help clients prepare for or defend themselves,\" said Ezra Reese, political law chair at Elias Law Group, which represents Democratic groups and candidates and is chaired by Marc Elias, the lawyer who has himself been a Trump target.",
      "An FBI spokesperson declined to comment when asked about potential investigations into ActBlue and Indivisible. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not downplay the threat of a potential criminal probe when asked specifically whether Trump wants the FBI, the Treasury Department or any other federal agency to investigate Democratic groups.",
      "\u201cAnyone who has (not) broken the law should not be worried,\" Leavitt told The Associated Press. \"If you have broken the law and engaged in the weaponization of justice, then you should be worried. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d",
      "Indeed, far from distancing themselves from talk of retribution, many key Republicans are embracing it.",
      "Trump's allies argue they are justified in seeking vengeance due to the four criminal prosecutions against Trump, one of which led to multiple felony convictions in New York. There's no evidence former President Joe Biden influenced the Trump prosecutions in any way.",
      "Matt Schlapp, president of the American Conservative Union, said Democrats needed to be taught not to touch a hot stove.",
      "\u201cSomeone needs to get burned for all this activity or they\u2019re just gonna do it again,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not hypocrisy; that\u2019s justice.\u201d",
      "Trump has made no secret of his plans to use the power of the federal government to target domestic political adversaries.",
      "During a norm-breaking speech at the Department of Justice last month, Trump cast himself as the country\u2019s \u201cchief law enforcement officer,\u201d a title ordinarily reserved for the attorney general.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order instructing the Justice Department to investigate Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official who anonymously penned a book highly critical of his first presidency. Trump said that Taylor was likely guilty of treason, a crime that can carry the death penalty.",
      "Indivisible has been perhaps the most important group in the Democratic resistance since Trump returned to the White House. The group\u2019s leadership in Washington holds regular calls with state-based activists and recently released a detailed protest guide, which offers specific guidance to hundreds of local chapters across the country.",
      "This year alone, Indivisible groups have hosted more than 1,000 protests covering every state in the nation. The group was a key organizer in the recent Hands Off! protests that attracted hundreds of thousands of people across the country.",
      "Trump top adviser and billionaire Elon Musk has publicly condemned Indivisible as \u201ccriminals.\u201d",
      "The statement was an apparent reference to violent attacks against Tesla dealerships and vehicles, which have spiked in recent weeks. Indivisible\u2019s leadership released a guide earlier in the year encouraging protests outside Tesla dealerships, although the guide instructs protesters to remain peaceful and stay off private property.",
      "No charges are known to have been filed against Indivisible or its leaders. But Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin says it\u2019s critical that Democratic institutions work together to speak out against the threats posed by the Trump administration. His organization has been discussing contingency plans with attorneys and other activists in the event that he or other Indivisible leaders face criminal charges.",
      "\u201cThey may try to come at us directly, or it\u2019s as likely that their non-state actors are inspired by their lies and propaganda, and try to come at us individually,\u201d Levin said. \u201cAnd that is a risk in a moment where you\u2019re facing anti-democratic threats like we are.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur choice is, we can be quiet and hope that they won\u2019t target us, or we can try to work as a mass opposition,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to do that, what are you doing here?\u201d",
      "Musk, backed by several Republican members of Congress, has also called on the FBI to investigate ActBlue, alleging that the Democratic Party's main fundraising platform has skirted campaign finance laws and allowed foreign nationals to make illegal contributions to Democratic candidates.",
      "\u201cI think the FBI\u2019s going to do something on ActBlue soon,\u201d Charlie Kirk, a key Trump ally who founded the conservative group Turning Point USA, said at a political event last month in Wisconsin.",
      "ActBlue officials this week told the AP that they would continue to cooperate with a congressional investigation led by House Republicans into allegations of fraud within the organization. ActBlue is preparing a second batch of documents to comply with a new request by House Republicans. Additionally, two ActBlue staffers are expected to testify before a House panel behind closed doors later this month.",
      "Multiple House Republicans in recent weeks have encouraged federal law enforcement agencies to pursue requested criminal investigations into ActBlue.",
      "Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., has asked the Treasury Department to investigate allegations that the nonprofit processed payments to \u201cterror-linked organizations.\u201d Separately, Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., sent a letter to the FBI last month claiming that ActBlue is being used to \u201cto skirt the integrity of federal campaign finance laws\u201d by allowing foreign nationals to contribute to campaigns, among other allegations of criminal wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cIt must be emphasized that these allegations, were they to prove true, would indicate a serious threat to the integrity of our elections, besides the victimization of American citizens,\u201d Biggs wrote.",
      "ActBlue said it is preparing for the possibility of \u201cmany different attacks on various fronts,\u201d including investigations by the FBI or the Treasury Department.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic candidates are relying on ActBlue to fund their campaigns as never before.",
      "Donors have given more than $400 million to Democratic candidates through ActBlue over the first three months of the year, the organization told the AP. The fundraising haul represents the most money raised in any first quarter in ActBlue's two-decade history.",
      "While Republicans accuse the group of being funded by wealthy donors, ActBlue acts as a passthrough between donors and candidates that's funded by a 3.95% processing fee on each donation.",
      "\u201cThese unfounded attacks haven\u2019t shaken us \u2014 they\u2019ve sharpened our resolve to fuel Democratic wins,\" ActBlue spokesperson Megan Hughes said. \"As our first-quarter fundraising demonstrates, Democratic grassroots donors are engaged, undeterred and ready to meet this moment.\u201d",
      "Leavitt is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the AP on First- and Fifth Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.",

    "summary": "A new Democrat-sponsored bill seeks ethics checks on special government employees in the wake of Elon Musk's government influence.",
    "story": [
      "The bill addresses concerns spurred by Elon Musk's government influence.",
      "A new legislative push led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., is seeking to bar special government employees like tech billionaire and senior Trump adviser Elon Musk from communicating with government agencies that interface with their companies, and would require federal employees like Musk to meet new ethics requirements.",
      "Warren and Stansbury introduced a bill this week in the Senate and House, respectively, that would prevent special government employees (SGEs) like Musk \u2013 who lead companies worth $1 billion or more \u2013 from interacting with federal agencies that interface with his companies.",
      "SpaceX and Tesla together have received billions of dollars in government contracts over the past ten years.",
      "While the legislation introduced by Warren and Stansbury does not mention Musk or his companies by name, Musk\u2019s proximity to Trump in the early days of Trump\u2019s second term has made him a clear target of Democrats who have been outspoken about their opposition to Musk\u2019s key role in orchestrating massive cuts to the federal government, with little input from lawmakers.",
      "The bill, titled the SGE Ethics Enforcement & Reform (SEER) Act of 2025, would create what the lawmakers are calling a \u201cbright-line rule\u201d that makes new provisions explicitly applicable to owners of a \u201clarge company,\u201d which the bill defines as any for-profit company making over $1 billion.",
      "Democrats, including Warren, have also raised concerns that Musk\u2019s companies could be unfairly benefitting from Musk\u2019s influence over Trump\u2019s policies.",
      "Since 2015, Musk's companies SpaceX and Tesla have been awarded at least $24 billion in federal contracts, according to government spending data and public announcements. SpaceX has won nearly $23 million worth of contracts, which includes nearly $6 million that the Space Force recently awarded SpaceX for launch missions.",
      "\u201cNo special Government employee, as defined in section 202 of title 18, United States 23 Code, who is not on an advisory committee or a chair or vice chair on an advisory committee may have direct or indirect communications in their official capacity with an agency or office that contracts with, regulates, or has a pending enforcement action against a large company \u2013 (1) that the special Government employee owns; or (2) for which the special Government employee serves as a senior executive or director,\u201d the bill reads.",
      "The new bill would also implement a new requirement for government employees designated as \u201cspecial government employees\u201d to resolve conflicts of interest between their private-sector and governmental work during their service.",
      "Unlike other cabinet and high-level positions that are subject to congressional scrutiny via the Senate confirmation process, Musk, in his advisory role, is designated a \u201cspecial government employee,\u201d a status Congress created in 1962 for temporary executive branch hires to perform limited duties for no more than 130 days.",
      "\u201cUnelected billionaire Elon Musk should not be acting as co-president of the United States and making $8 million a day from government contracts while he\u2019s at it. My new bill would crack down on conflicts of interest and create stronger ethics rules for Elon Musk and all Special Government Employees. Government should work for the American people, not billionaires lining their own pockets,\u201d Sen. Warren said in a statement provided to ABC News.",
      "Those working for the government as special government employees are not paid by the federal government and can continue to collect payment from outside entities while performing their work for the government, which Warren and Stansbury say runs the risk of creating possible conflicts of interest.",
      "The legislation aims to address those concerns by applying the same standard ethics rules that apply to regular federal employees to special government employees after they render 60 days of government service. These rules guide federal employees to avoid using their office for personal gain, to steer clear of conflicting financial interest, to maintain impartiality, to avoid outside activity or employment that could raise conflict of interest questions, and more.",
      "The new legislation would also apply tougher scrutiny to the process of acquiring a conflict of interest waiver for this kind of work.",
      "Musk has appeared alongside Trump as recently as Thursday, when he was present at a Cabinet meeting at the White House.",
      "ABC News has previously reported that Musk could be taking a step back from his current role in the administration. His term would be up around the end of May but it had been widely rumored that the White House could take steps to keep him on or extend his employment status in some way.",
      "\u201cElon has done a fantastic job. Look, he's sitting here, and I don't care. I don't need Elon for anything other than I happen to like him,\u201d Trump told reporters during the meeting.",
      "Trump has acknowledged that Musk will eventually need to return to Tesla to run the company. However, when reports that Musk could depart the White House in May surfaced, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt refuted them.",
      "\u201cElon Musk and President Trump have both publicly stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at [the Department of Government Efficiency] is complete,\" Leavitt said earlier this month.",
      "The bill introduced by Warren and Stansbury faces an uncertain future on Capitol Hill. It does not currently have a Republican co-sponsor and it\u2019s unlikely to get the GOP support it would need to move through either chamber of the Republican-controlled Congress. Many Republicans have praised Musk\u2019s efforts to slash federal spending and have remained hesitant to criticize Musk\u2019s work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).",
      "Still, the bill comes as Democrats are looking to demonstrate that they are fighting against the Trump agenda on all fronts. Warren has been particularly focused on the Musk-led effort to dismantle federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that she was instrumental in creating.",

      "A retrial is set to begin for Sarah Palin's lawsuit accusing The New York Times of libeling her in an editorial eight years ago",
      "NEW YORK -- A retrial is set to begin Monday for Sarah Palin\u2019s libel lawsuit claiming The New York Times libeled her in an editorial eight years ago.",
      "The onetime Republican vice presidential candidate and ex-governor of Alaska gets another chance to prove to a federal jury that the newspaper defamed her with the 2017 editorial falsely linking her campaign rhetoric to a mass shooting. Palin said it damaged her reputation and career.",
      "The Times has acknowledged the editorial was inaccurate but said it quickly corrected an \u201chonest mistake.\u201d",
      "The trial, expected to last a week, comes after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals restored the case last year. Jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday morning.",
      "In February 2022, Judge Jed S. Rakoff in Manhattan rejected Palin's claims in a ruling issued while a jury deliberated. The judge then let jurors deliver their verdict, which went against Palin.",
      "In restoring the lawsuit, the 2nd Circuit said Rakoff's dismissal ruling improperly intruded on the jury's work. It also cited flaws in the trial, saying there was erroneous exclusion of evidence, an inaccurate jury instruction and an erroneous response to a question from the jury.",
      "The retrial occurs as President Donald Trump and others in agreement with his views of news coverage have been aggressive toward media outlets when they believe there has been unjust treatment.",
      "Trump sued CBS News for $20 billion over the editing of a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with his 2024 opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and also sued the Des Moines Register over an Iowa election poll that turned out to be inaccurate. ABC News settled a lawsuit with Trump over its incorrect claim the president had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "Kenneth G. Turkel, a lawyer for Palin, did not return a request for comment.",
      "Charlie Stadtlander, a spokesperson for the Times, said Palin's claim stemmed from \u201ca passing reference to an event in an editorial that was not about Sarah Palin.\u201d",
      "\"That reference was an unintended error, and quickly corrected. We\u2019re confident we will prevail and intend to vigorously defend the case,\u201d Stadtlander said in a statement.",

      "Among other things, the report also said that the president passed his Montreal Cognitive Assessment with a perfect score of 30 out of 30, the same score he received on that assessment in 2018. He was also screened for depression and anxiety and had \u201cscores within the normal range for both,\u201d the report stated.",

    "summary": "Lutnick said on \"This Week\" administration's exemptions on electronic devices from tariffs is temporary, with \"semiconductor tariffs\" likely come in \"a month or two.\"",
    "story": [
      "Lutnick said \"semiconductor tariffs\" will likely come in \"a month or two.\"",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the administration's decision Friday night to exempt a range of electronic devices from tariffs implemented earlier this month was only a temporary reprieve, with the secretary announcing that those items would be subject to \"semiconductor tariffs\" that will likely come in \"a month or two.\"",
      "\"All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they're going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored. We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels -- we need to have these things made in America. We can't be reliant on Southeast Asia for all of the things that operate for us,\" Lutnick told \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl.",
      "He continued, \"So what [President Donald Trump's] doing is he's saying they're exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they're included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two. So these are coming soon.\"",
      "The administration's clarification comes after a U.S. Customs and Border Protection bulletin was posted Friday night outlining key electronics -- smartphones, computers, solar cells, flat-panel TV displays and semiconductor-based storage devices, among others -- would be exempt from the tariffs announced since April 2. That meant those products would not be subject to steep tariffs on Chinese imports, nor the global 10% tariff rate President Donald Trump had imposed.",
      "Lutnick said on \"This Week\" that the White House will implement \"a tariff model in order to encourage\" the semiconductor industry, as well as the pharmaceutical industry, to move its business to the United States.",
      "\"We can't be beholden and rely upon foreign countries for fundamental things that we need,\" he said. \"So this is not like a permanent sort of exemption. He's just clarifying that these are not available to be negotiated away by countries. These are things that are national security that we need to be made in America.\"",
      "Here are more highlights from Lutnick's interview",
      "On the status of tariff negotiations with China",
      "Lutnick: I think we've had soft -- uh, the way I would say it is, is \"soft entrees,\" you know, through intermediaries and those kind of comments. But we all expect that the president of the United States and, and President Xi of China will work this out. I am completely confident, as is [Trump], that this will be worked out in a positive, thoughtful and effective way for the United States of America. I mean, Donald Trump has the ball. I want him to have it. He's the right person with it. He knows how to play this game. He knows how to deal with President Xi. This is the right person for the right role, and I am confident this is going to work out with China. Yes, is it in a tough spot now, of course it is, but that'll -- you'll see. All of that energy will sort of decline and will end up in a perfectly reasonable place with China. I'm confident of it.",
      "On VP JD Vance referring to Chinese people as 'peasants'",
      "In a Fox News interview earlier this month, Vance said, \"We borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things that those Chinese peasants manufacture.\"",
      "Karl: Did the vice president go off message there? ... I mean, I haven't heard Donald Trump talk that way about the Chinese.",
      "Lutnick: I'm just going to step back and really just leave the vice president to let him defend himself. He knows what he meant, and we all know what he meant, which is that, you know, the Chinese have basically attacked America and ripped us off by, by undercutting our businesses. The government of China assists their businesses to undercut our businesses, drive them out of business and take that manufacturing over to China. It's happened in pharmaceuticals. It's happened in so many industries. ... Imagine if the government of America, the United States of America, was backing your business? I mean, you'd be a killer in the world. So that's what the Chinese have been doing. And finally, Donald Trump is standing up to it.",
      "On Trump saying there would be 'a transition cost and transition problems' with tariffs",
      "Karl: This is going to mean higher prices, isn't it?",
      "Lutnick: I don't necessarily think so. I think the idea is that we can manufacture here in America. As I said, there's a, I saw Panasonic, you know, the battery company, right, Japanese company. They built an amazing factory in Kansas, which they're opening now. ...That is what's coming back to America. You're going to see that production, that, that kind of high tech factor is going to produce things here at very reasonable prices. So I think this is going to work out.\"",
      "On the constitutionality of Trump imposing tariffs",
      "Karl: The Constitution -- Article I, Section 8 -- makes it very clear that Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises.... The president has cited this 1977 emergency law that doesn't mention tariffs. So how concerned are you and are you prepared to defend this in court?",
      "Lutnick: The president knows the law. The president's general counsels know the law. They understand this that Congress has passed laws that gave the president the ability to protect our national security. We need to make medicine in America. If you don't think that's national security, you're not thinking it through. We need to make semiconductors in America. We need steel and aluminum in America. We need to manufacture in America. If we just run gigantic trade deficits and sell our soul to the rest of the world, eventually, we are going to be the worker for the rest of the world. We're going to be the thinker for the rest of the world that they're going to manufacture, and if someday they say, \"Gee, we're not sending it to you,\" we'll be nothing. So I think the president has national security in mind, and he's here to protect America.",

    "story": [
      "Books on race and gender were taken out of circulation at the Naval Academy.",
      "At the U.S. Naval Academy, it's not what's on the shelves that's drawing attention -- but what's missing.",
      "The institution's Nimitz Library has been stripped of 381 titles, according to a list first published in the New York Times, including works exploring race, gender, and national identity.",
      "The culling includes \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" by Maya Angelou, \"How to Be an Antiracist\" by Ibram X. Kendi, \"Bodies in Doubt\" by Elizabeth Reis, and \"White Rage\" by Carol Anderson. None was banned outright -- just rendered \"not immediately available,\" a Naval Academy spokesman, Cmdr. Tim Hawkins, said. The books, he said, had been placed in a room where patrons could no longer access them.",
      "President Donald Trump's Jan. 29 executive order titled \"Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling\" has been extended to cover the country's military academies. With language targeting what it called \"discriminatory equity ideology\" and \"gender ideology\" -- which he later called \"the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies\" -- the order set in motion extensive removals, reviews and institutional confusion.",
      "\"There isn't any clear criteria,\" Katherine Kuzminski, director of Studies at the Center for a New American Security, told ABC News. \"It leaves leadership scrambling -- how do we ensure compliance without being accused of overcorrecting?\"",
      "Kuzminski said military leaders, bound by a strict code to obey lawful orders, are grappling with what she called the ambiguity of the policy. \"Particularly in the Air Force,\" she noted, \"when the Tuskegee Airmen learning module was removed from basic training for a few days, leadership was trying to follow through with the best of intentions.\"",
      "Department of the Navy leadership determined which books required removal at the Naval Academy library, Hawkins told ABC News.",
      "Initially, officials searched the Nimitz Library catalog, using key word searches, to identify books that required further review, Hawkins said. Approximately 900 books were identified during the preliminary search, he said, and department officials then closely examined the preliminary list to determine which books required removal to comply with directives outlined in executive orders issued by the president.",
      "That ultimately resulted in nearly 400 books being selected for removal from the Nimitz Library collection, he said.",
      "Historians and former military officials told ABC News the implications are chilling. Richard Kohn, a military historian and former chief historian for the Air Force, sees the move as a \"cleansing\" effort. \"It reveals a certain kind of weakness in the current administration's confidence,\" he said. \"They're determined to appeal to their MAGA constituency by rolling back decades of progress on race, religion, and diversity.\"",
      "For Kohn, removing these books from the shelves sends a clear message to cadets: To get ahead in the military, avoid certain ideas.",
      "Retired U.S. Air Force Col. Thomas Keaney, a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced international Studies, spoke about how far the academies have come -- and how far he said they risk falling back. \"When I was there,\" he said, \"it was a whites-only institution,\" he said of the U.S. Air Force Academy. \"It was the poorer for it.\" Education, he insisted, is about exposure. \"You are not harming people by letting them read,\" he said.",
      "In a letter to the secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Democratic Reps. Adam Smith and Chrissy Houlahan called the book removals \"a blatant attack on the First Amendment\" and \"an alarming return to McCarthy-era censorship.\"",
      "They demanded to know who ordered the removals, the process used and which titles were being purged, while urging an immediate halt.",
      "The academies have issued carefully worded responses -- or none at all -- when asked by ABC News for comment.",
      "The U.S. Merchant Marine Academy did not respond to repeated requests. The U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy and U.S. Coast Guard Academy issued brief statements affirming compliance with executive orders but offered few specifics.",
      "\u201cThe Coast Guard Academy is conducting a comprehensive review of its curriculum to ensure compliance with all executive orders,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "The U.S. Naval Academy spokesman confirmed that \"nearly 400 books\" had been removed from its Nimitz Library, explaining the move as an effort \"to ensure compliance with all directives outlined in Executive Orders issued by the President.\"",
      "He emphasized what he called the library's robust collection -- some 590,000 print books and thousands of academic resources -- framing the book removals as minor compared to the size of the overall collection. \"The Naval Academy's mission,\" the spokesperson added, \"is to develop Midshipmen morally, mentally and physically ... to prepare them for careers of service to our country.\"",
      "At the U.S. Air Force Academy, a spokesperson noted that a curriculum review was underway \"to ensure our compliance with executive orders.\"",
      "But outside voices in military academic circles warned that the issue goes beyond compliance, saying it strikes at the core of intellectual development.",
      "\"You can't make ideas safe for people, but you can make people safe for ideas,\" said Kohn, who specializes in civil-military relations. \"If you don't mentor students in the academies to understand what's going on in American society, you don't really educate them.\"",
      "Keaney, the former U.S. Air Force officer, was more circumspect but equally concerned. \"I don't think anyone is going to be hurt by reading anything -- however nutty or outside their own culture it is,\" he said. \"You're not harming people by exposing them to ideas. On the contrary, you're training them to be discerning leaders. Give them a chance. Don't leave them to deal from ignorance.\"",

      "Lawyers for the driver charged with killing NHL hockey player Johnny Gaudreau and his brother, Matthew, are expected to argue in court Tuesday that the brothers contributed to the fatal crash by cycling while impaired.",
      "According to the defense, the Gaudreaus had blood-alcohol levels of .129 or above, higher than the .08 legal limit in New Jersey and the .087 that police recorded for Sean Higgins. They hope to have the manslaughter and vehicular homicide charges reduced or dismissed.",
      "However, Salem County prosecutors note that there is no law banning cycling while intoxicated in New Jersey, and that witnesses said the brothers were riding single-file on the edge of the rural road, not weaving into traffic. Prosecutors have accused Higgins of being impaired by alcohol and fueled by road rage when he ran into them.",
      "\u201cThere are four witnesses that witnessed the defendant speeding and illegally passing the Bronco on the right when he struck the brothers. The witnesses also saw the brothers riding single file, with the flow of traffic, on the fog line just prior to being struck by the defendant,\u201d Assistant Prosecutor Michael Mestern wrote this month in asking the judge to exclude the defense\u2019s \u201ccontributory negligence\u201d theory at trial.",
      "He said there was \u201cno credible argument\u201d that would make the cyclists' intoxication levels relevant.",
      "The Gaudreaus were bicycling near their hometown in southern New Jersey on the eve of their sister\u2019s wedding on Aug. 29. Both of their wives have since given birth to sons. Johnny Gaudreau's widow, Meredith, gave birth to their third child on April 1. The sister's wedding was postponed until this summer.",
      "Johnny Gaudreau, known as \u201cJohnny Hockey,\u201d played 10 full seasons in the NHL and was set to start his third with the Columbus Blue Jackets. He played his first eight seasons with the Calgary Flames.",
      "Higgins, 44, of nearby Woodstown, New Jersey, is charged with two counts each of aggravated manslaughter and reckless vehicular homicide, along with evidence tampering and leaving the scene of an accident. He was found beside his damaged vehicle about a quarter mile from the scene.",
      "A combat veteran and married father of two who worked for an addiction treatment company, he told police he had consumed about a half-dozen beers that day, some while driving, after an upsetting phone call with his mother.",
      "He faces a maximum 70 years in prison if convicted on all counts. His lawyers have rejected a plea offer of 35 years, arguing that defendants in comparable cases received far less time. The defense also wants to review the laboratory testing methods.",
      "\u201cMr. Higgins is not demanding to be treated differently than any other but rather is respectfully requesting that the presentation of the charges against him be full, complete and transparent,\" defense lawyer Matthew Portella wrote in a motion to dismiss the indictment.",
      "The hearing is set to take place before Superior Court Judge Michael Silvanio. It's not clear if he will rule from the bench.",

    "story": [
      "Jury selection is set to begin Tuesday in Harvey Weinstein's retrial in New York",
      "NEW YORK -- The last time a New York City jury sat in judgment of Harvey Weinstein, the ex-movie studio boss was convicted of rape and sentenced to 23 years in prison.",
      "Five years later, that landmark #MeToo verdict is gone \u2014 wiped away on appeal \u2014 and Weinstein is set to go on trial again, beginning Tuesday with jury selection.",
      "New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, overturned Weinstein\u2019s conviction and ordered a new trial, finding that his original one in 2020 was tainted by improper rulings and prejudicial testimony. That ruling gave Weinstein a second chance to fight the charges, and do so in a different atmosphere than his first trial, which was held in the middle of a global reckoning over sexual misconduct.",
      "Weinstein, who has pleaded not guilty and denies that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone, is older and more frail, in and out of the hospital regularly for a variety of health problems. He's now far removed from the time when he was among the most powerful men in the movie business.",
      "And even if he is acquitted, he will not walk free.",
      "Weinstein is also appealing a 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, though his lawyers said he needs to be resentenced because the since-vacated New York conviction was a factor in how his punishment was calculated.",
      "In the New York retrial, Judge Curtis Farber has set aside at least four days for jury selection and expects opening statements and the start of testimony next week.",
      "The judge, prosecution and defense will work to whittle a massive pool of potential jurors down to the 18 people \u2014 12 jurors and six alternates \u2014 needed for the trial by asking questions and seeking to eliminate anyone they feel can\u2019t judge the case fairly.",
      "Weinstein, 73, is being retried on two charges from his original trial. He is accused of raping an aspiring actor in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and performing a criminal sex act by forcing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006. He is also charged with one count of criminal sex act based on an allegation from a woman who was not a part of the original trial. That woman, who has not been named publicly, alleges Weinstein forced oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel.",
      "Selecting a jury will involve bringing in around 80 potential jurors at a time for two basic screening questions.",
      "First, the judge will ask for a show of hands from anyone who has work, family or other obligations that will prevent them from serving. Then, he\u2019ll ask for a show of hands from anyone who feels they can\u2019t be impartial based on the nature of the charges or news coverage.",
      "Anyone who raises a hand will be sent home, Farber has said.",
      "Those who remain will be seated in or near the jury box, 24 at a time, and asked additional questions about things like their education, work, and whether anyone they know is in law enforcement or has been a victim of a crime.",
      "Prosecutors and Weinstein\u2019s lawyers will then each have 40 minutes to ask questions to each subset of 24 potential jurors. Often, lawyers will use that time to follow up on things raised in earlier questioning or to zero in on concerns about potential biases.",
      "Either side can ask the judge to dismiss a potential juror. If too many jurors are dismissed, another group will be brought in and the process will repeat until the full jury is seated.",

      "Some of the Democratic Party\u2019s core political groups are preparing for the possibility that President Donald Trump\u2019s allies may soon launch criminal investigations that could handicap Democratic infrastructure",
      "NEW YORK -- As President Donald Trump pushes the historical boundaries of executive power, some of the Democratic Party's core political institutions are preparing for the possibility that the federal government may soon launch criminal investigations against them.",
      "The Democrats' dominant national fundraising platform, ActBlue, and the party's largest protest group, Indivisible, are working with their attorneys for just such a scenario, according to officials within both organizations. Trump's top political allies have suggested both groups should face prosecution.",
      "Other Democratic allies are planning for Trump-backed legal crackdowns as well. Wary of antagonizing the president, most prefer to stay anonymous for now.",
      "\u201cEvery one of our clients is concerned about being arbitrarily targeted by the Trump administration. We are going to great lengths to help clients prepare for or defend themselves,\" said Ezra Reese, political law chair at Elias Law Group, which represents Democratic groups and candidates and is chaired by Marc Elias, the lawyer who has himself been a Trump target.",
      "An FBI spokesperson declined to comment when asked about potential investigations into ActBlue and Indivisible. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not downplay the threat of a potential criminal probe when asked specifically whether Trump wants the FBI, the Treasury Department or any other federal agency to investigate Democratic groups.",
      "\u201cAnyone who has (not) broken the law should not be worried,\" Leavitt told The Associated Press. \"If you have broken the law and engaged in the weaponization of justice, then you should be worried. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d",
      "Indeed, far from distancing themselves from talk of retribution, many key Republicans are embracing it.",
      "Trump's allies argue they are justified in seeking vengeance due to the four criminal prosecutions against Trump, one of which led to multiple felony convictions in New York. There's no evidence former President Joe Biden influenced the Trump prosecutions in any way.",
      "Matt Schlapp, president of the American Conservative Union, said Democrats needed to be taught not to touch a hot stove.",
      "\u201cSomeone needs to get burned for all this activity or they\u2019re just gonna do it again,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not hypocrisy; that\u2019s justice.\u201d",
      "Trump has made no secret of his plans to use the power of the federal government to target domestic political adversaries.",
      "During a norm-breaking speech at the Department of Justice last month, Trump cast himself as the country\u2019s \u201cchief law enforcement officer,\u201d a title ordinarily reserved for the attorney general.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order instructing the Justice Department to investigate Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official who anonymously penned a book highly critical of his first presidency. Trump said that Taylor was likely guilty of treason, a crime that can carry the death penalty.",
      "Indivisible has been perhaps the most important group in the Democratic resistance since Trump returned to the White House. The group\u2019s leadership in Washington holds regular calls with state-based activists and recently released a detailed protest guide, which offers specific guidance to hundreds of local chapters across the country.",
      "This year alone, Indivisible groups have hosted more than 1,000 protests covering every state in the nation. The group was a key organizer in the recent Hands Off! protests that attracted hundreds of thousands of people across the country.",
      "Trump top adviser and billionaire Elon Musk has publicly condemned Indivisible as \u201ccriminals.\u201d",
      "The statement was an apparent reference to violent attacks against Tesla dealerships and vehicles, which have spiked in recent weeks. Indivisible\u2019s leadership released a guide earlier in the year encouraging protests outside Tesla dealerships, although the guide instructs protesters to remain peaceful and stay off private property.",
      "No charges are known to have been filed against Indivisible or its leaders. But Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin says it\u2019s critical that Democratic institutions work together to speak out against the threats posed by the Trump administration. His organization has been discussing contingency plans with attorneys and other activists in the event that he or other Indivisible leaders face criminal charges.",
      "\u201cThey may try to come at us directly, or it\u2019s as likely that their non-state actors are inspired by their lies and propaganda, and try to come at us individually,\u201d Levin said. \u201cAnd that is a risk in a moment where you\u2019re facing anti-democratic threats like we are.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur choice is, we can be quiet and hope that they won\u2019t target us, or we can try to work as a mass opposition,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to do that, what are you doing here?\u201d",
      "Musk, backed by several Republican members of Congress, has also called on the FBI to investigate ActBlue, alleging that the Democratic Party's main fundraising platform has skirted campaign finance laws and allowed foreign nationals to make illegal contributions to Democratic candidates.",
      "\u201cI think the FBI\u2019s going to do something on ActBlue soon,\u201d Charlie Kirk, a key Trump ally who founded the conservative group Turning Point USA, said at a political event last month in Wisconsin.",
      "ActBlue officials this week told the AP that they would continue to cooperate with a congressional investigation led by House Republicans into allegations of fraud within the organization. ActBlue is preparing a second batch of documents to comply with a new request by House Republicans. Additionally, two ActBlue staffers are expected to testify before a House panel behind closed doors later this month.",
      "Multiple House Republicans in recent weeks have encouraged federal law enforcement agencies to pursue requested criminal investigations into ActBlue.",
      "Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., has asked the Treasury Department to investigate allegations that the nonprofit processed payments to \u201cterror-linked organizations.\u201d Separately, Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., sent a letter to the FBI last month claiming that ActBlue is being used to \u201cto skirt the integrity of federal campaign finance laws\u201d by allowing foreign nationals to contribute to campaigns, among other allegations of criminal wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cIt must be emphasized that these allegations, were they to prove true, would indicate a serious threat to the integrity of our elections, besides the victimization of American citizens,\u201d Biggs wrote.",
      "ActBlue said it is preparing for the possibility of \u201cmany different attacks on various fronts,\u201d including investigations by the FBI or the Treasury Department.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic candidates are relying on ActBlue to fund their campaigns as never before.",
      "Donors have given more than $400 million to Democratic candidates through ActBlue over the first three months of the year, the organization told the AP. The fundraising haul represents the most money raised in any first quarter in ActBlue's two-decade history.",
      "While Republicans accuse the group of being funded by wealthy donors, ActBlue acts as a passthrough between donors and candidates that's funded by a 3.95% processing fee on each donation.",
      "\u201cThese unfounded attacks haven\u2019t shaken us \u2014 they\u2019ve sharpened our resolve to fuel Democratic wins,\" ActBlue spokesperson Megan Hughes said. \"As our first-quarter fundraising demonstrates, Democratic grassroots donors are engaged, undeterred and ready to meet this moment.\u201d",
      "Leavitt is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from the AP on First- and Fifth Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.",

      "New York Helicopter Tours' sightseeing helicopter broke apart in midair and plunged into the Hudson River Thursday, killing five tourists from Spain and the pilot.",
      "Rocheleau said the agency also began a comprehensive review of the company\u2019s operations. The review is designed to determine whether an operator complies with regulations and effectively manages safety, and identifies hazards and risks.",
      "The victims included passengers Agustin Escobar, 49, his wife, Merc\u00e8 Camprub\u00ed Montal, 39, and their three children, Victor, 4, Mercedes, 8, and Agustin, 10. The pilot was Seankese Johnson, 36, a U.S. Navy veteran who received his commercial pilot\u2019s license in 2023.

      "The company's director of operations, Jason Costello, agreed on Sunday to voluntarily halt flights while the crash was being investigated.

The CEO, Michael Roth, also said Costello was no longer an employee, according to the FAA order.",

      "BEL AIR, Md. -- A fugitive from El Salvador was convicted Monday in the 2023 slaying of a Maryland woman who was attacked while exercising on a popular hiking trail northeast of Baltimore.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Victor Martinez-Hernandez, 24, was carrying out a planned attack when he grabbed Rachel Morin off the trail, bashed her head against nearby rocks, raped her and concealed her body in a drainage culvert. Their case hinged on DNA evidence connecting him to the crime.",
      "A jury found Martinez-Hernandez guilty of first-degree murder and first-degree rape, among other offenses, according to Randolph Rice, an attorney representing Morin\u2019s relatives.",
      "\u201cThe Morin family is incredibly relieved that justice was served today,\u201d Rice said in a statement.",
      "Martinez-Hernandez was accused of entering the United States illegally after allegedly killing another woman in his home country. Authorities also linked him to a 2023 home invasion in Los Angeles.",
      "Morin was killed in August 2023. The act of violence sent shock waves through Bel Air, a suburban community northeast of Baltimore. It also became a political flashpoint during the 2024 presidential election campaign as Donald Trump called for increased border security and mass deportations of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Trump posted on social media about the verdict Monday night, saying Morin\u2019s \u201clife was taken at the hands of a monster who should have NEVER been here in the first place\u201d and blaming the Biden administration for failing to properly secure the border.",

      "Defense attorneys challenged prosecutors' assertion that the crime was a random attack and said police simply got the wrong guy. They also asked jurors to pay close attention to unanswered questions during the trial, including questions of motive.",

Then the older elephants \u2014 Ndlula, Umngani, Khosi \u2014 scramble to encircle and shield the two 7-year-old calves Zuli and Mkhaya from any possible threats.",
      "They remain huddled for several minutes as the older elephants look outward, appearing to be at the ready, their ears spread and flapping \u2014 even after the rocking stopped.",
      "The quake was felt from San Diego to Los Angeles, 120 miles (193 kilometers) away. It sent boulders tumbling onto rural roads in San Diego County and knocked items off store shelves in the tiny mountain town of Julian near the epicenter but caused no injuries or major damage.",
      "But it spooked the elephants.",
      "Once in a circle, \u201cthey sort of freeze as they gather information about where the danger is,\u201d said Mindy Albright, a curator of mammals at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park.",

      "ST. LOUIS -- The city of St. Louis and the leader of its city council filed a federal lawsuit Monday against a new Missouri law putting a state-appointed board back in control of the local police department, putting St. Louis among a handful of major U.S. cities that don't fully oversee law enforcement.",
      "The president of the city's Board of Aldermen, Megan Green, argues in the lawsuit that the new law violates her rights to free expression, freedom of assembly and to petition state government, all guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The city says the law violates a provision of the Missouri Constitution that prohibits unfunded mandates from the state.",
      "The law, approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature and signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe last month, gives the governor the power to appoint four city residents as voting members of a new board to manage the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department to serve along with the city's elected mayor, currently Democrat Tishaura Jones. The police department of Kansas City, Missouri, is overseen by such a board.",
      "Some critics suggested that Republican lawmakers wanted to wrest control of the police away from Jones, a Black woman, but Kehoe has said legislators were \u201cprioritizing public safety.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the new law violates Green\u2019s rights through vague and overly broad provisions that prohibit city officials from taking any action to \u201cimpede, obstruct or interfere\u201d with the state board, subjecting them to fines and removal from office. The new law also requires St. Louis to increase its spending on the police department each year through 2028.",

      "St. Louis first lost full control over its police department during the Civil War in 1861, when Missouri was sharply divided between Union and Confederate supporters. St. Louis and Kansas City had larger Black populations than other parts of the state and were centers of Union support. A pro-Confederate government persuaded the Legislature to give the state control of the local police.",
      "That control lasted until a statewide vote in 2012 decisively approved an amendment to the state constitution to allow St. Louis to take control of the police department. However, Republicans argued this year that it was necessary to return control to the state to restore order in the city following years of population loss, a rise in homicides, and power struggles between city leaders and GOP state officials.",

      "A history scholar convicted of spying on Chinese dissidents by ingratiating himself as a sympathizer has been spared prison time by a U.S. judge",
      "NEW YORK -- A Chinese American scholar convicted of spying on Chinese dissidents was spared prison time Monday by a U.S. judge.",
      "Shujun Wang was sentenced by U.S. Circuit Judge Denny Chin to time served and three years\u2019 supervised release, according to attorneys. Wang has been free on bail since the day of his arrest.",
      "Wang, 76, was convicted last summer of charges including conspiring to act as an illegal foreign agent.",
      "With a story that federal prosecutors have described as akin to a spy novel, the case is part of their portfolio on what Washington views as \" transnational repression \" by authoritarian governments targeting critics abroad. The Chinese government has said it's being slandered by the \u201cmalicious fabrication of the so-called \u2018transnational suppression\u2019 narrative.\"",
      "A Chinese-born American citizen, Wang was a history professor in his homeland. He became a visiting fellow at Columbia University for a time in the 1990s and emigrated to the U.S., where he wrote books and co-founded a pro-democracy group in New York City.",
      "Prosecutors portrayed Wang's advocacy as a facade that garnered him credibility with sincere activists, allowing him to gather information on Hong Kong democracy protesters, supporters of Taiwanese independence, Uyghur and Tibetan activists and others.",
      "He relayed the intel to China\u2019s main intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security, in the form of emails styled as \u201cdiaries,\" according to prosecutors and trial evidence. The messages concerned demonstrations planned during Chinese President Xi Jinping' s visits to the U.S., anniversary events for the 1989 protests and bloody crackdown in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square, and more.",
      "Wang also met with ministry officials on trips to China, according to prosecutors and evidence.",
      "One activist and fellow academic mentioned in the \u201cdiaries,\u201d Ming Xia, told the court in a letter that he\u2019d altered his daily routine as a result. Another activist, Anna Yeung-Cheung, wrote that Wang's \u201cbetrayal not only damaged personal bonds and shattered our collective trust but also exacerbated harmful stereotypes that depict Chinese and Asian Americans as potential spies.\u201d",
      "Another figure in the \u201cdiaries\u201d \u2014 Juntao Wang, an academic and dissident who spent years in prison in China \u2014 said he knew about Shujun Wang's Chinese Communist Party connections but still appreciated his work with the pro-democracy movement.",
      "\u201cFrom the perspective of traditional Chinese political culture and contemporary Chinese politics, his dual identity is a common and understandable phenomenon,\u201d he wrote to the court. Saying that some genuine supporters of democracy also deal with Chinese officials to gain some benefits, he asked for a short sentence for Shujun Wang.",
      "Shujun Wang told FBI agents in interviews that his communiqu\u00e9s were just accounts of publicly available tidbits.",
      "In a New York Times Magazine interview after his conviction, he at times called the diaries a hobby and said he hadn't known his contacts in China worked for the security agency. At other points, he acknowledged sharing information with Chinese officials and said he was just trying to promote democracy to the Communist government, according to the magazine.",
      "Wang\u2019s attorney, Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, called Judge Chin's sentence a \u201cwise\u201d decision.",
      "\u201cIt appropriately recognized that his conduct was not driven by any financial motive and did limited, if any harm,\u201d said Margulis-Ohnuma, who also noted that Wang has multiple health problems.",
      "In court papers, Margulis-Ohnuma said the case didn't depict a debonair spy but rather \u201can aging democracy activist \u2014 lonesome and starved for attention, eager to please and always delighted to engage \u2014 who occasionally provided mostly-useless information to the Chinese government and lied about it as he became older, more impaired and more isolated.\u201d",

      "A federal judge in New Hampshire says two dads who oppose allowing transgender athletes to play high school sports won\u2019t be allowed to wear pink wristbands marked \u201cXX\u201d to games while their lawsuit against the school district continues",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Two fathers who oppose allowing transgender athletes to play high school sports won't be allowed to wear pink wristbands marked \u201cXX\u201d to games while their lawsuit against the school district continues, a federal judge ruled Monday.",
      "Kyle Fellers and Anthony Foote were banned from school grounds in Bow after wearing the wristbands to a soccer game in September that included a transgender girl on the opposing team. They later sued the school district, and while the no-trespass orders have since expired, they asked the judge to allow them to carry signs and wear the wristbands featuring the symbol for female chromosomes at school events while the case proceeds.",
      "Both men testified at a hearing in November that they didn\u2019t intend to harass or otherwise target transgender athlete Parker Tirrell, and their attorneys argued they did nothing more than silently express their support for reserving girls\u2019 sports for those assigned female at birth.",
      "But in denying their motion Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Steven McAuliffe said the parents' \u201cnarrow, plausibly inoffensive\u201d intentions weren't as important as the wider context, and that adults attending a high school athletic event do not enjoy a First Amendment protected right to convey messages that demean, harass or harm students.",
      "\"While plaintiffs may very well have never intended to communicate a demeaning or harassing message directed at Parker Tirrell or any other transgender students, the symbols and posters they displayed were fully capable of conveying such a message,\" he wrote. \u201cAnd, that broader messaging is what the school authorities reasonably understood and appropriately tried to prevent.\u201d",
      "School officials described receiving strongly-worded emails from Foote in which he called himself a \u201creal leader\u201d who was prepared to take action and seeing his social media posts urging others to attend the game. In the days leading up to the game, another parent told school officials she overheard others talk about showing up to the game wearing dresses and heckling Tirrell.",
      "\u201cThis was organized and targeted,\u201d Superintendent Marcy Kelley said.",
      "Brian Cullen, an attorney for the school district, said Monday he was pleased with what he called a well-reasoned ruling that affirms that school districts can and should protect students from harassment from adults on school grounds. And he noted that the ruling doesn't prevent the plaintiffs from expressing their views in other ways.",
      "\u201cIt simply prevents them from bringing their protest to the sidelines of a game being played by kids. That should not be a controversial limitation,\u201d he said.",
      "Del Kolde, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said he strongly disagrees with the ruling.",
      "\u201cThis was adult speech in a limited public forum, which enjoys greater First Amendment protection than student speech in the classroom,\u201d said Kolde, senior attorney for the Institute for Free Speech. \u201cBow School District officials were obviously discriminating based on viewpoint because they perceived the XX wristbands to be \u2018trans-exclusionary.'\u201d",
      "After the ruling was issued, the plaintiffs filed a notice saying they do not intend to enter more evidence before the judge makes a final decision.",
      "Meanwhile, Tirrell and another student athlete are challenging the state law that bans transgender athletes  in grades 5 to 12 from teams that align with their gender identity, as well as President Donald Trump\u2019s Feb. 5 executive order, \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports.\u201d A federal judge ruled in their case that they can play sports during the ongoing lawsuit that seeks to overturn the law.",

      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied Washington state's request for emergency relief funds to help repair an estimated $34 million in damage from a deadly bomb cyclone storm system in November, according to Gov. Bob Ferguson.",
      "Ferguson said in a news release on Monday that the state\u2019s January application for assistance was denied in a letter he received on Friday. The state's application had met all of the criteria necessary to qualify, he said.",
      "\u201cThis is another troubling example of the federal government withholding funding,\u201d Ferguson, a Democrat, said. \"Washington communities have been waiting for months for the resources they need to fully recover from last winter\u2019s devastating storms, and this decision will cause further delay. We will appeal.\u201d",
      "The November storm system battered the state with strong winds and rain that caused widespread damage and power outages, and toppled trees that killed at least two people. It was considered a \u201c bomb cyclone,\u201d which occurs when a cyclone intensifies rapidly. Bomb cyclones have been associated with major weather events across the country including hurricanes in recent years.",
      "After Washington's storms, then-Gov. Jay Inslee issued a disaster declaration in 11 counties \u2014 including where Seattle is located \u2014 and filed the application for disaster relief with FEMA to repair damage to public highways, public utilities and electrical power systems.",
      "FEMA's letter denying the application didn't give an explanation and said the assistance was \u201cnot warranted.\u201d The state has 30 days to appeal.",
      "The denial comes as FEMA's future is in question. President Donald Trump has questioned whether to disband it entirely and give money directly to states to handle disasters. Trump has created a council to study what to do with FEMA and whether to get rid of it.",
      "Earlier this month FEMA said it was ending a key program that has been used by communities across the country to pay for projects designed to help them prepare for natural disasters like flooding and fires.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the agency was instrumental in responding to a growing number of disasters linked to climate change. The agency also tried to address historical inequalities in how aid is dispersed after disasters.",
      "FEMA helps respond to disasters when local leaders request a presidential emergency declaration, a signal that the damage is beyond the state\u2019s ability to handle on its own. FEMA can reimburse governments for recovery efforts such as debris removal, and it gives stopgap financial assistance to individual residents.",
      "Washington\u2019s preliminary damage estimate of $34 million will likely increase as the state works with counties to update their information for an appeal, Ferguson said.",

      "The U.N. humanitarian agency says more than 300 civilians were killed in two days of intense fighting in Sudan\u2019s conflict-wracked Darfur region",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- More than 300 civilians were killed in two days of intense fighting in Sudan\u2019s conflict-wracked Darfur region, the U.N. humanitarian agency reported Monday, as the African country's brutal civil war nears the two-year mark.",
      "The attacks launched by Sudan\u2019s notorious paramilitary group on two famine-hit camps for displaced people in North Darfur and its nearby capital on Friday and Saturday were initially reported to have left more than 100 dead, including 20 children and nine aid workers, according to a U.N. official.",
      "But the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as OCHA, reported the much higher death toll Monday, citing local sources that were not identified. The Associated Press could not independently verify the numbers due to the conditions and communications on the ground.",
      "Sudan plunged into conflict on April 15, 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including the vast western Darfur region. Since then, at least 24,000 people have been tallied as being killed, according to the United Nations, though activists say the number is far higher.",
      "The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, known as the RSF, carried out the recent attacks after the Sudanese military late last month regained control over Khartoum, a major symbolic victory in the war.",
      "The war has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis and worst displacement crisis, and it has led to Sudan becoming the only country in the world experiencing famine.",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said OCHA has received reports of mass casualties and large-scale displacement following the recent fighting in and around the Zamzam and Abu Shorouk displacement camps, as well as North Darfur\u2019s capital, El Fasher, the only capital in Darfur that the RSF doesn\u2019t control. North Darfur is one of five states in the Darfur region.",
      "\u201cPreliminary figures from local sources indicate that more than 300 civilians have been killed, including 10 humanitarian personnel from the NGO Relief International who lost their lives while operating one of the last functioning health centers in Zamzam camp,\u201d Dujarric said.",
      "The escalation in the fighting came ahead of a conference in London to spotlight the war's anniversary on Tuesday organized by Britain, the European Union, Germany and France, where more than 20 foreign ministers are expected along with representatives of global organizations.",
      "Dujarric said the United Nations wants the conference to see Sudan\u2019s \u201cneighbors and the international community move in unity of purpose towards peace instead of fueling the conflict.\u201d",
      "Also Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council has scheduled emergency closed consultations on Sudan.",
      "The U.N. migration agency said Monday the RSF attacks in Zamzam camp have displaced between 60,000 to 80,000 families in the past two days. The majority of the families remain within El Fasher, which is under military control but has been besieged by the RSF for over a year.",
      "Mamadou Dian Balde, the U.N. refugee office\u2019s regional director, said in a video press conference with U.N. correspondents that \u201cmassive violations of human rights\u201d have forced almost 13 million Sudanese to flee their homes, including 4 million who fled to other countries. Most fled to Sudan's immediate neighbors, but more than 200,000 have gone to Libya and about 70,000 to Uganda, he said.",
      "Balde said the U.N. refugee agency\u2019s appeal for $1.8 billion to help the millions of refugees and their host nations is only 10% funded. He warned that if it doesn\u2019t get more money, people will move toward southern Africa, east Africa, the Gulf countries and Europe.",
      "\u201cWe really hope that tomorrow\u2019s event in London will also show greater support for the Sudanese brothers and sisters who have been displaced,\u201d Balde said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget has proposed gutting the State Department\u2019s budget by almost 50%, closing a number of overseas diplomatic missions, slashing the number of diplomatic staff, and eliminating funding for nearly all international organizations, including the United Nations, many of its agencies and for NATO headquarters, officials said.",
      "The proposal, which was presented to the State Department last week and is still in a highly preliminary phase, is not expected to pass muster with either the department\u2019s leadership or Congress, which will ultimately be asked to vote on the entire federal budget in the coming months.",
      "Officials familiar with the proposal say it must still go through several rounds of review before it even gets to lawmakers, who in the past have amended and even rejected White House budget requests. Though the proposal is preliminary, it gives an indication of the Trump administration's priorities and coincides with massive job and funding cuts across the federal government, from Health and Human Services and the Education Department to the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "Notes from an internal meeting about the proposal have been circulated in online chat groups among foreign service officers since the weekend but exploded Monday when the State Department was due to present a separate unrelated reorganization plan to the OMB.",
      "One senior U.S. official familiar with the OMB proposal called it \u201caggressive\u201d in terms of cost-cutting, but also stressed that it was an early outline that mirrored what OMB chief Russell Vought sought to do in President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration when he served in the same job. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.",
      "So did two people familiar with the matter who confirmed the proposal, one of whom also said it originated from OMB.",
      "OMB spokesperson Alexandra McCandless said that \u201cno final funding decisions have been made.\u201d The National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment on the proposed cuts.",
      "OMB\u2019s efforts to severely reduce the State Department\u2019s budget during Trump\u2019s first term were met with fierce resistance on Capitol Hill and largely failed.",
      "However, Trump\u2019s second administration has moved swiftly to scale back the federal government, slashing jobs and funding across agencies. It's already dismantled USAID and moved to defund so-called other \u201csoft power\u201d institutions of foreign policy importance like the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, Radio Free Asia and Radio/TV Marti, which broadcasts to Cuba.",
      "Thus, State Department officials and others have expressed increasing concern about the possibility that the proposed drastic cuts could actually be implemented.",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said she was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the proposed cuts.",
      "\u201cWhen America First becomes America Alone, our economy, security and prosperity will suffer as adversaries fill the void the Trump Administration leaves behind,\" Shaheen said in a statement. \u201cInvestments in diplomatic programs that promote peace and stability, and advance American national security interests are commonsense priorities that should be reflected in the State Department\u2019s budget request.\u201d",
      "According to the notes from the internal State Department meeting, the budget proposal calls for:",
      "\u2014 Halving foreign assistance funding managed by State and the U.S. Agency for International Development, which stood at $52 billion in 2024.",
      "\u2014 Eliminating more than a quarter of foreign assistance through State and USAID overall, freeze pay through next year, and cut travel and benefits for U.S. foreign service staffers.",
      "\u2014 Eliminating global health funding other than small amounts for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. Require global health partners to contribute a bigger share.",

      "Despite a court order, a reporter and photographer from The Associated Press were barred from an Oval Office news conference on Monday with President Donald Trump and his counterpart from El Salvador, Nayib Bukele.",
      "Last week's federal court decision forbidding the Trump administration from punishing the AP for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico was to take effect Monday. The administration is appealing the decision and arguing with the news outlet over whether it needs to change anything until those appeals are exhausted.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit set a Thursday hearing on Trump's request that any changes be delayed while case is reviewed. The AP is fighting for more access as soon as possible.",
      "Later Monday, two AP photographers were admitted to an event honoring Ohio State's championship football team on the more spacious South Lawn. A text reporter was turned away.",
      "Since mid-February, AP reporters and photographers have been blocked from attending events in the Oval Office, where President Donald Trump frequently addresses journalists, and on Air Force One. The AP has seen sporadic access elsewhere, and regularly covers White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt\u2019s briefings. Leavitt is one of three administration officials named in the AP's lawsuit.",
      "The dispute stems from AP\u2019s decision not to follow the president\u2019s executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico, although AP style does cite Trump\u2019s wish that it be called the Gulf of America. The AP argued \u2013 and U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden agreed last week \u2013 that the government cannot punish the news organization for exercising its right to free speech.",
      "McFadden on Friday had rejected Trump\u2019s request for more delay in implementing the ruling; now the president is asking an appeals court for the same thing.",
      "\u201cWe expect the White House to restore AP's participation in the (White House press) pool as of today, as provided in the injunction order,\u201d AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said Monday.",
      "The extent of AP's future access remains uncertain, even with the court decision.",
      "Until being blocked by Trump, AP has traditionally always had a reporter and photographer among the small group of journalists invited into the Oval Office. McFadden did not order that to be restored, only that no news organization should be shut out because the president objects to its news decisions \u2014 under a principle called \u201cviewpoint discrimination.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo other news organization in the United States receives the level of guaranteed access previously bestowed upon the AP,\u201d the administration argued in court papers over the weekend. \u201cThe AP may have grown accustomed to its favored status, but the Constitution does not require that such status endure in perpetuity.\u201d",

      "CHICAGO -- For the first time in over a decade, Chicago\u2019s public school teachers have a new contract without a strike or threat of a walkout. The four-year agreement includes pay hikes, hiring more teachers and class size limits.",
      "While negotiations between the Chicago Teachers Union and the district didn\u2019t escalate this time, there was unprecedented turmoil surrounding the unusual yearlong talks. The drama included the school superintendent\u2019s firing, the entire board resigning and historic elections that tested the union\u2019s power.",
      "Now, Chicago faces uncertainty with Trump administration education cuts and looming questions about how the nation\u2019s fourth-largest school district will pay for the contract.",
      "While all parties are celebrating the agreement now, there\u2019s been no shortage of turbulence.",
      "Perhaps the main reason negotiations didn\u2019t devolve into a strike, as was the case in 2019 and 2012, was union ally Mayor Brandon Johnson. A former teacher and CTU organizer, the union helped elect him in 2023.",
      "He spent months trying to oust Chicago Public Schools CEO Pedro Martinez, an appointee of former Mayor Lori Lightfoot, in a public spat.",
      "\u201cAll of that chaos and turmoil there clearly dragged down the bargaining and probably shut it down for a fair amount of time,\u201d said Robert Bruno, a University of Illinois professor of labor and employment relations.",
      "Johnson wanted a $300 million high-interest loan to cover the new contract and a pension payment, which Martinez and the board rejected as fiscally irresponsible. In October, the board resigned in protest.",
      "The next month, the city held its first school elections. The transitional board \u2014 a mix of union-backed candidates, charter school supporters and independents \u2014 includes mayoral appointees until it\u2019s fully elected in 2027.",
      "In December, the board moved to fire Martinez, though he\u2019ll remain until June. At one point, Martinez accused new members of meeting privately with the union and won a judge\u2019s restraining order.",
      "The union started contract talks last year with more than 700 requests, a record for the almost 30,000-member union.",
      "Union leaders say their goal is always equality in the segregated city. Roughly 70% of the 325,000 students in the district are low-income and more than 80% are Black or Latino.",
      "But district officials said those lofty requests would have cost over $10 billion. The district\u2019s annual budget is roughly $10 billion.",
      "The new agreement\u2019s price tag is about $1.5 billion.",
      "\u201cWe stayed true to our values,\u201d Martinez said after the deal was announced. \u201cWe succeeded in keeping the best interest of our students always at the center.\"",
      "Both sides touted transparency. For the first time, some bargaining sessions were publicly livestreamed.",
      "It was also the first time in nearly about decades the union was allowed to bargain on issues like class size. In 1995, a Republican-led Illinois legislature passed a law limiting collective bargaining rights largely to pay and benefits. Democratic leaders changed that in 2021.",
      "CTU President Stacy Davis Gates celebrated the contract as a win that protects students, particularly those who are vulnerable under Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s big, it\u2019s complex and it is certainly a step in the right direction,\u201d she said.",
      "Johnson also took a victory lap, trumpeting his union ties.",
      "\u201cWhen I was running for office, they said it would be a liability,\u201d he told reporters recently. \u201cBut it sounds like to me that no other mayor could have brought Chicago Public Schools, the Board of Education, the mayor\u2019s office and the CTU together to the table to make sure that our children get exactly what they deserve, which is a fully funded, well-rounded education.\u201d",
      "Under the deal, teachers will get 4% retroactive raises as the contract expired last year. Then they\u2019ll get 4% or 5% raises each year after.",
      "Starting next year, the median teacher pay will be $98,000. By the contract\u2019s end in 2028, the average teacher will earn around $110,000, according to the district.",
      "The district, which employs roughly 7,000 teachers, will hire 800 more, and nearly 100 additional librarians. Teachers will get an extra 10 minutes of daily prep time, for 70 minutes total.",
      "Also, class sizes will be limited by grade level. For instance, kindergarten will have the smallest and be capped at 25 students.",
      "Union leaders announced Monday that 97% of members who voted approved the deal. Davis Gates called it \u201coverwhelmingly historic levels\u201d of support for a contract that built on previous years' work, including strikes.",
      "Experts say what happened in Chicago could give other unions momentum. Los Angeles teachers, who are currently negotiating, noted CTU in a recent newsletter.",
      "\u201cOrganizing is how we resist political agendas to dismantle our public schools and public services. And we can Win Our Future in Los Angeles, just like our union siblings in Chicago,\u201d the United Teachers Los Angeles newsletter read.",
      "Still, serious funding questions remain.",
      "The district has a roughly $500 million annual deficit and a pending $175 million pension reimbursement to the city. The district is also about to enter contract negotiations with the principals\u2019 union.",
      "Martinez said the first year of the contract is covered, but there\u2019s uncertainty after that.",
      "Where the two sides agree is that the talks took too long.",
      "As Trump took office, union organizers said there was more gravity to their work, even as both sides in the Democratic stronghold are aligned on issues including immigrant rights.",
      "\u201cWe had a sense of urgency, we had a sense of responsibility,\u201d Davis Gates said. \u201cThe district shared the responsibility, but not the urgency.\u201d",
      "School officials accused the union of taking their time.",
      "\u201cWe should have had this contract months ago,\u201d Martinez said.",

      "A political battle fit for the gridiron is raging in Ohio",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A political battle fit for the gridiron is underway in Ohio, where state Republican leaders are clashing over whether to single out the Cleveland Browns for help building a new suburban domed stadium or impose tax hikes to fund stadium upgrades for the Cincinnati Bengals and other teams longer term.",
      "Neither idea is without critics in both parties, who argue that underwriting National Football League stadiums siphons money from the state's policy priorities, including funding infrastructure and public schools.",
      "The most heated debate centers on a proposal by Haslam Sports Group, which owns the Browns, to relocate from the team's existing open-air stadium on downtown Cleveland\u2019s lakeshore \u2014 where they have played since 1999 \u2014 to a new $2.4 billion complex in Brook Park, about 15 miles (24.14 kilometers) south. The team has proposed a private-public partnership to which the state would contribute $600 million.",
      "After the money was approved by the Ohio House last week, commissioners in Hamilton County, home to the Bengals, balked. They moved swiftly to re-up their request for $350 million for Paycor Stadium, where the Bengals' lease is up June 30, 2026. The ask follows Bengals Executive Vice President Katie Blackburn's comments at recent NFL meetings in Florida, where she said, \u201cWe could, I guess, go wherever we wanted after this year\u201d \u2014 while noting negotiations are progressing.",
      "The stadium debate heads to the Ohio Senate after their two-week spring break.",
      "Dee and Jimmy Haslam, generous Republican campaign donors, say they want a facility \u201cconsistent with other world-class NFL stadiums.\u201d With the addition of a dome, the Browns could host year-round events during northeast Ohio's severe winters and \u201ccatalyze meaningful economic impact\u201d at an adjacent entertainment complex. They point out that eight in 10 home game attendees live outside city limits.",
      "Leaders in Cleveland, where Browns games draw coveted economic activity to downtown and the tourism district along Lake Erie, are livid. The existing $247 million Huntington Bank Field was primarily funded by city and county tax dollars. To many, it's a symbol of the hard-luck sports town's commitment to the team it nearly lost when then-owner Art Modell notoriously packed off to Baltimore in 1996.",
      "Modell's messy exit, also hitched to a stadium dispute, led to a state law that says no owner of an Ohio professional sports team that plays most of its home games at a tax-supported stadium can go elsewhere without an agreement with its host city or unless the host city is given six months\u2019 notice with an opportunity to buy the team.",
      "Democratic Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb and members of the city council have threatened for months to invoke the \u201cModell Law\u201d to prevent the Browns from leaving their current location, where the lease runs through the 2028 season. The city plans to remake the so-called \u201cNorth Shore\u201d with an eye toward accessibility, economic development and environmental protection. The team has filed a constitutional challenge to the law, and the city sued it back.",
      "Meanwhile, the clock for allocating dollars toward the project is running down: Lawmakers face a June 30 deadline to finalize the state budget for the next two years.",
      "Republican Gov. Mike DeWine's budget proposal called for raising the $600 million by doubling the tax on sports betting companies from 20% to 40%. The idea was to create a long-term revenue stream that could help both the Browns and the Bengals, and other teams.",
      "\u201cThe governor's plan goes beyond one team,\u201d DeWine spokesman Dan Tierney said. \u201cThe general revenue fund can't afford that. Therefore, we need to look at something that is more sustainable and can help all the teams.\u201d",
      "The GOP-led Ohio House, however, rejected DeWine's plan in a vote last week. Its version of the operating budget calls for issuing $600 million in general obligation bonds to pay for the Browns project instead. Paying off the bonds would cost the state about $1 billion over 30 years.",
      "House Finance Chairman Brian Stewart told reporters that the \u201cmetrics\u201d of bonds are better for Ohio taxpayers because officials project that tax revenue from the Browns' \u201cmegaproject\u201d will be ample to cover the $40 million a year it will take to repay the bonds.",
      "As the Senate takes up the bill, it must weigh opposition to the current plan from all quarters: DeWine, the city of Cleveland, the Bengals, legislative Democrats and Republican Attorney General Dave Yost, who is running to succeed DeWine next year.",
      "\u201cOhio is getting ready to spend more money on a new stadium in one city for one football team than it will spend on new highway construction for the next two years in the entire state,\u201d Yost wrote in a recent Columbus Dispatch op-ed. He called state money for the project a \u201cspendthrift gift to a billionaire.\u201d",
      "House Democrats unsuccessfully fought to pause the funding proposal altogether, citing unanswered questions about revenue projections, economic impacts and commitments by private developers. Cleveland Rep. Terrence Upchurch told reporters that lawmakers have more important priorities than helping the Browns' owners, \u201cespecially since they only won three (expletive) games last year,\u201d referring to the team's 3-14 record.",
      "A fellow Democrat in the Republican-supermajority Senate has proposed prohibiting public dollars from going to any professional sports franchise without a winning record in three of its five past seasons.",

      "Leaders of state humanities councils throughout the country say federal funding cuts by President Donald Trump's administration will force them to scale back or eliminate celebrations next year commemorating the nation's 250th anniversary",
      "WASHINGTON -- Community celebrations being planned to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary next year are at risk of being significantly scaled back or canceled because of federal funding cuts under President Donald Trump's administration, according to multiple state humanities councils across the country.",
      "The councils have been working on programming for America250, an initiative marking the milestone anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. But the Republican administration's deep cost-cutting effort across the federal government has led the National Endowment for the Humanities to cancel its grants for state humanities councils. That has left them with less money for programming to plan for the celebration, ranging from themed K-12 school curriculums to special events at public libraries.",
      "\u201cI cannot imagine how we\u2019re supposed to have a national commemoration that\u2019s meaningful for people where they live without the humanities being supported,\u201d said Gabrielle Lyon, executive director of Illinois Humanities, the state's humanities council.",
      "\u201cWhat is it going to mean for small towns and rural communities who were expecting the possibility of having grants to do special exhibits, special commemorations, their own programs, and speakers and performers? All of that is now extremely tenuous. And those are exactly the kinds of things people have been looking forward to.\"",
      "The head of Washington state\u2019s humanities council said the NEH funding cuts appeared at odds with Trump's focus on the commemorations. Earlier this year, the president signed an executive order creating a White House task force to plan a \u201cgrand celebration worthy of the momentous occasion of the 250th anniversary of American Independence.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe organization that\u2019s positioned to do that for America is the National Endowment for the Humanities,\u201d said Julie Ziegler, CEO and executive director of Humanities Washington.",
      "The White House and the NEH did not respond to requests for comment. America250, the initiative established by Congress to help orchestrate the commemorations, did not comment for this story.",
      "The humanities funding cuts come as Trump has targeted cultural establishments from the Smithsonian Institution to the Institute of Museum and Library Services in executive orders. The moves are part of his goals to downsize the federal government and end initiatives seen as promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. The order directed at the Smithsonian, for example, said it has \u201ccome under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.\u201d",
      "To comply with the orders, federal agencies have scrubbed images and information designated as DEI material from websites pertaining to certain parts of American history. That ranges from a webpage highlighting baseball trailblazer Jackie Robinson\u2019s military service to the National Park Service removing content about Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad. Both were restored after a public outcry.",
      "\u201cI think that what\u2019s happening is the administration is trying to shape the history that we\u2019re going to tell in a way that\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d said James Grossman, executive director of the American Historical Association. \u201cThe expertise of professional historians is being set aside in favor of a narrow, ideologically driven idea of the American past.\u201d",
      "State humanities councils across the country have been discussing how to present the myriad histories that make up the U.S. for the 250th commemoration events. But leaders of those councils say the loss of money from the National Endowment for the Humanities means some events are now unlikely to take place.",
      "The NEH is a federal agency that awards money appropriated by Congress to a variety of recipients, including state humanities councils, museums, universities and historic sites. The money supports educational programs, research and preservation, among other things.",
      "This month, the Trump administration's Department of Governmental Efficiency, overseen by billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, placed roughly 80% of NEH staff members on administrative leave, according to the Federation of State Humanities Councils.",
      "The NEH also sent letters to state humanities councils across the country saying their federal grants had been terminated. The halt in funding came during the middle of the fiscal year for thousands of organizations and is causing widespread changes in their programs, including planning for the 250th anniversary.",
      "Georgia Humanities, the state's humanities council, has been planning various events for the 250th anniversary, said president Mary McCartin Wearn.",
      "They include a statewide \u201cdigital book club\" in partnership with the state's public library service, a program for speakers to travel across the state to give lectures and presentations, and a Smithsonian Institution program known as Museum on Main Street, which brings traveling exhibits to small towns and rural areas.",
      "But the council has now lost $740,000 in federal funding that had been awarded to it, placing those programs in jeopardy, said McCartin Wearn, who has been fielding calls and emails from people asking about the status of their programming for the anniversary events.",
      "\u201cIt's really something that is heartbreaking, because it is a moment for reflection about who we are and who we want to be,\u201d she said.",
      "Adam Davis, executive director of Oregon Humanities, said his state had already run trainings at rural libraries and begun conversations about \u201cfreedom, equality, how we remember key events, why we monumentalize or memorialize big things, and how we should do that.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can celebrate the 250th by having a commercial at the Super Bowl and waving a big flag,\" Davis said. \"You could also do things like get community members talking to each other about the core values in the country and what we hope for, and you can build trust and strengthen the fabric of our democracy.\u201d",
      "Without the funding, he said, \u201cthe scale is going to be quite different.\u201d",
      "Miranda Restovic, president and executive director of the Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities, said the state\u2019s role in the nation's history makes the 250th anniversary \u201ca really wonderful opportunity.\u201d However, the funding cuts, which amount to $600,000 this fiscal year, put her organization in \u201ccontingency planning mode rather than continuing to think creatively about how we celebrate that important moment for our nation and our history.\u201d",
      "In a state that has shaped American history, cuisine and culture, the group\u2019s plan for the 250th anniversary was to \u201cnudge\u201d people around the state to design programs that would show off the distinct flavors of their communities.",
      "\u201cWe were planning to lean into us as a grant maker and support local initiatives that celebrated the 250th so that people can tell their own story,\" Restovic said. \"We are likely not going to be able to do that.\u201d",
      "Brenda Thomson, executive director of Arizona Humanities, said she had been imagining dramatic readings of the Bill of Rights, theater productions, parades, book readings and festivals as activities that communities would be putting on \u201cwith a heightened sense of pride\u201d for the 250th anniversary.",
      "She said the $1 million cut to her organization will mean curtailing those activities in a way that will not allow the telling of the nation\u2019s full story. She lamented what would be lost.",
      "\u201cHow do you know what you\u2019re doing if you don\u2019t know where you came from,\" she said.",

      "The Senate has produced the quickest top-level Cabinet confirmation process in the last 20 years under new Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate, once again, was working into the early morning hours Friday with its new majority leader, Republican John Thune, setting the pace.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until just after 2 a.m. that the last of the senators had straggled into the chamber to cast their vote on the confirmation of retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan \u201cRazin\u201d Caine for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The vote capped a grinding start to the year for the Senate that included several all-night floor sessions and \u2014 importantly for Thune \u2014 the quickest top-level Cabinet confirmation process in the past 20 years.",
      "At the outset, however, such an outcome was far from assured. President Donald Trump was making demands that the new Senate leader be ready to put the chamber into recess so he could skip over the Senate confirmation process altogether. Faced with that prospect, Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said his message in conversations with the president was, \u201cLet us do this the old-fashioned way and just use the clock and grind it out, and then we\u2019ll see where we go from there.\u201d",
      "That approach has been successful allowing Thune to show Trump the Senate\u2019s worth while also preserving its constitutional role in installing a president\u2019s Cabinet. But the decision to push forward on even Trump's most unconventional Cabinet nominees has also come at a cost.",
      "Several Cabinet officials have been intimately involved in the early controversies of Trump\u2019s second term, from discussing military plans on an unclassified Signal app chat to encouraging the Republican president to follow through with steep tariffs on trading partners.",
      "GOP senators, many of whom still hold traditional Republican ideas, have often had to mount a response. The Republican chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, last month initiated an investigation by the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general into whether classified information was shared on Signal by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. And GOP senators more recently made a concerted effort to encourage Trump to negotiate trade deals with other nations rather than listen to advisers like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who was adamant that tariffs were there to stay.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press shortly after Trump announced a pause on tariffs to most nations, Thune said the announcement showed the president is \u201cresponding to the feedback he\u2019s given.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think everybody wants to see him succeed with this, wants to see the country succeed and wants to make sure that we\u2019re gauging and calibrating \u2014 as some of these major policy shifts are being made \u2014 the impacts that they have,\u201d Thune added.",
      "That balance \u2014 Thune's supportive yet still cautious approach \u2014 has marked his early months working with a president with whom, until last year, he had a fraught relationship. So far, Trump and Thune have stayed on upbeat terms, but the stakes will only rise for Republicans in the coming months as they try to lift through Congress a massive package of tax breaks and spending cuts on party-line votes.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, it took barely a year \u2014 and some setbacks in Congress \u2014 before Trump began openly feuding with then Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.",
      "Discussing the reconciliation package as he sat in McConnell\u2019s old leadership office, Thune stressed that for the GOP\u2019s marquee legislation to work, \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to be rolling in the same direction. It takes a lot of teamwork.\u201d",
      "As Trump has entered office with practically total command of the Republican Party and an agenda to upend the federal government and its role in society, Thune acknowledged that Trump has been aggressive in his use of executive power. But he argued that it was no different from how previous presidents wanted to \u201ctake as much power as they possibly can,\" pointing to President Joe Biden\u2019s moves to cancel student debt and boost government food assistance.",
      "\u201cOur job is to do what we can to support the president and his agenda,\u201d Thune said. \u201cBut, you know, be that important check and balance, too, that the Founders intended.\u201d",
      "Still, as Trump has blazed through constitutional norms with sweeping orders that endanger civil rights, government programs, the federal workforce and America\u2019s relationship with allies, Republicans in Congress have stood by.",
      "\u201cWe need Republicans to get off the sidelines, including the majority leader, and say, \u2019This is unacceptable behavior by any president,'\u201d said Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat.",
      "Kelly cited Trump\u2019s disparagement of NATO and comments about taking over countries like Canada and Greenland and the Panama Canal. \u201cThe damage that Donald Trump is doing to our international reputation is not something we easily recover from,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Kelly added that Thune \u201cdeserves some credit\u201d for making the \u201cmechanics of the Senate function well.\u201d",
      "Thune has been aggressive in trying to get the Senate to move faster through its votes. He noted that he had allowed one recent vote session to close before he had even had a chance to cast his vote because he was at the White House for a meeting.",
      "It\u2019s an incremental change in the Senate\u2019s timing, but one that Thune, a former runner, hopes will contribute to the chamber becoming more active and deliberative in shaping the law. He won the leadership contest in part by pledging to allow individual senators to have more of a say in crafting and amending legislation.",
      "So far, the Senate has also gained bipartisan support to pass bills that will increase prison penalties for fentanyl traffickers as well as mandate the detainment of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally and are accused of theft and violent crimes.",
      "Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Missouri Republican who has been vocal about changes to the way legislation advances, said Thune has \"done a great job,\" although the Senate hasn't had much of a chance to work on legislation.",
      "\u201cThe truth of the matter,\" he added, \u201cis we've been consumed by confirmations.\u201d",

      "Talks between Iran and the United States over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program had appeared ready to leave the Middle East, as an Italian source and others said the next round of negotiations would take place in Rome",
      "ROME -- Talks between Iran and the United States over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program appeared ready to leave the Middle East on Monday, as an Italian source and others said the next round of negotiations would take place in Rome. But early Tuesday, Iran insisted the next round would again be held in Oman.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear where the negotiations would be held after Tehran's overnight announcement. American officials have not said where the talks would be held. President Donald Trump separately complained Monday about the pace of nuclear talks between the United States and Iran as the two countries start a new round of pivotal negotiations.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re tapping us along,\u201d he said in the Oval Office during a meeting with El Salvador's president.",
      "The next meeting had been expected to take place on Saturday in Rome, according to a source in the Italian government who spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani also signaled the talks would take place there.",
      "\u201cWe received the request from the interested parties, from Oman, which plays the role of mediator and we gave a positive response,\u201d Tajani told reporters during a trip to Osaka, Japan. \u201cWe are ready to welcome, as always, meetings that can bring positive results, in this case on the nuclear issue.\u201d",
      "Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp, speaking at a meeting in Luxembourg, also said the coming talks would be in Rome. And Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reportedly said Monday the talks would happen in Rome while speaking to his Iraqi counterpart on Monday, according to the state-run Iraqi News Agency.",
      "Then early Tuesday, the state-run IRNA news agency quoted Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei as saying the talks would be back in Oman, without elaborating on the reason. Easter Sunday will be this coming weekend, a major holiday in Rome, which surrounds Vatican City, the home of the Roman Catholic church.",
      "The first round of talks over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program took place over the past weekend in Oman.",
      "The stakes of the negotiations couldn\u2019t be higher for the two nations closing in on half a century of enmity. Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Speaking of Iran, Trump said \u201cI want them to be a rich, great nation.\u201d However, he said \u201cthese are radicalized people, and they cannot have a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog separately confirmed he would be taking a trip to Iran later in the week, possibly to discuss ways to improve access for his inspectors to Tehran's program.",
      "The talks will follow a visit by Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency to Iran later this week.",
      "The IAEA played a key role in verifying Iran's compliance with its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and has continued to work in the Islamic Republic, even as the country's theocracy slowly peeled away its access after Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord in 2018.",
      "\u201cContinued engagement and cooperation with the Agency is essential at a time when diplomatic solutions are urgently needed,\u201d Grossi wrote on X.",
      "Grossi will arrive in Iran on Wednesday night and will meet with Araghchi and President Masoud Pezeshkian, the state-run IRNA news agency reported, quoting Kazem Gharibabadi, a deputy foreign minister.",
      "The 2015 nuclear deal saw Iran agree to drastically reduce its stockpile of uranium and only enrich up to 3.67% \u2014 enough for its nuclear power plant at Bushehr. Today, Iran enriches up to 60%, a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels and has enough stockpile for multiple nuclear bombs, should it choose to build them.",
      "The deal lifted economic sanctions on Iran and unfroze assets around the world. The deal's collapse refroze those funds and limited Iran's ability to sell crude oil abroad \u2014 though it still sells to China, likely at a sharp discount.",
      "While the U.S. can offer sanctions relief for Iran\u2019s beleaguered economy, it remains unclear just how much Iran will be willing to concede. Judging from negotiations since 2018, Iran will likely ask to keep enriching uranium up to at least 20%. However, neither side has offered any public statements about what it is specifically seeking in the talks.",
      "\u201cThere must definitely be guarantees in place regarding the fulfillment of commitments,\" Baghaei said Monday. \"The issue of guarantees is especially important given the history of broken promises in the past. God willing, the negotiating team will continue its work with all these factors and points in mind.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cAs long as the language of sanctions, pressure, threats, and intimidation continues, direct negotiations will not take place.\u201d",
      "However, Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff did meet and speak face to face after some two hours of indirect talks mediated by Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi.",
      "Speaking to journalists on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said he met with Witkoff and that his envoy had \u201cvery good meetings on the Middle East.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be making a decision on Iran very quickly,\" Trump said, without elaborating.",

      "DENVER -- A former Colorado sheriff\u2019s deputy convicted of killing a 22-year-old man in distress who called 911 for help was sentenced Monday to three years in prison, the maximum sentence, by a judge who said the shooting was about power.",
      "Andrew Buen was convicted in February of criminally negligent homicide in the 2022 death of Christian Glass, which drew national attention and prompted calls to reform how authorities respond to people with mental health problems.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Buen needlessly escalated a standoff with Glass, who showed signs of a mental health crisis and refused orders to get out of his SUV near Silver Plume, a small, former mining town along Interstate 70 in the Rocky Mountains west of Denver.",
      "His parents and the agencies involved reached a $19 million settlement that included crisis intervention training for officers responding to people in distress.",

      "Buen, wearing an orange jail uniform, apologized to the Glass family, dabbing his eyes with a tissue with his handcuffed hands as he spoke at a podium.",
      "Glass's family had questioned whether any remorse Buen might show would be sincere. Buen, his voice shaking, said they had every right to feel the way they do. He said his actions had escalated the standoff and told the judge he wasn't \u201cowed\u201d anything.",
      "\u201cThere are a million things I should have done better that night,\u201d he said before he was sentenced.",
      "Sally Glass told Cheroutes that Buen had acted like a \u201cbully\u201d toward her son, a creative and gentle artist who was born in his father\u2019s native New Zealand.",
      "\u201cHe met evil that night and there was no compassion,\u201d she said.",
      "Simon Glass said his family's grief was compounded at first by authorities initially describing his son as the aggressor in the standoff, which the sheriff's office later apologized for. He said he struggles with anxiety and has trouble referring to his son in the past tense, but takes comfort that his son's name has been cleared, in part because of body camera footage.",
      "Katie Glass said she and her mother try to always drive below the speed limit to avoid being pulled over by the police. She said she regrets watching the body camera footage showing her older brother's final moments.",
      "\"He died terrified, in pain and all alone. That is what hurts me the most,\u201d she said.",
      "Buen, a former deputy in Clear Creek County, was convicted after a second trial.",

      "With the support of Glass\u2019 family, prosecutors decided to try Buen again on a second-degree murder charge. Jurors also had the option of convicting him of the less serious charge of criminally negligent homicide.",
      "The defense argued that Glass had a knife and Buen was legally justified in shooting him to protect a fellow officer.",

      "The officers fired bean bag rounds and shocked Glass with a Taser, but that failed to make him exit the car. He then took a knife he had offered to surrender at the beginning of the encounter and flung it out a rear window, which had been broken by a bean bag, toward an officer, according to the indictment. At that point Buen fired five times at him.",
      "\u201cLord, hear me, Lord, hear me,\u201d Glass was heard saying moments before he was shot.",

      "HOUSTON -- HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 George Foreman was remembered Monday in a memorial service in his hometown of Houston for his legendary boxing career as well as for his love of God, family, horses and cheeseburgers and for his desire to help his fellow man.",
      "\u201cHe preached love all the time. That\u2019s what this life is all about. It\u2019s all about love and George was pure because George lived and believed what he preached,\u201d said James Douglas, a longtime friend and former president of Texas Southern University in Houston.",
      "During a nearly 1\u00bd hour memorial service, Foreman\u2019s family and friends recalled anecdotes about a man who was a two-time boxing heavyweight champion but who was also a pastor who delivered life affirming sermons at his church in northeast Houston and a savvy businessman best known for the George Foreman Grill.",
      "Foreman even addressed the crowd posthumously at the Wortham Theater Center, a performing arts center that hosted the memorial, with audio messages recorded previously.",
      "\u201cWinning and losing can never assure a lasting smile. But saying to the face you see daily, \u2018I did my best,\u2019 can,\u201d Foreman said on the recording.",
      "Many of the people who spoke at the memorial, including George Foreman IV, one of five sons of the boxing legend, highlighted the importance of faith in the elder Foreman\u2019s life and how God guided his efforts to help others.",
      "\u201c\u2019How well do I remember how Jesus brought me through? I prayed, I walked a night or two. I said, Lord, why don\u2019t you take and use me? That\u2019s all that I can do. I give my life to Jesus, what about you?\u2019 That was a song my grandmother gave to my father. He was going through a hard time. So now I\u2019ve given it to you,\u201d George Foreman IV said as his four brothers stood behind him.",
      "Foreman had 12 children, including five sons who are all famously named George Edward Foreman.",
      "\u201cRest well, dad. We will carry your love with us always,\u201d said George Foreman IV, who is also a pastor.",
      "Former boxer Michael Moorer, who Foreman defeated in 1994 to become the oldest man at age 45 to win the heavyweight championship, told the crowd that the two went from being competitors to having a relationship \u201cbuilt on respect for over 30 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cGeorge was a champion in life. His faith transformed the shy country boy from Texas to a successful businessman and a voice for the less fortunate,\u201d Moorer said.",
      "Dr. Adan Rios, a longtime friend of the boxing great, recalled how Foreman bought land to create a food bank for AIDS patients and donated $1.7 million to help treat adolescent patients with cancer.",
      "Foreman died on March 21 at age 76. Foreman\u2019s family has not disclosed his cause of death, only saying on social media that he \u201cpeacefully departed \u2026 surrounded by loved ones.\u201d",
      "Born in Marshall, Texas, Foreman was raised in Houston\u2019s Fifth Ward, one of the city\u2019s historically Black neighborhoods.",
      "He began his boxing career as an Olympic gold medalist in 1968, turning pro the next year.",
      "Foreman became the heavyweight champion of the world when he beat Joe Frazier in 1973. But he lost the title the following year when Muhammad Ali beat Foreman in the famous \u201cRumble in the Jungle\u201d fight in Zaire.",
      "Foreman then gave up boxing and after a religious awakening, became an ordained minister in 1978. He began preaching in Houston, later founding The Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in 1980.",
      "The middle-aged fighter returned to the ring after a 10-year absence and in 1994 pulled off one of the most spectacular knockouts in boxing history, flooring Moorer \u2014 19 years his junior \u2014 with a surgical right hand to claim Moorer\u2019s two heavyweight belts.",
      "Foreman retired in 1997 with a 76-5 career record.",
      "He then moved on to the next chapter in his life as a businessman, pitchman and occasional actor.",
      "He became known to a new generation as the face of the George Foreman Grill. The simple cooking machine sold more than 100 million units and brought him more wealth than boxing. A biographical movie based on his life was released in 2023.",
      "\u201cOf all the traits that I could mention, his faith, his family, his boxing career, his business career, the one that stands out to me as a friend of George Foreman, he never forgot where he came from,\u201d said Houston Mayor John Whitmire.",

      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it \"became clear\" to the government that Jingye was intent on closing down the blast furnaces no matter the financial support offered, prompting it to secure control of the site from its owner.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's trade policy shakeup has caused global economic turmoil.",
    "story": [
      "US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK, as the dust continues to settle from America's global trade shakeup.",
      "\"We're certainly working very hard with Keir Starmer's government,\" Vance said in an interview on Monday with the UnHerd website.",
      "The global stock market has been rocked by turbulence since 2 April, after President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on nearly every country.",
      "The unprecedented US trade policy manoeuvre included a 10% \"baseline\" tariff on all imports from the UK, France and other long-standing trade partners.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "PM: I'll only sign US tariffs deal if it suits UK",
      "UK government sources have suggested that recent talks with the US on a trade deal have been making good progress. It is understood that any deal would focus on more than just lowering tariffs, and cover elements of trade in both goods and services.",
      "In Vance's wide-ranging interview with UnHerd, he suggested a US-UK trade deal would be easier to land than with other European countries due to \"a much more reciprocal relationship\".",
      "He mentioned Germany as an example of a country that exported heavily to the US but by comparison was \"pretty tough on a lot of American\" exports.",
      "After Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, stock markets across the globe took a tumble, with trillions of dollars wiped from the US Stock market in the days after.",
      "The president has since made some exemptions, and stock markets on Monday showed signs of recovery, although they are still down on the month.",
      "Vance said any implementation of a new system is going to make financial markets \"jittery\" and that Trump is committed to the tariff strategy as \"a long-term play\".",
      "\"What we want is to see lower trade deficits, really across the board,\" Vance said.",
      "The vice-president also expressed an affinity for Europe, after disparaging remarks between him and other top US officials were leaked from a private chat.",
      "\"I love European people. I've said repeatedly that I think that you can't separate American culture from European culture,\" Vance said.",
      "He also emphasised points that he and the White House have made repeatedly, saying that Europe needs to better fortify its own self defence.",
      "\"It's not in Europe's interest, and it's not in America's interest, for Europe to be a permanent security vassal of the United States,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance went on to address the war in Ukraine and criticism that the US might be getting too cosy with Russia President Vladimir Putin.",
      "He reiterated the administration's messaging that to end the war \"you have to try to understand\" both sides.",
      "\"That doesn't mean you morally support the Russian cause, or that you support the full-scale invasion,\" Vance said.",
      "\"But you do have to try to understand what are their strategic red lines, in the same way that you have to try to understand what the Ukrainians are trying to get out of the conflict,\" he continued.",
      "On Sunday, Russia launched its deadliest attacks on Ukraine this year, killing at least 35 people and prompting Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to invite Trump to visit his country before any deal is struck with Russia."

    "summary": "First-time buyers will welcome the greater choice although prices are still on the rise.",
    "story": [
      "More low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures.",
      "The number of deals that need a deposit of 5% or 10% have risen to their highest level since then, data from financial information service Moneyfacts suggests.",
      "The extra choice is a boost for first time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates are higher than they were for much of the last 17 years.",
      "And competition is tough, with homes typically listed for just over a month before a sale is agreed, according to separate figures from property website Zoopla show.",
      "The UK housing market has been relatively settled in recent times, although buyers still need to navigate uncertainty over interest rates and changes to stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "'Flourishing choice'",
      "For buyers able to offer a deposit of 5% of the home loan, there are 442 mortgages to choose from, according to Moneyfacts.",
      "Two years ago, the choice was from fewer than half of that total, at 204.",
      "Borrowers able to pay a 10% deposit now have 845 products to choose from, up from 684 in April 2023.",
      "However, they still have to pay a mortgage rate of well over 5% on average, while a borrower who pays a 40% deposit typically pays a rate of under 5%.",
      "It has been hard for many prospective first-time buyers to save due to the rising cost of renting in recent years.",
      "But Rachel Springall, from Moneyfacts, said there was a flourishing choice of mortgages for those whose ability to pay a deposit is stretched.",
      "\"A rise in product availability for aspiring homeowners is a healthy step in the right direction,\" she said.",
      "However she said only 6% of all deals available to borrowers across fixed and variable mortgages had a deposit requirement of 5%, so there was still \"room for improvement\".",
      "Mortgage rates remain difficult to predict owing to uncertainty created by US tariff policy on the wider economy.",
      "While securing a mortgage is one thing, buyers also need to act relatively quickly when it comes to finding a new home, data suggests.",
      "Homes in England and Wales spend an average of 36 days on the market before a sale is agreed, according to news figures from the property portal Zoopla.",
      "Sales were agreed on half of homes within two months of being listed, it said. To complete a sale, sellers and buyers will typically need another four to six months, depending on the complexity of the transaction.",
      "The fastest sales were agreed for two-bedroom homes, at an average of 23 days, while homes with four bedrooms or more typically took an extra 15 days.",
      "Homes in northern regions of England tended to sell faster than homes in the south, where prices are higher, it said.",
      "Even so, the fastest selling, with an agreed sale taking an average of 19 days, had a north-south mix, with Manchester and the London borough of Waltham Forest hitting that mark.",
      "\"Households that are thinking about listing their home and moving in 2025 need to set their asking price at the right level and take the advice of local agents,\" said Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla.",
      "\"Buyers have a lot more choice of homes for sale than a year ago. Aiming too high on the asking price is likely to impact saleability and how long you may have to wait to agree a sale.\"",
      "Zoopla uses a median average figure (the mid-point) for its data. It also discards homes that have been listed for more than six months, as it considers them to be unlikely to sell.",

      "The project is an expansion of Maria 01, a co-working and event space for entrepreneurs and investors, as well as larger corporations that want to collaborate with tech start-ups.",
      "Its existing facilities across the street already house around 240 start-ups. They are spread across six buildings that used to make up the city's first hospital, founded in the 19th Century and notorious in Helsinki for treating patients with the plague.",
      "Now, the current 20,000 sq m site is a hub for companies developing innovative health technologies, alongside AI, cybersecurity, gaming and defence tech start-ups.",
      "\"The whole place is really based on community,\" says Maria 01's CEO Sarita Runeberg. \"We bring people together so they can network\u2026 and find different kinds of resources to grow their businesses.\"",
      "There are also office perks including a pool table, table football, running and ice bathing clubs, and in true Finnish-style, a sauna.",
      "\"We wouldn't be a proper start-up hub if we didn't have our own sauna here!\" laughs Ms Runeberg.",
      "While co-working spaces for tech companies are well established across the Nordics, Maria 01 is the largest of its kind in the region.",
      "It is run as a not-for-profit organisation partly funded by the city of Helsinki, which has invested more than \u20ac6m ($6.7m; \u00a35.2m) in the hub since its launch in 2016.",
      "Ms Runeberg believes it will become the biggest start-up campus in Europe following the completion of three new buildings by 2028, adding a 50,000 sqm floor area.",
      "Later this year it is launching an accelerator programme designed to support and guide high-growth start-ups.",
      "The hub's current and former members have already collectively raised over \u20ac1bn in funding.",
      "This represents around 40% of all early stage funding raised annually by Finnish start-ups.",
      "Ruben Byron is the Belgian co-founder of a start-up offering cloud services to AI developers.",
      "He has already scaled his business from a handful of staff using the hub's hot desks to a team of around 40 working from private offices in the former hospital, as well as remotely.",
      "\"That has been a great experience, that we've kind of been able [to] be nurtured here in a way,\" he says.",
      "Although not as mature \u2013 or well known globally \u2013 as other European start-up hubs like Sweden and the UK, Finland has been steadily making a name for itself in the tech scene over the last two decades.",
      "The small Nordic nation, which has a population of around 5.6 million, has spawned 12 unicorn businesses \u2013 firms worth a billion dollars or more \u2013 including sleep and fitness tracking ring Oura, game developers Supercell, Rovio (the creators of the Angry Birds game), and food delivery platform Wolt.",
      "Last year, Startup Blink, a global index mapping more than 100 countries ranked Finland's start-up ecosystem the 7th best in western Europe, and 14th in the world.",
      "The index cites factors including hubs like Maria 01, alongside high levels of state and university support, and Slush - a huge annual non-profit gathering for global start-ups and investors.",
      "It also highlights Finland's transparent and open business culture.",
      "\"There is an authenticity with the Finns,\" says Jack Parker, a Helsinki-based founder originally from Newcastle upon Tyne, who runs a healthcare innovation start-up.",
      "\"Ego doesn't really play a part. So if I reach out to somebody, it's quite likely eight out of 10 times that they will respond.\"",
      "Finland's right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2023, is on a mission to push the country even further up global indices, stating in its official government programme that it wants the Nordic nation to become a leader in fostering a dynamic start-up and growth company ecosystem.",
      "\"It's not just about rankings,\" says Marjo Ilmari, who runs the start-up services team at Business Finland, the government agency that promotes investment and innovation.",
      "In 2024 Business Finland alone invested \u20ac112m in start-ups, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year.",
      "\"The real goal is to create an environment where our ground-breaking start-ups can emerge and really tackle global challenges.\"",
      "The agency hopes this will help drive growth in the Finnish economy, which went into recession in 2023 and is currently making a sluggish recovery, with the Bank of Finland forecasting an increase of less than 1% this year.",
      "The country is also trying to attract more global talent by offering start-up permits for international founders who want to grow their businesses in Finland.",
      "These entrepreneurs are eligible for a so-called soft-landing support package provided by Business Finland.",
      "\"They give you advice, support, sometimes grants to support the initiation phase,\" explains Lalin Keyvan, a Turkish-born entrepreneur at Maria 01 who says the scheme was one of the main reasons why she relocated to Helsinki.",
      "Business Finland's marketing campaigns for would-be movers highlight social and lifestyle factors too: Finns tend to prioritise wellbeing, plus there's free education and subsidised healthcare and childcare.",
      "\"You don't really have to choose between building a high-growth company and enjoying life, because you can do both,\" says Ms Ilmari.",
      "But whether all this is enough for Finland to compete with Europe's more established start-up hubs is up for debate.",
      "Data suggests it still has a long way to go to catch up with neighbouring Sweden, long the Nordic darling of the European start-up scene.",
      "It is home to more than 40 unicorn businesses including Spotify, payments platform Klarna and game developer King.",
      "In Startup Blink's ecosystem ranking Sweden ranks second in Europe after the UK, and top in the EU.",
      "In the last decade it has attracted more than $29bn in funding compared to just over $8bn in Finland, according to the annual State of European Tech report by investment company Atomico.",
      "\"I love Finland's bold approach,\" says Charlotte Ekelund, CEO of Sting, a non-profit organisation that helps develop start-ups in Stockholm. However she believes Finland is still years behind Sweden in terms of pulling in capital and developing its ecosystem.",
      "\"We observe some of the things that the Finnish ecosystem is doing now, Sting was part of driving 10 or 15 years ago here - co-working spaces, [and] new organisations in the ecosystem that can support in different ways.\"",
      "Mikael Pentikainen, CEO of the Federation of Finnish Enterprises, says the country's government is currently losing support amongst entrepreneurs despite its pro-start-up and pro-business approach.",
      "A recent survey for the organisation found 41% of small and medium-sized business owners are satisfied with the coalition's actions, down from 54% in June.",
      "One likely reason for the dip, says Mr Pentikainen, is a decision to raise VAT from 24% to 25.5% last September, the highest rate in western Europe. The government said this was a \"difficult but necessary\" move designed to stabilise public finances.",
      "But Mr Pentikainen suggests it could make Finland's start-up ecosystem less competitive for international founders.",
      "The Finnish government has also recently toughened up citizenship requirements, meaning foreign entrepreneurs now need to stay at least eight years instead of five in order to obtain a passport, and will soon also be required to pass a test on Finnish society and culture if they want to settle long-term.",
      "Back at Maria 01, Mr Parker, the health company founder, says he's confident Finland's start-up ecosystem will continue to expand and attract international talent. But he warns it might lose some of the aspects that have so far made it an attractive option for entrepreneurs.",
      "\"The advantage of the ecosystem right now is this kind of 'small town, everybody knows each other' [feeling]. Scaling that up, there is the risk of actually losing that element of it.\"",

      "BBC Verify looks at what we know about the extent of Chinese investment in the UK economy - and how much of a concern it should be.",
      "How much Chinese investment is there in the UK in total?",
      "Data from the Office for National Statistics suggests total Chinese investment in the UK in 2023 amounted to about \u00a34.3bn - a small fraction of the total \u00a32 trillion  of overseas investment in the British economy in that year.",
      "However, this is likely to be a considerable underrepresentation of the true scale of Chinese investment in the UK because the official data only includes the immediate investing country, not the ultimate source of the money - and because of a lack of transparency from Beijing when it comes to overseas ownership stakes.",
      "Independent estimates from the American Enterprise Institute think tank, using corporate reports, suggest total public and private Chinese investment in the UK between 2005 and 2024 added up to $105bn, or \u00a382bn.",
      "This would have made Britain the third largest national destination of Chinese investment over this period, after only the US and Australia.",
      "What have Chinese firms invested in?",
      "There is a wide range of Chinese investment in the UK, ranging from critical energy and transport infrastructure, to stakes in private companies and football clubs.",
      "Significant Chinese investments in UK infrastructure include a 10% stake in London's Heathrow airport by the China Investment Corporation, a sovereign wealth fund wholly owned by the Chinese state.",
      "The Hong Kong-based industrialist Li Ka-shing's investment group owns UK Power Networks, which operates electricity distribution infrastructure across London, the South East of England and the East of England.",
      "The billionaire's group also owns a 76% stake in Northumbrian Water Group, which provides water supply and sewerage in the north east of England.",
      "There is also a large Chinese investment in the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset.",
      "China General Nuclear Power Group originally had a 33.5% stake, with the rest owned by the French company EDF.",
      "But EDF reports that the Chinese company has stopped contributing additional financing to the joint project - which has been running over budget - and, as a result the Chinese stake at the end of last year had declined to 27.4%.",
      "The same Chinese company has an even larger stake - 66.5% - in the proposed Bradwell B nuclear site in Essex, according to the project website. EDF owns the rest.",

      "Li Ka-shing's group owns the Suffolk-headquartered pub chain and brewery Greene King.",
      "Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club is owned by the Shanghai-based conglomerate Fosun.",
      "While Jingye steel had total control of the Scunthorpe steel plant, it's important to bear in mind that Chinese investors do not always have majority stakes in UK businesses, which would interfere with their ability to determine those companies' operational decisions.",
      "Some of these organisations such as airports and water utilities are also tightly regulated, potentially limiting the freedom of manoeuvre of their Chinese owners in controlling the assets.",
      "Chinese investors are also estimated to have considerable holdings of UK land and buildings.",

      "The potential danger posed by Chinese investment in UK infrastructure has been extensively debated in recent years - and a particular flashpoint was the involvement of the Shenzhen-based Chinese technology company Huawei in building the UK's 5G communications infrastructure.",
      "Huawei was founded by Ren Zhengfei, a former Chinese army officer, in 1987.",
      "The UK's National Cyber Security Centre initially judged in 2019 that any risk posed by Huawei was manageable.",
      "But the UK, nevertheless, required the Chinese company to begin pulling out of the UK's telecoms infrastructure in 2020, after coming under pressure from the US government during Donald Trump's first term as President.",
      "The involvement of Huawei in UK networks was also opposed by a number of MPs.",
      "Grace Theodoulou, policy fellow on China at the Council on Geostrategy, says there are two main potential threats to consider for Chinese investment in UK critical infrastructure.",
      "\"The first is the potential for espionage \u2013 for example, having Chinese-made audiovisual equipment installed in government buildings or devices.",
      "\"The second is the infrastructure can be controlled by the manufacturer and, as such, could be disrupted for geopolitical leverage,\" she said.",
      "Some analysts argue that Chinese law - which mandates all Chinese companies to align closely with Chinese Communist Party directives and to assist with national intelligence efforts - represents an inherent security risk in all Chinese investments in Western infrastructure.",
      "\"A likely scenario where it might be in China's interests [to harm UK infrastructure] would be to impede Britain's ability to impose sanctions against Beijing in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.",
      "\"If China were to invade Taiwan, and should they have control over parts of our critical infrastructure, it would highly impact the potential to enforce sanctions or similar measures,\" Ms Theodoulou said.",
      "However, other analysts are sceptical over whether it would be in the financial interest of Chinese investors to sabotage UK infrastructure or firms, as such actions would collapse the value of their investments and likely lead to their appropriation by the UK government.",
      "\"This threat is asserted and not proven, and these companies are profit-driven so it is not in their interests to sabotage our infrastructure,\" said Prof Giles Mohan of the Open University.",

      "The FTC pointed to a 2011 email Mr Zuckerberg sent saying: \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly.\"",
      "The following year, he sent another email saying the company was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are... I worry that it will take us too long to catch up\".",

      "\"Acquisitions to improve and grow\" have never been found unlawful, Meta's lead litigator, said on Monday, \"and they should not be found unlawful here\".",
      "Meta said last year that it had 3.27 billion daily active users across its products.",
      "Instagram was expected to account for more than half of Meta's advertising revenue in the US in 2025. according to research firm Emarketer.",
      "Meta has been making regular overtures to Trump since his election.",
      "The company contributed $1m to Trump's inaugural fund, and has added former Trump adviser Dina Powell McCormick and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) boss Dana White, a Trump ally, to Meta's board of directors this year.",

      "From the end of April, the 500-year-old Royal Mail will be controlled by a Czech billionaire who co-owns a football club and is a major investor in a British supermarket - so, why would he want this ailing institution?",
      "\"A pair of scissors, one empty teapot and some hot water, please.\" The slightly baffled staff at Claridge's scrambled to comply with Daniel Kretinsky's breakfast order as he sanitised and moisturised his hands.",
      "The upscale hotel has been serving tea to the global elite for decades but Mr Kretinsky brought along his own packet of Chinese green tea, which he snipped open (hence the scissors) and poured into the empty pot.",
      "He was tall, perfectly groomed, steely-eyed but unfalteringly polite and thoughtful. If you told anyone in the dining room he was a billionaire, they would have no problem believing it.",
      "Known as the Czech Sphinx for his enigmatic style, Mr Kretinsky, who is 49, is worth \u00a36bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He lives in plush mansions in Paris and London, was originally a lawyer and made his fortune in European energy markets.",
      "Our meeting was at Claridge's in June 2024 - I was trying to convince him to give me an interview about his audacious attempt to buy a British institution that was once seen as a national treasure: Royal Mail.",
      "His profile as a buyer was one that unions and ministers typically would be wary of because of his historic connections with Russia - his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe.",
      "But six months on, his bid to buy Royal Mail's parent company was cleared by the UK government after he agreed \"legally binding\" undertakings.",
      "The government was awarded a so-called \"golden share\", requiring it to be notified of any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, headquarters location and tax residency. The deal was also blessed by unions.",
      "Earlier this month, the owner of Royal Mail said that the takeover could be completed by the end of April as the deal cleared the final regulatory hurdles standing in the way.",
      "But step back and Royal Mail seems a strange target for a globally mobile oil and gas billionaire investor to set his sights on. It begs the question why would anyone, let alone a successful international entrepreneur, want to buy this faded relic?",
      "How Royal Mail's crown slipped",
      "Royal Mail was founded by Henry VIII more than 500 years ago and still carries the royal cipher on its vans. It is part of the fabric of British life and many people still have a fond relationship with their 'postie', who walks down their path bringing their letters and parcels to their door.",
      "But in recent years Royal Mail's crown has slipped. It is losing money and market share, has been fined for missing delivery targets and has made an enemy of its own workforce through a series of bitter strikes.",
      "Royal Mail's letter business is in steep decline too. It has gone from a peak of 20 billion letters sent in 2004 to under seven billion sent last year.",
      "In December 2024, it was fined \u00a310.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.",
      "While the boom in e-commerce has seen the volume of parcels rise, Royal Mail's share of that more profitable business has been falling as new competitors like DPD, DHL, Amazon and Evri have eaten into its market share.",
      "Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office in 2012 and privatised in 2013 at a value of \u00a33.3bn. Its shares immediately rocketed by 38% on the first day of trading, leading to criticism - from the National Audit Office, among others - that it had been sold on the cheap.",
      "At its peak in Covid-era May 2021, the company was worth more than \u00a36bn but had slumped to just over \u00a32bn when Mr Kretinsky launched his takeover bid last April.",
      "He sealed the deal at \u00a33.6bn - 63% higher than before he signalled his intent, but barely more than it was worth at privatisation over a decade ago.",
      "\"Royal Mail is a business that has historically found it difficult to grow revenues by more than costs,\" says Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt stockbrokers. \"It has seen its parcels market share eroded by more dynamic competition that has been able to invest more in technology, and it has struggled with industrial relations to keep staff working towards a common goal.",
      "\"This is not a challenge to underestimate nor one that can be overcome quickly, but that requires considerable long-term investment in infrastructure, technology and staff.\"",
      "Part of the challenge, and one that puts Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared with its rivals, is that unlike them, Royal Mail has to meet a string of legal and regulatory obligations, says Hazel King, the editor of Parcel and Post Technology International.",
      "Under what is called the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. So it cannot pick and choose which business it wants to do.",
      "\"Royal Mail must meet their universal service obligation while trying to compete with private firms who often cherry-pick the most profitable business,\" says Ms King.",
      "The 'Czech Sphinx's' plan",
      "Mr Kretinsky says he has a plan. His success in the energy sector allowed him to buy a 27.5% stake in Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS). And his company \u2013 EP Group \u2013 intends to build a pan-European conglomerate built on three pillars: energy, retail and logistics.",
      "He sees IDS as the cornerstone of the logistics pillar, with a plan to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Deutsche Post DHL, DPD and Amazon.",
      "The USO has been under review by Ofcom, with Royal Mail hoping that the regulator will reduce the requirement to deliver second-class letters from six days a week to every other weekday. That single move could save Royal Mail \u00a3300m a year \u2013 putting it back on a break-even footing.",
      "Mr Kretinsky told me during our interview that he would honour the USO \"as long as I am alive\", but he is unsurprisingly very much in favour of changing its terms. He said he hopes that \"rational minds prevail\" when reforming a service that is unsustainable in its current form.",
      "So far, the noises from Ofcom seem to be supportive. The regulator's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\".",
      "Given letter numbers are falling, \"we have to think about what is economical\", she said, adding Ofcom would be publishing plans for the regulation of Royal Mail \"to make sure it is sustainable\".",
      "While Royal Mail generally welcomed the proposed changes to the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail pushed back against proposed new delivery time and business customer requirements.",
      "Royal Mail said last week that the level at which Ofcom is proposing to set the new delivery targets \u2013 99.5% of First Class letters delivered within three days, and the same percentage of Second Class letters within five \u2013 is \"over specified and will add significant cost to the delivery of the Universal Service\".",
      "It also expressed concerns that proposals to add a new category of regulation to ensure timely delivery for business users like direct mail companies \"goes against the wider government drive to reduce unnecessary regulation\".",
      "European parcel know-how",
      "But there are other factors that may have driven the sale. Some analysts have speculated that there is another jewel in the crown of IDS - and that Mr Kretinsky may really be after a different part of the business.",
      "Along with Royal Mail, IDS also owns a European parcels business called GLS which it acquired in 1999 \u2013 long before Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office and privatised.",
      "Last year GLS made a profit of \u00a3320m, compared to Royal Mail, which lost \u00a3348m as letter volumes continued to plunge and new competitors ate into its market share of the more profitable parcels business.",
      "\"GLS has been a profitable growth business, which has seen investment whereas Royal Mail has been a perpetual underperformer, as the board of parent company IDS has invested where it thinks it will see the best returns,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "Mr Kretinsky rejects suggestions from some quarters that he wants to break up the group and has committed to keeping it together for at least five years. Even beyond that, he says the plan is to grow the company rather than shrink it, so a disposal of GLS would be \"nonsensical\".",
      "In fact, Mr Kretinsky says he hopes to bring the European parcel know-how at GLS to bear on Royal Mail's operations.",
      "What the unions are hoping, and Kretinsky is promising, is that Royal Mail will see greater investment and over time begin to look a bit more like GLS and its European counterparts such as Deutche Post DHL.",
      "Catching up with competitors",
      "Given all the challenges Royal Mail faces, there's an obvious question - why would a billionaire want to chance his arm on turning round something that others couldn't, while up against powerful competitors?",
      "Well, if you believe as Kretinsky does - and he is surely right - that getting parcels to people is a profitable and growing industry, then buying Royal Mail and GLS gives you a way to become a big European player in logistics quickly.",
      "Add to that a powerful and historic brand, a database with every single UK address and a frontline workforce that most of its customers are fond of and pleased to see when they walk down the path - then, despite the challenges, it begins to make sense.",
      "Mr Kretinsky is convinced future growth lies in out-of-home (OOH) delivery. The parcel lockers found in supermarket car parks and elsewhere, operated by the likes of Amazon, Evri and UPS, have grown quickly across Europe.",
      "Earlier this month it was reported that Sainsbury's would be the first supermarket to partner with Royal Mail and install parcel lockers at supermarkets. Some are already operating at several stores including ones in Clapham, Kidderminster and Chislehurst.",
      "Royal Mail has also trialled a new postbox that can take small parcels. Customers procure a barcode from an app, then at the postbox they scan the barcode and drop the parcel into a drawer - this is all powered by solar panels on the box.",
      "Emma Gilthorpe, Royal Mail chief executive, called it an \"historic change\" to give postboxes \"a new lease of life\".",
      "All of this boils down to the same thing: convenience. It means customers don't have to wait at home for a delivery - the sender or parcel business emails or texts a code to unlock the locker. For the business it's more efficient, allowing couriers to deliver lots of parcels to one place - meaning fewer miles on the road and less time.",
      "\"If they can grow the parcels business and claw back market share, there is every chance that they can add new jobs that could offset the reduction in jobs in the declining letters business,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "\"There is a significant long-term opportunity to run Royal Mail more successfully with regulatory changes to the USO and greater investment in technology and out-of-home deliveries.\"",
      "But Royal Mail still has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. It currently has 1,500 lockers in the UK and aims to grow this figure to at least 20,000 over time. By contrast, Amazon already has 5,000 lockers across the UK and InPost has 7,500 across the UK.",
      "Winning over doubters",
      "That Mr Kretinsky has pulled off the takeover is no easy feat. Royal Mail is, after all, considered vital national infrastructure and as such the deal required review under national security laws.",
      "Then there is the fact that his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe \u2013 paid for and approved by EU member states. The small amount that was transported was reduced to zero at the end of 2024 when Ukraine refused to renew permission for any gas to flow across its borders.",
      "Speaking in front of MPs in November, UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company two years ago.",
      "Getting the unions on board seemed even more of a challenge and the Communication Workers Union was wary of Mr Kretinsky. \"The CWU believes Royal Mail should be in public hands,\" Dave Ward, the CWU's general secretary, told the BBC in June. \"We know there are legitimate concerns about Royal Mail Group being owned by a foreign private equity investor.\"",
      "But during negotiations, union representatives secured a series of time-limited commitments from him, including guarantees that he will protect Royal Mail's pension surplus, that there will be no compulsory redundancies for two years, no sell-off or break-up of any operational part of the existing company and no outsourcing of grades represented by the CWU.",
      "Mr Kretinsky also agreed to restrictions on moving dividends out of Royal Mail Group and to respect agreements with and recognition of the CWU. He said he would keep the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years.",
      "Union bosses told me that a life under Mr Kretinsky \"couldn't be any worse than what we have had for the last 10 years\".",
      "So, as Mr Kretinsky looks certain to pull off the sale, what will customers notice?",
      "The frequency of second-class deliveries may be reduced after the Ofcom review. We will see new Royal Mail lockers appearing in our neighbourhoods. And the price of first-class mail may go up: second-class stamps are regulated by Ofcom, while first-class ones are not.",
      "The monarch's head will still be on those stamps, but there is a new king of our mail system. And his name is Daniel Kretinsky.",

      "The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, to prevent it from closing.",
      "A race is now on to try and secure raw materials to stop the plant's blast furnaces from shutting down.",
      "What is British Steel and why is it important?",
      "British Steel's Scunthorpe plant employs 2,700 people, about three-quarters of the company's workforce.",
      "It is the last plant in the UK producing virgin steel, which is used in major construction projects like buildings and railways. It has fewer imperfections than the recycled steel made elsewhere in the country.",
      "Were the plant to stop producing virgin steel, the UK would be the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make it. The government views that as a risk to the UK's economic security.",

      "Live: China warns UK against 'politicising' British Steel",
      "UK takes control of British Steel under emergency powers",
      "Why is British Steel Chinese-owned?",
      "In 2016, Tata Steel sold the loss-making part of its business that made \"long products\" like transport rails and steel sections for construction.",
      "Private investment firm Greybull Capital bought it for \u00a31 and renamed the business British Steel.",
      "However, following financial collapse in 2019, British Steel was taken over by the government's insolvency service.",
      "It was sold to Chinese steel-making firm Jingye the following year.",
      "Can British Steel's blast furnaces keep running?",
      "Scunthorpe's skyline has four blast furnaces, all named after English Queens - Bess, Mary, Anne and Victoria. Bess and Anne are the only two still working.",
      "The supplies needed to keep them running - coking coal and iron pellets - are running low.",
      "However, the government says the materials are \"in the country\". Officials are \"working as fast as they possibly can\" to get them to the plant.",
      "On Saturday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it had become clear that Jingye intended to \"refuse\" to buy enough material to keep the furnaces running, and \"to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders\".",
      "\"The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel,\" he added.",
      "Why can't a blast furnace easily be restarted?",
      "Turning off a blast furnace without making it permanently unusable is notoriously difficult.",
      "The furnaces operate at extreme temperatures, with iron ore and coking coal poured in at the top and liquid iron extracted at the bottom. This iron goes to the steel plant to make steel.",
      "If a furnace stops working, the molten metal will cool and solidify. This is called a \"salamander\".",
      "When the furnace is turned back on this metal heats up again and expands which can crack the furnace.",
      "A so-called \"Salamander Tap\" process can be used to temporarily shut down a blast furnace by drilling a hole to remove any remaining hot metal. However, this can be a dangerous process.",
      "Has British Steel been nationalised?",
      "The emergency legislation fast-tracked through Parliament on Saturday gives the government the ability to order raw materials for the furnaces and to direct the company's workforce and managers.",
      "Any employees sacked by the Chinese owners can be reinstated and the plant can be entered by force, if necessary, to secure assets.",
      "But Jingye will retain ownership of it for now.",
      "This means British Steel has not been nationalised - which is when a government takes ownership and control of a company.",
      "However, the business secretary acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\" as there are currently no companies willing to buy the plant.",
      "If British Steel is nationalised, taxpayers' money will be used to run it. Reynolds says it is currently making an annual net loss of \u00a3233m, but had the furnaces been allowed to shut the cost to the taxpayer would be higher.",
      "Why is the Scunthorpe plant losing money?",
      "In late March 2025, Jingye said the plant was losing around \u00a3700,000 a day and launched a consultation on its closure.",
      "It said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable,\" blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with moving to lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government UK government briefing, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",
      "After the government took control of the plant, China's embassy in the UK said it was \"closely following\" developments.",
      "It said: \"It is an objective fact that British steel companies have generally encountered difficulties in recent years.\"",
      "Who else produces steel in the UK?",
      "There are 1,160 businesses in the UK steel industry, directly supporting 40,000 other firms, according to government figures.",
      "Tata Steel at Port Talbot in Wales was once the UK's largest virgin steel producer but it turned off its blast furnace in September 2024, saying it was losing \u00a31.7m a day.",
      "An agreement with the UK government was reached which saw it commit \u00a3500m to help the company move to greener forms of steelmaking.",
      "Other steelmakers in the UK include Liberty Steel, Celsa, Marcegaglia and Outokumpu.",
      "Liberty Steel also has a plant in Scunthorpe which is facing closure. More than 120 jobs are at risk, with bosses blaming high energy costs.",
      "In 2023 the UK steel industry contributed \u00a32.3 billion to the UK economy -  equivalent to 0.1% of total UK economic output and 1.0% of manufacturing output.",
      "In the same year, the UK produced 5.6 million tonnes of crude steel, or 0.3% of the world's total. In comparison, China produced more than 1,000 million tonnes, 54% of global production.",
      "The EU produced 126 million tonnes of steel in 2023, 7% of the world's total. Compared with EU countries, the UK ranked as the eighth largest steel producer, after Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Austria, Poland and Belgium.",

    "story": [
      "Well, well, well.",
      "In a US customs messaging note quietly slipped out in the early hours of Saturday, a series of numbers were listed as exempt from the 125% tariff on goods entering the country from China.",
      "The code \"8517.13.00.00\" means very little to most of the world, but in the US customs list it represents smartphones.",
      "The inclusion meant the number one Chinese export to America by value last year was exempted from the import taxes, alongside other electronic devices and components, including semiconductors, solar cells and memory cards.",
      "In the context of the US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick just days ago announcing that part of the point of escalating tariffs on China was to bring back iPhone production to the US, this was a stunning about-turn.",
      "The US has now excluded the single biggest Chinese export, and certainly the most high-profile finished good from tariffs, without publicly announcing it at first.",
      "It is worth considering what would have happened in the absence of this exemption.",
      "The effect of 125% tariffs on Apple's Zhengzhou manufacturing facility in eastern China would have started to show in weeks at most American Apple stores. It would have been a totemic \"sticker shock\" for the White House's tumultuous tariff push.",
      "According to Counterpoint, a global technology market research firm, as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China.",
      "The tech giant's manufacturing profit margins are estimated to be between 40-60%. Typical iPhone prices might have moved closer to $2,000 (\u00a31,528) than $1,000. The other option for Apple could have been to spread the cost across all of its global prices, but would the rest of the world accept paying a Trump tariff tax?",
      "A very public repricing of iPhones has been avoided, but still may occur if, as the White House has said, the previously imposed 20% tariffs on China related to the powerful opioid fentanyl, remain in place.",
      "Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, is a key player here. He can walk into a meeting with both US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. It is not an outlandish prediction to suggest that, if it comes, any peace in the US-China trade war could be brokered by Mr Cook.",
      "That's based on his deep fundamental role in connecting the two economies. He was hand-selected by Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs for his unrivalled expertise in just-in-time supply logistics.",
      "'Art of the Repeal'",
      "This is all moving rather quickly now. Weekend reports in the US press claim White House trade hawk Pete Navarro is being sidelined too, in favour of US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "Navarro was the author of the infamous equation that set so-called reciprocal tariff rates in proportion to the size of a country's trade surplus with the US, calling it \"the sum of all cheating\".",
      "Bessent is now leading negotiations with trade partners seeking to avoid the reapplication of those rates after the 90-day pause.",
      "There is a big question after 10 days of chaos. What is the incentive for other nations to offer much here? The Trump administration is clearly spooked by the bond market reaction to the president's trade plans, and questions surrounding the safe haven status of US debt for investors.",
      "In trying to stave off effective interest rates on bonds rising to 5%, the US needs deals more than just those in surplus countries.",
      "Indeed this weekend's broad range of exemptions are in and of themselves an astonishing U-turn on the principle embodied in the notorious tariff chart held up by Trump in the Rose Garden.",
      "Just under a quarter of China's total exports are now exempt from the 125% tariff, according to Capital Economics.",
      "The consultancy suggests there are other big winners from the exemptions, with 64% of exports to the US from Taiwan, 44% from Malaysia, and just under 30% from both Vietnam and Thailand now also exempt.",
      "The 10% universal tariff is now riddled with exemptions, and the biggest carve outs are for many nations with massive trade surpluses from electronics manufacturing.",
      "The new tariff equation is to give an effective discount from the universal 10% (through exemptions) to those with the biggest surpluses. For example, Taiwan has a $74bn surplus with the US, and Vietnam a $124bn surplus.",
      "This is the exact opposite of the infamous Navarro calculation from last week. In 10 days we've gone from the \"looters and pillagers\" will be hit the hardest, to (apart from China) those with big surpluses getting the biggest exemptions.",
      "Meanwhile an ally such as the UK, which according to US figures has a $12bn deficit - i.e. the US sells more to the UK than the other way round, has a 25% tariff on cars, its biggest goods exports, with number two, medicines, in line for similar charges.",
      "The White House has gone from clearly suggesting there would be no negotiation on the baseline 10% tariffs to offering exemptions to the very products causing the deficit the entire policy was supposed to solve.",
      "This is a lot more than a \"row back\". Some have called it the \"Art of the Repeal\". The 4D chess has been replaced by someone playing one dimensional checkers, but unable to tell the difference between opposing pieces.",

      "\"I said, 'We've got to switch this out now,'\" the 43-year-old recalled. \"Let's take care of it.\"",
      "The move was a sign of the pressure rising across the US, where households are being buffeted by what could be staggering price rises, and even possible shortages triggered by the sweeping tariffs that US President Donald Trump announced this month.",
      "Some are trying to stock up. Others say they feel paralysed by the changes, which have come quickly, or hope Trump will change his mind and reverse course - not an entirely unreasonable hope given the rapid changes in policy.",
      "Trump, facing financial market revolt over his latest tariffs, has already altered his plans repeatedly.",
      "First, he scaled back duties that had been planned on some countries, such as the European Union, in what was described as a 90-day pause.",
      "Then, as market turmoil continued, he exempted smartphones and other electronics from the duties, announcing the carve-out just a few days after Mr Medina felt pressure to make a purchase.",
      "\"I can't keep up with the president. Every day is something new,\" said Anna Woods, 42, who recently received a message from her son's summer camp warning that the tariffs might affect pricing of standard gear such as T-shirts.",
      "The 42-year-old, who works in legal operations, says she is nervous but unclear how to proceed.",
      "\"I just feel like we're living in uncertain times,\" she said, adding: \"I do need to make some purchases .... Everything is going up.\"",
      "The latest tariffs include a 10% tax on the vast majority of imports - and an eye-popping 145% duty on goods from China, which is the third biggest supplier of imports to the US after the European Union and Mexico and a key source of essentials such as smartphones, shoes and umbrellas.",
      "The measures followed previous orders that added 25% levies on cars, steel, aluminium and some goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "In all, Trump's orders have pushed the average effective tariff rate on imports in the US to the highest level in more than a century.",
      "In stores, the immediate impact has been limited, since many firms stockpiled some products in anticipation of some tariffs.",
      "But the tariffs are widely expected to lead to higher prices in the months ahead, especially for items such as clothing, leather goods, electronics and toys, many of which are made in China.",
      "The Budget Lab at Yale forecasts that prices for clothing could soar by more than 60% in the short run; basic pharmaceutical products could jump by 12%, and food prices rise by 2.6%.",
      "All told, the typical US family is facing a roughly $4,700 jump in costs due to the new taxes, if purchase patterns remain the same, it estimates.",
      "\"I'm extremely worried about it,\" said 38-year-old mother Jamie Casey, one of more than a dozen people shopping at a Target in Brooklyn on a recent afternoon who shared their thoughts with the BBC about the tariffs.",
      "She was in the store picking up formula - and some onesies and outfits for her daughter, who has yet to turn one.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I'm panic-buying yet, but I am interested in how it plays out.\"",
      "Major retailers experienced a jump in visits in the weeks leading up to Trump's tariff announcement, according to research firm Placer.ai, while purchases at the likes of Walmart and Target increased markedly in the immediate aftermath, according to data tracked by ConsumerEdge.",
      "There has also been an uptick in US purchases on Amazon's e-commerce platform, where Chinese sellers dominate, CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC recently.",
      "\"I don't know if we can necessarily conclude it's panic-buying but there seems to be broad stock-up behaviour,\" said Michael Gunther, head of insights at ConsumerEdge, noting that two separate data sets used by the firm showed a pick-up.",
      "Cristina Montoya said she had been buying extra canned food and frozen fruit, a little at a time for a few months, anxious about possible price increases, especially as a pensioner reliant on a fixed income.",
      "\"You never used to do your shopping nervous,\" the 74-year-old said. \"I feel like you have to buy a lot of things because you don't know what's going to happen.\"",
      "The dynamic has added to the tariff turmoil.",
      "Last week, as the measures came into effect, some businesses started introducing tariff surcharges, while others abruptly cancelled shipments from China, unwilling to risk being unable to recoup the cost of the duties.",
      "The disruption has the potential to cause near-term shortages in the US of items where China dominates the supply, such as baby carriages, colouring books and umbrellas, analysts at Macquarie noted this week.",
      "Analysts say the pickup in consumer purchases is likely to prove temporary, or an acceleration of transactions that would have happened anyway.",
      "If price rises start to hit, many economists expect Americans to opt for cheaper substitutes, delay purchases, or simply do without - a pullback with major consequences for an economy driven by consumer spending.",
      "Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, is predicting the US economy will grow just 0.5% this year, and the unemployment rate will rise to 5% - the highest level since 2021 amid Covid.",
      "Other firms, such as JP Morgan, are forecasting an outright recession.",
      "\"In terms of the consumer, it does get a little tricky,\" Ms Bostjancic said.",
      "\"We could see consumer spending actually be strong in March and April but it's just because of this surge ahead of the tariff increases,\" she added. \"Going forward, consumer spending is going to be weaker.\"",
      "On surveys, fears about both the economy and price rises are flaring, even though hiring has been solid and inflation cooled to 2.4% in March, down from 2.8% in February.",
      "Some people shopping in New York said it felt like a whole way of life could be coming to an end.",
      "Louis Lopez, an elevator mechanic in New York City, said he was so worried about the economy he had started to squirrel away cash under the mattress. But he was also holding shopping bags with new work clothes and a pair of Nike trainers for the summer.",
      "\"You might as well buy it now ... while you have it good,\" the 56-year-old said. \"It's going to change everything for everybody.\"",

      "Businesses say that as well as poor internal processes at the Department for Work and Pensions, there has also been a large increase in the bureaucracy associated with Access to Work in recent months, with many more forms having to be filled in and then posted \u2013 not uploaded or emailed \u2013 to the DWP.",

      "In Newton Abbott in Devon, a cafe that employed people with learning disabilities shut last month. Its founders say new restrictions and problems with Access to Work contributed to the closure.",
      "Sarah Thorp, who set up the No Limits cafe, said the scheme had in recent months started to refuse funding for people who wanted to get some work experience.",
      "The decision came despite the local Job Centre recommending the individuals to the cafe.  The change left the business with a shortfall of \u00a3800 a week.",

      "Steve Darling MP, the Lib Dem Work and Pensions spokesperson, says that while the principles behind Access to Work are excellent, \"individuals and businesses are often covering significant sums from their own savings while waiting for payments from Access to Work, which risks pushing people into debt, or businesses even closing down.

      "The economy expanded by 0.5%, with the services sector having a strong month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.",
      "The better-than-expected figures come as the UK economy braces itself for the impact of tariffs imposed on goods imported to the US, with analysts warning that growth could prove short-lived.",
      "Tariffs on steel and aluminium came into effect on 12 March, while a 10% tariff on other goods came into effect this week.",
      "Goods exports from the UK to the US increased for the third consecutive month and are now at the highest level since November 2022, the ONS said.",
      "\"There are clear signs that UK firms increased goods exports to the US ahead of the introduction of tariffs,\" said William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).",
      "\"Data for the past three months shows a 23% increase in the value of goods flowing from the UK across the Atlantic,\" Mr Bain said.",
      "Economists had predicted UK growth of just 0.1% in February, but the ONS said several factors contributed to the surprise rise which was driven by a boost in manufacturing and production.",
      "The government has made growing the UK economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said February's surprise growth was due to computer programming, telecoms and car dealerships in the services sector all having \"strong months\".",
      "She added that manufacturing, electronics and pharmaceutical businesses performed well, and the car making industry also picked up after \"its recent poor performance\".",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the latest growth figures an \"encouraging sign\", but added the government was \"not complacent\".",
      "\"We must go further and faster to kickstart economic growth, provide security for working people and put more money in their pockets,\" she added.",
      "The UK is subject to the blanket 10% tariff on nearly all of its goods being brought into the US, which is expected to hit British exporters and also affect economic growth.",
      "Mr Bain from the BCC said securing a deal with the US and removing trade barriers with the EU would be \"key to cushioning the negative impacts of the sweeping new US tariffs\".",
      "Speaking to reporters, Reeves said: \"We continue to engage with our counterparts in the United States and of course we want to secure the best deal possible for British jobs and British industry and we are absolutely committed and resolved to do everything we can,\" she told reporters.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Alongside the better-than-expected growth, the ONS revised up its figure for January from a contraction of 0.1% to no growth.",
      "Monthly figures alone can be volatile so should be taken in context. The more stable three-month average to February shows growth is up 0.6%.",
      "This would have been considered normal growth a decade ago, but has been elusive in recent years.",
      "However, it suggests that recent talk of a recession has been way off the mark.",
      "But February's figure comes ahead of the impact of tax rises on businesses and household energy and water bill increases on the economy, along with US tariffs.",
      "Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist, said the UK's \"surprisingly strong growth will prove short lived, as rises in tariffs and taxes bite\".",
      "\"The big picture is that the economy has grown in only four of the last nine months and it's hard to see the economy strengthening much from here,\" she said.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: \"Since coming to office, Labour's choices have killed growth stone dead and there is still a long way to go to recover.\"",

    "summary": "Countries break ten-year deadlock to agree measures to reduce commercial shipping emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.",
      "The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.",
      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",
      "Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\".",
      "Shipping agrees net-zero goal but critics unmoved",
      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water molecules to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",
      "Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.",
      "\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.",
      "It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.",
      "But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.",
      "Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.",
      "\"It is a difficult set of decisions, but it is the first regulation of its kind and that is to be celebrated,\" he said.",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.",
      "\"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said.",
      "Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.",
      "It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken.",
      "Although the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "But industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations.",
      "The US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised.",

    "story": [
      "The Caribbean nation of Guyana is breathing a sigh of relief after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the introduction of higher tariffs on a number of countries.",
      "Guyana, which is nestled between Venezuela and Suriname on the South American mainland, had been singled out for rates of 38% on many of its exports.",
      "Following Trump's change in policy, it now faces tariffs of only 10% - the same as all countries apart from Canada, China and Mexico.",
      "But why had Guyana been facing a higher levy in the first place?",
      "Guyanese political commentator Francis Bailey says the country is caught in a geopolitical battle between the US and China. Or more specifically - Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in Guyana.",
      "Recent years have seen billions of dollars of investment in Guyana by Chinese entities, in everything from roads and hospitals, to hotels and shopping centres. And a crucial new bridge linking the capital Georgetown to the western region of Demerara-Mahaica is currently under construction by a Beijing-based company.",
      "For its part, the US continues to be happy to buy Guyana's key exports of crude oil, gold and bauxite, which is the ore from which aluminium is extracted. These were all to be exempt from the planned 38% tariff, which instead would have hit Guyana's fishing and sugar industries.",
      "The US also backs Guyana in its territorial dispute with Venezuela over the vast Essequibo region that forms the western two thirds of Guyana. During a visit to Georgetown in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Venezuela of \"consequences\" if it were to use force against Guyana.",
      "But the planned high tariff showed Washington's ire, says Mr Bailey. \"I think the reason we had been given such high tariffs is to apply pressure on Guyana.",
      "\"The US is saying, 'if you want our protection you need to chase the Chinese out of your country'. Trump is a very transactional president \u2013 and Guyana is in a very precarious position against its sabre-rattling adversary Venezuela which has been ramping up acts of aggression.\"",
      "The Guyanese government did not respond to requests for comments. The country, once one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere, and a former British colony, has been enjoying a surge in wealth since it first discovered oil in its territorial waters in 2015.",
      "Last year it exported $3.13bn (\u00a32.4bn) of crude oil to the US, according to United Nations figures.",
      "Across the Caribbean all countries now face a 10% tariff on their exports to the US. However, it is the price impact of Trump's global tariffs on what they import from the US that is of most concern.",
      "This is because the Caribbean's love for, and reliance on, US products is immediately apparent when you glance at a High Street or supermarket shelf across the region. In fact, some islands are said to import as much as 70% of their consumer goods from their North American neighbour.",
      "And with American goods that rely on overseas raw materials or components set to go up in price, this will inevitably be passed on to consumers in the Caribbean.",
      "Also, much of what Caribbean nations buy from other countries around the world comes to them via the US.",
      "So with the White House now hitting Chinese goods coming into the US with tariffs of 125%, Chinese items that are then reexported to the Caribbean should see price hikes of a similar amount. And by around 10% for goods from other countries that arrive via the US.",
      "With already ever-increasing shipping costs in the Caribbean, and high local import duties causing exorbitant prices in a region beset by low wages, the impact of Trump's tariffs could be profound and keenly felt.",
      "In Antigua and Barbuda, interior designer Carissa Warner tells the BBC that 70% of her materials are imported from the US, and 20% from China.",
      "\"Some of my projects are on hold while we wait to see what happens,\" she explains. \"I am extremely worried from a business aspect but also just as a local consumer.",
      "\"I'm so worried about the cost of food I have been looking online for pots to start growing fresh produce. I don't think people realise the impact it will have on us.\"",
      "Ms Warner believes one way Caribbean governments could ease the squeeze on their people is by lowering their own import duties, which are partially calculated using a percentage of an item's cost.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's Prime Minister Gaston Browne has dubbed global tariffs \"extremely worrisome\" and is urging citizens to \"buy smarter and buy local\".",
      "Trump's tariffs come as the Caribbean is already grappling with a confluence of harsh economic conditions from the cost of cleaning up after frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, to the aftereffects of the Covid pandemic.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Sanders, says that the US has long enjoyed a trade surplus with most Caribbean countries.",
      "\"For decades, we have helped sustain American prosperity by collectively importing far more from the United States than we export,\" he says.",
      "\"The problem we have created for ourselves is that we have been dependent on the US market for such a long time and have not sought to diversify into other markets.\"",
      "As for the 10% tariff on Caribbean exports to the US, Sir Ronald says: \"Any loss is not a good thing for our small economies, but the 10% that we face is not going to disrupt our goods from going to the US market.\"",
      "The Caribbean islands' small market sizes, high labour costs and remoteness from principle markets has kept their manufacturing sectors relatively modest. Their exports include many niche products like specialist rums and indigenous foods such as ackee, a fruit from Jamaica.",
      "\"These kinds of products are all orientated to a certain kind of market and will not face any competition because the US does not produce them, and the countries that do face their own tariffs,\" Sir Ronald continues.",
      "Exacerbating worries in the Caribbean are potential additional taxes on Chinese-built ships entering US ports of up to $1.5m per docking. This idea was mooted by the White House in February.",
      "Many fear that will aggravate freight costs in the Caribbean, and lead to further hikes in the price of everyday goods, given the large volume of items sold in the region that are manufactured in China.",
      "Sir Ronald adds that tacking the problem of an overreliance on the US \"can only come from diversifying the market, but that's not an overnight achievement\".",
      "He adds: \"It's not as easy to set up new markets as people think. It's not governments who control trade; it's the private sector. And much of what we buy will still come via the US.\"",
      "Many Caribbean leaders feel the best strategy to thwart the fallout from tariffs is to negotiate as a bloc.",
      "Mia Mottley, chair of the intergovernmental group Caricom, said the region was facing the most challenging of times since its 15 member states gained independence several decades ago.",
      "\"We are working and will continue to work to become more self-sufficient, but\u2026 this trade war will mean higher prices for all of us,\" she said in a recent statement.",
      "Ms Mottley added that it was vital to redouble efforts to \"invest in Caribbean agricultural production and light manufacturing\".",
      "\"We must build our ties with Africa, Central and Latin America, and renew those ties with some of our older partners around the world, in the United Kingdom and Europe, and in Canada. We must not rely solely on one or two markets.\"",
      "Ms Mottley, who is also the prime minister of Barbados, is calling for Washington to \"work with\" the Caribbean to keep prices down.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqj3z4g0e1o",
    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 23:07:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Cocoa prices are soaring so new chocolate firms are looking at an alternative ingredient.",
    "story": [
      "The first thing I notice is the lack of a strong aroma. There's no familiar, powerful waft of cocoa when opening this bag of sweets, the packet of biscuits, or the caramel-filled truffles.",
      "And as I taste each one as part of my solemn commitment to inform the public, I don't get quite the same burst of chocolate flavour that you might expect from treats with that familiar, waxy, light brown chocolate-like coating. The thing is, this isn't chocolate. It's made with sunflower seeds. Or fava (also called broad) beans.",
      "The selection before me is just a smattering of the non-cocoa containing alternatives to chocolate that are creeping into the European retail market right now. Their makers have spied an opportunity, partly because real chocolate prices are soaring.",
      "\"The average increase in price for chocolate was 9% over 2024,\" says Richard Caines, principal analyst in UK food and drink research at market research firm Mintel. \"In January just gone, it's shot up by 14%.\"",
      "That's the retail price of chocolate. The wholesale price of the key ingredient, cocoa \u2013 which is made from fermented, roasted and ground cacao beans \u2013 has increased by an astonishing 300% in 2024.",
      "\"I have been looking at this chocolate market for quite a few years now \u2013 I don't remember a big story like this on costs going up,\" adds Mr Caines.",
      "A key reason for this increase is climate change-related weather impacts on cacao farms, particularly in West Africa.",
      "Plus, some farmers in Ghana are turning away from cacao production in favour of illegal gold-mining, according to reports.",
      "It means that there was a deficit of roughly 500,000 tonnes of cocoa in the global market last year.",
      "Real chocolate could become a \"luxury\" item in the future says Massimo Sabatini, co-founder and chief executive of Italian firm Foreverland, which makes a cocoa powder alternative called Choruba.",
      "The company opened its production facility in March, where staff process not cacao beans but carob husks.",
      "Carob trees produce small, brown, banana-shaped pods containing seeds. It's possible to process the pods to create a cocoa-like powder. This chocolate alternative has a long history, however \u2013 and not a very happy one.",
      "A New Yorker article claims a generation was \"traumatized\" by carob-based confectionary during the 1970s. It didn't taste as good as real chocolate, and it didn't melt in your mouth in the same way, apparently.",
      "But Mr Sabatini insists that he and his colleagues have come up with a worthy product. He acknowledges that carob \"really doesn't taste like chocolate\" but adds that Foreverland's fermentation and roasting process removes some of the carob flavour to get it closer to cocoa.",
      "Their carob-based dark chocolate alternative is sweeter and more caramel-like than real dark chocolate, he explains.",
      "There could be health benefits to this. \"We can reduce drastically the sugar content,\" says Mr Sabatini. Carob is also higher in fibre and lower in fat than cocoa.",
      "German food manufacturer Planet A Foods has developed a different chocolate alternative. Sara Marquart, co-founder and chief technology officer, says her goal is not to replace chocolate but to help fill the gap in the market caused by volatility in cocoa availability and prices.",
      "Unlike Foreverland, Planet A Foods have chosen sunflower seeds as the key ingredient in their cocoa powder alternative, ChoViva.",
      "\"We process sunflower seeds like cocoa beans,\" explains Dr Marquart. \"It's a highly abundant ingredient, there's millions and millions of tonnes on the market.\"",
      "ChoViva is now present in roughly 35 different retail products, mostly on the market in Germany and France \u2013 though it also appears in mini egg-shaped sweets sold by Aldi in the UK. The sweets are made with peanuts and have a chocolate-like coating containing ChoViva.",
      "When I try them, the flavour is overwhelmingly dominated by the salty peanut at the egg's core. But the chocolatey texture of the coating is impressive. The same applies to ChoViva-covered biscuits made by the firm.",
      "I note that the chocolate-like coating is rather thin and not overly flavourful. But again, the texture is pretty much what you'd expect from real chocolate, though not quite as melty.",
      "The company's ChoViva-covered popcorn is probably the most chocolatey item I try \u2013 the popcorn doesn't usurp its coating.",
      "Overall, there's nothing here that would perturb a consumer. Especially one unaware that these products don't actually contain chocolate.",
      "A UK start-up also keen to compete in this space is Nukoko. Two of its founders previously ran a real chocolate business and teamed up with a food scientist to form their new venture.",
      "\"We saw first-hand the issues with the chocolate supply chain,\" says Ross Newton, co-founder. Like Foreverland and Planet A Foods, Nukoko has opted for a key ingredient that the firm can source and process locally \u2013 to reduce food miles and insulate against supply chain risks. But in Nukoko's case the raw material of choice is not carob or sunflower seeds but fava beans.",
      "\"There's around a million tonnes harvested in the UK every year,\" says Mr Newton.",
      "It's early days for the company but he adds that he hopes to begin selling their cocoa powder alternative to food firms later this year.",
      "Mr Newton says imitating the flavour of real chocolate is very hard but that, out of 25 crucial flavour compounds in real chocolate, his company's product manages to include 24 of them \u2013 though in some cases at slightly different concentrations.",
      "The company sends me four caramel-filled truffles to try. The caramel totally dominates and the truffles are very sweet. But the chocolate alternative is as smooth and glossy as you'd expect, and very satisfying to chew.",
      "\"Anything new that comes out has got to meet equal taste expectations,\" says Mr Caines, noting how discerning consumers are when it comes to their favourite chocolate-containing products. Getting them to embrace alternatives devoid of cocoa will be no mean feat.",
      "He adds that alternatives might fare best when used in bakery products \u2013 such as the chips in chocolate chip cookies: \"The chocolate is not so much the star of the show there so it might actually be more acceptable.\"",
      "Should chocolate alternatives meet with success, there is some risk that this could negatively impact cacao farmers, says Tonya Lander, a lecturer in biology at Oxford University.",
      "\"It's something that should be worked through with farmers or farmer collectives,\" she says. Cacao farmers are among the poorest agricultural workers in the world.",
      "Nukoko, Planet A Foods and Foreverland all say they don't aim to replace chocolate, rather, the goal is to fill the gap left by cocoa production shortfalls.",
      "Dr Lander and colleagues have studied environmental factors that influence yield from cacao trees.",
      "Poor pollination and high temperatures negatively affect how much cacao the trees produce, the researchers report in a study published in February.",
      "By shading cacao trees on plantations, for example, it might be possible to improve harvests and potentially reduce the volatility of cocoa supplies. Such interventions, besides switching to cocoa alternatives, could help satisfy confectionary-obsessed consumers in the coming years.",

      "\"The way we see it is that by putting the data centre in space, you're really offering unparalleled security,\" says the president of Lonestar Data Holdings.",
      "Last month, the Florida-based firm claimed to have successfully tested a tiny data centre the size of a hardback book that hitched a ride to the Moon on the Athena Lunar Lander from US space exploration firm Intuitive Machines. This, in turn, had been launched by a rocket from Elon Musk's SpaceX.",
      "Data centres are the vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Lonestar says that putting them on the Moon will offer customers secure, reliable data processing, while taking advantage of unlimited solar energy to power them.",
      "The environmental campaigners fighting against data centres",
      "Data centre power use 'to surge six-fold in 10 years'",
      "Concern UK's AI ambitions could lead to water shortages",
      "And while space-based data centres may sound far-fetched, it's an idea that's really starting to take off.",
      "Part of the reason is rocketing demand and the difficulty of finding suitable sites on Earth.",
      "The ever-expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) computing has seen a massive increase in the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed around the world.",
      "As a result, the need for data centres has shot up too, with annual demand set to rise between 19% and 22% by 2030, according to global management consultants McKinsey.",
      "New facilities are springing up all the time - but it's getting hard to find places to put them. Data centres are large and sprawling, and use enormous amounts of power and water for cooling.",
      "And increasingly local people don't want them built nearby.",
      "Putting data centres in space \u2013 either in orbit around Earth, or on the Moon - the theory goes, means they can't do quite so much harm. There's more-or-less unlimited energy available from the sun, for example, and no neighbours to complain about the environmental impacts.",
      "Not only that, space-based data centres could specialise in services for spacecraft and other space facilities, with space-to-space data transfers quicker than from the ground.",
      "Last summer, a European Commission-funded feasibility study into orbiting data centres published its results.",
      "The Ascend report by carried out by Thales Alenia Space - a joint venture between French and Italian aerospace groups Thales and Leonardo - published its results.",
      "It determined that deploying data centres in space \"could transform the European digital landscape\", and be \"more eco-friendly\".",
      "Thales Alenia Space envisages building a constellation of 13 satellites measuring  a combined 200m-by-80m, and with a total data processing power of around 10 megawatts (MW). That's equivalent to a current medium-sized, ground-based data centre, with some 5,000 servers.",
      "Based on technologies that already exist or are under development, the satellites would be assembled in orbit.",
      "Damien Dumestier, Ascend project architect at Thales Alenia Space, says that for space-based data centres to be more environmentally friendly than existing ground-based ones it will be necessary to make the rocket launchers 10 times less emissive over their lifecycles. He says this looks possible.",
      "\"But in order to cover the new technology's developments and the production capacity ramp-up to benefit from scale, we have to consider larger system capacity, around 200MW, meaning 200 of our envisaged large space infrastructures and 200 launches,\" he says.",
      "\"The main question is when an adapted launcher will be ready. Depending on the investment and decisions to be taken, this could be done for 2030 or 2035, meaning commercial viability before 2037.\"",
      "However, despite this optimism from firms aiming to develop the technology, Dr Domenico Vicinanza, associate professor of intelligent systems and data science at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, says there are numerous big hurdles before space-based data centres can be a viable proposition.",
      "\"Even with the contribution and advancements of companies like SpaceX, launching hardware into orbit remains extremely expensive,\" he says. \"Each kilogram sent into space costs thousands of dollars.",
      "\"Space-based data centres would require not only the data equipment but also the infrastructure to protect, power, and cool them. All of which add up in weight and complexity.\"",
      "Cooling the equipment will be a particular problem,  because even though space is cold, conventional cooling systems don't work well without gravity.",
      "Meanwhile, space weather can damage electronics, while the ever-increasing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.",
      "Dr Vicinanza adds: \"And fixing problems in orbit is far from straightforward. Even with robotics and automation, there are limits to what can be repaired remotely.",
      "\"A big hardware failure might necessitate a costly human mission, potentially making downtime stretch for weeks or months.\"",
      "Yet firms like Lonestar are supremely confident, and say that they are responding to demand. \"We wouldn't be doing this if the customers weren't asking us to,\" says Mr Scott.",
      "Its next target is to put a small data centre in orbit around the moon in 2027. Meanwhile, other companies are hoping to get there a bit faster, such as Washington state-based Starcloud, which is due to launch a satellite-based data centre next month, and start commercial operations in mid-2026.",
      "Lonestar's Mr Eidele says that space-based facilities offer more security for governments and businesses because their data does not need to be routed through terrestrial networks. Instead the information can be beamed directly from space to a dedicated ground station.",
      "\"It's like having the vaults at the back of the bank,\" he says. \"You don't have to open it every day, but it's there to provide an extra measure of security, and the distance from the Earth to the moon offers that - it's that much harder to hack, that much harder to access.\"",
      "The distance to the Moon means that data takes about a second and a half to reach the ground - this doesn't matter for some applications, like longer-term data storage and backups.",
      "And meanwhile, says Lonestar founder and chief executive Chris Stott, space-based data centres can help organisations meet regulations about data sovereignty - the need to hold peoples' data in the country of origin.",
      "\"Under space law, that box of electronics is literally under the law of the licensing or launching state - it is an actual embassy in space,\" he says.",

      "More low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures.",
      "The number of deals that need a deposit of 5% or 10% have risen to their highest level since then, data from financial information service Moneyfacts suggests.",
      "The extra choice is a boost for first time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates are higher than they were for much of the last 17 years.",
      "And competition is tough, with homes typically listed for just over a month before a sale is agreed, according to separate figures from property website Zoopla show.",
      "The UK housing market has been relatively settled in recent times, although buyers still need to navigate uncertainty over interest rates and changes to stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "'Flourishing choice'",
      "For buyers able to offer a deposit of 5% of the home loan, there are 442 mortgages to choose from, according to Moneyfacts.",
      "Two years ago, the choice was from fewer than half of that total, at 204.",
      "Borrowers able to pay a 10% deposit now have 845 products to choose from, up from 684 in April 2023.",
      "However, they still have to pay a mortgage rate of well over 5% on average, while a borrower who pays a 40% deposit typically pays a rate of under 5%.",
      "It has been hard for many prospective first-time buyers to save due to the rising cost of renting in recent years.",
      "But Rachel Springall, from Moneyfacts, said there was a flourishing choice of mortgages for those whose ability to pay a deposit is stretched.",
      "\"A rise in product availability for aspiring homeowners is a healthy step in the right direction,\" she said.",
      "However she said only 6% of all deals available to borrowers across fixed and variable mortgages had a deposit requirement of 5%, so there was still \"room for improvement\".",
      "Mortgage rates remain difficult to predict owing to uncertainty created by US tariff policy on the wider economy.",
      "While securing a mortgage is one thing, buyers also need to act relatively quickly when it comes to finding a new home, data suggests.",
      "Homes in England and Wales spend an average of 36 days on the market before a sale is agreed, according to news figures from the property portal Zoopla.",
      "Sales were agreed on half of homes within two months of being listed, it said. To complete a sale, sellers and buyers will typically need another four to six months, depending on the complexity of the transaction.",
      "The fastest sales were agreed for two-bedroom homes, at an average of 23 days, while homes with four bedrooms or more typically took an extra 15 days.",
      "Homes in northern regions of England tended to sell faster than homes in the south, where prices are higher, it said.",
      "Even so, the fastest selling, with an agreed sale taking an average of 19 days, had a north-south mix, with Manchester and the London borough of Waltham Forest hitting that mark.",
      "\"Households that are thinking about listing their home and moving in 2025 need to set their asking price at the right level and take the advice of local agents,\" said Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla.",
      "\"Buyers have a lot more choice of homes for sale than a year ago. Aiming too high on the asking price is likely to impact saleability and how long you may have to wait to agree a sale.\"",
      "Zoopla uses a median average figure (the mid-point) for its data. It also discards homes that have been listed for more than six months, as it considers them to be unlikely to sell.",

      "Listen to an audio version of this article on BBC Sounds",
      "From the end of April, the 500-year-old Royal Mail will be controlled by a Czech billionaire who co-owns a football club and is a major investor in a British supermarket - so, why would he want this ailing institution?",
      "\"A pair of scissors, one empty teapot and some hot water, please.\" The slightly baffled staff at Claridge's scrambled to comply with Daniel Kretinsky's breakfast order as he sanitised and moisturised his hands.",
      "The upscale hotel has been serving tea to the global elite for decades but Mr Kretinsky brought along his own packet of Chinese green tea, which he snipped open (hence the scissors) and poured into the empty pot.",
      "He was tall, perfectly groomed, steely-eyed but unfalteringly polite and thoughtful. If you told anyone in the dining room he was a billionaire, they would have no problem believing it.",
      "Known as the Czech Sphinx for his enigmatic style, Mr Kretinsky, who is 49, is worth \u00a36bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He lives in plush mansions in Paris and London, was originally a lawyer and made his fortune in European energy markets.",
      "Our meeting was at Claridge's in June 2024 - I was trying to convince him to give me an interview about his audacious attempt to buy a British institution that was once seen as a national treasure: Royal Mail.",
      "His profile as a buyer was one that unions and ministers typically would be wary of because of his historic connections with Russia - his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe.",
      "But six months on, his bid to buy Royal Mail's parent company was cleared by the UK government after he agreed \"legally binding\" undertakings.",
      "The government was awarded a so-called \"golden share\", requiring it to be notified of any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, headquarters location and tax residency. The deal was also blessed by unions.",
      "Earlier this month, the owner of Royal Mail said that the takeover could be completed by the end of April as the deal cleared the final regulatory hurdles standing in the way.",
      "But step back and Royal Mail seems a strange target for a globally mobile oil and gas billionaire investor to set his sights on. It begs the question why would anyone, let alone a successful international entrepreneur, want to buy this faded relic?",
      "How Royal Mail's crown slipped",
      "Royal Mail was founded by Henry VIII more than 500 years ago and still carries the royal cipher on its vans. It is part of the fabric of British life and many people still have a fond relationship with their 'postie', who walks down their path bringing their letters and parcels to their door.",
      "But in recent years Royal Mail's crown has slipped. It is losing money and market share, has been fined for missing delivery targets and has made an enemy of its own workforce through a series of bitter strikes.",
      "Royal Mail's letter business is in steep decline too. It has gone from a peak of 20 billion letters sent in 2004 to under seven billion sent last year.",
      "In December 2024, it was fined \u00a310.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.",
      "While the boom in e-commerce has seen the volume of parcels rise, Royal Mail's share of that more profitable business has been falling as new competitors like DPD, DHL, Amazon and Evri have eaten into its market share.",
      "Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office in 2012 and privatised in 2013 at a value of \u00a33.3bn. Its shares immediately rocketed by 38% on the first day of trading, leading to criticism - from the National Audit Office, among others - that it had been sold on the cheap.",
      "At its peak in Covid-era May 2021, the company was worth more than \u00a36bn but had slumped to just over \u00a32bn when Mr Kretinsky launched his takeover bid last April.",
      "He sealed the deal at \u00a33.6bn - 63% higher than before he signalled his intent, but barely more than it was worth at privatisation over a decade ago.",
      "\"Royal Mail is a business that has historically found it difficult to grow revenues by more than costs,\" says Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt stockbrokers. \"It has seen its parcels market share eroded by more dynamic competition that has been able to invest more in technology, and it has struggled with industrial relations to keep staff working towards a common goal.",
      "\"This is not a challenge to underestimate nor one that can be overcome quickly, but that requires considerable long-term investment in infrastructure, technology and staff.\"",
      "Part of the challenge, and one that puts Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared with its rivals, is that unlike them, Royal Mail has to meet a string of legal and regulatory obligations, says Hazel King, the editor of Parcel and Post Technology International.",
      "Under what is called the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. So it cannot pick and choose which business it wants to do.",
      "\"Royal Mail must meet their universal service obligation while trying to compete with private firms who often cherry-pick the most profitable business,\" says Ms King.",
      "The 'Czech Sphinx's' plan",
      "Mr Kretinsky says he has a plan. His success in the energy sector allowed him to buy a 27.5% stake in Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS). And his company \u2013 EP Group \u2013 intends to build a pan-European conglomerate built on three pillars: energy, retail and logistics.",
      "He sees IDS as the cornerstone of the logistics pillar, with a plan to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Deutsche Post DHL, DPD and Amazon.",
      "The USO has been under review by Ofcom, with Royal Mail hoping that the regulator will reduce the requirement to deliver second-class letters from six days a week to every other weekday. That single move could save Royal Mail \u00a3300m a year \u2013 putting it back on a break-even footing.",
      "Mr Kretinsky told me during our interview that he would honour the USO \"as long as I am alive\", but he is unsurprisingly very much in favour of changing its terms. He said he hopes that \"rational minds prevail\" when reforming a service that is unsustainable in its current form.",
      "So far, the noises from Ofcom seem to be supportive. The regulator's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\".",
      "Given letter numbers are falling, \"we have to think about what is economical\", she said, adding Ofcom would be publishing plans for the regulation of Royal Mail \"to make sure it is sustainable\".",
      "While Royal Mail generally welcomed the proposed changes to the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail pushed back against proposed new delivery time and business customer requirements.",
      "Royal Mail said last week that the level at which Ofcom is proposing to set the new delivery targets \u2013 99.5% of First Class letters delivered within three days, and the same percentage of Second Class letters within five \u2013 is \"over specified and will add significant cost to the delivery of the Universal Service\".",
      "It also expressed concerns that proposals to add a new category of regulation to ensure timely delivery for business users like direct mail companies \"goes against the wider government drive to reduce unnecessary regulation\".",
      "European parcel know-how",
      "But there are other factors that may have driven the sale. Some analysts have speculated that there is another jewel in the crown of IDS - and that Mr Kretinsky may really be after a different part of the business.",
      "Along with Royal Mail, IDS also owns a European parcels business called GLS which it acquired in 1999 \u2013 long before Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office and privatised.",
      "Last year GLS made a profit of \u00a3320m, compared to Royal Mail, which lost \u00a3348m as letter volumes continued to plunge and new competitors ate into its market share of the more profitable parcels business.",
      "\"GLS has been a profitable growth business, which has seen investment whereas Royal Mail has been a perpetual underperformer, as the board of parent company IDS has invested where it thinks it will see the best returns,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "Mr Kretinsky rejects suggestions from some quarters that he wants to break up the group and has committed to keeping it together for at least five years. Even beyond that, he says the plan is to grow the company rather than shrink it, so a disposal of GLS would be \"nonsensical\".",
      "In fact, Mr Kretinsky says he hopes to bring the European parcel know-how at GLS to bear on Royal Mail's operations.",
      "What the unions are hoping, and Kretinsky is promising, is that Royal Mail will see greater investment and over time begin to look a bit more like GLS and its European counterparts such as Deutche Post DHL.",
      "Catching up with competitors",
      "Given all the challenges Royal Mail faces, there's an obvious question - why would a billionaire want to chance his arm on turning round something that others couldn't, while up against powerful competitors?",
      "Well, if you believe as Kretinsky does - and he is surely right - that getting parcels to people is a profitable and growing industry, then buying Royal Mail and GLS gives you a way to become a big European player in logistics quickly.",
      "Add to that a powerful and historic brand, a database with every single UK address and a frontline workforce that most of its customers are fond of and pleased to see when they walk down the path - then, despite the challenges, it begins to make sense.",
      "Mr Kretinsky is convinced future growth lies in out-of-home (OOH) delivery. The parcel lockers found in supermarket car parks and elsewhere, operated by the likes of Amazon, Evri and UPS, have grown quickly across Europe.",
      "Earlier this month it was reported that Sainsbury's would be the first supermarket to partner with Royal Mail and install parcel lockers at supermarkets. Some are already operating at several stores including ones in Clapham, Kidderminster and Chislehurst.",
      "Royal Mail has also trialled a new postbox that can take small parcels. Customers procure a barcode from an app, then at the postbox they scan the barcode and drop the parcel into a drawer - this is all powered by solar panels on the box.",
      "Emma Gilthorpe, Royal Mail chief executive, called it an \"historic change\" to give postboxes \"a new lease of life\".",
      "All of this boils down to the same thing: convenience. It means customers don't have to wait at home for a delivery - the sender or parcel business emails or texts a code to unlock the locker. For the business it's more efficient, allowing couriers to deliver lots of parcels to one place - meaning fewer miles on the road and less time.",
      "\"If they can grow the parcels business and claw back market share, there is every chance that they can add new jobs that could offset the reduction in jobs in the declining letters business,\" says Mr Paterson.",
      "\"There is a significant long-term opportunity to run Royal Mail more successfully with regulatory changes to the USO and greater investment in technology and out-of-home deliveries.\"",
      "But Royal Mail still has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. It currently has 1,500 lockers in the UK and aims to grow this figure to at least 20,000 over time. By contrast, Amazon already has 5,000 lockers across the UK and InPost has 7,500 across the UK.",
      "Winning over doubters",
      "That Mr Kretinsky has pulled off the takeover is no easy feat. Royal Mail is, after all, considered vital national infrastructure and as such the deal required review under national security laws.",
      "Then there is the fact that his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe \u2013 paid for and approved by EU member states. The small amount that was transported was reduced to zero at the end of 2024 when Ukraine refused to renew permission for any gas to flow across its borders.",
      "Speaking in front of MPs in November, UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company two years ago.",
      "Getting the unions on board seemed even more of a challenge and the Communication Workers Union was wary of Mr Kretinsky. \"The CWU believes Royal Mail should be in public hands,\" Dave Ward, the CWU's general secretary, told the BBC in June. \"We know there are legitimate concerns about Royal Mail Group being owned by a foreign private equity investor.\"",
      "But during negotiations, union representatives secured a series of time-limited commitments from him, including guarantees that he will protect Royal Mail's pension surplus, that there will be no compulsory redundancies for two years, no sell-off or break-up of any operational part of the existing company and no outsourcing of grades represented by the CWU.",
      "Mr Kretinsky also agreed to restrictions on moving dividends out of Royal Mail Group and to respect agreements with and recognition of the CWU. He said he would keep the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years.",
      "Union bosses told me that a life under Mr Kretinsky \"couldn't be any worse than what we have had for the last 10 years\".",
      "So, as Mr Kretinsky looks certain to pull off the sale, what will customers notice?",
      "The frequency of second-class deliveries may be reduced after the Ofcom review. We will see new Royal Mail lockers appearing in our neighbourhoods. And the price of first-class mail may go up: second-class stamps are regulated by Ofcom, while first-class ones are not.",
      "The monarch's head will still be on those stamps, but there is a new king of our mail system. And his name is Daniel Kretinsky.",

      "The Trump administration has said it is freezing more than $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) in federal funds for Harvard University, hours after the elite college rejected a list of demands from the White House.",
      "\"Harvard's statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges,\" the Department of Education said in a statement.",
      "The White House sent a list of demands to Harvard last week which it said were designed to fight antisemitism on campus. They included changes to its governance, hiring practices and admissions procedures.",
      "Harvard rejected it and said the White House was trying to \"control\" its community.",

    "summary": "A unique study is tracking the development of hundreds of babies whose parents have also been studied since birth.",
    "story": [
      "Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal.",
      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",
      "Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.",
      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",
      "In another room, Jaxon, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.",
      "A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jaxon can keep all the stickers he finds.",
      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",
      "\"These are what I call 'building blocks' of really important skills.\"",
      "The study will also assess language development and processing speed - a measure of how quickly children pick up new information.",
      "The Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health.",
      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",
      "In this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.",
      "Emily, who was studied as a child of the 90s, is Henry's mum. Today, her young son sits on her lap as he works on one of the research team's carefully designed puzzles.",
      "\"We've both been a part of this since birth,\" Emily says. \"It wasn't a choice for me at the start - my mum signed me up. But it is now, and I just think it's fascinating.\"",
      "Helping children to thrive in the future is the aim, Dr Holmboe says. Because when children start school, she explains \"a lot of things are already set.",
      "\"This is the groundwork that will help us support children at the right time.\"",
      "Henry and Jaxon finish their puzzles and games and take off their brain-scanning hats.",
      "\"My boys just love coming here,\" says Emily. \"They love all the toys - they get free snacks. So I'll continue coming just as long as they want to.",

    "story": [
      "Martha was struggling to sleep, losing her hair, having palpitations, suffering tinnitus and was eventually hospitalised for deep vein thrombosis.",
      "She would come home from her job, as her daughter Amelie said, \"grumpy and stressed\".",
      "Martha described \"getting home, eating, and working again. I wasn't the best mum that I could be. It was a bit of a blur after work. It was constant.\"",
      "Something had to give - so Martha changed her 60-hour weeks as a teacher for 30 hours a week working from home as a virtual assistant.",
      "Amelie and her brothers, Otis and Barnaby, suddenly had their mum around again.",
      "And research has backed up the family's experience, with neuroscientists agreeing it's good for children for parents to be more available.",
      "Finance is the main limitation  when it comes to being able to work shorter hours.",
      "Prof Sam Wass, a neuroscientist at the University of East London, studies children's brain development and behaviour.",
      "\"For a lot of families, this is a resources question: Can I afford to work four days a week?",
      "\"Can I afford to knock off work at three o'clock in the afternoon to pick up the kids from school?",
      "But, he said, \"the research on this is pretty clear. For families where the parent is more engaged, children's academic outcomes are better, and their long-term mental health outcomes are better too.\"",
      "The move has \"transformed\" Martha's relationship with her children.",
      "\"I appreciate the fact that I'm living my life with them, and I'm not just bundled off into a school in a different borough where I can't see them.\"",
      "Her children agree. Amelie, 14, said it was \"so nice\" to have her mum around.",
      "\"If I'm not having a very good day at school, then I'll come home and I'll just talk her about the dramas going on.\"",
      "Barnaby, 10, added: \"The thing that makes it nice is that she's there - even if she's on a meeting, it's nice to just have that moment of conversation.\"",
      "Parents do not need to make such a wholesale change as Martha, Prof Wass said, as studies showed just five to 10 minutes of attention could have a beneficial effect on children.",
      "\"In the morning, for example, it's very easy - I'm exactly the same - to be very focused on 'I've got to do this' and then you've got your list of jobs to do in a hurry.",
      "\"But just to take five minutes to wipe all of that out of your mind and say, 'OK, I'm going to sit and I'm going to play with my kids, I'm going to watch and respond to what they're interested in, this isn't about me and what I need to get done, this is about me being there for the child and supporting my child in what they want to do'.\"",
      "He added: \"This type of child-led learning, where you're sitting and responding and sustaining and helping them to engage in what they're interested in, is really, really important for child outcomes.",
      "\"But the other thing is, it's great for you as a parent too, just to force yourself to forget your day-to-day worries and to be there with your child really, really helps you to manage your stress and to manage your bad moods at the same time.\"",
      "Working from home became normalised during the pandemic, with many people reluctant to return to the office once lockdown ended.",
      "But the culture of home working is coming under pressure from businesses and commentators claiming to be concerned over its impact on the economy.",
      "Mayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan has said central London was being \"emptied out\", while organisations including the Metropolitan Police are bringing in requirements for staff to work a standard number of days in the office.",
      "Not every job has the option to work from home; those who work on construction sites, in schools, hospitals or shift-based roles in hospitality and shops for example, cannot.",
      "Clare McNeil from Timewise, a social enterprise which helps employers support flexible working, said although it was great that there had been a rise in hybrid working, they were concerned about workers who had not benefitted from this cultural shift.",
      "\"Our work shows that you can, even in these frontline roles, introduce greater choice around shifts and working patterns to introduce greater flexibility through team-based working for example,\" she said.",
      "\"We want more workers to be able to benefit from these opportunities, thinking about the impact on children and families as well.\"",
      "Flexible working definition",
      "The employment rights bill which is making its way through parliament, will make flexible working the \"default\" for all workers.",
      "Employers are required to say yes to requests from staff from their first day starting in a job unless they can prove it is \"unreasonable\".",
      "The government defines flexible working as a way of working \"that suits an employee's needs\", for example, having flexible start and finish times, or working from home.",
      "Employees can already request flexible working from their first day in a job, but an employer can refuse an application if they have a good business reason for doing so.",
      "\"We are hopeful that the government's legislation that they're introducing will be an opportunity for more work, more employers to think differently about how they design jobs,\" Ms McNeil added.",

    "summary": "The number of plays and musicals staged by the UK's main subsidised theatres is down by almost a third.",
    "story": [
      "The number of plays and musicals staged by the UK's main subsidised theatres last year was down by almost a third compared with 10 years earlier, BBC research suggests.",
      "In 2024, the 40 best-funded theatre companies that make their own productions - ranging from the National Theatre to the Colchester Mercury - opened 229 original productions, compared with 332 in 2014, a drop of 31%.",
      "Funding cuts and rising costs took much of the blame, with National Theatre executive director Kate Varah recently saying many in the industry are at \"breaking point\".",
      "But some venues said the shows they do stage are on a bigger scale than a decade ago, with the aim of running for longer on tour or in the West End.",
      "Last week, actress Lesley Manville warned that new talent had \"less opportunity\" to develop than when she was starting out in the 1970s.",
      "\"It's going to be a diminishing discipline, because there's not always the amount of stage work available for them to go and do,\" she told BBC Radio 4 after winning an Olivier Award.",
      "'Serious problem'",
      "Leeds Playhouse chief executive and artistic director James Brining said the venue had cut its number of homegrown shows from 12 to eight a year.",
      "\"That decision to contract has been forced upon theatres because it's so expensive, and increasingly so, to make work,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We love making work. So it's heartbreaking that the amount of work you can make is reducing, and it is reducing the pipeline opportunities for artists at the beginning of their careers.\"",
      "British theatre has \"a serious problem\" with the reduction in opportunities, added Brining, who is about to move from Leeds to run the Edinburgh Lyceum.",
      "25 of the best theatre shows to see in spring/summer 2025",
      "25 of the best theatre shows to see in spring/summer 2025",
      "Many performers and crew start their careers in theatres before going on to work in TV and film, arts education consultant and theatre blogger Carl Woodward said.",
      "\"A lot of Netflix stars and a lot of those people we see on dramas like Mr Bates vs the Post office and Adolescence cut their teeth in regional theatres.",
      "\"And if those opportunities are no longer there, then those pathways don't exist. And that is a national scandal, I think.\"",
      "The theatre industry's financial pressures have had an impact on the workforce, with \"chronic low pay, job insecurity, poor work/life balance,\" he added.",
      "Many venues said they now co-produce more shows with other theatres or commercial operators to spread the costs and risks. That also means those productions can be on a bigger scale.",
      "\"Some individual productions that are made with the commercial sector are much bigger than anything we ever used to make,\" Birmingham Rep chief executive Rachael Thomas said.",
      "\"So for us, yes there are fewer productions coming out, but we are spending more because the productions that we are making are so much bigger than they ever used to be.\"",
      "However, the Rep has lost all of its annual local council funding - once worth more than \u00a31m a year - and smaller shows have often been squeezed out, Thomas said.",
      "\"I suppose the subsidy enables you to take the risk on the productions that are never going to recoup what they've cost, and often that will be the smaller-scale productions.\"",
      "In 1995, the Rep's studio theatre staged the premiere of East Is East, four years before it became a hit British film. It couldn't afford to do a play of that scale in its studio today.",
      "\"I cannot see a world in which we could now launch a play which has got a cast size of nine or 10 in our 133-seater studio space now as a new play,\" Thomas said.",
      "\"For our model, and I would say for the vast majority of regional producing theatres, that is nigh on impossible.\"",
      "'Less serious drama'",
      "Salisbury Playhouse artistic director Gareth Machin said audience tastes had also changed, meaning it's harder to put on \"serious drama\", especially outside London.",
      "\"When money is tight, people want a good night out and they don't want to take a risk,\" he said.",
      "\"They're probably not coming out as much as they were, so when they do come out they don't want to take a chance on something they're not sure is going to be entertaining and a fun experience.",
      "\"So there's less misery and risk.\"",
      "Nottingham Playhouse chief executive and UK Theatre joint president Stephanie Sirr said she didn't recognise the picture of a drop in productions, pointing out that \"it does fluctuate from year to year\".",
      "\"I do think it's more difficult to produce these days,\" she continued.",
      "\"The costs have gone up exponentially. Things like the energy costs really impact you if you're building scenery all day, or if you're running theatre lanterns all night.\"",
      "However, making more co-productions is a positive thing in most ways, and has meant \"we've been able to really increase the scale of the work we produce\", she said, with Nottingham's production of Dear Evan Hansen now on a major UK tour.",
      "'More with less'",
      "A handful of venues staged more original shows in 2024 than 2014. They include Leicester Curve, which has put a focus on making musicals in collaboration with commercial producers, which can then go on the road.",
      "Curve has doubled its box office receipts over the past decade.",
      "\"By sharing resources and risk, we're able to, by default, do more work and create and present more work,\" chief executive Chris Stafford said.",
      "\"We are doing more with less in terms of public investment,\" he continued, but said the biggest challenge for many theatres would be affording essential building repairs and upgrades in the coming years.",
      "Annual funding from Arts Councils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the Scottish equivalent has largely been stagnant for the past 10 years - while inflation has risen sharply - and many venues have had their local council subsidies cut. Many are also still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic.",
      "Last year, a survey by the group Freelancers Make Theatre Work depicted \"a workforce that is at breaking point\".",
      "Performer and group spokesman Paul Carey Jones said the BBC research \"would come as no surprise to most theatre freelancers in the UK, who have been struggling with low rates of pay, career precarity and vulnerability, a lack of job certainty and a skills retention crisis for many years now.",
      "\"It shows the need for action from government in terms of funding for the arts, but also from the theatre industry to support its freelance workforce, on which it entirely depends.\"",
      "The research for this story counted original and co-productions that opened in 2014 and 2024, including revivals, transfers and tours. They had to be professional in-person theatre productions, at least an hour long, and to have run for at least a week. If a co-production was jointly made by more than one theatre, it was counted as a single production.",
      "The research covered the 40 venues, festivals and touring companies that produce original theatre, were operating in 2014 and 2024, and had the highest annual grants in 2024/25 from the Arts Councils of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Creative Scotland and the Scottish government.",

    "summary": "The actress stayed behind the camera to make a documentary about Young's 2023 solo tour.",
    "story": [
      "Fifty-seven years into his career, Neil Young has harvested millions of fans \u2013 but none of those followers is more devoted than his pet dogs.",
      "\"They love the music,\" says the musician's wife, actress Daryl Hannah.",
      "\"They go to every sound check and lay under the piano on the stage. Whenever Neil is playing, the dogs just migrate right to him and lay at his feet.\"",
      "It's not just the dogs. During the 2020 lockdown, Young performed a livestream concert from the barn at his Colorado farm, surrounded by alpacas, ducks, chickens and even a horse.",
      "\"And every single one of the animals came over and laid down and watched him,\" Hannah says. \"It was so cool. I think they're really drawn to the music.\"",
      "Hannah, known for appearing in films such as Blade Runner, Splash and Kill Bill, directed that livestream \u2013 and she's stayed behind the camera to make a documentary about Young's 2023 solo tour.",
      "Filmed largely on her phone (\"and it's not even the most recent model\"), it captures the star's return to the stage, aged 75, after a four-year break, with his dogs in tow.",
      "\"He was very nervous about it,\" she recalls.",
      "\"There's always a point where he's like, 'I don't know if I can do this\u2026 We'll see'.\"",
      "\"It's funny, because he didn't do any rehearsals before the tour. He likes things to be real and spontaneous. But as soon as he walked out on stage, he was fine.\"",
      "Playing without a band, the shows were loose and unpredictable. The setlist changed every night, and even recurring songs like Heart of Gold and Like A Hurricane would be played in different settings, on different instruments, without warning.",
      "It's a set-up that caused his director a few headaches.",
      "\"It was really hit or miss because every day he would go out to do sound check, and he would choose one of his three pianos and play something like Expecting To Fly,\" says Hannah.",
      "\"So we'd set a camera on that piano but, when it came to show time, he wouldn't go near it. There were quite a few shows where we literally got no footage.",
      "\"I was frustrated in the editing room, trust me.\"",
      "Despite those challenges, Hannah captured spellbinding, stripped back versions of rarely-played tracks like Vampire Blues, If You Got Love and Prime Of Life.",
      "More revealing, however, was the footage she shot off the stage.",
      "Large stretches of the film take place on a silver eagle tour bus, where Young rides shotgun beside his longtime driver, Jerry Don Burden.",
      "Together, they shoot the breeze like Vladimir and Estragon - but rather than waiting for Godot, they're waiting for the next arena car park.",
      "The conversations are wonderfully mundane. There is ample discussion of scenery, snacks and setlists (\"people think they want to hear the hits, because that's all they've ever heard\", Young observes.)",
      "It's punctuated by stretches of companionable silence, where Young drums on his knees, or interacts with his son Ben, who was born with severe cerebral palsy.",
      "Later, the musician emerges from the bathroom, stares into the camera and deadpans: \"Now there's no risk of having to pee in the middle of the show\".",
      "Capturing that day-to-day normality was Hannah's motivation from the start.",
      "\"So many performers put on a persona, and Neil just does not have that quality at all. Whatever he's talking about with his bus driver, he continues talking about with the audience.",
      "\"People think of him as this intimidating, inscrutable person who'll make an album the record company refuses to put out,\" she continues, referring to the time Geffen Records sued Young for submitting two albums it considered \"musically uncharacteristic\".",
      "Hannah says people who judge him on that basis have got it wrong.",
      "\"He just has an absolute, uncanny commitment to his creative muse,\" she argues.",
      "\"He's not driven by financial interests, he's not driven by self-aggrandisement, he's not driven by anything other than that creative force, and it's pretty incredible to witness.",
      "\"Having spent so much time with him, my perception is that he's completely guileless. He has a lot of warmth and innocence, so I wanted to show that.\"",
      "Barred from America?",
      "Young recently made headlines for pulling out of the Glastonbury Festival, saying the BBC had asked him \"to do a lot of things\" he was \"not interested in\".",
      "He later backtracked, saying he'd received bad information, and will top the bill on the Pyramid Stage this June (Hannah jokes he'll serenade Glastonbury's livestock, in the style of his lockdown sessions).",
      "But his European tour isn't without peril. Writing on his website, Young has shared concerns that he could be barred from the US upon his return, following a rise in the number of people being detained and deported upon entering the country.",
      "\"If I talk about Donald J Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminium blanket,\" he wrote.",
      "Young, who holds dual Canadian-American citizenship, has long been an outspoken critic of President Trump, calling him \"a disgrace to my country\" and suing him for using the song Rockin' In the Free World on the campaign trail.",
      "Hannah reveals her husband was harassed during the first Trump administration, as he went through the process of becoming a US citizen.",
      "\"They tried to every trick in the book to mess him up, and made him keep coming back to be re-interviewed and re-interviewed. It's ridiculous [because] he's been living in America and paying taxes here since he was in his 20s.\"",
      "Despite that, she doesn't think Young will be prevented from entering the country.",
      "\"They've been detaining people who have green cards or visas \u2013 which is hideous and horrifying -  but they have not, so far, been refusing to let American citizens back in the country, so I don't think that's going to happen.\"",
      "Hannah will accompany Young to Glastonbury, and says she'll film his performance from the side of the stage (perhaps the BBC can use that footage, if all else fails).",
      "The trip happens to fall on the 25th anniversary of her West End debut, in The Seven Year Itch. So, has she any desire to tread the boards again?",
      "\"Oh God, no,\" she exclaims. \"I really loving directing, because I don't have to be the focus of things, and that's a much more comfortable position for me.",
      "\"I mean, never say never, but that's how I feel right now.\"",

      "The White Lotus star Aimee Lou Wood has called a Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketch that impersonated her using exaggerated prosthetic teeth \"mean and unfunny\".",
      "The British actress said the US comedy programme \"punched down\" on her and suggested the sketch was misogynistic.",
      "In a series of Instagram posts, Wood wrote that she was happy to be made fun of \"when it's clever and in good spirits\" but that there \"must be a cleverer, more nuanced, less cheap way\".",
      "Wood, 31, said she had received \"apologies from SNL\" after sharing her criticism. The BBC has contacted broadcaster NBC for a response.",
      "The actress's role in the third series of The White Lotus, which follows a group of guests at a resort, prompted significant media attention surrounding what she calls her \"big gap teeth\".",
      "The SNL sketch, which aired this week, imagined US President Donald Trump and his top team spending time at the fictional hotel.",
      "Wood's character Chelsea was portrayed by cast member Sarah Sherman using a pronounced accent and fake teeth.",
      "At one point, in a reference to the actress's teeth, she asks: \"Fluoride? What's that?\"",
      "Wood, who burst onto screens in Netflix's Sex Education, said she was \"not thin skinned\" and understood that SNL was about \"caricature\".",
      "\"But the whole joke was about fluoride,\" she wrote on Sunday.",
      "\"I have big gap teeth not bad teeth.\"",
      "\"The rest of the skit was punching up,\" Wood added, \"and I/Chelsea was the only one punched down on\".",
      "She said that she was not \"hating on\" Sarah Sherman, but \"hating on the concept\".",
      "Wood also shared a comment by an unnamed user describing the sketch as \"sharp and funny\" before taking \"a screeching turn into 1970s misogyny\".",
      "\"This sums up my view,\" the actress added.",
      "She also criticised Sherman's accent, writing: \"I respect accuracy even if it's mean.\"",
      "Wood, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, wrote that she had received \"thousands of messages\" agreeing with her since sharing her posts, and that she was glad she \"said something\".",
      "Speaking to GQ magazine last week, Wood said that the conversation surrounding her teeth made her \"a bit sad because I'm not getting to talk about my work\".",
      "\"It makes me really happy that it's symbolising rebellion and freedom, but there's a limit,\" she said.",
      "Wood added: \"I don't know if it was a man would we be talking about it this much? It's still going on about a woman's appearance.\"",
      "Sister's support",
      "Following her posts, Wood's younger sister Emily offered her support for the actress on her own Instagram story.",
      "Sharing a picture of the pair together, Emily Wood said her sister was \"out here personifying the word powerhouse\".",
      "\"The admiration I have for this woman is nuts. Beyond comprehension,\" she continued, adding that she felt \"deep animalistic protectiveness\" over her.",
      "\"The greatest big sister. My best human on the planet. Her authenticity and originality is incomparable. My god we are really madly blessed to experience life on earth at the same time as her.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg41r4kx0lko",
    "published": "Mon, 14 Apr 2025 04:02:32 GMT",
    "summary": "The distinguished Peruvian author won the Nobel Prize and courted controversy most of his life.",
    "story": [
      "Mario Vargas Llosa, who has died at the age of 89 in his native Peru, was a towering figure in Latin American literature and culture who rarely shied away from controversy.",
      "With more than 50 works to his name, many of which have been widely translated, Vargas Llosa won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2010 when judges dubbed him a \"divinely gifted story-teller\". His depictions of authoritarianism, violence and machismo, using rich language and imagery, made him a star of the Latin American Boom literary movement that shone a global spotlight on the continent.",
      "At first sympathetic to left-wing ideas, he grew disillusioned with Latin America's revolutionary causes, eventually running unsuccessfully for the Peruvian presidency with a centre-right party in 1990.",
      "Vargas Llosa was born in 1936 to a middle-class family in Arequipa in southern Peru. After his parents separated while he was an infant, he moved to Cochabamba in Bolivia with his great-grandparents. He returned to Peru aged 10 and six years later he wrote his first play, The Escape of the Inca. He graduated from Lima University, studied in Spain and later moved to Paris.",
      "His first novel, The Time of the Hero, was an indictment of corruption and abuse at a Peruvian military school. Written at a time when the country's military wielded significant political and social power, it was published in 1962.",
      "Its forceful, menacing imagery was condemned by several Peruvian generals. One accused Vargas Llosa of having a \"degenerate mind\".",
      "It was based on the writer's own time as a teenager at the Leoncio Prado Military Academy, which he described in 1990 as \"an extremely traumatic experience\". His two years there made him see his country \"as a violent society, filled with bitterness, made up of social, cultural, and racial factions in complete opposition\". The school itself burnt 1,000 copies of the novel on its grounds, Vargas Llosa claimed.",
      "His experimental second novel The Green House (1966) was set in the Peruvian desert and jungle, and described an alliance of pimps, missionaries and soldiers based around a brothel.",
      "The two novels helped found the Latin American Boom literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The Boom was characterised by experimental and explicitly political works that reflected a continent in turmoil.",
      "Its leading authors, who included Vargas Llosa's Colombian friend and sometime rival Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez - who pioneered the kaleidoscopic magical realism style of writing - became household names and their works were read around the world.",
      "Famously the two authors did not speak to each other for decades after Vargas Llosa punched Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez in the face in a Mexican cinema in 1976. Reports of why Vargas Llosa punched his Colombian friend differ.",
      "Friends of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez said the dispute had revolved around Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's friendship with Vargas Llosa's then-wife, Patricia, but Vargas Llosa told students at a Madrid university in 2017 that it had been down to their opposing views on Cuba and its communist leader, Fidel Castro.",
      "They reconciled in 2007 and three years later, in 2010, Vargas Llosa was awarded the Nobel Prize - the first South American writer to be chosen for the literature prize since Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez took the honour in 1982.",
      "Much of Vargas Llosa's work is inseparable from the instability and violence in parts of Latin America in the second half of the 20th Century as the region experienced waves of revolutions and military rule.",
      "His novel Conversations in the Cathedral (1969) was celebrated for exposing how the Peruvian dictatorship of 1948-56 under Manuel Odr\u00eda controlled and eventually ruined the lives of ordinary people.",
      "Like many intellectuals, Vargas Llosa supported Fidel Castro but became disillusioned with the communist leader following the \"Padilla Affair\" when poet Heberto Padilla was imprisoned for criticising the Cuban government in 1971.",
      "In 1983 Vargas Llosa was appointed president of a commission investigating the gruesome killing in a village in the Peruvian Andes of eight journalists, which became known as the Uchuraccay massacre.",
      "Peruvian officials maintained that the journalists had been killed by indigenous villagers who had mistaken the journalists for members of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group.",
      "The commission's report backed the official line, leading to fierce criticism of Vargas Llosa by those who believed that the gruesome nature of the crime and the horrific mutilations inflicted on the body were the hallmark of an infamous anti-terrorist police rather than signs of \"indigenous violence\".",
      "Moving further right on the political spectrum, in 1990 Vargas Llosa ran for the Peruvian presidency with the centre-right Frente Democr\u00e1tico coalition on a neo-liberal platform. He lost to Alberto Fujimori, who went on to govern Peru for the following 10 years.",
      "Despite the criticism levelled against him over the investigation into the Uchuraccay massacre, Vargas Llosa continued to expose state terror and abuse of power through literature.",
      "His novel The Feast of the Goat, published in 2000, focused on dictator Rafael Trujillo, who ruled the Dominican Republic for 31 years until his assassination in 1961. The novel won praise from the Nobel Prize Committee for its attention to \"structures of power\" and \"images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat\".",
      "Other works were adapted for the big screen. His book Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, based on his first marriage, was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, Tune in Tomorrow.",
      "His later work covered figures as diverse as Irish nationalist Roger Casement (The Dream of the Celt, 2012).",
      "He spent the latter years of his life in Peru as well as Madrid.",
      "The author appeared in the pages of Spanish gossip magazine Hola after he left his wife of 50 years in 2015 to be with Spanish-Filipino socialite Isabel Preysler, the mother of popular Latin singer Enrique Iglesias.",
      "He also continued to attract criticism for controversial remarks.",
      "In 2019 he was condemned for blaming the rise in killings of journalists in Mexico - more than 100 in the past decade - on the expansion of press freedom \"which allows journalists to say things that were not permitted previously\". While he also said that \"narcotics trafficking plays an absolutely central part in all of this\", some commentators felt that he failed to express sympathy with the victims and their families.",
      "And in 2018 he caused a stir when, in a column for Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, he called feminism \"the most determined enemy of literature, trying to decontaminate it from machismo, multiple prejudices and immoralities\".",
      "He died in Lima on 13 April surrounded by his family and \"at peace\", his son \u00c1lvaro Vargas Llosa announced.",
      "With his death, the last of the Latin American Boom's great stars has gone."

    "published": "Sun, 13 Apr 2025 00:09:12 GMT",
    "summary": "A planned UK version of the legendary US comedy show is described as a \"difficult proposition\".",
    "story": [
      "US TV institution Saturday Night Live has entertained viewers and created comedy stars for 50 years. Can a British version reach the same heights?",
      "For five decades, the phrase \"Live from New York, it's Saturday night!\" has boldly opened episodes of Saturday Night Live, with its tried and tested mix of topical sketch comedy, celebrity cameos and big-name musical guests.",
      "Now, the stateside staple is to come live from London after Sky announced that a \"star-studded\" UK spin-off, fronted by British comedic talent, will launch next year.",
      "Overseen by the US original show's creator Lorne Michaels, now 80, the broadcaster is promising the same \"live, fast-paced style\" as its American cousin.",
      "Comedy heritage",
      "Since being launched by Michaels in 1975, SNL has been a livewire springboard for comedic talents like Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Tina Fey, Will Ferrell and Mike Myers.",
      "Famed for its ever-revolving cast, Joe Piscopo of the 1980s cohort summed it up in a documentary marking the show's 50th anniversary: \"They took sketch comedy to a whole other level,\" he said. \"Comedy slowly became rock 'n' roll.\"",
      "The unpredictable live premise, combined with its longevity, has helped maintain its status. No other show has been nominated for (331) or won (90) more Emmy Awards.",
      "\"I don't think you can underestimate that heritage when accounting for its current success,\" says the Guardian's TV and comedy writer Rachel Aroesti. \"Which is something the UK version obviously won't be able to emulate.\"",
      "The heritage is one reason why the show still attracts major young stars like Timothee Chalamet, who grew up watching it even as linear TV audiences have dropped sharply in the streaming age.",
      "\"In the US, the guests' involvement is often newsworthy in itself - they also know their presence will generate a lot of publicity, so it's a win-win situation,\" Aroesti adds.",
      "\"I would be surprised if the UK version is able to attract the same calibre of guest.\"",
      "'Courageous' move",
      "The Atlantic writer Helen Lewis says the general industry reaction has been that commissioning a UK version is a \"courageous\" move - wishing the team luck with the \"difficult proposition\".",
      "There are some notable differences between the two transatlantic TV industries.",
      "The US SNL budget will be far bigger than UK TV norm, paying for a large cast and a team of writers working to the wire to keep jokes current.",
      "\"In the American version, it's a very expensive format, having a writers' room and keeping a cast of actors on retainer, essentially, the whole time. That's really expensive,\" Lewis told BBC Radio 4's PM programme.",
      "The US comedy culture is also different, Lewis believes.",
      "\"The humour can sometimes be much more slapsticky. Quite a lot of the time, Americans struggle with British humour because they think we're extremely mean.\"",
      "Comedy writer Jack Bernhardt agrees that there are different comedic traditions. UK sketch groups often form through friendships and showcase their talent at the Edinburgh Fringe, whereas many US comedians train at improv and sketch clubs, specifically honing their skills for shows like SNL.",
      "Bernhardt says these differences \"can't necessarily be fixed by commissioning the UK version of SNL - it's an entire comedy culture that would need to shift\".",
      "\"That's not to say one can't do the other,\" he adds. \"Just that this version of a sketch show isn't necessarily playing to the unique strengths of the UK comedy scene. And that's even before we get into the difficulties of doing a live show.\"",
      "Given these challenges, importing a legacy brand name like SNL may seem a gamble, especially at a time when the UK TV industry is faltering.",
      "However, the US show's fortunes have held relatively firm this decade, even if ratings are well below the pre-streaming era.",
      "Vulture found that SNL averages 8.4 million weekly viewers, outperforming all other late-night shows combined. It's also US network TV's top entertainment series among adults aged 18 to 49.",
      "\"You rarely hear anyone asking whether SNL will 'survive', only how once Michaels moves on,\" wrote reporter Josef Adalian. \"Linear TV may be fighting for its life, yet SNL seems safe.\"",
      "Crucially, the sketch format lends itself perfectly to social media age, being easily digestible on digital platforms. According to the Economist, online SNL clips are averaging about 216 million views per episode on TikTok, X and YouTube. Sure, these viewers are not watching live, but the content undoubtedly lives.",
      "Previous attempts to translate US late-night shows to the UK have often struggled.",
      "However, in the 1980s, Saturday Live - later renamed Friday Night Live - ran for four seasons and helped the careers of Ben Elton, Harry Enfield, Stephen Fry and Rik Mayall, while Channel 4's The 11 O'Clock Show gave breaks to Ricky Gervais and Sacha Baron Cohen.",
      "British comedy producer Jimmy Mulville, whose company Hat Trick Productions has made shows including Have I Got News For You and Whose Line is it Anyway?, says the opportunity to develop new talent will be one of the key draws for Sky, despite the risks.",
      "\"If Sky get this right, they'll create new stars, and from that they can spin-off other shows with those performers,\" he explains. \"These shows can be fantastic, they can go on for years, and they can show off new talent all the time.\"",
      "He says the producers will need to assemble the right team of writers and performers.",
      "\"If it's well-produced, I've no reason to see why it shouldn't be successful,\" says Mulville, who co-hosts Insiders: The TV Podcast.",
      "He recently took the BBC's long-running topical panel show Have I Got News For You to the US, where it has been commissioned for a second season by CNN. One US talent agent warned that the show was \"too British\" to work across the pond, he recalls.",
      "\"I said, 'Yes it is, but I'm going to get it written by Americans and performed by Americans for Americans'.\"",
      "The reverse will be true for SNL. \"In the UK, you're going to have it written by British writers with British performers for a British audience. So it's not an American show any more.\"",
      "Indeed, being \"live from London\" won't be enough on its own to succeed, and SNL UK will need to feel like a truly British comedy creation and not just a reheated imitation of an American hit.",

      "The smash-hit adaptation of the PlayStation video game was a critical and ratings success, launching the young star to full-on leading role status.",

      "Rather than sacrifice her, Joel kills the medics and flees with the unconscious teenager.",
      "When she awakes, he lies to her about what happened, and season one's cliffhanger ending leaves viewers with the strong impression that Ellie is well aware of the deception.",

      "Ellie is 19 in season two, not too much younger than Bella, who began shooting the first series back in 2021.",
      "Number two was delayed by the 2023 Hollywood strikes, so a lot has happened for Bella in the meantime.",
      "There's symmetry there.",

      "Bella says opening up has allowed them \"to be a bit more free\" and hopes it will inspire others.",
      "\"You can be in industries like this and openly say that you're autistic, why there shouldn't be sort of such a stigma around that and such a fear around that,\" says Bella.",

      "\"It doesn't feel like it's like representation added on top to check a box - it really feels like it's just a part of the story.",
      "\"So that was what was exciting about getting to portray this sort of relationship in this medium.\"",
      "The Last of Us has already been commissioned for a third series after a positive critical reception for season two, so Bella - and Ellie - will still be growing up in the public eye for a while yet.",
      "It's something that \"comes with pros and cons,\" says Bella.",

    "published": "Sat, 12 Apr 2025 23:53:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Imagination should have no limit when drawing up new resorts, rollercoaster and theme park experts say.",
    "story": [
      "A new Universal theme park near Bedford - the first in Europe - was announced to much fanfare earlier this week.",
      "Set to open in 2031, construction is to begin at the 476-acre (1.9-sq-km) site, where attractions are likely to feature James Bond, Paddington and The Lord of the Rings.",
      "But from deciding how many loops to include on a coaster, to making sure even the trees blend in seamlessly with an area's design, building a dream world is a painstaking task.",
      "To find out what planning lies behind the thrills, and what sort of things we could expect when the new Universal park finally arrives, BBC News spoke to some rollercoaster experts.",
      "Building an iconic rollercoaster",
      "Of course, any good theme park needs some good rides - but maybe it's an understatement to say that's a tall order.",
      "While \"at least two or three iconic rides\" are needed, these need not necessarily be the fastest, tallest or most innovative to stand out, explains Andy Sinclair-Harris, creative director at Katapult, which has designed attractions for the likes of Legoland and Alton Towers.",
      "\"What is more important is the depth of storytelling,\" he says, so that you're fully immersed in the experience of the ride.",
      "A good example, says Robbie Jones, insights director at Katapult, is a Harry-Potter-themed rollercoaster called Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, located at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal's Orlando resort. Riders sit in replicas of Hagrid's motorbike and zoom through recreations of settings from the popular film series.",
      "\"There's nothing particularly brand new or absolutely amazing about that ride, other than it tells a story amazingly well,\" he adds.",
      "How Universal Studios almost came to Essex",
      "Bond and Paddington could star at Universal park",
      "If the rumours that there's going to be a Back to the Future ride at Universal's UK venture are true, those behind it will be ensuring that the DeLorean time machine is included, he says.",
      "During the brainstorming stage of building a resort, rides are often \"developed as storytelling tools\" in a \"specific genre or world\", says Joseph Bright, CEO at Scruffy Dog, which provides creative project management for theme parks.",
      "While an iconic ride might help to \"anchor\" a zone of a park, \"it's never developed in isolation\" - rather \"cohesion is critical [and] every element... must serve the wider guest story\".",
      "Dennis Speigel, founder of International Theme Park Services, says meticulous planning goes into the most immersive rides.",
      "He adds that the size of a rollercoaster is partly dictated by the number of guests its designers hope to get on board - \"between 1,500 and 2,000 an hour\" at popular parks.",
      "Usually, that means a coaster that is over 3,000ft (914m) long, with the first dip \"somewhere in the 150ft (45m) range\".",
      "Mr Speigel says that while an upcoming coaster at Six Flags Qiddiya in Saudi Arabia is set to break records when it sends riders speeding at over 150mph (240 km/h) around the tracks, most coasters today reach between 70-90mph (110-145 km/h) on their first drop.",
      "Once the larger rides are planned out, theme park designers then consider what he describes as \"flat rides\", which cater to less thrill-seeking crowds.",
      "\"Those are your smaller rides that take people around and around, like a merry-go-round or a monster,\" he says. \"[They're] rides that can often be bought off the shelf from a manufacturer.\"",
      "Your route to the ride is key",
      "When you step foot in a theme park, you're probably thinking about the rides you'll be going on - but you might think less about how you get there.",
      "During the design phase, you have to let your imagination run wild, says Mr Sinclair-Harris. \"Budget is a thing, but when you have those first initial discussions, you shouldn't be tempered by anything,\" he says.",
      "The \"story\" of your park is crucial, he adds. \"It's knowing the story, the characters and being true to that world.\"",
      "Discussions about potential ride dimensions and manufacturers soon follow, as well as a masterplan, which configures how attractions, pathways and amenities all fit into the space. It often determines how long people will end up queuing for.",
      "An artist's conception of the Universal UK park depicts a huge lake in middle of what appears to be different themed areas. Far from just looking pretty, it can allow crowds to fan out to multiple rides without congestion forming around one.",
      "Alton Towers has a lake too. Theme park vlogger and fanatic Charlotte Branford - known as Diary of a RollerCoaster Girl - believes it means other visitors often choose to go left around it (to the Wicker Man ride), or right around it (towards the Smiler). She heads to the back of the park to try to avoid the crowds.",
      "At the back of parks designed in this way you'll often find a show with set times \"to try and stop people running around to the back of the park to get to some big attraction\", says Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club, who has been involved in rollercoaster designs.",
      "\"Without realising it, they're trying to make you do roughly what they want you to do when you're in the park.\"",
      "Another tried and tested layout is the \"hub and spoke\" often seen at Disneyland resorts, says Mr Sinclair-Harris.",
      "\"In a sense you've got that central gathering point... like the castle in the Magic Kingdom... with different lands like spokes on a wheel, radiating out.\"",
      "Universal's new Epic Universe theme park in Orlando will follow a version of this - allowing you to venture into different lands through portals.",
      "The finer details",
      "So the stories behind the rollercoasters are intertwined with the story of the theme park layout itself.",
      "Then come the finishing touches - to maintain your sense of being in a futuristic or fantasy world while you're there.",
      "Trees, artificial rock or even other buildings are often used to obscure unsightly but necessary objects, Mr Sinclair-Harris says. \"If you're in an amazing world with castles and dragons, seeing a telephone pole removes you from that story\".",
      "Even the audio playing out, scent of a park and queue lines are considered because they \"play a role in that illusion,\" says Mr Bright.",
      "As Mr Garvanovic puts it, \"there's tons of subtle stuff going on in the background\" in a well thought-out theme park.",
      "The sign of success, perhaps, is when you barely even notice it.",

    "summary": "The four-part series tells the story of Daniel Brennan, a deaf man on a journey of revenge.",
    "story": [
      "\"Every day, as a deaf person, you're reminded of your deafness,\" says William Mager, writer of new BBC thriller Reunion.",
      "These reminders can range from having to face medical appointments with no available interpreter to being excluded from important decisions about your own life, he says.",
      "\"All those things add up over time and generate a sense of injustice,\" Mager says, adding that artist Christine Sun Kim describes this feeling as \"deaf rage\".",
      "It is a feeling partly borne out of the frustration and isolation of living in a hearing-centred world.",
      "This rage, alongside a love of 70s thrillers, is what inspired Mager's new drama.",
      "The bilingual thriller features both British Sign Language (BSL), with subtitles, and spoken English. The majority of the cast in Reunion are deaf or use BSL in their roles.",
      "The four-part series, from the producers of Adolescence, tells the story of Daniel Brennan (Matthew Gurney), a deaf man on a journey of revenge after spending a decade in prison.",
      "Mager, a lifelong fan of 70s thrillers, says he wanted to put his own \"twist\" on films like Get Carter and The Outfit (which feature \"intimidating men in cool clothes\" on a mission of vengeance) by drawing on the deaf experience as well.",
      "\"Reunion starts out like those classic thrillers, but ends up in a very different place,\" the writer says.",
      "As main character Brennan hunts down a man known only as Monroe, viewers become aware of a painful secret he's been hiding and the struggles he is facing to find justice in a hearing-centred world.",
      "The Guardian called the performances in the show \"outstanding\" and the switch between signed and spoken language \"utterly seamless\", while the Independent says Reunion is \"in many ways, a groundbreaking show\".",
      "Ultimately, Mager says he wanted to touch on issues unique to the deaf community in the programme, as well as providing opportunities for deaf creatives.",
      "'Unfortunately, that's still the reality'",
      "Mager says communication is a central theme of Reunion and the drama shows how each character struggles with it.",
      "One key example is a scene where Brennan's daughter Carly has to pass on painful information to her mother and father that would usually be relayed by professionals, due to a lack of interpreters.",
      "\"Unfortunately, that's still the reality today,\" Mager says, explaining his wife recently experienced this, having to interpret for her mother at a hospital appointment, because an interpreter had not been booked.",
      "Mager says this shows how deaf people often have to rely on someone else voicing them in order to be understood.",
      "\"That can be hard for a deaf person to relinquish that control over what they're saying to someone else,\" he says.",
      "Another thing Mager wanted to draw attention to was literacy rates in deaf children.",
      "A key plot point in Reunion is that Brennan is unable to read or write in English which, coupled with the prison's failure to book interpreters, means he misses important letters from his daughter and does not have his case details fully explained.",
      "\"Deaf children often lag behind their hearing counterparts in education, particularly [in] reading and writing,\" Mager says.",
      "The writer adds that, in his opinion, this is partly due to language deprivation, resulting from deaf children not being given access to the language they're most comfortable with from a young age.",
      "According to Simon Want, from the National Deaf Children's Society, many deaf children face barriers to accessing a good education.",
      "'I hope that door stays open'",
      "Mager says it was a \"joy\" to see the actors both deaf and hearing bringing his script to life.",
      "On set, deaf first assistant director Sam Arnold worked with hearing first assistant director Alex Szygowski to relay directions to the cast and crew.",
      "And hearing actors Anne-Marie Duff and Lara Peake learned to sign for their roles.",
      "\"They're all fantastic. My favourite thing about making Reunion has been to see the genuine enthusiasm and excitement [of] the cast and crew,\" Mager says.",
      "The writer adds that he hopes the series will \"open a door\" for deaf creatives both in front of and behind the camera.",

    "story": [
      "The young cast of Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza\u2019s film Warfare had to bond pretty quickly, to play a US military unit whose lives depended on each other, during the Iraq war in 2006.",
      "Familiarity was crucial, so before filming began, the cast were sent on a three-week military bootcamp.",
      "They lived together, learning military jargon and gun safety and were pushed beyond their limits - all of which brought them closer together.",
      "First off though, they agreed to shave each other's heads to look the part, boosting trust and familiarity.",
      "\"We shaved our heads on day one, and got tattoos at the end of the process, so it bookended the experience,\" Poulter tells the BBC.",
      "The actor, who recently appeared in The Bear and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, plays Captain Eric, who was part of a group of US soldiers and Iraqi scouts on a surveillance mission.",
      "We see how it goes wrong, with devastating consequences.",
      "Heartstopper star Connor plays newcomer Tommy, hitting home how young the soldiers were - he's just turned 21, the same age Tommy was at the time.",
      "The actor says the decision to get a shared tattoo with his castmates after filming wrapped was a \"no-brainer\". The casts of The Avengers and The Lord of the Rings did the same thing after their final films.",
      "Warfare's actors decided their tattoo would say \"Call On Me\", to reflect their brotherhood, while referencing Erik Prydz's 2004 dance hit, which kicks the film off.",
      "The cast features some other big names, including Reservation Dogs' D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Sh\u014dgun's Cosmo Jarvis, Stranger Things and the forthcoming Beatles biopic's Joseph Quinn, and Riverdale's Charles Melton.",
      "\"It was really formative for me,\" Connor says about his time  on the film. \"I've made friends I really do believe I will know for a long time.",
      "\"We all wanted to commemorate it - we are so proud of the work we've done together.\"",
      "The movie is based entirely on a real-life mission that took place during the Iraq war, and is built on the memories of the US soldiers who were there.",
      "The group was embedded in the home of an ordinary Iraqi family, who we briefly see in the film, in Ramadi - an area controlled by Al-Qaeda forces.",
      "The military's goal had been to slip into and observe the area under the cover of darkness, to ensure the safe passage of ground forces there the next day.",
      "What they didn't know what that they were next door to an insurgent house, making them the target of an attack.",
      "Shot in real-time, Warfare has no music or flashbacks, so there's no let-up for the audience. You're dropped into the thick of the action for the whole film.",
      "The soldiers in command have to make split-second decisions amid the pain and chaos, with the Iraqi family caught in the crossfire.",
      "Oscar nominee Garland, whose back catalogue includes the 28 Days film franchise and Ex Machina, got the idea for Warfare when he was making last year's film Civil War.",
      "He was working on the battle scenes with Hollywood stunt man and gunfight co-ordinator Ray Mendoza.",
      "\"During the edit process of Civil War, I was able to really focus on some of the work Ray had done, and how sophisticated and how nuanced it was,\" Garland recalls.",
      "They got chatting about Mendoza's previous life as a US Navy Seal, and about the Ramadi operation, where he was its communications officer.",
      "Mendoza said he'd always wanted to make a film about that mission.",
      "The veteran had a very big reason for wanting to recreate what happened that day - to help replace the lost memories of his colleague Elliott Miller.",
      "Miller, a former Navy Seal, was so badly injured in Ramadi that he suffered traumatic brain injury and memory loss, and had to have a leg amputated.",
      "During the mission, Mendoza carried the unconscious soldier to the rescue tank that ultimately saved his life.",
      "\"Elliott doesn't remember it, and when he woke up, he had a lot of questions,\" Mendoza says.",
      "\"No matter how many maps we drew, or how many times we wrote it out - without that core memory, I think he's had a hard time.",
      "\"It just raised more questions than answers. So I wanted to recreate this one.\"",
      "So Garland and Mendoza decided to make Warfare together, sharing writing and directing credits, and dedicating the film to Miller.",
      "The crucial question is whether seeing the film helped Miller piece things together.",
      "\"It did, yeah - he was a sponge,\" Mendoza says.",
      "\"We walked him through it - he had a lot of questions, he's got kids that have questions.",
      "\"It's now a film memory, but it's as close as he's gonna have \u2013 he's super grateful.\"",
      "Miller was played by Jarvis, who calls him \"a funny guy... he's great - a living embodiment of perseverance\".",
      "It was a \"unique situation to be in when you're entrusted with portraying somebody that's sitting right across from you\", Jarvis said, about having the person he was playing actually on set.",
      "\"But because he didn't remember [what happened], a lot of my references had to come from his colleagues.\"",
      "The soldiers' casting has caused some excitement online, with some publications breathily calling the actors \"all of the internet's boyfriends\" and \"red hot rising stars\".",

      "\"So what that means is their willingness to push their bodies past a comfort level that they're maybe not used to. 'You're gonna be exhausted. You're gonna be required to rely on other people. It's not about you, it's about the team'.",

    "story": [
      "While on holiday in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) last week, there was only one mission on my mind - getting my hands on the viral \"Dubai chocolate\" bar.",
      "If you're on TikTok, you will have seen the bar, which combines the flavours of chocolate, pistachio and tahini with filo pastry, and is inspired by the Arab dessert Knafeh.",
      "The original, called Can't Get Knafeh of It, by FIX Chocolatier, has been sold exclusively in the UAE since 2022. It become so popular on social media that it's only on sale for two hours a day and often sells out within minutes.",
      "But now imitations, known by the nickname \"Dubai chocolate\", have hit UK supermarkets including Waitrose, Lidl and Morrisons, with some supermarkets limiting the number of bars customers are allowed to buy.",
      "Yezen Alani, who co-owns FIX with his wife Sarah Hamouda, told the BBC the global attention Dubai chocolate was getting was \"flattering and humbling\".",
      "The FIX chocolate bar was first imagined by Hamouda in 2021, who craved the flavours while she was pregnant.",
      "Alani and Hamouda started developing the bar a year later, running the business alongside their corporate jobs.",
      "\"Sarah and I were brought up in the UK and we moved to Dubai 10 years ago, so we've got Western and Arab roots.",
      "\"We wanted to create flavours that were inspired by that,\" Alani says.",
      "Part of the appeal of the chocolate is its exclusivity - you can only order it using a food delivery app, rather than walking into a shop or grabbing it at the supermarket.",
      "It costs around \u00a315 per bar and can only be bought during specific hours of the day to ensure the company can fulfil all their orders.",
      "I also saw similar bars sold in many shops in the region, dubbed \"Dubai chocolate\" and adorned with pictures of pistachios and filo pastry.",
      "Alani says the \"copycat\" bars are \"very frustrating because people are trying knockoffs, which damages our brand\".",
      "One of the reasons for the bar's surge in popularity has been social media - with a viral video by TikTok user Maria Vehera  from 2023 being cited as one of the main reasons for its rise to prominence.",
      "It shows Vehera trying the Knafeh bar for the first time - along with several others made by the same chocolatier - and has been liked nearly seven million times.",
      "The way the bar looks is made for social media -  from the attractive orange and green spots on top of the smooth milk chocolate to the crunch sound it makes when you break off a piece.",
      "Chocolate combined with pistachio isn't new but the real standout element is the crunchy nature of the filling, with the filo pastry adding a texture and thickness to the bar.",
      "Since the Can't Get Knafeh of It bar is only available in one country, other brands have started to sell their versions in the UK, including Swiss chocolate manufacturer Lindt whose Dubai chocolate is being sold for \u00a310 in supermarkets.",
      "Since stocking the bar, Waitrose says they've had to introduce a two-bar limit for customers in order to regulate stock levels.",
      "Another version has also been sold by Home Bargains, while supermarket Lidl has its own version for \u00a34.99 and is also limiting purchase numbers.",
      "One influencer documented how the has bar been kept behind tills for this reason.",
      "Having tried the Lindt bar and a couple of other versions being sold in corner shops, there is quite a contrast.",
      "The FIX chocolate is billed as a \"dessert bar\" and needs to be kept in the fridge, with a short expiry date like many dairy items.",
      "This isn't the case for the others, which have been designed to have a longer shelf life.",
      "You can also see the difference in taste and texture - the original bar is almost double the width of the Lindt bar, which is more aligned to the size and shape of a standard chocolate bar.",
      "When Alani and Hamouda first started out, they employed one person to fulfil around six to seven orders a day.",
      "But since growing in popularity, primarily thanks to TikTok, their business now employs 50 people, who fulfil 500 orders a day.",
      "One big talking point has been the price of the product, which is \u00a315 per bar.",
      "\"It's all handmade, every single design is done by hand,\" Alani says.",
      "\"We use premium ingredients and the process is not like making other bars - you've got the baking, moulding the chocolate to the design and with the filling itself, even the pistachios are hand-picked and processed\".",
      "Speaking to Arabian Business last year, Hamouda said: \"My mother used to make Knafeh, and that's something I wanted to capture my own way.",
      "\"Knafeh was the first flavour we perfected. The crunch, the pistachio, it had to be just right,\" she added.",
      "Despite the product's success, Alani says \"it's been a tough journey\" as the pair have been working together full time while also raising their two children.",
      "\"There's been times where we've wanted to give up, but we said to ourselves 'we'll keep going as long as we can pay the rent' and now we have no regrets as its worked out\"."

    "story": [
      "Music fans wondering what Pulp would do for an encore have finally got their answer as the Britpop legends announced they would be releasing their first new album for almost a quarter of century in June.",
      "The first single from the upcoming More takes a familiar path to their much-loved previous songs, with singer Jarvis Cocker drawing on his own experiences and interactions for its lyrics.",
      "Its main inspiration though is not the band's native Sheffield or Cocker's meandering life through London, Paris or the Peak District, but a gig that has a special place in music history - The Stone Roses' almost legendary show at Spike Island.",
      "Held on the banks of the Mersey in Widnes, Cheshire, at the height of the Madchester pioneers' fame in 1990, it has become one of rock music's most mythologised gigs.",
      "Who were The Stone Roses?",
      "Formed in Manchester in 1985, The Stone Roses originally featured singer Ian Brown, guitarist John Squire, bass player Gary 'Mani' Mounfield and drummer Alan 'Reni' Wren.",
      "With singles such as This Is the One, I Am the Resurrection and Fools Gold, they provided some of the biggest soundtracks of the Madchester music scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s.",
      "The movement saw an explosion of a musical and cultural scene in their home city, where a blend of indie rock, acid house, psychedelia and 1960s pop rose in popularity.",
      "Matt Mead, who has published a book about the band, said they were \"the biggest band at that time\".",
      "\"They were as big, if not bigger, than U2, who were massive,\" he said.",
      "\"Their musicianship was second to none.",
      "\"You just had four members, but there was some sort of magic that happened when they were on stage.\"",
      "Along with the music, the band also had a distinctive style, leading fans to adopt baggy clothing, mop haircuts and bucket hats.",
      "Their beloved Manchester United even launched a kit collection in 2024 inspired by the band.",
      "Why did they play Spike Island?",
      "As part of their series of gigs, The Stone Roses held a concert at Spike Island on a sunny day on 27 May 1990.",
      "It seemed like the ideal spot, almost equidistant from the huge musical hubs of Manchester and Liverpool and the band's legions of North-West fans.",
      "Created after the 1833 extension of the Sankey Canal in Widnes, Cheshire, the island was the centre of Britain's chemical industry during the Industrial Revolution.",
      "Factories and railways dominated the area until the industry went into decline in the 20th Century.",
      "The area has now become a haven for wildlife with paths for walkers and cyclists.",
      "What happened at the concert?",
      "Official figures suggest about 28,000 people attended the concert on 27 May 1990 but Mead reckons that goes up to about 30,000 if gatecrashers were included.",
      "Dave Haslam performed a DJ set before The Stone Roses' performance.",
      "He said there was an element of chaos from the start as the band's management booked the wrong DJ acts, getting rave favourite Frankie Bones instead of house legend Frankie Knuckles.",
      "He said that sort of misstep was \"evidence of the endearing amateurism around the gig\".",
      "\"My generation were not really into open air festivals,\" he said.",
      "\"Glastonbury wasn't anywhere like it is as big now.",
      "\"We liked rave venues or basement live music.",
      "\"We liked sweaty little venues clubs in the middle of town.\"",
      "There have been mixed reviews of the concert with Pulp guitarist Mark Webber telling BBC 6 Music describing the show as \"a slight anticlimax\".",
      "\"There was a lot of anticipation but it didn't sound very good,\" he said.",
      "\"It was very windy and the vibe wasn't there.\"",
      "Haslam said that was another example of the lack of experience of putting on such big shows.",
      "\"I don't think anyone appreciated that you need to a lot of amplification to reach the back of the crowd, because all the sound just gets lost in the atmosphere,\" he said.",
      "Mead, who is helping on a documentary project about the concert, said recently-found footage revealed \"key moments\".",
      "\"When the band play I Wanna Be Adored and you see the crowd, it's electric,\" he said.",
      "\"It's like nothing else \u2013 wall-to-wall bouncing from the front to the back.\"",
      "He said there was also \"blissed-out dancing\" during Fools Gold and \"everyone's arms in the air\" for I Am the Resurrection.",
      "Haslam also remembers fans filing out of the gig in \"very, very high spirits\".",
      "\"Whatever the problems with the sound and waiting around and all of that, I think for those young people, they knew they'd had a day out to remember,\" he added.",
      "Why has it become the stuff of legend?",
      "Until a full recording came to light in 2024, it was thought the concert had not been captured on film, making it the subject of much mystique for those who weren't there.",
      "But even with the new find, Haslam believes the gig was significant because The Stone Roses \"didn't play that often\" and it felt like \"a life-changing moment\".",
      "\"It was an opportunity to see this band that had somehow seemed to be the most significant band of the era.",
      "\"It was the culmination of two or three years when a certain look and a sound that was a kind of cross between funky indie and rave really animated a new generation.\"",
      "He said the Spike Island show was part of a series of gigs that \"took The Stone Roses from being a big local band and a kind of Manchester secret to being internationally renowned\".",
      "Crews travelled from France and Germany for the event while fans came from across the country.",
      "Haslam said there \"wasn't really anything similar afterwards\" for the band due to the time it took the band to release a second album.",
      "\"That took far too long - four or five years - so a lot of the momentum went out of the Roses at that point and by the time they came back, that part of the world had all moved on to Oasis\".",
      "He said Spike Island \"was the only moment where you had The Stone Roses absolutely at their peak, playing music that had been quite underground but had been becoming accepted by the mainstream - that mix of euphoric rave vibe with rock music\".",
      "What happened to The Stone Roses?",
      "After the Spike Island show, The Stone Roses became embroiled in a long legal battle with their record label and did not release a follow-up album, The Second Coming, until 1994.",
      "Three months after its release, Reni left the band and was followed a year later by Squire.",
      "Brown and Mani tried to carry on with guitarist Aziz Ibrahim and drummer Robbie Maddix joining the band, but within a few months, they dissolved the band.",
      "Squire, Brown and Mani went on to have post-Roses success, while Reni left music altogether.",
      "After years of rumours, the original line-up finally reformed in 2011, going on to play huge gigs across the globe before Squire confirmed in 2019 that they had split once more.",
      "How did the gig come to inspire Pulp?",
      "Though Pulp had been a working band for over a decade when Spike Island happened, they did not break into the mainstream until the release of their His 'n' Hers album in 1994, before becoming huge stars with the release of their landmark single Common People a year later.",
      "That song was taken from their most successful album, Different Class, which also spawned the hit, Sorted for E's and Wizz, which Cocker has now revealed was a sister song to the new single and was also based on a fan's experience of the Stone Roses' gig.",
      "The inspiration for that track was \"a girl that I was speaking to at The Leadmill (nightclub) in Sheffield one night,\" he said.",
      "\"She said all that she could remember were people going round saying, 'Is everyone sorted for E's and wizz?'.",
      "\"So that phrase stuck in my mind.\"",
      "He said he did not go to Spike Island, but had written the new song's lyrics after speaking to various attendees, including musician Jason Buckle, from the band All Seeing I, who co-wrote the single.",
      "\"All he could remember was a DJ who between every song said, 'Spike Island come alive, Spike Island come alive',\" he said.",

Synnovis, which serves six hospitals in London, added that it had \"dedicated every available resource to delivering clinically safe and largely manual interim solutions\".",
      "According to more than a dozen GPs we heard from, across all of south-east London's boroughs, the severity of challenges they face under Synnovis is causing anxiety for both patients and doctors.",
      "The GPs told the BBC that the blood-test issues were leading to unnecessary hospital referrals and wasted patient appointments. In one case the BBC was told about, an elderly man who was caring for his wife with dementia needlessly spent hours in accident and emergency (A&E) due to problems with his test.",
      "One GP, who spoke to the BBC anonymously, said: \"It would [previously] never cross our minds that a blood test might not be reliable. This is now an everyday concern.",
      "\"The current problems with Synnovis is nothing short of a national scandal,\" they added.",
      "Kemi, a 17-year-old college student, started to experience heart palpitations, breathlessness and fatigue six months ago.",
      "Unable to attend college because of her health issues, in November she sought an appointment at her GP surgery, which relies on Synnovis for blood testing.",
      "When the results came back, she was told there was a problem. \"I found out there was something wrong with the blood test - my potassium was too high, which is not normal,\" she said.",
      "However, Kemi said her GP told her that her potassium levels were not actually high, but that this result was found because her blood sample had coagulated as it had waited too long to be processed.",
      "When she received her results on the NHS app - which the BBC has seen - it said they were \"invalid due to laboratory error\". Kemi said the situation had left her \"frustrated, sad and confused\".",
      "\"I'm really stuck. I'm depressed, I'm anxious that something's going to happen to me before I get a diagnosis,\" she told us. \"I am worried that I am going to end up seriously hurt because I can't get the diagnosis I need.\"",
      "GPs have told the BBC that unreliable blood results, with erroneously high levels of potassium caused by processing delays, are a regular occurrence since Synnovis began the service.",
      "High potassium levels in the blood can point to serious health issues, such as heart problems.",
      "Because of this, GPs say they cannot ignore blood-test results that indicate high potassium - even if they believe them to be incorrect - and they are obliged to refer patients immediately to A&E.",
      "GPs say these patients are often turned away after being retested at hospital, where normal potassium levels are discovered.",
      "'I couldn't reassure them'",
      "It is an issue Dr Shah - not his real name - says he experiences on a weekly basis.",
      "\"If the potassium level is above six it can cause problems with the heart and heart rhythm disturbances that could potentially prove to be fatal,\" Dr Shah said. \"It's an urgent thing that needs to have the sample repeated and to make sure the result is genuine or a false reading.\"",
      "Dr Shah, who has been a GP for nearly three decades, said the frequency of elevated potassium in blood results had been unusually high at his surgery in recent years.",
      "\"It turned out that there were delays in the collection of samples from the GP surgeries, then to the labs\u2026 delays in processing in the labs, which was causing the results to be high,\" he said.",
      "Dr Shah told the BBC he recently had to send a man in his 80s to hospital as his potassium level appeared elevated on a Synnovis blood test. He explained that the patient had come to the surgery with his wife who had dementia and his daughter, and the family were concerned about long waiting times at A&E that evening.",
      "\"I had to say to them they shouldn't leave it until the next day because whilst I thought it was normal, I couldn't reassure them,\" Dr Shah explained. At hospital, the patient's potassium level was eventually found to be normal and he was discharged.",
      "Trainees urged to help hospitals after cyber-attack",
      "Dr Shah added: \"I'm probably sending a couple of patients to A&E a week because of results I suspect to be faulty. Since Synnovis took over pathology services for south-east London, it's pretty much been a catalogue of disasters.",
      "\"We're almost second-guessing the pathology system and it's something that never used to happen.",
      "\"You go to a shoe shop, you expect to buy a pair of shoes; you have a pathology service, you expect accuracy and reliability. That's not happening.\"",
      "Dr Shah's account is not a lone one.",
      "A range of claims has been made by the 14 GPs we have heard from \u2013 who all wanted to remain anonymous for professional reasons.",
      "One GP told the BBC that the increased workload resulting from having to assess and then escalate unreliable results was leading to \"increased burnout and people wanting to leave the profession\".",
      "Several GPs told of recent instances where they were unable to do timely diabetes tests for patients because of Synnovis delays.",
      "Londonwide LMCs (local medical committees), the body that represents and supports GPs across the capital, said the problems with blood-test delays and inaccuracies experienced by GPs in south-east London were not consistent with the pathology service across other parts of the city.",
      "\"We have never had so many emails and questions, apart from the beginning of Covid, about one particular thing, from one area in London, said Michelle Drage, CEO of Londonwide LMCs.",
      "\"This is happening on a daily basis, on a clinic-by-clinic basis,\" she added.",
      "Acknowledging the impact the problems have had on the morale and workload of GPs, Ms Drage said: \"We do not believe we can rely on Synnovis for accuracy. Our GPs have lost faith and trust in that service \u2013 that's a horrible situation to be in.\"",
      "In October, Londonwide LMCs escalated its concerns to the Southeast London Integrated Care Board \u2013 the body charged with holding to account the NHS hospital trusts partnered with Synnovis.",
      "Ms Drage said the written response it received was \"unsatisfactory\".",
      "As well as hearing the testimony of doctors, the BBC has seen dozens of Synnovis emails, sent to GPs from 2021 to the present day, apologising and attempting to account for various pathology problems, for instance regarding tests for malaria and diabetes.",
      "One email showed Synnovis apologising for a backlog of 70,000 test results in spring 2024 - before the cyber-attack.",
      "Dr Jayne - not her real name - explained that it took Synnovis a month to discover the backlog and begin to address it. \"It's really difficult to quantify that problem\u2026 70,000 worries,\" the GP of nearly 20 years told the BBC.",
      "\"It's really stressful. We try to protect our patients. I feel like I'm constantly apologising for the system. It's not my fault. We really want to be getting on with our work properly and not managing Synnovis's errors.\"",
      "Don't blame us for people suffering - London hospital hackers",
      "Southeast London Integrated Care Board said in a statement that tests requested by south-east London GPs alone amounted to about 10,000 a day, \"with a number of logistical steps involved, from blood taking through to results reporting\".",
      "It said there had been \"a number of incidents\" since Synnovis took on pathology services for south-east London that had been driven by a \"number of factors, including incidents that have impacted on the Synnovis service but which were outside of their control\".",
      "The statement continued: \"You will also be aware that one of these incidents was a criminal cyberattack, the response to which was an extraordinary effort from multiple partners, including Synnovis, to maintain a viable service for our GP colleagues, while Synnovis undertook the significant task of rebuilding their systems from the ground up.\"",
      "According to a statement released by NHS England in October, 10,152 acute outpatient appointments and 1,710 elective procedures were postponed as a result of the cyberattack.",
      "The statement said: \"The final stages of recovery following the cyber attack on pathology services provider Synnovis in June are almost complete, which means nearly all services are now up and running.\"",
      "'Extremely challenging'",
      "In its statement, Synnovis said it offered more than 6,000 different types of test, serving almost two million patients, six hospitals and 191 GP practices across 249 sites.",
      "\"While we understand that any error at all can cause patient and practitioner distress, erroneous Synnovis tests account for significantly less than 0.001% of the 150,000 tests we process per day.\"",
      "However, these figures appear to include all Synnovis testing, including urine tests.",
      "Synnovis added in its statement: \"The provision of Synnovis's pathology services for GPs is enabled through a range of test-request and results systems and software, a significant portion of which predates the Synnovis contract and are provided by legacy third-party suppliers.",
      "\"We are very aware that this has been an extremely challenging and sometimes distressing period for patients and front-line NHS colleagues and are incredibly sorry for the inconvenience and upset caused to those affected.\"",
      "For college student Kemi, her recent experiences have made her lose confidence in the health service.",
      "She said: \"I feel like as a young person, not being able to have access to reliable results sets the precedent that I can't have an independent health journey as a 17-year-old. It's hard to know where I can go from here.",
      "\"It might seem like it's just a blood test but it's serious. It can be a matter of life and death.\"",

      "More than three million children around the world are thought to have died in 2022 as a result of infections that are resistant to antibiotics, according to a study by two leading experts in child health.",
      "Children in Africa and South East Asia were found to be most at risk.",
      "Antimicrobial resistance - known as AMR - develops when the microbes that cause infections evolve in such a way that antibiotic drugs no longer work.",

      "A new study now reveals the toll that AMR is taking on children.",

      "Increased use of antibiotics",
      "Antibiotics are used to treat or prevent a huge range of bacterial infections - everything from skin infections to pneumonia.",
      "They are also sometimes given as a precaution to prevent, rather than treat, an infection - for example if someone is having an operation or receiving chemotherapy treatment for cancer.",
      "Antibiotics have no impact on viral infections, though - illnesses such as the common cold, flu or Covid.",
      "But some bacteria have now evolved resistance to some drugs, due to their overuse and inappropriate use, while the production of new antibiotics  - a lengthy and costly process - has slowed right down.",
      "The report's lead authors, Doctor Yanhong Jessika Hu of Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia and Professor Herb Harwell of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, point to a significant growth in the use of antibiotics that are meant to only be held back for the most serious infections.",
      "Between 2019 and 2021 the use of \"watch antibiotics\", drugs with a high risk of resistance, increased by 160% in South East Asia and 126% in Africa.",
      "Over the same period, \"reserve antibiotics\" -  last-resort treatments for severe, multidrug-resistant infections - rose by 45% in South East Asia and 125% in Africa.",
      "Dwindling options",
      "The authors warn that if bacteria develop resistance to these antibiotics, there will be few, if any, alternatives for treating multidrug-resistant infections.",
      "Prof Harwell is presenting the findings at the Congress of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Vienna later this month.",
      "\"AMR is a global problem. It affects everyone. We did this work really to focus on the disproportionate way in which AMR affects children,\" he said ahead of the event.",

      "Is there a solution to AMR?",
      "The WHO describes AMR as one of the most serious global health threats we face, but speaking from Vienna, Prof Harwell warns that there are no easy answers.",
      "\"It's a multi-faceted problem that extends into all aspects of medicine and really, human life,\" he said.",
      "\"Antibiotics are ubiquitous around us, they end up in our food and the environment and so coming up with a single solution is not easy.\"",
      "The best way to avoid a resistant infection is to avoid infection altogether, which means higher levels of immunisation, water sanitation and hygiene are needed, he adds.",
      "\"There's going to be more antibiotics use because there's more people who need them, but we need to make sure that they are used appropriately and the correct medicines are used.\"",
      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, said the new study \"marks a significant and alarming increase compared to previous data\".",
      "\"These findings should serve as a wake-up call for global health leaders. Without decisive action, AMR could undermine decades of progress in child health, particularly in the world's most vulnerable regions.\"",

    "story": [
      "Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal.",
      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",
      "Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.",
      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",
      "In another room, Jaxon, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.",
      "A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jaxon can keep all the stickers he finds.",
      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",
      "\"These are what I call 'building blocks' of really important skills.\"",
      "The study will also assess language development and processing speed - a measure of how quickly children pick up new information.",
      "The Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health.",
      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",
      "In this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.",
      "Emily, who was studied as a child of the 90s, is Henry's mum. Today, her young son sits on her lap as he works on one of the research team's carefully designed puzzles.",
      "\"We've both been a part of this since birth,\" Emily says. \"It wasn't a choice for me at the start - my mum signed me up. But it is now, and I just think it's fascinating.\"",
      "Helping children to thrive in the future is the aim, Dr Holmboe says. Because when children start school, she explains \"a lot of things are already set.",
      "\"This is the groundwork that will help us support children at the right time.\"",
      "Henry and Jaxon finish their puzzles and games and take off their brain-scanning hats.",
      "\"My boys just love coming here,\" says Emily. \"They love all the toys - they get free snacks. So I'll continue coming just as long as they want to.",

    "story": [
      "US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK, as the dust continues to settle from America's global trade shakeup.",
      "\"We're certainly working very hard with Keir Starmer's government,\" Vance said in an interview on Monday with the UnHerd website.",
      "The global stock market has been rocked by turbulence since 2 April, after President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on nearly every country.",
      "The unprecedented US trade policy manoeuvre included a 10% \"baseline\" tariff on all imports from the UK, France and other long-standing trade partners.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "PM: I'll only sign US tariffs deal if it suits UK",
      "UK government sources have suggested that recent talks with the US on a trade deal have been making good progress. It is understood that any deal would focus on more than just lowering tariffs, and cover elements of trade in both goods and services.",
      "In Vance's wide-ranging interview with UnHerd, he suggested a US-UK trade deal would be easier to land than with other European countries due to \"a much more reciprocal relationship\".",
      "He mentioned Germany as an example of a country that exported heavily to the US but by comparison was \"pretty tough on a lot of American\" exports.",
      "After Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, stock markets across the globe took a tumble, with trillions of dollars wiped from the US Stock market in the days after.",
      "The president has since made some exemptions, and stock markets on Monday showed signs of recovery, although they are still down on the month.",
      "Vance said any implementation of a new system is going to make financial markets \"jittery\" and that Trump is committed to the tariff strategy as \"a long-term play\".",
      "\"What we want is to see lower trade deficits, really across the board,\" Vance said.",
      "The vice-president also expressed an affinity for Europe, after disparaging remarks between him and other top US officials were leaked from a private chat.",
      "\"I love European people. I've said repeatedly that I think that you can't separate American culture from European culture,\" Vance said.",
      "He also emphasised points that he and the White House have made repeatedly, saying that Europe needs to better fortify its own self defence.",
      "\"It's not in Europe's interest, and it's not in America's interest, for Europe to be a permanent security vassal of the United States,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance went on to address the war in Ukraine and criticism that the US might be getting too cosy with Russia President Vladimir Putin.",
      "He reiterated the administration's messaging that to end the war \"you have to try to understand\" both sides.",
      "\"That doesn't mean you morally support the Russian cause, or that you support the full-scale invasion,\" Vance said.",
      "\"But you do have to try to understand what are their strategic red lines, in the same way that you have to try to understand what the Ukrainians are trying to get out of the conflict,\" he continued.",
      "On Sunday, Russia launched its deadliest attacks on Ukraine this year, killing at least 35 people and prompting Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to invite Trump to visit his country before any deal is struck with Russia."

      "If the furnaces were starved of fuel and went out, the UK would no longer have the capability to produce so-called virgin steel, due to the process of restarting them being extremely difficult and costly.",
      "Virgin steel-making involves iron being extracted from its original source to be purified and treated to make all types of steel used in major construction projects, such as new buildings and railways.",
      "Scunthorpe's furnaces produce molten iron by splitting rocks containing iron ore in a chemical reaction that requires intense heat. Even if the temperature of the furnaces drops too low, it can lead to permanent damage.",

      "The materials have been paid for by the government, but the cost has not been revealed. The plant, which employs 2,700 people, is said to be in a \"far better position\" as a result of the government's intervention, according to union officials.",

      "Can UK afford to save British Steel \u2013 and can it afford not to?",
      "Beijing has accused the British government of \"politicising trade co-operation\", and said its move to take control of British Steel had raised doubts about investment in the UK.",
      "On Saturday, an emergency law was rushed through Parliament, giving the government control of the  site to prevent Jingye from closing the furnaces against ministers' wishes.",
      "The government has appointed two long-standing British Steel employees to run the plant on an interim basis.",
      "The situation at the site has raised questions about Chinese investment in industries the government has deemed strategically critical.",
      "The government has so far stopped short of taking British Steel back into full public ownership, but has not ruled out nationalisation, while also looking for potential private investors to fund operations.",
      "China's embassy in the UK has urged ministers to negotiate with Jingye to \"find a solution acceptable to all parties\".",
      "In March, Jingye said its Scunthorpe site was losing \u00a3700,000 a day, which it said was \"no longer financially sustainable\", and the company began a consultation on job cuts.",
      "Government talks with Jingye last week failed to produce a breakthrough. The government said the company had rejected an offer of \u00a3500m in public money to help keep the furnaces operating, and had demanded more than twice as much with few guarantees it would keep the plant open.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it \"became clear\" to the government that Jingye was intent on closing down the blast furnaces no matter the financial support offered, prompting it to secure control of the site from its owner.",

      "A strike by bin workers in Birmingham is set to continue after the latest pay offer by the city council was \"overwhelmingly\" rejected.",
      "It follows a month-long stand-off between members of the Unite union and the Labour-run authority as bin bags and fly-tipped rubbish have piled high on streets.",
      "Unite said the city council's \"partial\" offer was \"totally inadequate\" and did not address the potential pay cuts for 200 drivers.",
      "The council has previously said the offer on the table was a fair one.",
      "Unite's national lead officer Onay Kasab said 97% of those who voted rejected the council's deal, on a 60% turnout.",
      "\"They could see through what this so called proposal meant, it simply failed to deal with all of the issues and it also nailed the lie,\" he said.",
      "The union's general secretary Sharon Graham said the rejection was \"no surprise as these workers simply cannot afford to take pay cuts of this magnitude to pay the price for bad decision after bad decision\".",
      "The dispute centres around the council's decision to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) roles.",
      "The union argued that it was an important  health and safety role and about 170 affected workers faced losing up to \u00a38,000 annually due to the decision, with hundreds more losing out on the prospect of pay progression.",
      "A spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said the vote was \"incredibly disappointing\" but the authority's \"door remains open\".",
      "They claimed Unite's proposals focused on retaining a role that did not exist at other councils and could open up the council to more equal pay claims as refuse collection is a job overwhelmingly performed by men.",
      "The statement said a \"fair and reasonable offer\" was made while suggesting \"every employee affected by the removal of the WRCO role could take an equivalent graded role in the council, LGV Driver training or voluntary redundancy packages.\"",

      "He said: \"This is about huge pay cuts and hundreds of people, it's time now for us all to sit down, no more negative briefing, and let's reach a negotiated resolution and solution.\"",
      "One refuse collector told the BBC on Monday that the mood among their colleagues was \"powerful\", while another said their sentiments remained unchanged.",
      "\"As much as we want a resolution, none of us are willing to lose money,\" they added.",

      "At the end of March, the council declared a major incident, saying that some 17,000 tonnes of rubbish was lining the city's streets.",
      "Some residents have also reported an increase in rats and other vermin.",
      "Adam Yasin said his Mercedes had been \"completely written off\" just weeks ago because rats had chewed through electrical wires.",

      "The programme can pay individuals with disabilities and the businesses that employ them for the extra costs associated with being in work.  It covers a broad range of support, from paying for taxis to powered wheelchairs.",
      "Yateley Industries is a near 90-year-old charity in Hampshire that employs almost 60 people, most of whom have disabilities, in a range of packaging jobs.",
      "It says it is owed \u00a3186,000 by the Access to Work scheme.",
      "\"It's an existential threat to us,\" says chief executive, Sheldon McMullan.  \"If we don't get it, we could potentially close this magical place forever, and that would be a tragedy for the local community and for the government's agenda more broadly.\"",
      "Yateley Industries is part of a nationwide forum of dozens of supported businesses -   companies specialising in employing disabled people.",
      "Mr McMullan says many others are affected by the backlog.",
      "\"The annoying thing is that it's money that's been granted to us,\" he adds.  \"We have the paperwork saying this is what each person's been awarded, but the claim system is not set up for us to draw down the money effectively.\"",
      "Businesses say that as well as poor internal processes at the Department for Work and Pensions, there has also been a large increase in the bureaucracy associated with Access to Work in recent months, with many more forms having to be filled in and then posted \u2013 not uploaded or emailed \u2013 to the DWP.",
      "\"Until ministers realise that they've got this wrong, they're in danger of pushing so many disabled people out of the workplace,\" says Steven McGurk, president of the trade union, Community Union.",
      "\"Its very bureaucratic, very difficult to claim - it's the biggest threat to disabled people's employment.\"",
      "In Newton Abbott in Devon, a cafe that employed people with learning disabilities shut last month. Its founders say new restrictions and problems with Access to Work contributed to the closure.",
      "Sarah Thorp, who set up the No Limits cafe, said the scheme had in recent months started to refuse funding for people who wanted to get some work experience.",
      "The decision came despite the local Job Centre recommending the individuals to the cafe.  The change left the business with a shortfall of \u00a3800 a week.",
      "\"In the last 18 months, we've got 20 people into paid employment, all with disabilities,\" she says.",
      "\"When the issues around work experience changed in the last few months, we had to turn people down because we could not fund the support. It just seems really counter-intuitive when all the rhetoric is around getting disabled adults into work.\"",
      "When the government unveiled cuts and restrictions to disability benefits last month, the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, name-checked the Access to Work scheme as a programme that could help those who will lose out to get a job.",
      "As well as businesses being able to claim, disabled people themselves can apply for help under the scheme.",
      "They are also suffering delays and backlogs; in October, there were 55,000 outstanding applications, according to the DWP.",
      "Some claimants are waiting more than six months to be assessed, with people writing on social media that the delays have resulted in them losing job offers.",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions says it prioritises those who are newly offered a job.",
      "Lucy Earle, 31, is a social media executive for a museum.",
      "She has various disabilities and conditions, including agonising pain in her feet that means she needs to use a wheelchair.",
      "It took six months for her claim to be looked at by Access to Work, and then she was assigned a wheelchair that wasn't suitable and left her upper body in pain.",
      "\"The last few weeks, I haven't been into work because I can't manage the pain of either using the wheelchair that isn't built for me, or being on my feet and not going very far.\"",
      "She credits the Access to Work scheme with helping her stay in employment, but feels they are refusing reasonable requests.",
      "\"They're saying that the benefits are being cut so we can push more people into work, but then also Access to Work is having all these problems.\"",
      "Steve Darling MP, the Lib Dem Work and Pensions spokesperson, says that while the principles behind Access to Work are excellent, \"individuals and businesses are often covering significant sums from their own savings while waiting for payments from Access to Work, which risks pushing people into debt, or businesses even closing down. This is unacceptable.\"",
      "Minister for Social Security and Disability, Sir Stephen Timms, said in February that Access to Work, established in 1994, \"was not in a good shape at the moment.\"",
      "Spending on the programme increased by 41% in 2023/24 to \u00a3257.8m.",
      "\"What we will need to do\u2026is make some fairly significant reforms to Access to Work, look at whether employers can do more. There is quite a big issue here and the current style of Access to Work is unlikely to be sustainable in the long term,\" he said.",
      "\"We have to come up with something better and more effective, given the current very high level of demand.\"",
      "In a statement, the Department for Work and Pensions said: \"Last month we introduced a new streamlined claims process to ensure outstanding payments are made swiftly to businesses.",

      "Mordaunt told the watchdog the role would also involve testing the company's strategy \"to reduce its combustible products i.e. cigarettes\".",
      "British American Tobacco has produced some of the world's most famous cigarette brands including Lucky Strike and Rothmans, but in recent years has begun selling vapes.",

      "The committee considers whether the job could be seen as a reward from a prospective employer for favourable decisions made by the politician when they were in power.",
      "It also looks at whether the former minister could have access to insider information.",
      "If the committee has concerns, it can advise the politician to delay taking up the job or avoid particular activities while in the role.",
      "In its advice letter to Mordaunt, Acoba said the risk that her role with British American Tobacco could be seen as \"a reward for your decisions in office\" was \"limited\".",
      "It added that Mordaunt had not had access to specific information that would \"offer an unfair advantage to British American Tobacco\".",
      "\"It is also relevant that you have been out of office for five months, creating a gap between your access to information in government and your role with British American Tobacco,\" it added.",
      "Acoba noted that Mordaunt had said she would not lobby for the firm, but it advised her to have \"no direct engagement with government on behalf of the company as to do so would raise significant risks under the government's rules\".",
      "During his last months as prime minister, former Tory PM Rishi Sunak introduced the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which would have made it illegal to sell tobacco to anyone born after 1 January 2009.",
      "Although Sunak was keen to push the legislation through, many of his Conservative MPs had doubts. Mordaunt herself did not vote on the bill when it came to Parliament.",
      "Labour backed the proposals, and since coming into government has reintroduced a similar bill to Parliament.",
      "Mordaunt is not the first politician to work for British American Tobacco. After losing the 1997 Tory leadership election, former chancellor Ken Clarke took up a deputy chairmanship with the company.",
      "During her time in government, Mordaunt served as a minister in several departments, including the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence.",
      "She stood in the 2022 Conservative Party leadership race, but was eliminated in the penultimate round of the contest that was ultimately won by Liz Truss.",
      "Had she not lost her seat in Portsmouth North in 2024, she would have been a potential contender to lead her party in opposition.",
      "In addition to taking a role with British American Tobacco, Mordaunt is planning to produce and appear in a series of short films about Ukraine, entitled \"Do Not Look Away\".",
      "She is also taking a paid role with Sub Sea Craft Limited, a Portsmouth-based engineering company that produces maritime technology.",

      "\"Who was going to blink first?\"",
      "A source involved in the fraught negotiations since the election over the future of British Steel told me that as time passed, and literally, coal to keep the furnaces burning started to run out, that was the question - was the government going to offer even more to the Chinese owners of British Steel, Jingye, or act itself?",
      "On Saturday, the government is changing the law to answer that question.",
      "Unless something truly weird happens, Parliament will vote to give Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, the power to tell British Steel what to do \u2013 in practice, buying coal to keep the fires burning, to keep the once mighty steel industry alive.",

      "Follow latest updates as Parliament recalled over British Steel",
      "Even on Thursday he was offering taxpayers' cash to buy the raw materials to keep the furnaces alive as a sweetener for Jingye.",
      "At one point in the talks, sources suggest they were asking for a billion-pound taxpayer bailout to keep the plant alive. But I'm told that price wouldn't have been accompanied by any guarantee that jobs would be saved, or the plant protected for good.",
      "Taking control on Saturday does not do that. The Chinese owners will remain the shareholders, for now. But Labour's decision literally and metaphorically keeps the flames alive \u2013 the government hopes. And it commits taxpayers to start coughing up to save the steel industry \u2013 for how long, is a more complicated question.",
      "So what then? Theoretically, Jingye could \"get their act together and take the company back\", one insider suggests.",
      "Talking to interested parties on Friday night, that seemed vanishingly unlikely.",
      "The UK government has spent the last couple of weeks trying to tempt them to stay on board with huge inducements. That failed, so the chances of getting back involved seem pretty slim.",
      "Why is British Steel in trouble and who owns it?",
      "Why is British Steel in trouble and who owns it?",
      "There is the possibility that another company wants to swoop in and rescue the business.",
      "Again, don't hold your breath \u2013 the company has been losing money hand over fist, the blast furnaces are nearing the end of their useful life, and the cost of energy it gulps is enormous.",
      "So in the current state, taking on the business as an offer? It's not that pretty. Remember Jingye were the only bidder last time round \u2013 when a Conservative source says, \"there were no other bidders \u2013 the alternative was closure or nationalisation, and the Conservatives were never going to nationalise\". So will Labour?",
      "As of this weekend, that seems pretty likely. Remember the action in Parliament later does not mean nationalisation. But it's a necessary first step if that is what's going to happen.",
      "You've probably heard ministers again and again say \"all options are on the table\"  - that's their get out of jail card where they don't commit to anything in case their preferred option suddenly disappears. But as MPs gather to vote on the next steps, a journey towards nationalisation certainly feels like the direction.",
      "Two different sources who have been part of the wider discussions tell me the prime minister has come to believe that taking British Steel back into public hands is what the government will have to do. There are practical and political reasons for why that might come to pass.",
      "First, for the government to have a hope of achieving its aims - building infrastructure, spending more on defence at home, growing the economy and protecting jobs - it is logical to preserve a steel industry in this country.",
      "That's not just because ministers are loathe to see good jobs disappear. But because in government, the capacity to make steel is an important part of what the UK needs to be able to do. If the plant closes, the UK would become the only G7 country without primary steel making capability.",
      "That wasn't something the government was willing to tolerate. So if the private sector won't do it \u2013 enter the state. Although, it wouldn't be unfair to wonder why they have ended up making this decision at the last minute when the fuel for the furnaces is about to run out, given it was three weeks ago that the company sounded the alarm about possible closures.",
      "Second, that requirement to act has become politically attractive because it fits into Sir Keir Starmer's more and more familiar script, that the new world order has changed \u2013 governments need to be more active and agile in protecting their own interests.",
      "It follows, if, as Treasury Minister Darren Jones, told us last week, globalisation is over, then the UK has to be able to make the materials and products like steel that it really needs itself.",
      "One source remarks: \"Dragging the Tories to Parliament over the weekend to back the Labour government's plans to save British steel: I can finally see why people said government was worth it\".",
      "It is politics after all.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has blamed the government's \"incompetence\" for the last-minute recall, while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it was an opportunity to come up with \"a serious plan\" for domestic steel production.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the government's plan was just a \"short-term sticking plaster\" and both he and the Green Party have called for public ownership as the only option.",
      "It is worth remembering the problems in the steel industry didn't start with Donald Trump, or this government, or even Jingye. Steel was nationalised in 1967, then sold back into the private sector in 1988.",
      "Frantic negotiations with government about jobs, bailouts, survival are familiar. But there is gathering momentum around nationalisation as the solution, in a way unthinkable not so long ago.",
      "Hypothetical conversations started at the top of government a couple of months ago about the possibility, detailed work only in the last week or so. But there is a growing consensus - one source familiar with the situation even says, \"nationalisation is inevitable and has been for some time\".",
      "But \u2013 \"the hurdles are huge\" \u2013 a source tells me. The most obvious obstacle? Cold hard cash, way beyond the initial price tag for raw materials to keep Scunthorpe going for a few more weeks.",
      "In the long term, the blast furnaces are near the end of their life, the plant needs investment, massive investment, to make it safe and to have a proper future. One industry source told me modern electric furnaces could have a price tag as as much as \u00a33bn each, and Scunthorpe might need two.",
      "Energy costs for new or existing furnaces are enormous. In Number 10 and Number 11 there is an acknowledgement that the costs of energy for industry can be crippling. That could be another area where government is keen to act.",
      "The government hasn't yet shared, or hasn't yet worked out, what the potential cost of taking on the plant in the long term might be. A Treasury source says it will have to be within the current plans for spending. And you don't need me to remind you again how tight Number 11 says money is, how tightly Chancellor Rachel Reeves wants to stick to her spending rules.",
      "And yet \u2013 if a big ticket effective nationalisation is the political choice, and it runs to many billions? Let's see.",
      "MPs voting later won't determine the entire future for British Steel. But it puts the government on a path to make real some of its rhetoric in recent weeks, as one figure put it \u2013 \"neoliberalism is over. Ownership matters again -  Labour needs to define Britain's place in this new,  new world order\".",
      "But passing a law in a rush is one thing. Political excitement another. Sir Keir used to attract ire from the left of his own party for walking away from some of his previous beliefs in common ownership, nationalising vital industries. Embarking on an expensive and complicated adventure to preserve a struggling multi-billion pound industry was not meant to be part of the plan.",

    "summary": "An emergency law has handed control of the UK's only remaining plant making virgin steel to the government.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, to prevent it from closing.",
      "A race is now on to try and secure raw materials to stop the plant's blast furnaces from shutting down.",
      "What is British Steel and why is it important?",
      "British Steel's Scunthorpe plant employs 2,700 people, about three-quarters of the company's workforce.",
      "It is the last plant in the UK producing virgin steel, which is used in major construction projects like buildings and railways. It has fewer imperfections than the recycled steel made elsewhere in the country.",
      "Were the plant to stop producing virgin steel, the UK would be the only member of the G7 group of leading economies without the ability to make it. The government views that as a risk to the UK's economic security.",

      "Live: China warns UK against 'politicising' British Steel",
      "UK takes control of British Steel under emergency powers",
      "Why is British Steel Chinese-owned?",
      "In 2016, Tata Steel sold the loss-making part of its business that made \"long products\" like transport rails and steel sections for construction.",
      "Private investment firm Greybull Capital bought it for \u00a31 and renamed the business British Steel.",
      "However, following financial collapse in 2019, British Steel was taken over by the government's insolvency service.",
      "It was sold to Chinese steel-making firm Jingye the following year.",
      "Can British Steel's blast furnaces keep running?",
      "Scunthorpe's skyline has four blast furnaces, all named after English Queens - Bess, Mary, Anne and Victoria. Bess and Anne are the only two still working.",
      "The supplies needed to keep them running - coking coal and iron pellets - are running low.",
      "However, the government says the materials are \"in the country\". Officials are \"working as fast as they possibly can\" to get them to the plant.",
      "On Saturday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it had become clear that Jingye intended to \"refuse\" to buy enough material to keep the furnaces running, and \"to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders\".",
      "\"The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel,\" he added.",
      "Why can't a blast furnace easily be restarted?",
      "Turning off a blast furnace without making it permanently unusable is notoriously difficult.",
      "The furnaces operate at extreme temperatures, with iron ore and coking coal poured in at the top and liquid iron extracted at the bottom. This iron goes to the steel plant to make steel.",
      "If a furnace stops working, the molten metal will cool and solidify. This is called a \"salamander\".",
      "When the furnace is turned back on this metal heats up again and expands which can crack the furnace.",
      "A so-called \"Salamander Tap\" process can be used to temporarily shut down a blast furnace by drilling a hole to remove any remaining hot metal. However, this can be a dangerous process.",
      "Has British Steel been nationalised?",
      "The emergency legislation fast-tracked through Parliament on Saturday gives the government the ability to order raw materials for the furnaces and to direct the company's workforce and managers.",
      "Any employees sacked by the Chinese owners can be reinstated and the plant can be entered by force, if necessary, to secure assets.",
      "But Jingye will retain ownership of it for now.",
      "This means British Steel has not been nationalised - which is when a government takes ownership and control of a company.",
      "However, the business secretary acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\" as there are currently no companies willing to buy the plant.",
      "If British Steel is nationalised, taxpayers' money will be used to run it. Reynolds says it is currently making an annual net loss of \u00a3233m, but had the furnaces been allowed to shut the cost to the taxpayer would be higher.",
      "Why is the Scunthorpe plant losing money?",
      "In late March 2025, Jingye said the plant was losing around \u00a3700,000 a day and launched a consultation on its closure.",
      "It said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable,\" blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with moving to lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government UK government briefing, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",
      "After the government took control of the plant, China's embassy in the UK said it was \"closely following\" developments.",
      "It said: \"It is an objective fact that British steel companies have generally encountered difficulties in recent years.\"",
      "Who else produces steel in the UK?",
      "There are 1,160 businesses in the UK steel industry, directly supporting 40,000 other firms, according to government figures.",
      "Tata Steel at Port Talbot in Wales was once the UK's largest virgin steel producer but it turned off its blast furnace in September 2024, saying it was losing \u00a31.7m a day.",
      "An agreement with the UK government was reached which saw it commit \u00a3500m to help the company move to greener forms of steelmaking.",
      "Other steelmakers in the UK include Liberty Steel, Celsa, Marcegaglia and Outokumpu.",
      "Liberty Steel also has a plant in Scunthorpe which is facing closure. More than 120 jobs are at risk, with bosses blaming high energy costs.",
      "In 2023 the UK steel industry contributed \u00a32.3 billion to the UK economy -  equivalent to 0.1% of total UK economic output and 1.0% of manufacturing output.",
      "In the same year, the UK produced 5.6 million tonnes of crude steel, or 0.3% of the world's total. In comparison, China produced more than 1,000 million tonnes, 54% of global production.",
      "The EU produced 126 million tonnes of steel in 2023, 7% of the world's total. Compared with EU countries, the UK ranked as the eighth largest steel producer, after Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Austria, Poland and Belgium.",

      "The UK appeared to have come off lightly compared to other economies.",
      "But, British exporters still face an extra charge on goods sold into the US and there are many other ways the UK will be affected, from growth to inflation.",
      "The exact impact remains very uncertain. But some of the emerging fallout may have an upside - and here's why.",
      "Business",
      "Those most directly exposed in the UK to this trade war are British businesses - from carmakers to food producers - selling goods into the US.",
      "As American importers buying their products pay 10% more, they face a dilemma of whether to squeeze profits, share the pain across the supply chain or hope customers will be prepared to pay higher prices.",
      "They already risk a dent to their sales from tariffs, threatening jobs and investment plans. Other companies too could be squeezed by more competition, if cheap imports from other nations are diverted to the UK - China makes a third of global goods.",

      "Two-thirds of British exports to the US are services - the likes of banking, insurance  and advertising - which aren't subject to tariffs. The UK's success in this area makes it a particular area of strength in its trade portfolio.",
      "But that strength can also be a weakness.",
      "Some services exports are linked to goods; think after-sales services or marketing. The demand for those could be affected by tariffs in the US.",
      "Sales of services exports could more broadly be impacted elsewhere if demand from other countries suffers.",
      "Some in the advertising industry are already fretting because spending on their services are often the first to suffer when there are budget cutbacks.",
      "And that trade success could be a vulnerability.",
      "The Bank of England notes that the size of the UK's export sector compared to the economy, and its financial sector, means it may be susceptible to risks to financial stability from weaker global growth.",
      "It's for all these reasons that Chancellor Rachel Reeves is warning that growth in the UK will be hit, even if we're now on a level playing field with other countries in terms of the 10% tariff.",

      "And the wild swings in stock markets around the world, egged on by the heightened risk of global recession, have not been good news for investors in the UK.",
      "When share prices drop, they reduce the value of products such as ISAs and pension funds.",
      "But as seasoned analysts caution, those sorts of funds are long-term ones. Swings in the value of investments tend to get smoothed out over time - and most people aren't drawing from such funds day-to-day. On the whole, households here are less exposed to the stock market directly than those in America are.",
      "Interest rates",
      "There may be a silver lining to the market volatility.",
      "Prices of oil and commodities such as copper and sugar have been falling.",
      "That may bode well for lower inflation, as might the diversion of cheap goods from countries struggling to sell in the US.",
      "Against a backdrop of weaker growth, investors are speculating that the Bank of England may cut interest rates four more times this year, touting potential relief for millions of households.",
      "The Bank of England itself has noted that, in any case, British households are well placed to weather the storm - our debt relative to our incomes is at its lowest level since 2001.",
      "Moreover, the banking system, the Bank judges, is well placed to absorb shocks. Lessons from the 2008 financial crisis have been learnt.",

      "Pop star Katy Perry and five other women safely returned to Earth after reaching space aboard Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin rocket.",
      "The singer was joined by Bezos's fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez and CBS presenter Gayle King, who said a highlight of the flight was hearing Perry sing Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\".",
      "After landing back on Earth, Perry said she felt \"super connected to life\" and \"so connected to love\".",
      "The flight lasted around 11 minutes and took the six women more than 100km (62 miles) above Earth, crossing the internationally recognised boundary of space and giving them a few moments of weightlessness.",
      "Also on board were former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.",
      "The New Shepard rocket lifted off from its West Texas launch site just after 08:30 local time (14:30 BST).",
      "The capsule returned to Earth with a parachute-assisted soft landing, while the rocket booster also landed back in Texas.",
      "Cheering could be heard from inside the capsule as the recovery crew went to collect them.",
      "Jeff Bezos opened the capsule door to welcome back Lauren S\u00e1nchez, the first to disembark.",
      "\"I'm so proud of this crew,\" she said tearfully. \"I can't put it into words.\"",
      "She paused, before adding: \"I looked out of the window and we got to see the moon.\"",
      "\"Earth looked so quiet,\" she said, adding that it was not what she expected. \"It was quiet, but really alive.\"",
      "Next out was Katy Perry, who kissed the ground and lifted a daisy to the sky - her daughter is called Daisy.",
      "Gayle King also got on her knees and kissed the ground.",
      "\"I just want to have a moment with the ground, just appreciate the ground for just a second,\" she said.",
      "The last to get out, Kerianne Flynn, pointed at the sky and shouted: \"I went to space.\"",
      "A celebrity cast had watched the launch from the ground.",
      "Speaking from the viewing platform, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian said: \"I didn't realise how emotional it would be, it's hard to explain. I have all this adrenaline and I'm just standing here.\"",
      "\"Whatever you dream of is in our reach, especially in today's day and age. Dream big, wish for the stars\u2014and one day, you could maybe be amongst them,\"\u200b she added.",
      "Oprah Winfrey spoke about her friend Gayle King, and revealed she was a nervous flier.",
      "\"I mean, for her\u2014whew\u2014anytime we're on a flight, she's in somebody's lap at the slightest bit of turbulence. She has real, real-world anxiety when it comes to flying. And this... this is her overcoming a wall of fear,\" she said.",
      "The spacecraft was fully autonomous, requiring no pilots, and the crew did not manually operate the vehicle.",
      "The last all-female spaceflight was over 60 years ago when Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to travel into space on a solo mission aboard the spacecraft Vostok 6.",
      "Since then, there have been no other all-female spaceflights but women have made numerous significant contributions.",
      "The space tourism  industry is still in its infancy, so every successful launch is significant and demonstrates that these short, commercial flights can be carried out safely.",
      "But some critics stress it is tourism, not space science, and professional astronauts undertake missions, including scientific research, for the benefit of humankind.",
      "\"A celebrity isn't an envoy of humankind - they go into space for their own reasons,\" Dr Kai-Uwe Schrogl, special advisor for political affairs at the European Space Agency, told BBC News.",
      "\"These flights are significant and exciting, but I think maybe they can also be a source of frustration for space scientists,\" he added. \"We see space flight as being for science, knowledge and the interests of humanity.",
      "\"Celebrities do it for amusement but get a lot more attention than the regular astronauts.\"",
      "The space flight also generated a range of response on social media, from enthusiasm to hostility.",
      "Dr Tanya Harrison, from the Outer Space Institute experts network said: \"A lot of the comments that I saw on social media were things about, 'Oh, it's like the Real Housewives go to Mars' or 'It's the oligarchy in space, read the room, the timing is terrible.'\"",
      "But: \"There were a lot of positive takes as well. People were like, 'Oh, this is so cool. Katy Perry is going to space.'\"",
      "Dr Harrison, who had previously worked on Nasa missions to Mars said: \"The cynical part of me wants to call it a marketing stunt. This is a company promoting the fact they can launch tourists into space.\"",
      "However she noted the all-women team might \"change the demographics a little bit of who might want to do something like this.\"",
      "\"Socially, they might have had some impact\", she said.",
      "In a news conference after the flight, two of the women took issue with some of the criticism the mission had received, related for example to its cost.",
      "\"I feel that anybody who is criticising doesn't really understand what's happening here,\" said Gayle King.",
      "She said that the astronauts had had a huge, positive response from young women and young girls.",
      "Lauren S\u00e1nchez said she had got \"fired up\" about the criticism and would love to have the naysayers come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees who \"put their heart and soul into\" the missions.",
      "Blue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 by Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur who also started Amazon.",
      "Although Blue Origin has not released full ticket prices, a $150,000 (\u00a3114,575.85) deposit is required to reserve a seat\u2014underlining the exclusivity of these early flights.",
      "Alongside its suborbital tourism business, the company is also developing long-term space infrastructure, including reusable rockets and lunar landing systems.",
      "The New Shepard rocket is designed to be fully reusable and its booster returns to the launch pad for vertical landings after each flight, reducing overall costs.",
      "According to US law, astronauts must complete comprehensive training for their specific roles.",
      "Blue Origin says its New Shepard passengers are trained over two days with a focus on physical fitness, emergency protocols, details about the safety measures and procedures for zero gravity.",
      "Additionally, there are two support members referred to as Crew Member Seven: one provides continuous guidance to astronauts, while the other maintains communication from the control room during the mission.",
      "The rise of space tourism has prompted criticism that it is too exclusive and environmentally damaging.",
      "Supporters argue that private companies are accelerating innovation and making space more accessible.",
      "Professor Brian Cox told the BBC in 2024: \"Our civilisation needs to expand beyond our planet for so many reasons,\" and believes that collaboration between NASA and commercial firms is a positive step.",
      "Rocket engine exhaust contains gases and particles that can affect Earth's climate and ozone layer.",
      "On its web page under the title \"Protecting our Planet\" Blue Origin claims: \"During flight, the only byproduct of New Shepard's engine combustion is water vapor with no carbon emissions.\"",
      "However, Eloise Marais, a professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Air Quality\u00a0at University College London points out that water vapour too is a greenhouse gas and is a chemical that is not supposed to be in the upper layers of the atmosphere.",
      "\"It alters the chemistry of the stratosphere, depleting the ozone layer, and also forms clouds that affect climate,\" she says.",

    "story": [
      "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.",
      "The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.",
      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",
      "Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\".",
      "Shipping agrees net-zero goal but critics unmoved",
      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water molecules to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",
      "Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.",
      "\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.",
      "It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.",
      "But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.",
      "Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.",

      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.",
      "\"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said.",
      "Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.",
      "It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken.",
      "Although the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "But industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations.",

    "summary": "A unique study is tracking the development of hundreds of babies whose parents have also been studied since birth.",
    "story": [
      "Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal.",
      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",
      "Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.",
      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",
      "In another room, Jaxon, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.",
      "A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jaxon can keep all the stickers he finds.",
      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",
      "\"These are what I call 'building blocks' of really important skills.\"",
      "The study will also assess language development and processing speed - a measure of how quickly children pick up new information.",
      "The Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health.",
      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",
      "In this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.",

      "Emma Marsh, RSPB's executive director, told Radio 4's Today programme that it is a \"real shame\" because the starling is \"one of our most charismatic birds\".",
      "She said small actions in people's gardens can benefit starlings and other wildlife.",
      "These include avoiding pesticides, which reduce the number of insects around that starlings eat; having a mix of short and long grass to help starlings watch out for predators; keeping lawns natural with dandelions and clovers so there would be more invertebrates; and putting up nest boxes.",
      "Ms Speight added: \"While our homes and gardens often provide the perfect place for individual people to help, we also urgently need governments and businesses to join us in the wider fight to restore our natural world.\"",

    "summary": "Countries break ten-year deadlock to agree measures to reduce commercial shipping emissions.",
    "story": [
      "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.",
      "The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.",
      "The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.",
      "Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\".",
      "Shipping agrees net-zero goal but critics unmoved",
      "Clean energy's share of world's electricity reaches 40%, report says",
      "Shipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.",
      "But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.",
      "The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.",
      "It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.",
      "Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.",
      "The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.",
      "Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.",
      "There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.",
      "The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.",
      "\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.",
      "\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.",
      "In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water molecules to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.",
      "Figures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.",
      "\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.",
      "Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.",
      "\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.",
      "Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.",
      "\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.",
      "It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.",
      "But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.",
      "Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.",

      "Listen: How to clean up the shipping industry",
      "Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.",
      "\"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said.",
      "Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.",
      "It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken.",
      "Although the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "But industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations.",
      "The US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised.",

      "The US competition watchdog alleges Meta unfairly dominated the market through its acquisitions of photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 and the messaging service WhatsApp in 2014.",
      "The FTC is seeking to break up Meta by forcing a spinoff of Instagram or WhatsApp. Meta says there's plenty of competition in social media, including from apps such as TikTok, X, and YouTube.",
      "Wearing a dark suit and light blue tie, Mr Zuckerberg was the first witness in the case on Monday at a federal court in Washington DC. The trial is expected to last for two months.",
      "The FTC pointed to a 2011 email Mr Zuckerberg sent saying: \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly.\"",
      "The following year, he sent another email saying the company was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are... I worry that it will take us too long to catch up\".",
      "On the stand, Mr Zuckerberg defended his statements, calling the emails \"relatively early\" conversations about buying the app. He added that Meta had improved Instagram over the years.",
      "Mr Zuckerberg also said he wanted to buy Instagram because of its camera technology, not because of its social network. He is expected to continue his testimony on Tuesday.",
      "The FTC says the company overpaid when it acquired Instagram for $1bn and WhatsApp for $19bn as a defensive move.",
      "\"They decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them,\" said FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson in his opening statement at Monday's trial.",
      "Meta countered that the lawsuit from the FTC, which originally reviewed and approved both those acquisitions, was \"misguided\".",
      "Meta \"acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to improve and grow them alongside Facebook\", the company's attorney Mark Hansen argued.",
      "The FTC lawyer cited a 2012 memo from Mr Zuckerberg in which he discusses the importance of \"neutralising\" Instagram.",
      "Mr Matheson called that message \"a smoking gun\".",
      "Meta, on the other hand, said the purchases made the consumer experience better.",
      "\"Acquisitions to improve and grow\" have never been found unlawful, Meta's lead litigator, said on Monday, \"and they should not be found unlawful here\".",
      "Meta said last year that it had 3.27 billion daily active users across its products.",
      "Instagram was expected to account for more than half of Meta's advertising revenue in the US in 2025. according to research firm Emarketer.",
      "Meta has been making regular overtures to Trump since his election.",
      "The company contributed $1m to Trump's inaugural fund, and has added former Trump adviser Dina Powell McCormick and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) boss Dana White, a Trump ally, to Meta's board of directors this year.",
      "The company also announced in January that it was rolling back content moderation policies that Republicans said had amounted to censorship.",
      "It also agreed to pay Trump $25m to settle a lawsuit over the suspension of his accounts after the US Capitol riot in 2021.",
      "Mr Zuckerberg has also visited the White House in recent weeks.",
      "The Meta boss has lobbied Trump in person to have the FTC drop the case, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "When asked by the BBC to confirm that report, Meta sidestepped the question but said in a statement: \"The FTC's lawsuits against Meta defies reality.\"",
      "FTC v Meta begins as another major antitrust case - USA v Google - grinds on.",
      "The Department of Justice won the first phase of that case last summer when Judge Amit Mehta found that Google holds a monopoly in online search, with a market share of around 90%.",
      "Last month, government attorneys reiterated a demand made during the Biden administration that a court break up Google's search monopoly.",
      "The FTC's case against Meta will be tougher to prove, says Laura Phillips-Sawyer, an associate professor of business law at the University of Georgia.",
      "\"I think they have a real uphill battle,\" Ms Phillips-Sawyer said of the FTC.",
      "\"They have a long road before any consideration of divestiture of Instagram or WhatsApp is considered.\"",
      "That's because compared to online search, there's more competition in the personal network services space that Meta operates in, Ms Phillips-Sawyer said.",
      "Amazon and Apple also face antitrust lawsuits by US enforcers."

      "Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.",
      "The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
      "And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.",
      "Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.",
      "\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.",
      "Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.",
      "And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.",

      "The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet.",
      "How exposed is Apple to tariffs?",

      "But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.",
      "\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"",

      "A pro-suicide forum is under investigation by the UK's online regulator - its first using new powers under the Online Safety Act.",
      "The forum, which Ofcom has not named, is understood to be a site BBC News has been investigating for the last three years, linking it to at least 50 deaths in the UK.",
      "The site has tens of thousands of members, including children, and users discuss methods of suicide, sharing instructions about how to buy and use a potentially deadly toxic chemical.",
      "Last month, Ofcom gained powers to take action against sites hosting illegal material.",
      "This first investigation could lead to fines or court orders against those running the forum.",
      "Families whose loved ones took their own lives after contact with the site have welcomed the move but called on Ofcom to move as quickly as possible.",
      "Vlad Nikolin-Caisley, from Southampton, died in May last year, aged 17.",
      "His parents have evidence that he was coached and encouraged to take his own life by members on the site, which we aren't naming.",
      "He bought a poisonous chemical and followed instructions on how to end his life.",
      "His parents, Anna and Graham, called on Ofcom to ban the site to save lives.",
      "\"At what point do we say enough is enough, because those young people did not deserve to die,\" says Anna. \"The sooner they take action, the sooner we stop deaths linked to this forum,\" agrees Graham.",
      "New powers for authorities",
      "The Online Safety Act became law in October 2023 and Ofcom has spent the last 18 months drawing up guidelines and codes of practice for platforms to follow.",
      "On 17 March, Ofcom got powers to take action against sites hosting illegal content, which includes assisting suicide.",
      "All websites will now have to show they have systems in place to remove illegal material.",
      "If they fail to do so, the regulator can get court orders to block platforms or impose fines of up to \u00a318m.",
      "An investigation is the first step before any enforcement action can take place.",
      "But Ofcom faces a number of hurdles, including the fact that those running this forum are anonymous and that it is hosted in the US.",
      "BBC News has revealed how more than 50 UK suicides have been connected to the forum.",
      "In October 2023, the BBC confronted an American man, Lamarcus Small, who is believed to have set the site up in 2018. And in March last year, we also tracked down a poison seller in Ukraine who had been linked to the site.",
      "The BBC also joined the forum using a false identity, compiling a list of the dead and exposing a partner section where members could find someone to die with.",
      "Catherine Adenekan and daughter-in-law Melanie Saville have been campaigning to have the site shut down since Catherine's son, Joe, took his own life in April 2020.",
      "He was a member of the forum for less than a week, but the 23-year-old learned how to buy and use a toxic chemical.",
      "He left a note for his mother which read: \"Please do your best in closing that website for anyone else.\"",
      "Together they infiltrated the site, documented the numbers of deaths associated with it and identified people selling the chemical.",
      "They have been lobbying ministers, their local MP and talking to the media in an effort to get the forum closed down. They say it has been an exhausting five years.",
      "Inaction is costing lives",
      "Melanie says: \"Every day there are new people signing up to the website. There are people dying, ordering poisons online.\"",
      "Asked about Ofcom's investigation, she says: \"They've known long enough about this site and what's going on. They don't need to go through lengthy processes to be able to take it down. They need to take the action now.\"",
      "BBC News has also revealed that at least six coroners have written to government departments since 2019 demanding action to shut the forum down.",
      "We learned a number of police forces and the National Crime Agency are also aware of the forum, and have investigated deaths linked to it.",
      "Vlad's parents Anna and Graham say inaction by the authorities cost their son's life.",

    "story": [
      "Yellow diggers are shoring up mounds of earth, as construction workers prepare to lay the foundations for what's set to become the largest start-up campus in Europe.",
      "The project is an expansion of Maria 01, a co-working and event space for entrepreneurs and investors, as well as larger corporations that want to collaborate with tech start-ups.",
      "Its existing facilities across the street already house around 240 start-ups. They are spread across six buildings that used to make up the city's first hospital, founded in the 19th Century and notorious in Helsinki for treating patients with the plague.",
      "Now, the current 20,000 sq m site is a hub for companies developing innovative health technologies, alongside AI, cybersecurity, gaming and defence tech start-ups.",
      "\"The whole place is really based on community,\" says Maria 01's CEO Sarita Runeberg. \"We bring people together so they can network\u2026 and find different kinds of resources to grow their businesses.\"",
      "There are also office perks including a pool table, table football, running and ice bathing clubs, and in true Finnish-style, a sauna.",
      "\"We wouldn't be a proper start-up hub if we didn't have our own sauna here!\" laughs Ms Runeberg.",
      "While co-working spaces for tech companies are well established across the Nordics, Maria 01 is the largest of its kind in the region.",
      "It is run as a not-for-profit organisation partly funded by the city of Helsinki, which has invested more than \u20ac6m ($6.7m; \u00a35.2m) in the hub since its launch in 2016.",
      "Ms Runeberg believes it will become the biggest start-up campus in Europe following the completion of three new buildings by 2028, adding a 50,000 sqm floor area.",
      "Later this year it is launching an accelerator programme designed to support and guide high-growth start-ups.",
      "The hub's current and former members have already collectively raised over \u20ac1bn in funding.",
      "This represents around 40% of all early stage funding raised annually by Finnish start-ups.",
      "Ruben Byron is the Belgian co-founder of a start-up offering cloud services to AI developers.",
      "He has already scaled his business from a handful of staff using the hub's hot desks to a team of around 40 working from private offices in the former hospital, as well as remotely.",
      "\"That has been a great experience, that we've kind of been able [to] be nurtured here in a way,\" he says.",
      "Although not as mature \u2013 or well known globally \u2013 as other European start-up hubs like Sweden and the UK, Finland has been steadily making a name for itself in the tech scene over the last two decades.",
      "The small Nordic nation, which has a population of around 5.6 million, has spawned 12 unicorn businesses \u2013 firms worth a billion dollars or more \u2013 including sleep and fitness tracking ring Oura, game developers Supercell, Rovio (the creators of the Angry Birds game), and food delivery platform Wolt.",
      "Last year, Startup Blink, a global index mapping more than 100 countries ranked Finland's start-up ecosystem the 7th best in western Europe, and 14th in the world.",
      "The index cites factors including hubs like Maria 01, alongside high levels of state and university support, and Slush - a huge annual non-profit gathering for global start-ups and investors.",
      "It also highlights Finland's transparent and open business culture.",
      "\"There is an authenticity with the Finns,\" says Jack Parker, a Helsinki-based founder originally from Newcastle upon Tyne, who runs a healthcare innovation start-up.",
      "\"Ego doesn't really play a part. So if I reach out to somebody, it's quite likely eight out of 10 times that they will respond.\"",
      "Finland's right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2023, is on a mission to push the country even further up global indices, stating in its official government programme that it wants the Nordic nation to become a leader in fostering a dynamic start-up and growth company ecosystem.",
      "\"It's not just about rankings,\" says Marjo Ilmari, who runs the start-up services team at Business Finland, the government agency that promotes investment and innovation.",
      "In 2024 Business Finland alone invested \u20ac112m in start-ups, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year.",
      "\"The real goal is to create an environment where our ground-breaking start-ups can emerge and really tackle global challenges.\"",
      "The agency hopes this will help drive growth in the Finnish economy, which went into recession in 2023 and is currently making a sluggish recovery, with the Bank of Finland forecasting an increase of less than 1% this year.",
      "The country is also trying to attract more global talent by offering start-up permits for international founders who want to grow their businesses in Finland.",
      "These entrepreneurs are eligible for a so-called soft-landing support package provided by Business Finland.",
      "\"They give you advice, support, sometimes grants to support the initiation phase,\" explains Lalin Keyvan, a Turkish-born entrepreneur at Maria 01 who says the scheme was one of the main reasons why she relocated to Helsinki.",
      "Business Finland's marketing campaigns for would-be movers highlight social and lifestyle factors too: Finns tend to prioritise wellbeing, plus there's free education and subsidised healthcare and childcare.",
      "\"You don't really have to choose between building a high-growth company and enjoying life, because you can do both,\" says Ms Ilmari.",
      "But whether all this is enough for Finland to compete with Europe's more established start-up hubs is up for debate.",
      "Data suggests it still has a long way to go to catch up with neighbouring Sweden, long the Nordic darling of the European start-up scene.",
      "It is home to more than 40 unicorn businesses including Spotify, payments platform Klarna and game developer King.",
      "In Startup Blink's ecosystem ranking Sweden ranks second in Europe after the UK, and top in the EU.",
      "In the last decade it has attracted more than $29bn in funding compared to just over $8bn in Finland, according to the annual State of European Tech report by investment company Atomico.",
      "\"I love Finland's bold approach,\" says Charlotte Ekelund, CEO of Sting, a non-profit organisation that helps develop start-ups in Stockholm. However she believes Finland is still years behind Sweden in terms of pulling in capital and developing its ecosystem.",
      "\"We observe some of the things that the Finnish ecosystem is doing now, Sting was part of driving 10 or 15 years ago here - co-working spaces, [and] new organisations in the ecosystem that can support in different ways.\"",
      "Mikael Pentikainen, CEO of the Federation of Finnish Enterprises, says the country's government is currently losing support amongst entrepreneurs despite its pro-start-up and pro-business approach.",
      "A recent survey for the organisation found 41% of small and medium-sized business owners are satisfied with the coalition's actions, down from 54% in June.",
      "One likely reason for the dip, says Mr Pentikainen, is a decision to raise VAT from 24% to 25.5% last September, the highest rate in western Europe. The government said this was a \"difficult but necessary\" move designed to stabilise public finances.",
      "But Mr Pentikainen suggests it could make Finland's start-up ecosystem less competitive for international founders.",
      "The Finnish government has also recently toughened up citizenship requirements, meaning foreign entrepreneurs now need to stay at least eight years instead of five in order to obtain a passport, and will soon also be required to pass a test on Finnish society and culture if they want to settle long-term.",
      "Back at Maria 01, Mr Parker, the health company founder, says he's confident Finland's start-up ecosystem will continue to expand and attract international talent. But he warns it might lose some of the aspects that have so far made it an attractive option for entrepreneurs.",
      "\"The advantage of the ecosystem right now is this kind of 'small town, everybody knows each other' [feeling]. Scaling that up, there is the risk of actually losing that element of it.\"",

      "Some of the changes included: reporting students to the federal government who are \"hostile\" to American values; ensuring each academic department is \"viewpoint diverse\"; and hiring an external government-approved party to audit programs and departments \"that most fuel antisemitic harassment\".",

    "story": [
      "In the chaotic minutes after US President Donald Trump's administration abruptly reversed course and paused dozens of sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs, one man quickly became the public face of the decision: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "\"It took great courage,\" the bespectacled 62-year-old former hedge fund manager told the dozens of reporters gathered around him on 9 April. \"Great courage to stay the course until this moment.\"",
      "Notably absent during the press briefing - after which markets rocketed - were the other two men tasked with delivering Trump's tariff message to the American people: Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade adviser Pete Navarro.",
      "Bessent's centre-stage role in the tariffs announcement, some trade policy veterans have suggested, starkly highlights how shifting power dynamics within the White House brought the US back from the brink of an all-out global trade war, even if all the players are broadly supportive of Trump's economic agenda.",
      "\"He's playing the good cop,\" William Alan Reinsch, the former head of the National Foreign Trade Council, told the BBC. \"And Lutnick and Navarro are playing the bad cop.\"",

      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Trump had five tariff goals - has he achieved any of them?",
      "Publicly, the White House has been largely quiet on the chain of events that led to Trump's market-shaking decision to pause reciprocal tariffs for most countries while raising levies on China, with the president saying only that he had been \"thinking about it\" for a \"few days\" before it \"came together\" early on the morning of 9 April.",
      "But according to US media reports, it was Bessent, inundated with calls from business leaders, that played a key part in swaying Trump, including with conversations on Air Force One the weekend beforehand and in the Oval Office on the morning of the decision.",
      "Earlier in his career, Bessent expressed reservations about tariffs. Some observers believe these views, together with long experience in the bond market, ultimately made it possible for him to gain the president's ear over Navarro and Lutnick, both of whom represented a harder-line stance on the tariffs.",
      "\"I think what happened was that Trump wasn't paying attention to the bond market,\" added Mr Reinsch, now an economics expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"And Bessent got him to pay attention.\"",
      "Mr Reinsch, who was also undersecretary of commerce for export administration in the 1990s during President Bill Clinton's administration, said that Bessent's approach, so far, has been \"a classic way to deal with Trump\".",
      "\"Don't tell him he's wrong or made a mistake,\" he added. \"Tell him there's a better way forward to achieve his objectives, and that the market is not reacting the way we want it to react.\"",
      "On the morning of the announcement on 9 April, Trump met in the Oval Office with Bessent as well as National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett and Lutnick, the 63-year-old former chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald and a noted China hawk.",
      "Two other key players in tariffs policy were notably absent, prompting one source close to the White House to tell Reuters news agency there had been a \"pecking order change\".",
      "One, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, was just a short drive away on Capitol Hill, testifying about tariffs before a House of Representative committee.",
      "He would later that day learn of the tariffs announcement in real-time along with the lawmakers, prompting a tense exchange in which he was accused of having the \"rug pulled out\" from underneath him.",
      "The other, Peter Navarro, was similarly absent despite being one of the most visible figures in the media on tariffs, prompting speculation his stance had fallen out of favour with the president.",
      "At times, the various figures involved in tariffs gave contradictory statements on the policy, which experts say contributed to confusion and market volatility.",
      "\"They are not singing on the same page,\" said Mark Sobel, who spent nearly 40 years at the Treasury Department, including as deputy assistant secretary for international monetary and financial policy.",
      "\"You hear Navarro, you hear Bessent, you hear the president and you feel you're getting whiplash,\" he added. \"This is not a disciplined group.\"",
      "Terry Haines, the founder of Washington DC-based consultancy Pangaea Policy, told the BBC he believes that it was \"deliberate\" that the administration put forward various people to become the public faces of tariffs.",
      "\"[They wanted to] throw as many spokespeople out there, say different things, and flood the zone with opinion,\" he said. \"It may have efficacy in politics, but it confuses the hell out of markets.\"",
      "As an example, Mr Haines pointed to Navarro, who he said gets \"more leeway than you'd expect\" owing to the four-month jail term he served for contempt of Congress after ignoring a subpoena from a House committee investigating the 2021 US Capitol riot.",
      "\"They appeal to different audiences. Bessent would be interested in the financial press, while Navarro has a different message,\" he said.",
      "Haines, however, cautioned against assuming that any one person contributed the most to Trump's decision.",
      "\"Markets want winners and losers, like People magazine-style stuff,\" he said. \"But we need to know who to listen to, and that became, pretty much by default, Bessent.\"",
      "Several experts contacted by the BBC said they expect Bessent to now take a much more prominent public role in tariff policy, with Lutnick taking charge of the negotiations, while Navarro, Hassett and Greer play supporting roles.",
      "Haines, for example, said he believes Bessent will become, in real terms, \"the spokesman for economic policy\".",
      "Ultimately, a more structured approach could contribute to market stability, according to Andrew Hale, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation.",

      "In total, 19 felines were found on the property and rescued by agents. They included a caracal, two servals and 16 hybrid felines.",
      "The Civil Guard say the discovery was just \"the tip of the iceberg of a plot\" of a global criminal organisation involving breeders, transporters and vets.",
      "\"Most of the animals offered for sale came from countries such as Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, to be smuggled into the European Union,\" the Civil Guard said.",

      "The animals have been temporarily placed at the Son Servera Safari Zoo in Majorca. They may be later relocated to a rescue centre near Alicante, although this is still under discussion.",

    "story": [
      "The World Health Organization has said conditions at hospitals in Gaza are \"beyond description\", after a major facility was put out of service by an Israeli air strike.",
      "Spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris told the BBC it was seeing \"attack after attack\" on hospitals and healthcare workers, and medical supplies were critically low due to Israel's blockade of the territory.",
      "On Sunday, staff at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City said an Israeli strike had destroyed its laboratory and damaged its emergency room. They did not report any direct casualties, but said a child died due to disruption of care.",
      "The Israeli military said it hit a \"command-and-control centre\" used by Hamas to plan attacks.",
      "The hospital is run by the Church of England, whose bishops said they shared \"grief, sorrow and outrage\" with Palestinians over the attack and called on Israel to provide evidence to support its claim.",
      "A ceasefire in Gaza ended when Israel resumed its air and ground campaign four weeks ago, saying that military pressure would force Hamas to release the hostages it is still holding.",
      "Gaza medic missing since deadly attack being detained by Israel, Red Cross says",
      "Israeli air strike destroys part of last fully functional hospital in Gaza City",
      "Al-Ahli hospital was struck by two missiles around midnight on Sunday - the fifth time it has been hit since the beginning of the war.",
      "According to the Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem, the two-storey genetic laboratory was demolished and the pharmacy and emergency department buildings were damaged. Surrounding buildings were also damaged, including St Philip's Church.",
      "The diocese said the Israel military gave a 20-minute warning to hospital staff and patients to evacuate before the attack.",
      "There were no casualties as a result of the strike, but one child who had previously suffered a head injury died as a result of the rushed evacuation process, it added.",
      "Later, WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the UN agency had been told by al-Ahli's director that the emergency room, laboratory, emergency room X-ray machines, and the pharmacy were \"destroyed\".",
      "The hospital was forced to move 50 patients to other hospitals, but 40 patients in a critical condition could not be moved, he added.",
      "\"Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law. Attacks on health care must stop. Once again we repeat: patients, health workers and hospitals must be protected.\"",
      "The Israeli foreign ministry said it was a \"precise strike on a single building that was used by Hamas as a terror command and control centre\" and where there was \"no medical activity take place\".",
      "It also stressed that an \"early warning\" was issued, and that the strike was \"carried out while avoiding further damage to the hospital compound, which remained operational for continued medical treatment\".",
      "Hamas condemned the attack as a \"savage crime\" and rejected the claim that it was using the facility for military purposes.",
      "On Monday, the Church of England's House of Bishops said in a statement they were \"dismayed that hospitals have become battlegrounds in Gaza\" and that Israel had \"yet to provide clear and compelling evidence to substantiate its claim\" that the hospital was being used by Hamas.",
      "\"Against that backdrop, we call for an independent, thorough and transparent investigation into this attack as well as the alleged misuse of the hospital.\"",
      "The bishops also said that \"the extremely limited time given to staff and patients to evacuate the hospital was a further assault on fundamental human rights and basic human dignity\".",
      "WHO representative Dr Rik Peeperkorn meanwhile told the BBC that al-Ahli was now unable to receive new patients pending repairs, and that this would \"heavily impact trauma patients\".",
      "\"Al-Ahli was a key trauma hospital north of Wadi Gaza. It is the hospital with the only functional CT scanner north of Wadi Gaza,\" he said, referring to the valley that effectively divides the territory in two because it is an Israeli-designated \"no-go\" area.",
      "The charity Medical Aid for Palestinians also quoted an orthopaedic surgeon at al-Ahli as saying that the level of care the hospital could provide to the 40 remaining patients was \"quite similar to that of a hostel\".",
      "\"We are unable to perform any surgical procedures, as these patients require laboratory diagnostics, pharmacy support, and emergency referrals in case of complications - all of which have ceased entirely due to the recent attack,\" Dr Ahmed al-Shurafa said.",
      "Dr Harris warned: \"We're seeing attack after attack on hospitals, healthcare workers, ambulance workers... the very people that are relied on, who give their all to save lives. But they don't give their all to lose their lives.\"",
      "On 23 March, the Israeli military struck the surgical department of Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, killing Hamas finance chief Ismail Barhoum and one other person.",
      "Hamas said Barhoum was being treated for injuries that he suffered in an earlier Israeli attack. The military denied this, saying he was in the hospital \"in order to commit acts of terrorism\".",
      "That same day, 15 emergency workers, including eight Palestinian Red Crescent paramedics, were shot and killed by Israeli troops in nearby Rafah as they responded to a report of wounded people.",
      "The Israeli military said the troops \"opened fire due to a perceived threat\" and that six of those killed were \"Hamas terrorists\", without giving evidence. The Red Crescent denied the allegation and accused Israel of a \"full-fledged war crime\".",
      "On Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it had received information that a ninth paramedic who had been missing since the attack was being held \"in an Israeli place of detention\".",
      "The ICRC's head of sub-delegation in Gaza, Adrian Zimmermann, also warned that the wider shortage of medical supplies \"puts the life and the wellbeing of Gazans who require healthcare services at risk\".",
      "Dr Peeperkorn said they were running critically low because Israel had not allowed in any deliveries of humanitarian aid for more than six weeks.",
      "He added that the WHO had stockpiled some supplies in its warehouses during the recent ceasefire, but that the Israeli military was not facilitating transfers between northern and southern Gaza.",
      "\"Last week, we had a discussion with one of the medical specialists at al-Ahli. He was telling us that they had to use the same surgical gowns and the same surgical gloves for various operations, while we have surgical gloves and gowns in our warehouse in Deir al-Balah [south of Wadi Gaza],\" he recalled. \"We want to bring them, but we are not facilitated.\"",
      "The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
      "More than 50,980 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "A ceasefire deal that began in January and lasted two months saw Hamas release 33 Israeli hostages \u2013 eight of them dead \u2013 and five Thai hostages in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and a surge in humanitarian aid entering Gaza.",
      "Israel resumed its offensive on 18 March, blaming Hamas's refusal to accept a proposal for an extension of the agreement's first phase and the release of more of the 59 hostages it is still holding, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Hamas accused Israel of violating the original deal, according to which there would be a second phase where all the remaining living hostages would be handed over and the war brought to a permanent end.",
      "On Monday, a Hamas delegation led by the group's chief negotiator left Cairo without making any progress in talks with Egyptian mediators aimed at reaching a new ceasefire agreement, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC.",
      "\"No breakthrough was achieved due to Israel's refusal to commit to ending the war and withdrawing from the Gaza Strip,\" the official said.",
      "\"Hamas showed flexibility, regarding the number of hostages to be released in order to make progress. But Israel wants the hostages back without ending the war,\" he claimed.",
      "Israel has said it is waiting for a response to its latest proposal, sent at the end of last week.",
      "It is understood to have reduced slightly the number of hostages it is demanding should be released in exchange for an extension of the truce and the entry of humanitarian aid.",
      "A group of hostages' families, known as the Tikvah Forum, said on Monday that the parents of Eitan Mor had been told by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the government was working on a deal that would see 10 hostages freed - down from 11 or 12."

      "Many Gonz\u00e1lez supporters are nostalgic for what they perceive as a \"better time\" under Correa's presidency (2007-17), when oil revenues boosted the economy and poverty was reduced.",
      "He is a deeply divisive figure, though.",
      "His critics in the country decry his rule as authoritarian, and he has since been convicted of corruption and lives in exile. Gonz\u00e1lez's association with him remains controversial."

    "story": [
      "Four men have pleaded guilty in Kenya to trying to smuggle hundreds of highly sought-after ants out of the country.",
      "The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), which is more used to protecting larger creatures, such as lions and elephants, has described this as a \"landmark case\".",
      "The contraband included giant African harvester ants, which are valued by some UK dealers at up to \u00a3170 ($220) each.",
      "The case showed a \"disturbing shift in trafficking patterns - from iconic mammals to lesser-known species that are vital to ecological balance\", the KWS said.",
      "The suspects had concealed the creatures in \"specially modified test tubes and syringes\" which would have enabled the insects to survive for two months, the KWS said.",
      "There was also a \"calculated attempt to bypass security systems\" by obscuring the contents of the tubes.",
      "Photographs of the illegal haul shared by the KWS show hundreds of these containers packed with cotton wool, each with two or three ants.",
      "The exact number of insects involved is still being evaluated but KWS spokesperson Paul Udoto told the BBC this was the country's first case of \"bio-piracy\" on this scale.",
      "The four suspects \u2013 two Belgians, a Vietnamese and a Kenyan \u2013 were arrested after what the KWS has described as \"a co-ordinated, intelligence-led operation\".",
      "It is believed that the intended destinations were the exotic pet markets in Europe and Asia.",
      "The KWS said the demand for rare insect species is growing. Collectors keep them in special habitats, known as formicariums, and watch them build their colonies.",
      "The giant African harvester ant - or Messor cephalotes -  is the largest of its species and can grow to around 20mm, with the queen growing up to 25mm.",
      "Pat Stanchev, the general manager of insect-dealing website Best Ants UK, said that it is their \"big and beautiful size\" that makes them attractive for those who want to keep them as pets.",
      "He does not sell the giant African harvester ant but told the BBC that he is aware of people who try to pass on illegally imported insects.",
      "In Kenya, the ants are protected by international bio-diversity treaties and their trade is highly regulated.",
      "\"This prosecution sends a strong message that Kenya will enforce compliance\u2026 and marks a significant step forward in Kenya's fight against unconventional wildlife crimes,\" the KWS said.",

      "A 5.2 earthquake rattled San Diego, California, and the surrounding area on Monday afternoon, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "The quake struck at 10:08 local time (18:00 GMT) with an epicentre in Julian, California.",
      "The resort town is located in the Cuyamaca Mountains about an hour north-east of San Diego.",
      "Around two hours after the earthquake, Perette Godwin, a spokeswoman for the City of San Diego, told the BBC there had been no reports of structural damage or injuries.",
      "The San Diego sheriff's office also said it had not yet \"received any reports of injuries or major damage caused by the earthquake,\" but said it was a \"developing situation\".",
      "California Governor Gavin Newsom's office posted on X shortly after the quake that he had been briefed on the situation.",
      "The USGS continued to report smaller aftershocks in the region in the hour after the quake.",
      "The National Weather Service, meanwhile, said a tsunami was not expected.",
      "In the moments before it struck, emergency alerts issued by the USGS ordered residents to take shelter as far away as Los Angeles.",
      "\"Drop, cover, hold on. Protect yourself,\" the alert read.",
      "Kevin Manaugh was eating breakfast when he received an alert, and quickly took shelter under a door frame.",
      "\"Sure enough, the quaking started to happen,\" Mr Manaugh said. \"I've lived in San Diego most of my life, I was born here, and this is probably the worst quake that I've ever felt.\"",
      "\"It was a bit shocking,\" he continued. \"Everything shook, it shook a lot. It rattled around and lasted maybe three seconds, and then it was over.\"",
      "Though his house suffered no damage, Mr Manaugh said he would likely prepare in case another earthquake struck.",
      "\"Between this and the wildfires in Los Angeles, it made me think that it's probably a good idea to have an evacuation bag,\" he said.",
      "Earthquakes are notoriously difficult to predict, but the alert's lead time - about 15 seconds for Mr Manaugh - was enough to take action.",
      "\"The way they were able to predict that, it gave me time to get to a point of safety,\" he said.",
      "The USGS uses seismographs and other sensors buried in the ground throughout California to make a \"lightning fast\" detection when the earth starts to move, said Robert de Groot, a team lead for the agency's ShakeAlert system.",
      "The sensors convey data to a processing centre, which helps scientists determine the strength and potential scale of the quake.",
      "\"We use about a second's worth of data to determine what is going on,\" Mr de Groot said. USGS data is quickly distributed to Google and various earthquake apps to help warn residents.",
      "In the case of larger quakes, like the one that struck Southern California on Monday morning, officials send a notification through the wireless emergency alert system to ensure it reaches anyone who could be in harms way.",
      "On Monday, that included Mr de Groot, who felt the earthquake in Pasadena, 130 miles north of the epicentre.",
      "He saw the alert, and quickly took cover under a table until the rattling stopped.",
      "\"Nobody likes the ground shaking,\" he said, \"even though earthquakes are my day job.\""

    "story": [
      "A Palestinian paramedic who has been missing since an Israeli attack that killed 15 other emergency workers in southern Gaza three weeks ago is being detained by Israeli authorities, the International Committee of the Red Cross has said.",
      "The ICRC confirmed in a statement that it had \"received information\" that Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) medic Assad al-Nassasra was being held \"in an Israeli place of detention\".",
      "The PRCS said Mr Nassasra was \"forcibly abducted\" by Israeli troops following the attack and called for his immediate release.",

      "The bodies of eight PRCS medics, six Civil Defence first responders and a UN staff member were found buried in shallow graves on the outskirts of Rafah, a week after their convoy came under fire from Israeli troops there on 23 March.",
      "One other PRCS medic survived and said he was released by Israeli forces after being detained for around 15 hours.",
      "The PRCS has said the incident was a \"full-fledged war crime\", accusing Israeli forces of \"a series of deliberate attacks\" on its staff and their ambulances as they answered a call to help casualties.",
      "It has called for an independent international investigation into the incident and for those responsible to be held to account.",
      "Last Monday, the IDF said a preliminary inquiry indicated troops \"opened fire due to a perceived threat following a previous encounter in the area, and that six of the individuals killed in the incident were identified as Hamas terrorists\", without giving evidence.",
      "The Palestinian Red Crescent rejected the allegation, as did the other surviving paramedic.",
      "The IDF initially said its troops fired on \"suspicious vehicles\" driving in darkness with their headlights and emergency lights off.",
      "But it later said that account was \"mistaken\" after a video found on the mobile phone of medic Rifaat Radwan, who was in the same ambulance as Assad al-Nassasra, showed the convoy was using its emergency lights.",
      "At the end of the video, the ambulances are seen pulled over on the roadside. The sound of gunfire can be then heard just as Radwan gets out of his ambulance. It continues for more than five minutes and Radwan is heard saying his last prayers, before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching.",
      "Audio analysis by BBC Verify of the footage found Israeli troops fired more than 100 times during the attack, with some shots taken from as close as 12m (39ft) away.",
      "In a statement released on Sunday, the PRCS said: \"We have been informed by the International Committee of the Red Cross that PRCS medic Assad al-Nassasra is being held by the Israeli occupation authorities.",
      "\"His fate had remained unknown since he was targeted along with other PRCS medics in Rafah.\"",
      "It added: \"We call on the international community to pressure the occupation authorities to immediately release our colleague, medic Assad, who was forcibly abducted while carrying out his humanitarian duties.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for the PRCS told the New York Times Mr Nassasra had worked for the PRCS for 16 years, and was married with six children.",
      "An ICRC spokeswoman said it had informed Mr Nassasra's family and the PRCS after receiving information about his whereabouts.",
      "It noted: \"The ICRC has not been granted access to visit Assad al-Nassasra. The ICRC has not been able to visit any Palestinian detainees held in Israeli places of detention since 7 October 2023.\"",
      "The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.",
      "More than 50,940 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

    "story": [
      "\"She left no last words. She was dead when she was carried away,\" says Hafiza quietly, as she describes how her mother was killed in a city under siege in Darfur, during Sudan's civil war, which began exactly two years ago.",
      "The 21-year-old recorded how her family's life was turned upside down by her mother's death, on one of several phones the BBC World Service managed to get to people trapped in the crossfire in el-Fasher.",
      "Under constant bombardment, el-Fasher has been largely cut off from the outside world for a year, making it impossible for journalists to enter the city. For safety reasons, we are only using the first names of people who wanted to film their lives and share their stories on the BBC phones.",
      "Hafiza describes how she suddenly found herself responsible for her five-year-old brother and two teenage sisters.",
      "Their father had died before the start of the war, which has pitted the army against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and caused the world's biggest humanitarian crisis.",
      "The two rivals had been allies - coming to power together in a coup - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule.",
      "Hafiza's home is the last major city controlled by the military in Sudan's western region of Darfur, and has been under siege by the RSF for the past 12 months.",
      "In August 2024, a shell hit the market where her mother had gone to sell household goods.",
      "\"Grief is very difficult, I still can't bring myself to visit her workplace,\" says Hafiza in one of her first video messages after receiving her phone, shortly after her mother's death.",
      "\"I spend my time crying alone at home.\"",
      "Both sides in the war have been accused of war crimes and deliberately targeting civilians - which they deny. The RSF has also previously denied accusations from the US and human rights groups that it has committed a genocide against non-Arab groups in other parts of Darfur after it seized control of those areas.",
      "The RSF controls passage in and out the city and sometimes allows civilians to leave, so Hafiza managed to send her siblings to stay with family in a neutral area.",
      "But she stayed to try to earn money to support them.",
      "In her messages, she describes her days distributing blankets and water to displaced people living in shelters, helping at a community kitchen and supporting a breast cancer awareness group in return for a little money to help her survive.",
      "Her nights are spent alone.",
      "\"I remember the places where my mother and siblings used to sit, I feel broken,\" she adds.",
      "In almost every video 32-year-old Mostafa sent us, the sound of shelling and gunfire can be heard in the background.",
      "\"We endure relentless artillery shelling, both day and night, by the RSF,\" he says.",
      "One day, after visiting family, he returned to find his house near the city centre had been hit by shells - the roof and walls were damaged - and looters had ransacked what was left.",
      "\"Everything was turned upside down. Most houses in our neighbourhood have been looted,\" he says, blaming the RSF.",
      "While Mostafa was volunteering at a shelter for displaced people, the area came under intense attack. He kept his camera rolling as he hid, flinching at each explosion.",
      "\"There is no safe place in el-Fasher,\" he says. \"Even refugee camps are being bombed with artillery shells.",
      "\"Death can strike anyone, anytime, without warning\u2026 by a bullet, shelling, hunger or thirst.\"",
      "In another message, he talks about the lack of clean water, describing how people drink from sources contaminated with sewage.",
      "Both Mostafa and 26-year-old Manahel, who also received a BBC phone, volunteered at community kitchens funded by donations from Sudanese people living elsewhere.",
      "The UN has warned of famine in the city, something that has already happened at the nearby Zamzam camp, which is home to more than 500,000 displaced people.",
      "Many people cannot get to the market \"and if they go, they find high prices\", explains Manahel.",
      "\"Every family is equal now - there is no rich or poor. People can't afford the basic necessities like food.\"",
      "After cooking meals such as rice and stew, they deliver the food to people in shelters. For many, it is the only meal they will have for the day.",
      "When the war started, Manahel had just finished university, where she studied Sharia and law.",
      "As the fighting reached el-Fasher, she moved with her mother and six siblings to a safer area, further away from the front line.",
      "\"You lose your home, everything you own and find yourself in a new place with nothing,\" she says.",
      "But her father refused to leave their house. Some neighbours had entrusted him with their belongings, and he decided to stay to protect them - a decision that cost him his life.",
      "She says he was killed by RSF artillery in September 2024.",
      "Since the siege began a year ago, almost 2,000 people have been killed or injured in el-Fasher, according to the UN.",
      "After sunset, people rarely leave their homes. The lack of electricity can make night-time frightening for many of el-Fasher's one million residents.",
      "People with solar power or batteries are scared to turn lights on because they \"could be detected by drones\", explains Manahel.",
      "There were times we could not reach her or the others for several days because they had no internet access.",
      "But above all these worries, there is one particular fear that both Manahel and Hafiza share if the city falls to the RSF.",
      "\"As a girl, I might get raped,\" Hafiza says in one of her messages.",
      "She, Manahel and Mostafa are all from non-Arabic communities and their fear stems from what happened in other cities that the RSF has taken, most notably el-Geneina, 250 miles (400km) west of el-Fasher.",
      "In 2023 it witnessed horrific massacres, along ethnic lines, which the US and others say amounted to genocide. RSF fighters and allied Arab militia allegedly targeted people from non-Arab ethnic groups, such as the Massalit - which the RSF has previously denied.",
      "A Massalit woman I met in a refugee camp over the border in Chad described how she was gang-raped by RSF fighters and was unable to walk for nearly two weeks, while the UN has said girls as young as 14 were raped.",
      "One man told me how he witnessed a massacre by RSF forces - he escaped after he was injured and left for dead.",
      "The UN estimates that between 10,000 and 15,000 people were killed in el-Geneina alone in 2023. And now more than a quarter of a million people from the city - half its former population - are among those living in refugee camps in Chad.",
      "We put these accusations to the RSF but it did not respond. However, in the past it has denied any involvement in ethnic cleansing in Darfur, saying the perpetrators had worn RSF clothing to shift the blame to them.",
      "Few reporters have had access to el-Geneina since then, but after months of negotiation with the city's civil authorities, a BBC team was allowed to visit in December 2024.",
      "We were assigned minders from the governor's office and were only allowed to see what they wanted to show us.",
      "It was immediately clear that the RSF was in control. I saw their fighters patrolling the streets in armed vehicles and had a brief conversation with some of them, when they showed me their anti-vehicle rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launcher.",
      "It did not take long to realise how differently they viewed the conflict. Their commander insisted there were no civilians like Hafiza, Mostafa and Manahel living in el-Fasher.",
      "\"The person who stays in a war zone is participating in the war, there are no civilians, they are all from the army,\" he said.",
      "He claimed el-Geneina was now peaceful and that most of its residents - \"around 90%\" - had come back. \"Homes that were previously empty are now occupied again.\"",
      "But hundreds of thousands of the city's residents are still living as refugees in Chad, and I saw many deserted and destroyed neighbourhoods as we drove around.",
      "With the minders watching us, it was hard to get a true picture of life in el-Geneina. They took us to a bustling vegetable market, where I asked people about their lives.",
      "Each time I asked someone a question, I noticed them glance at the minder over my shoulder before answering that everything was \"fine\", apart from a few comments about high prices.",
      "However, my minder would often whisper in my ear afterwards, saying people were exaggerating about the prices.",
      "We ended our trip with an interview with Tijani Karshoum, the governor of West Darfur whose predecessor was killed in May 2023 after accusing the RSF of committing genocide.",
      "It was his first interview since 2023, and he maintained he was a neutral civilian during the el-Geneina unrest and did not side with anyone.",
      "\"We have turned a new page with the slogan of peace, coexistence, moving beyond the bitterness of the past,\" he said, adding that the UN's casualty figures were \"exaggerated\".",
      "Also in the room was a man who we understood to be a representative of the RSF.",
      "Karshoum's answers to nearly all my questions were almost identical, whether I was asking about accusations of ethnic cleansing or about what happened to the former governor, Khamis Abakar.",
      "Nearly two weeks after I spoke to Karshoum, the European Union imposed sanctions on him, saying he \"holds responsibility in the fatal attack\" on his predecessor and that he had \"been involved in planning, directing or committing\u2026 serious human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, including killings, rape and other serious forms of sexual and gender-based violence, and abduction\".",
      "I followed up with him to get his response to these accusations, and he said: \"Since I am a suspect in this matter, I believe any statement from me would lack credibility.\"",
      "But he stated that he \"was never part of the tribal conflict and remained at home during the clashes\" and added that he was not involved in any violations of humanitarian law.",
      "\"Accusations of killings, abductions, or rape must be addressed through an independent investigation\" with which he would co-operate, Karshoum said.",
      "\"From the start of the conflict in Khartoum, we pushed for peace and proposed well-known initiatives to prevent violence in our socially fragile state,\" he added.",
      "Given the stark contrast between the narrative promoted by those in control of el-Geneina and the countless stories I heard from refugees across the border, it is hard to imagine people ever returning home.",
      "The same goes for 12 million other Sudanese people who have fled their homes and are either refugees abroad or living in camps inside Sudan.",
      "In the end, Hafiza, Mostafa and Manahel found life in el-Fasher unbearable and in November 2024 all three left the city to stay in nearby towns.",
      "With the military regaining control of the capital, Khartoum, in March, Darfur remains the last major region where the paramilitaries are still largely in control - and that has turned el-Fasher into an even more intense battlefield.",
      "\"El-Fasher has become scary,\" Manahel said as she packed her belongings.",

      "Since the Taliban seized power in 2021, girls over the age of 12 have been barred from getting an education, and women from many jobs.",
      "In 2020, only 19% of women were part of the workforce - four times less than men. That number has dropped even further under Taliban rule.",
      "The lack of opportunities, coupled with the dire economic situation the country faces, have pushed many into long, laborious days of carpet weaving - one of the few trades the Taliban government allows women to work in.",
      "According to the UN, the livelihoods of about 1.2 to 1.5 million Afghans depend on the carpet weaving industry, with women making up nearly 90% of the workforce.",
      "In an economy that the UN warned in a 2024 report had \"basically collapsed\" since the Taliban took power, the carpet export business is booming.",
      "The Ministry of Industry and Commerce noted that in the first six months of 2024 alone, over 2.4 million kilograms of carpets - worth $8.7m (\u00a36.6m) - were exported to countries such as Pakistan, India, Austria and the US.",
      "But this has not necessarily meant better wages for the weavers. Some the BBC spoke to said they had seen none of the profit from a piece sold in Kazakhstan last year that fetched $18,000.",
      "Within Afghanistan, carpets sell for far less - between $100-$150 per square metre. Needing money to help support their families and having few options for employment, workers are trapped in low-paid labour.",
      "Carpet weavers say they earn about $27 for each square metre, which usually takes about a month to produce. That is less than a dollar a day despite the long, gruelling shifts that often stretch to 10 or 12 hours.",
      "Nisar Ahmad Hassieni, head of the Elmak Baft company, who let the BBC go inside his workshops, said that he pays his employees between $39 and $42 per square metre. He said they are paid every two weeks, with an eight-hour workday.",
      "The Taliban has repeatedly said that girls will be allowed to return to school once its concerns, such as aligning the curriculum with Islamic values, are resolved - but so far, no concrete steps have been taken to make that happen.",
      "Mr Hassieni said that, following the rise of the Taliban government, his organisation made it its mission to support those left behind by the closures.",
      "\"We established three workshops for carpet weaving and wool spinning,\" he says.",
      "\"About 50-60% of these rugs are exported to Pakistan, while the rest are sent to China, the USA, Turkey, France, and Russia to meet customer demand.\"",
      "Shakila, 22, makes carpets with her sisters in one of the rooms of the modest rental they also share with their elderly parents and three brothers. They live in the impoverished Dasht-e Barchi area, in the western outskirts of Kabul.",

      "\"We couldn't do anything else,\" Shakila tells me. \"There weren't any other jobs\".",
      "She explains how her father taught her to weave when she was 10 and he was recovering from a car accident.",
      "What began as a necessary skill in times of hardship has now become the family's lifeline.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump's return to the White House has created flashpoints between the North American neighbours.",
    "story": [
      "Machias Seal Island is a tiny dot on maps of North America. But the uninhabited, fogbound rock is significant for its location in an area known as the \"Grey Zone\" \u2013 the site of a rare international dispute between Canada and the United States.",
      "The two neighbours and long-time allies have each long laid claim to the island and surrounding water, where the US state of Maine meets Canada's New Brunswick province \u2013 and with that claim, the right to catch and sell the prized local lobsters.",
      "John Drouin, a US lobsterman who has fished in the Grey Zone for 30 years, tells of the mad dash by Canadian and American fishermen to place lobster traps at the start of the summer catching season each year.",
      "\"People have literally lost parts of their bodies, have had concussions, [their] head smashed and everything,\" he says.",
      "The injuries have been caused when lobstermen have been caught up in each other's lines. He says one friend lost his thumb after it became caught up in a Canadian line, what Mr Drouin calls his battle scar from the Grey Zone.",
      "The 277 square miles of sea around Machias Seal Island has been under dispute since the late 1700s \u2013 and in 1984, an international court ruling gave both the US and Canada the right to fish in the waterway.",
      "It has stood as a quirk \u2013 an isolated area of tension in what had been, until now, an otherwise close relationship between the two countries.",
      "But that could all be about to change.",
      "US President Donald Trump's return to the White House, steep tariffs on Canadian imports and rhetoric about making the country the 51st state has sparked a series of fresh flashpoints, with the possibility that he may ultimately wish to subsume Canada into the US hanging over everything. Amid the biggest shift in the relationship between the two countries in decades, the question is, what does he really want from Canada?",
      "Lobster wars",
      "Cutler, Maine, is the closest US town to the Grey Zone. It has a collection of scattered houses, one supply store and, for good reason, a lobster wholesaler.",
      "Aside from a few big-city retirees and holiday-goers, Cutler owes its existence to the bountiful crustaceans that inhabit the offshore waters. And for the lobstermen of Cutler, the international limbo of the Grey Zone is their everyday reality, as they scatter their traps along the bottom of the Gulf of Maine to catch the prized lobsters and bring them to market.",
      "During lobster season, the Grey Zone is packed with boats and buoys marking the location of their traps. When the waters get crowded and livelihoods are at stake, things can get ugly.",
      "\"Do we like it? Not in the least,\" says Mr Drouin. He has caught lobsters in the Grey Zone for 30 years. \"I will continue to complain about it until I can't breathe anymore.\"",
      "Another Maine lobsterman, Nick Lemieux, said he and his sons have had nearly 200 traps stolen in recent years \u2013 and he blames their rivals to the north.",
      "\"This is our area, and it's all we have to work with,\" he said. \"Things like that don't sit very well with us.\"",
      "Americans accuse the Canadians of operating under a different, more accommodating set of rules that allow them to catch larger lobsters.",
      "Canadians counter that the Americans have higher catch limits and are surreptitiously fishing in their territorial waters.",
      "The union representing Canada's border officials recently complained that Americans have responded to their enforcement efforts with threats of violence \u2013 and some of its officers have refused to work in the Grey Zone.",
      "Canada regularly dispatches maintenance workers to Machias Seal Island to check on an automated lighthouse \u2013 evidence, they say, of their control. The Americans point to US Marines who occupied the island during World War One as their proof of sovereignty.",
      "A series of border disputes",
      "The dispute appears to be going nowhere, but during Trump's first presidency, events in the Grey Zone did not appear to be intruding greatly on the overall warmth between the US and Canada.",
      "When Trump hosted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House in 2017, he spoke about the US-Canada relationship in glowing terms, remarking on the \"special bonds\" between the two nations that \"share much more than a border\".",
      "Yet his rhetoric has since changed sharply.",
      "In recent months, Trump has repeatedly called Canada the \"51st state\" of the US \u2013 and the White House has expressed a willingness to open up new areas of dispute all along the US-Canada border.",
      "In September, the president voiced designs on Canadian water in British Columbia in the west of the country, for instance, suggesting it could be piped to drought-parched California: \"You have millions of gallons of water pouring down from the north\u2026 they have essentially a very large faucet\".",
      "Approximately 1,500 miles further east, the Great Lakes could become another site of potential conflict, as US officials told their Canadian counterparts they are considering withdrawing from treaties over their coordinated environmental regulation.",
      "And even further east, a library has become the unlikely setting for a flashpoint: built deliberately to straddle the Vermont-Quebec border as a symbol of cooperation between Canada and the US, the Haskell Free Library and Opera House used to be open to residents from both nations.",
      "However in March, America changed the rules so that Canadians are required to pass through immigration control before they access the building, with the US Department of Homeland Security claiming it was in response to drug trafficking.",
      "Battle for natural resources",
      "Natural resources are another source of dispute. Canada has vast supplies of rare earth metals, gold, oil, coal and lumber \u2013 the kind of natural wealth that Trump has long prized.",
      "While Trump has disavowed any desire for Canada's lumber, energy stockpiles or manufactured products, in February Trudeau reportedly told a closed-door meeting of Canadian business and labour leaders that he saw it differently.",
      "\"I suggest that not only does the Trump administration know how many critical minerals we have but that may even be why they keep talking about absorbing us and making us the 51st state. They're very aware of our resources, of what we have, and they very much want to be able to benefit from those,\" the CBC quoted Trudeau as saying.",
      "Jordan Heath-Rawlings, a Canadian journalist and host of The Big Story podcast, believes Trump wants Canadian resources, and that the president's annexation comments should be taken seriously.",
      "\"He likes the idea of being the guy to bring in a huge land mass,\" says Mr Heath-Rawlings. \"He probably wants the Arctic, which is obviously going to become much more valuable in the years to come.\"",
      "For Trump, even the US-Canadian border itself is suspect. \"If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it between Canada and the US,\" he said in March. \"Somebody did it a long time ago, and it makes no sense.\"",
      "Needless to say, Trump's comments have rankled Canadian leaders, who warn of the president's ultimate designs on their homeland.",
      "In March, Trudeau accused the US president of planning \"a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us\".",
      "The previous month, after Trump first announced new tariffs on Canada, Trudeau had said: \"Trump has it in mind that one of the easiest ways of doing that [annexing Canada] is absorbing our country. And it is a real thing.\"",
      "If US territorial ambitions for Canada are, in fact, a \"real thing\", it presents a simple, vexing question. Why? Why would the US, which has had the closest of diplomatic, military, economic and cultural ties with its northern neighbour for more than a century, put all of that at risk?",
      "Exception rather than the norm",
      "Some see a pattern in Trump's designs on Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal \u2013 one that reflects a dramatic change in how the US sees itself in the world.",
      "It has been most clearly articulated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said in January that the post-World War Two dominance of the US was more the exception than the norm.",
      "\"Eventually you were going to reach back to a point where you had a multi-polar world, multiple great powers in different parts of the planet,\" he said. \"We face that now with China and to some extent Russia, and \u2026 rogue states like Iran and North Korea.\"",
      "According to Michael Williams, professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, if the current Trump administration thinks that American world dominance is no longer possible or even desired, the US might pull back from far-flung conflicts and European commitments.",
      "Instead, says Prof Williams, the US would prioritise its \"territorial core\", creating a continental fortress of sorts, insulated on both sides by the vastness of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.",
      "\"If this is your plan, you seek to control key geographic choke points,\" he says. \"You maximise access to natural resources, of which Canada has plenty, and you reshore industry whenever possible.\"",
      "Such a geopolitical outlook is hardly new. In the 1820s, US President James Monroe articulated a new global order in which America and Europe confined themselves to their own hemispheres.",
      "But it does represent a remarkable shift in US foreign policy since the end of World War Two.",
      "A plan or a whim?",
      "Prof Williams acknowledges that it's difficult to figure out exactly what the US president is thinking \u2013 a view wholeheartedly endorsed by John Bolton, who served as Trump's national security adviser for more than a year of his first presidential term.",
      "\"Trump has no philosophy,\" he says. \"He gets ideas, but does not follow a coherent pattern. There is no underlying strategy.\"",
      "The president is currently fixated on minerals and natural resources, he said, but Mr Bolton argues the best way to go about doing that is through the private sector, not by floating the idea of annexing an ally. Canada, for its part, has offered to work with US companies on joint mining partnerships.",
      "Prof Williams and Mr Bolton agree that whatever the motivations behind Trump's designs on Canada, the diplomatic damage that's being done will be difficult to undo \u2013 and the possibility of unanticipated consequences is high.",
      "Boycotts and cancelled trips",
      "\"Trump likes to say in a lot of contexts that other people don't have any cards,\" says Prof Williams. \"But the further you push people to the wall, the more you may find that they have cards that you didn't know they had \u2013 and they might be willing to play them. And even if you have more cards, the consequences of doing so can easily spiral out of control in some really bad ways.\"",
      "Canadians have already been boycotting US products and cancelling winter trips south, which has had an impact on tourist communities in Florida.",
      "\"We're not looking for a fight, but Canada's ready for one,\" says Mr Heath-Rawlings.",
      "The idea that the trust between the US and Canada has been broken is one that's been embraced by the country's new prime minister, Mark Carney, as a general election looms.",
      "\"The old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over,\" he said recently. \"I reject any attempts to weaken Canada, to wear us down, to break us so that America can own us.\"",
      "Back in the 19th Century, territorial conflicts and flare-ups along the US-Canada border were a more frequent occurrence. Americans made multiple unsuccessful attempts to capture Canadian territory during the 1812 War.",
      "In 1844, some Americans called for military force if the UK wouldn't agree to its claims in the Pacific Northwest.",
      "The 1859 \"pig dispute\" involved contested islands near Vancouver and the unfortunate shooting of a British hog that had intruded on an American's garden.",
      "All that seemed the stuff of dusty history books, where the Grey Zone was a diplomatic oddity \u2013 an exception to a peaceful norm in the modern world of developed and integrated democracies.",
      "But that calm is now broken, and no one is sure where these stormy waters will lead either country.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg41r4kx0lko",
    "published": "Mon, 14 Apr 2025 04:02:32 GMT",
    "summary": "The Peruvian was  called a \"divinely gifted story-teller\" when he won the Nobel in 2010.",
    "story": [
      "Mario Vargas Llosa, who has died at the age of 89 in his native Peru, was a towering figure in Latin American literature and culture who rarely shied away from controversy.",
      "With more than 50 works to his name, many of which have been widely translated, Vargas Llosa won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2010 when judges dubbed him a \"divinely gifted story-teller\". His depictions of authoritarianism, violence and machismo, using rich language and imagery, made him a star of the Latin American Boom literary movement that shone a global spotlight on the continent.",
      "At first sympathetic to left-wing ideas, he grew disillusioned with Latin America's revolutionary causes, eventually running unsuccessfully for the Peruvian presidency with a centre-right party in 1990.",
      "Vargas Llosa was born in 1936 to a middle-class family in Arequipa in southern Peru. After his parents separated while he was an infant, he moved to Cochabamba in Bolivia with his great-grandparents. He returned to Peru aged 10 and six years later he wrote his first play, The Escape of the Inca. He graduated from Lima University, studied in Spain and later moved to Paris.",
      "His first novel, The Time of the Hero, was an indictment of corruption and abuse at a Peruvian military school. Written at a time when the country's military wielded significant political and social power, it was published in 1962.",
      "Its forceful, menacing imagery was condemned by several Peruvian generals. One accused Vargas Llosa of having a \"degenerate mind\".",
      "It was based on the writer's own time as a teenager at the Leoncio Prado Military Academy, which he described in 1990 as \"an extremely traumatic experience\". His two years there made him see his country \"as a violent society, filled with bitterness, made up of social, cultural, and racial factions in complete opposition\". The school itself burnt 1,000 copies of the novel on its grounds, Vargas Llosa claimed.",
      "His experimental second novel The Green House (1966) was set in the Peruvian desert and jungle, and described an alliance of pimps, missionaries and soldiers based around a brothel.",
      "The two novels helped found the Latin American Boom literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The Boom was characterised by experimental and explicitly political works that reflected a continent in turmoil.",
      "Its leading authors, who included Vargas Llosa's Colombian friend and sometime rival Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez - who pioneered the kaleidoscopic magical realism style of writing - became household names and their works were read around the world.",
      "Famously the two authors did not speak to each other for decades after Vargas Llosa punched Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez in the face in a Mexican cinema in 1976. Reports of why Vargas Llosa punched his Colombian friend differ.",
      "Friends of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez said the dispute had revolved around Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's friendship with Vargas Llosa's then-wife, Patricia, but Vargas Llosa told students at a Madrid university in 2017 that it had been down to their opposing views on Cuba and its communist leader, Fidel Castro.",
      "They reconciled in 2007 and three years later, in 2010, Vargas Llosa was awarded the Nobel Prize - the first South American writer to be chosen for the literature prize since Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez took the honour in 1982.",
      "Much of Vargas Llosa's work is inseparable from the instability and violence in parts of Latin America in the second half of the 20th Century as the region experienced waves of revolutions and military rule.",
      "His novel Conversations in the Cathedral (1969) was celebrated for exposing how the Peruvian dictatorship of 1948-56 under Manuel Odr\u00eda controlled and eventually ruined the lives of ordinary people.",
      "Like many intellectuals, Vargas Llosa supported Fidel Castro but became disillusioned with the communist leader following the \"Padilla Affair\" when poet Heberto Padilla was imprisoned for criticising the Cuban government in 1971.",
      "In 1983 Vargas Llosa was appointed president of a commission investigating the gruesome killing in a village in the Peruvian Andes of eight journalists, which became known as the Uchuraccay massacre.",
      "Peruvian officials maintained that the journalists had been killed by indigenous villagers who had mistaken the journalists for members of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group.",
      "The commission's report backed the official line, leading to fierce criticism of Vargas Llosa by those who believed that the gruesome nature of the crime and the horrific mutilations inflicted on the body were the hallmark of an infamous anti-terrorist police rather than signs of \"indigenous violence\".",
      "Moving further right on the political spectrum, in 1990 Vargas Llosa ran for the Peruvian presidency with the centre-right Frente Democr\u00e1tico coalition on a neo-liberal platform. He lost to Alberto Fujimori, who went on to govern Peru for the following 10 years.",
      "Despite the criticism levelled against him over the investigation into the Uchuraccay massacre, Vargas Llosa continued to expose state terror and abuse of power through literature.",
      "His novel The Feast of the Goat, published in 2000, focused on dictator Rafael Trujillo, who ruled the Dominican Republic for 31 years until his assassination in 1961. The novel won praise from the Nobel Prize Committee for its attention to \"structures of power\" and \"images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat\".",
      "Other works were adapted for the big screen. His book Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, based on his first marriage, was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, Tune in Tomorrow.",
      "His later work covered figures as diverse as Irish nationalist Roger Casement (The Dream of the Celt, 2012).",
      "He spent the latter years of his life in Peru as well as Madrid.",
      "The author appeared in the pages of Spanish gossip magazine Hola after he left his wife of 50 years in 2015 to be with Spanish-Filipino socialite Isabel Preysler, the mother of popular Latin singer Enrique Iglesias.",
      "He also continued to attract criticism for controversial remarks.",
      "In 2019 he was condemned for blaming the rise in killings of journalists in Mexico - more than 100 in the past decade - on the expansion of press freedom \"which allows journalists to say things that were not permitted previously\". While he also said that \"narcotics trafficking plays an absolutely central part in all of this\", some commentators felt that he failed to express sympathy with the victims and their families.",
      "And in 2018 he caused a stir when, in a column for Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, he called feminism \"the most determined enemy of literature, trying to decontaminate it from machismo, multiple prejudices and immoralities\".",
      "He died in Lima on 13 April surrounded by his family and \"at peace\", his son \u00c1lvaro Vargas Llosa announced.",
      "With his death, the last of the Latin American Boom's great stars has gone."

    "summary": "When F. Scott Fitzgerald\u200b wrote \"The Great Gatsby\"\u200b at the height of the roaring '20s, he couldn't possibly realize that the book would emerge as one of the very top contenders for \"the great American novel.\"",
    "story": [
      "When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote \"The Great Gatsby\" at the height of the roaring '20s, he couldn't possibly realize that the book would emerge as one of the very top contenders for \"the great American novel.\"",
      "In fact, when Fitzgerald \u2013 a St. Paul, Minnesota native whose debut novel \"This Side of Paradise\" launched him into national prominence at the age of 24 \u2013 died in 1940 at the early age of 44, the book was already in danger of falling into obscurity.",
      "Now, 100 years after the book's first publication on April 10, 1925, it endures as one of the country's foremost tales of American hubris, modern yearning and class consciousness. And its clear-eyed assessment of the attainability of the American dream remains incisive with each passing decade.",
      "Fitzgerald's book, long a staple in high school literature classes, tells the story of Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner (and veiled Fitzgerald stand-in) who becomes enamored with the bon vivant, Jazz Age lifestyle on Long Island, specifically the effects of mutli-millioniare Jay Gatsby.",
      "Like Carraway, Gatsby is a Midwesterner who has trekked to the East Coast to make a name for himself. It's Carraway's cousin Daisy Buchanan who serves as the catalyst for Gatsby's downfall, and ultimately Carraway's own disillusionment. All the while, a symbolic green light beckons from the distance.",
      "When the book was first published, reviews were largely positive, though not unanimous. Fitzgerald, who originally wanted to title the book \"Trimalchio in West Egg\" before being persuaded to go with a title he thought far more generic, watched as the book languished on the vine commercially, selling fewer than 25,000 copies in the initial push.",
      "He would only complete one further novel in his lifetime: 1934's \"Tender is the Night,\" a thinly-veiled roman \u00e0 clef of Fitzgerald's own marriage to socialite Zelda Sayre, detailing their mutual descent into alcoholism and mental illness. Fitzgerald's early death from a heart attack was likely fuelled by years and years of alcohol abuse. Ironically, he'd gone sober just ahead of the cardiac event.",
      "If \"The Great Gatsby\" never achieved the level of esteem it now enjoys during the author's own life, it wasn't long after his death that Fitgerald's literary reputation took off.",
      "When the Modern Library asked authors, historians, critics and publishers on the eve of Y2K to rank their picks for the world's best novels of the 20th century, it was \"The Great Gatsby\" that\u00a0stood above all other U.S. contenders near the top of the poll. (The novel landed in second place, bookended by Irish author James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in the top three.)",
      "The novel has since launched multiple film adaptations, has been transposed to the stage, and since going into the public domain in 2021, has been the subject of an endless array of reimaginings, remixes and mashups. It's even cleared space around itself as a modern-day meme, in the form of an animated .GIF depicting Leonardo Dicaprio (playing Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation) smirking as he offers a champagne toast flanked by ostentatious fireworks.",
      "Host of \"Gatsby\" centennial events planned in New York, Minnesota",
      "A host of \"Gatsby\"-themed events are planned to mark the novel's centennial anniversary. In New York, the Empire State Building announced plans to light up in green in a nod to the novel's symbolic green light at the end of Tom and Daisy's dock.",
      "There was also a rowdy \"Roaring Twenties\" party at the Empire Steak House in New York, which was an opulent opera house in Fitzgerald's era. Billed as the \"nation's most extravagant celebration,\" the event featured live jazz, period dancing, and speeches from officials with the New York Public Library.",
      "In honor of the legendary stage play, Broadway has marked the occasion with a release of new block tickets for the show. Tickets are on sale now and will run through Jan. 4, 2026.",
      "The iconic Victorian-themed New York bar, Oscar Wilde, is also hosting a Gatsby-inspired soir\u00e9e on Saturday. The event information markets the celebration as \"an all-day affair of music, opulence and mischief.\" Events kick off at 2 p.m. and continue into the evening until 11 p.m.",
      "Additionally, multiple restaurants are offering exclusive discounts on cocktails, and even a free drink at some places. Gatsby's Landing, Nothing Really Matters, Angelina Bakery and The Plaza are all listed as participants. All events and discounts are ongoing throughout the month of April.",
      "In Fitzgerald's hometown of St. Paul, the events include a new exhibit of the author's life and times at the Minnesota History Center, as well as various, less-than-sober events leaning into the novel's party-friendly Prohibition-era setting.",
      "If you managed to get through high school without having been assigned to read the book, there are a number of live readings of the book scheduled this month, including at St. Paul's Gale Family Library.",
      "By the by, one of the stars of the aforementioned Broadway musical of \"Gatsby\" is Ryan McCarten, who is from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and graduated from Minnetonka High School. He plays the titular role of Jay Gatsby.",

      "\"The first thing my dad said is, 'This is an accurate portrayal of what it was to love and fear this woman.' Once I knew that I had gotten her right, everything else flowed,\" she said during an appearance on \"CBS Mornings\" on Wednesday.",

      "\"I'm just another girl trying to make sense of her dead, crazy mother,\" Hanks said.",

      "\"My mom \u2014 I had language for addiction because we used to host 12-step programs in our house, and my mom would have sponsees stay with us.

      "She detailed both emotional and physical abuse in her childhood home. Hanks explained that in California during the late 1980s, family law typically required evidence of physical abuse before a child could be removed from a situation.",
      "\"Family law in California in the late '80s wasn't enough room for it. At that time, you kind of had to have the receipts of physical abuse to get pulled out of a situation. And once we crossed that rubicon is when I moved to Los Angeles,\" she said.",

      "\"At the time, my mom kind of had this stance like a thoroughbred who had been put out to pasture too soon, and she didn't get her chance as an artist because of my dad's, as I describe it, catastrophic fame,\" Hanks said. \"I think including her poetry in the book is a way of treating her seriously as an artist and getting back into conversation with her. And anybody who's buried a parent knows that a two-way conversation suddenly becomes a one-way conversation.\"",
      "When asked about the truth she now understands, Hanks reflected, \"The truth is, my mother had good days and bad days. And I was lucky to experience the good days, and I was shaped by the bad days. All of the care and protection I had for the child that I was doesn't diminish what happened between us. But it means that as I get older, there's more wiggle room and acceptance for her flaws and mine.\"",
      "The memoir also explores themes of place and identity. As a journalist accustomed to interviewing others, Hanks discovered, \"When you're talking to stone-cold strangers, you can't start with, 'Tell me about your mom,' but you can start with, 'Tell me where you're from.' If someone wants to talk about their hometown, it's an elevator to their deepest self.\"",

      "The CDC said Friday there have been seven local outbreaks of the virus in the U.S., up from six last week. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring New Mexico remains the country's largest, with nearly 600 cases between the two states.",
      "A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, asked about the new outbreaks. The agency previously said outbreaks had been reported in Texas and New Mexico, New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.",
      "This week's update came a day after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described his strategy for handling the current outbreak as a success, even after a third death of an unvaccinated American was linked to it.",
      "\"Our numbers in this country have now plateaued. And I want to thank CDC for that,\" Kennedy said Thursday at a White House Cabinet meeting.",
      "Kennedy compared the nation's measles figures to those in Europe, which has seen thousands more measles cases and several more deaths. Health officials there have been grappling with record measles cases in recent years due to steep gaps in vaccination rates in several countries.",
      "Unlike in Europe, prolonged local outbreaks of measles had been declared eliminated in the Americas. Officials have warned that this year's outbreaks in the region are now threatening that public health achievement.",
      "Kennedy also told President Trump at the Cabinet meeting, \"We're trying to refocus the press. We've had three measles deaths in this country over 20 years, and we're trying to refocus the press to get them to pay attention to the chronic disease epidemic.\"",
      "One CDC official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, warned that any apparent slowdown in recent measles cases should be treated with caution. Challenges in quickly identifying and reporting cases from the outbreaks can distort figures.",
      "During outbreaks, weekly measles cases almost always appear to be lower in more recent weeks due to reporting delays, they said.",
      "Some travelers to Texas and Kansas are also now being advised to get a second or early dose of the measles vaccine, the CDC said in a letter to health departments this week, marking the first time in years that the CDC has published these kinds of vaccination recommendations for domestic travel within the country.",
      "\"The current increase in measles cases in the United States is due to people returning to the United States from international trips with measles and an expanding outbreak among communities with low vaccination coverage in Texas and other states,\" the CDC wrote in its letter.",

      "It has been nearly three years since the launch of the 988 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and since then, millions seeking help have used the call center as a life-saving resource. But understaffing and underfunding threaten to upend the hotline's mission.",
      "The nation's 988 hotline works like 911, bringing critical access to care for those battling mental health emergencies. Counselor Alejandra takes calls at the nation's largest suicide prevention center \u2014 Los Angeles' Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services. That one center receives 20,000 calls and texts a month.",
      "Alejandra said they became a counselor because they have \"personal experience with suicidal thoughts.\"",

      "\"I know what it's like to go through this, or not feel comfortable reaching out,\" Alejandra told CBS News.",
      "\"When someone calls prevention, they're already breaking through a lot of barriers and a lot of stigma,\" Alejandra said. \"So there is vulnerability and courage in those first few of moments. I breathe deeply because those are the moments where you show someone, 'I'm glad you called.'\"",
      "Nationwide, calls increased 40% soon after the three-digit number was officially launched in 2022.",
      "\"Since 2022, 12 million people have contacted 988 for help. So what that tells us is that people want the help,\" said Didi Hirsch CEO Lyn Morris, noting that these calls are oftentimes literal life or death situations.",
      "\"We have dealt with people calling our line who have either taken measures to end their life or are sitting at home with a gun in their lap,\" she said.",
      "A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association outlines that, while calls have gone up, access to care after those initial calls has not increased. The study's authors are pushing for more awareness and funding to make 988 more effective for those in need.",
      "\"We want them to have a full crisis continuum of care,\" Morris said. \"We need more resources, we need more therapists, we need technology. We want to be able to answer those calls in the most efficient way possible.\"",
      "One in four adults in the U.S. lives with a diagnosable mental illness, according to the National Institutes of Health. But many more could be struggling without a diagnosis, and the numbers are expected to go up.",
      "Meanwhile, public health services nationwide could face further federal cuts.",
      "More than 10% of the staff working for the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, which oversees the 988 hotline, were fired last month amid cuts by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. One SAMHSA employee said about a quarter of the agency's communication team, who work to raise awareness about the hotline, were let go.",
      "\"The ultimate goal is for all Americans to have access to crisis care for mental health and substance use issues, in the way that 911 provides rapid response for physical health emergencies,\" SAMHSA told CBS News in a statement. \"The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is working diligently to support the development and sustainability of local treatment and support connected to 988, including the expansion of mobile crisis services and 24/7 walk-in crisis care clinics across the country. Transformation of this scale and building a cohesive crisis care system takes time, and there is more work needed to be able to deliver these critical services to the American public.\"",
      "Morris said additional cuts could lead to \"a very dire situation.\"",

    "summary": "The case could determine whether Mark Zuckerberg's company might have to divest WhatsApp and Instagram.",
    "story": [
      "Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday in a Washington, D.C., courtroom to defend his social media company from federal allegations that the technology giant is a monopoly.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is facing off with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday, for Day one of a landmark antitrust trial that could result in the company's breakup. For Zuckerberg, the case could determine whether the business empire he started building while still a student at Harvard University will be forced to break apart.",
      "The trial will be the first big test of the FTC's willingness under President Trump to challenge Big Tech, a long-time target of Republicans. The lawsuit was initially filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Mr. Trump's first term, before being amended in 2021.",
      "In its\u00a0complaint, the FTC accuses Meta of \"anticompetitive conduct,\" alleging that the company's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp gives it excessive control of the social media market.",
      "\"There's nothing wrong with Meta innovating,\" said Daniel Matheson, lead attorney for the FTC in his opening statements for the agency Monday, \"It's what happened next that is a problem.\"",
      "During his testimony Monday, Zuckerberg defended his decision to buy Instagram and pushed back against FTC claims that he did not invest in developing the app.",
      "Purchased by Facebook in\u00a02012\u00a0and\u00a02014, respectively, Instagram and WhatsApp have grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "To restore competition, Meta must part ways with Instagram and WhatsApp, the government agency says in\u00a0court filings. The FTC also wants Meta to provide the government with prior notice for any future mergers and acquisitions.",
      "With the landmark trial underway, here's what you need to know.",
      "How long will the Meta trial last, and who will testify?",
      "The trial, which begins Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., is expected to last several weeks.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg will preside over the case, which could see a range of witnesses including Meta CEO and founder Zuckerberg; former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; former Meta Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer; Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom; and executives from rival social media platforms.",
      "What is happening in court today?",
      "The FTC and Meta made their opening arguments on Monday, with witness testimony expected to start in the afternoon.",
      "In his opening statement, lead FTC attorney Matheson said Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing WhatsApp and Instagram platforms and in buying them, the tech giant was \"eliminating immediate threats,\" to their market.",
      "Meta said the company \"did nothing wrong\" by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta attorney Mark Hansen said in his opening statement that the two apps have grown substantially under the tech company's ownership and that there is no evidence to prove Meta is a monopoly.",
      "If Meta had monopoly power, it would exercise control over pricing in the social media space, Hansen said. But Meta's services are free, he noted. \"How can the FTC maintain this monopolization case when [Meta] has never charged users a cent,\" Hansen said.",
      "After the opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify. His\u00a0testimony largely focused on Facebook's efforts to build a rival photo app that could compete with Instagram, before it decided to ultimately buy the company in 2012.",
      "Zuckerberg admitted Facebook was struggling with mobile users in the early 2010s. \"Our whole company had been built up to that point\" for desktop.",
      "Referencing email communications sent by the Meta executive, the FTC pointed out that Zuckerberg had been eyeing the progress of competitor Instagram. Facebook at the time was working on launching a new photo app.",
      "According to the FTC, Zuckerberg sent an email in Feb 2011 saying \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly\" that mentioned their numbers and uploads.",
      "In 2012, Zuckerberg sent another email in which he described his rationale for buying Instagram, saying it was a good photo-sharing network, according to the FTC. At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\"",
      "Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue.",
      "\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Associated Press.",
      "\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.",
      "Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"",
      "What is Meta saying?",
      "The social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.",
      "\"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta's statement reads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\"",
      "\"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\"",
      "\"Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The FTC did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "When did this case get started?",
      "The history of the Meta case stretches back several years. The FTC initially filed the suit in 2020 during President Trump's first term in office.",
      "In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC, claiming the lawsuits were \"legally insufficient\" and did not supply sufficient evidence to prove Facebook was a monopoly.",
      "But the federal judge later cleared the path for the case to proceed after the FTC introduced more evidence in an amended complaint, according to The Washington Post.",

      "People split on whether they believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan, and most don't think the tariffs will be permanent \u2014 rather that he's using them to negotiate. More like his goals regarding\u00a0trade policy than his approach to it. For those who think he does have a plan \u2014 predominantly, Republicans \u2014 it'll take months or longer to judge the impact. Republicans stand apart from the public overall in showing that patience.",
      "But in the short term, a big majority of Americans think new tariffs are going to raise prices, and many think that's the case in the long term, too. So, an inflation-weary public is bracing for that to hit their bottom line: a growing number think Trump's policies are making them financially worse off, not better, and most think that tariffs will make the economy worse more immediately, too.",
      "In turn, Trump's ratings for handling inflation and the economy have become more negative.",
      "Either way one lasting impression may be this: in the public mind it is Donald Trump's economy now. A majority say his policies, not Joe Biden's, are responsible for it.",
      "Views about the potential impact on prices are especially important in this context because in recent years inflation has consistently been a top concern for Americans, and it is still a top way people evaluate their finances and the economy.",

      "Despite many anticipating short-term price increases, Republicans and most independents say judging Trump's trade policies will take at least a few months to evaluate, while Democrats are more ready to evaluate them sooner.",
      "Support for tariffs is also connected to who people think they'll help or hurt. Either way large numbers think the wealthy and corporations will benefit. Those in favor see the middle and working class benefitting too.",
      "Trump's job handling",
      "When Mr. Trump was entering office, a sizable four in 10 Americans thought he'd make them financially better off \u2014 it was a key reason he won the election. That changed in March, with more seeing the impact as worse, and now that worsening view has continued today.",
      "The market was volatile this week while the poll was being conducted, but overall more Americans said Mr. Trump's policies were making the market go down.",
      "In all, the trend is for sliding ratings for Mr. Trump on handling the economy, handling inflation, and overall. (That overall number is down from its high at the start, but still higher than anything he had in his first term.)",

In political terms, most of the public considers this Donald Trump's economy now: the majority view his policies (not Joe Biden's) as mostly responsible for the way things are today. And combined, three-quarters assign him at least shared impact.",
      "Here's another way Mr. Trump is a central figure in the economy: given a list of reasons why they might think the economy is either good or bad, in either case, sizable numbers give Mr. Trump as a reason. For the large majority who think it's bad, prices and general lack of confidence are top reasons, along with Donald Trump specifically. Those who think the economy is good \u2014 a group that includes a lot of Republicans \u2014 list Mr. Trump, along with general confidence, and the job market.",
      "Polarization also plays a role in a difference between people's assessments now and their outlook. In the last few weeks, their collective outlook has changed a little more.",

      "And a slight majority of Americans \u2014 and slightly more than last month \u2014 said they think the economy is getting worse. That came from Democrats, as most Republicans say it's getting better. (Separately, in a different study, the consumer confidence index slipped in April.)",
      "Meanwhile, current views of the U.S. economy have been majority negative for years and still are. More Republicans are calling it good now, a partisan effect we often see over the years when the White House changes hands.

      "The S&P 500 gained 95 points, or 1.8%, to 5,363, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 619 points, or 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.1%.",

Even so, economists are cautioning that the growing trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp the nation's growth.",
      "\"'Rollercoaster' is not a technical term but it is probably the best adjective to describe price action across equity markets this week,\" noted Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, in an email.",
      "Beijing on Friday announced that it would raise tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. That matches the 125% duties on Chinese goods that President Trump\u00a0announced this week\u00a0\u2014 those tariffs will rise to as much as 145% for some of the Asian nation's products.",
      "\"The U.S. alternately raising abnormally high tariffs on China has become a numbers game, which has no practical economic significance, and will become a joke in the history of the world economy,\" a Chinese finance ministry spokesman said in a statement announcing the new tariffs. \"However, if the U.S. insists on continuing to substantially infringe on China's interests, China will resolutely counter and fight to the end.\"",

      "\"While the White House has tried hard in the last 1.5 days to spin things positively on trade, with a lot of talk about negotiations, investors are seeing through the noise and realize the irreparable damage inflicted on the global economy from Trump's reckless tariff campaign,\" equities analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told investors in a research note.",
      "The news for markets isn't uniformly grim. The Dow soared nearly 3,000 points on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq enjoyed their biggest one-day gains in decades after Mr. Trump\u00a0paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries, with the exception of China, for 90 days.",

    "summary": "Some people whose homes survived the Eaton wildfire in January are struggling to convince their insurers to test their properties for safety.",
    "story": [
      "All sense of survivors' guilt was fleeting for those residents whose homes remained standing after wildfires ripped through the Los Angeles area three months ago.",
      "Many worried that smoke from the Eaton wildfire that destroyed more than 9,000 structures and killed 18 people may have carried toxins, including lead, asbestos and heavy metals, into their homes. But they struggled to convince their insurers to test their properties to ensure it was safe to return.",
      "Nicole Maccalla, a data scientist, said embers burned more than half of her roof, several windows and eaves were damaged, and her house in Altadena was left filled with ash, debris, soot and damaged appliances. She said her insurance adjuster said USAA would pay for contamination testing, but after choosing a company and coming back with the results, her claim was rejected. The adjuster said the company only covered testing in homes with major damage.",
      "\"Every single item is a battle,\" said Maccalla. \"It's denials and appeals and denials and appeals, and you wait weeks and weeks and weeks for responses.\"",
      "Maccalla and others banded together as Eaton Fire Residents United, sharing indoor environmental testing data and compiling the results in an online map. Of 81 homes tested so far for lead, all show elevated levels, according to the group.",
      "\"I've already had multiple people reach out and say: 'Thank you for publishing this map \u2026 because my insurance company has changed their mind and approved testing,'\" said Maccalla, who helped design the data collection to verify results and maintain privacy.",
      "Many homeowners paid privately for the testing after their insurance companies refused, revealing gaps in coverage. The group hopes the data will help residents who can't afford it to convince their insurers to cover testing and remediation.",
      "\"If I can prove my community is not fit for human habitation then maybe I can show my home won't be,\" said Jane Lawton Potelle, founder of Eaton Fire Residents United.",
      "It's not easy to understand how and when it is safe to return home, Potelle said. The fine print of insurance policies can be frustrating and confusing, and the government has not stepped in to help.",
      "No help from FEMA",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has no plans to conduct widespread environmental testing. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is tracking environmental testing largely by academic researchers and a handful from government agencies, but most studies assess outdoor contamination.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven't standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don't torch the property.",
      "California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara released a bulletin in March that put the onus on companies to properly investigate reported smoke damage, saying they cannot deny such claims without investigating thoroughly, including paying for professional testing as warranted. But many residents have been left to fight for coverage anyway.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute that represents many major insurance companies, said it's hard to compare neighbors because every claim is unique due to each home's physical structure, actual damage and defined insurance coverage limits.",
      "\"It can vary and insurance companies are sensitive to what the claim is,\" Ruiz said. \"You have to work with your insurance companies and be reasonable about what may have happened.\"",
      "Disputes over fire damage coverage",
      "Dave Jones, director of the Climate Risk Initiative at University of California, Berkeley, and former state insurance commissioner, said testing should be covered even though some insurance companies disagree.",
      "\"It's perfectly reasonable for people to have some kind of environmental test done so that their home is safe and their property is safe,\" Jones said. \"We're talking about very catastrophically high temperature fires where all sorts of materials are melted and some of them become toxic.\"",
      "The state's insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over how it handles smoke damage claims. A 2017 change to the FAIR Plan limited coverage to \"permanent physical changes,\" meaning smoke damage must be visible or detectable without lab testing for claims to be approved. State officials said that threshold was too high and illegal, and ordered a change.",
      "Dylan Schaffer, an attorney leading a class action lawsuit challenging FAIR Plan's threshold, said he was surprised private carriers are disputing similar fire damage claims.",
      "\"The damage is not due to smoke, the damage is contamination from fire,\" Schaffer said. \"They make it complicated because it saves them money.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Altadena residents on the FAIR Plan say their claims are still being denied. Jones believes the debate will only end when lawmakers take action.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean declined to comment on the ongoing litigation and individual cases, but said the FAIR Plan pays all covered claims based on the adjusters' recommendations.",
      "\"Our policy, like many others, requires direct physical loss for there to be coverage,\" McLean said.",
      "Potelle said the first inkling that her house might be toxic came after meeting with her AAA insurance adjuster in the days after the fire. Even though she had worn a mask, her chest still ached and her voice rasped, and she wondered whether her home was safe for her 11-year-old.",
      "Stephanie Wilcox said her toddler's pediatrician recommended testing their home. Her Farmers Insurance policy includes coverage for lead and asbestos in addition to her wildfire coverage, but after multiple denials, she paid out of pocket.",
      "\"After the initial inspection, (Farmers) had told us remediation would cost about $12,000 and that it would be habitable, like we could move back in tomorrow,\" she said. \"But now there's no way.\"",
      "She plans to ask for a new estimate including lead abatement and other costs, citing the results.",
      "Similarly, Zach Bailey asked in late January for contamination testing. The house he shares with his wife and toddler sits in an island of largely spared homes among blocks wiped out by the fire. After months of denials, State Farm agreed to pay for lead and asbestos testing because the remediation company cited federal worker safety regulations.",
      "It shouldn't have been that hard, he said.",
      "\"It feels like the insurance companies should have a playbook at this point,\" he said. \"They should have a process to keep people safe because this isn't the first disaster like this.\"",

      "A 10% tariff on all U.S. imports remains in place. China, which accounts for nearly a third of all goods imported into the U.S., faces levies of up to 145% for some items.

      "That said, consumers' overarching goal, particularly after battling years of relentless inflation, is to save money. \"Consumers are very price-sensitive in this environment, so they are going to react very strongly to sales that companies are promoting,\" Shah added.",
      "The pre-tariff sales strategy is already working for some sellers, such as Burlap & Barrel, a spice company that imports single-origin spices from around the world.

      "\"The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and 'trade wars,' ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility,\" he said Friday during the banking giant's first-quarter earnings call.",
      "Dimon told Wall Street analysts that JPMorgan expects tariffs to increase inflation roughly 0.5% this year. But he also expressed confidence that the Trump administration is eager to negotiate trade agreements with other countries, which would ease the strain on the economy.",
      "\"I would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think that will be good for everybody, and they want to do it, too,\" he said.",
      "Dimon, considered the country's most influential banking leader, said earlier this week that U.S. tariffs could lead to higher inflation, weaker economic growth and potentially even a recession.",
      "\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" he said in his annual shareholder letter Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump this week\u00a0paused most country-based tariffs\u00a0for 90 days \u2014 a move that came as CEOs and Wall Street investors publicly pressed the White House to reconsider its trade measures and as financial markets gave a resounding thumb's down to U.S. trade policies.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-hhs-poverty-levels-medicaid-benefits/",
    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:27:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Recent cuts eliminated a small, specialized workforce that sets the poverty standards determining who is eligible for Medicaid as well as assistance with food, home heating, child care, and more.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's firings at the Department of Health and Human Services included the entire office that sets federal poverty guidelines, which determine whether tens of millions of Americans are eligible for health programs such as Medicaid, food assistance, child care, and other services, former staff said.",
      "The small team, with technical data expertise, worked out of HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, or ASPE. Their dismissal mirrored others across HHS, which came without warning and left officials puzzled as to why they were \"RIF'ed\" \u2014 as in \"reduction in force,\" the bureaucratic language used to describe the firings.",
      "\"I suspect they RIF'ed offices that had the word 'data' or 'statistics' in them,\" said one of the laid-off employees, a social scientist whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because the person feared further recrimination. \"It was random, as far as we can tell.\"",
      "Among those fired was Kendall Swenson, who had led development of the poverty guidelines for many years and was considered the repository of knowledge on the issue, according to the social scientist and two academics who have worked with the HHS team.",
      "The sacking of the office could lead to cuts in assistance to low-income families next year unless the Trump administration restores the positions or moves its duties elsewhere, said Robin Ghertner, the fired director of the Division of Data and Technical Analysis, which had overseen the guidelines.",
      "The poverty guidelines are \"needed by many people and programs,\" said Timothy Smeeding, a professor emeritus of economics at the La Follette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin. \"If you're thinking of someone you fired who should be rehired, Swenson would be a no-brainer,\" he added.",
      "Under a 1981 appropriations bill, HHS is required annually to take Census Bureau poverty-line figures, adjust them for inflation, and create guidelines that agencies and states use to determine who is eligible for various types of help.",
      "There's a special sauce for creating the guidelines that includes adjustments and calculations, Ghertner said. Swenson and three other staff members would independently prepare the numbers and quality-check them together before they were issued each January.",
      "Everyone in Ghertner's office was told last week, without warning, that they were being put on administrative leave until June 1, when their employment would officially end, he said.",
      "\"There's literally no one in the government who knows how to calculate the guidelines,\" he said. \"And because we're all locked out of our computers, we can't teach anyone how to calculate them.\"",
      "ASPE had about 140 staff members and now has about 40, according to a former staffer. The HHS shake-up merged the office with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ, whose staff has shrunk from 275 to about 80, according to a former AHRQ official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "HHS has said it laid off about 10,000 employees and that, combined with other moves, including a program to encourage early retirements, its workforce has been reduced by about 20,000. But the agency has not detailed where it made the cuts or identified specific employees it fired.",
      "\"These workers were told they couldn't come into their offices so there's no transfer of knowledge,\" said Wendell Primus, who worked at ASPE during the Bill Clinton administration. \"They had no time to train anyone, transfer data, etc.\"",
      "HHS defended the firings. The department merged AHRQ and ASPE \"as part of Secretary Kennedy's vision to streamline HHS to better serve Americans,\"\u00a0 spokesperson Emily Hilliard said. \"Critical programs within ASPE will continue in this new office\" and \"HHS will continue to comply with statutory requirements,\" she said in a written response to KFF Health News.",
      "After this article published, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon called KFF Health News to say others at HHS could do the work of the RIF'ed data analysis team, which had nine members. \"The idea that this will come to a halt is totally incorrect,\" he said. \"Eighty million people will not be affected.\"",
      "Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has so far declined to testify about the staff reductions before congressional committees that oversee much of his agency. On April 9, a delegation of 10 Democratic members of Congress waited fruitlessly for a meeting in the agency's lobby.",
      "The group was led by House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee ranking member Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), who told reporters afterward that Kennedy must appear before the committee \"and tell us what his plan is for keeping America healthy and for stopping these devastating cuts.\"",
      "Matt VanHyfte, a spokesperson for the Republican committee leadership, said HHS officials would meet with bipartisan committee staff on April 11 to discuss the firings and other policy issues.",
      "ASPE serves as a think tank for the HHS secretary, said Primus, who later was Rep. Nancy Pelosi's senior health policy adviser for 18 years. In addition to the poverty guidelines, the office maps out how much Medicaid money goes to each state and reviews all regulations developed by HHS agencies.",
      "\"These HHS staffing cuts \u2014 20,000 \u2014 obviously they are completely nuts,\" Primus said. \"These were not decisions made by Kennedy or staff at HHS. They are being made at the White House. There's no rhyme or reasons to what they're doing.\"",
      "HHS leaders may be unaware of their legal duty to issue the poverty guidelines, Ghertner said. If each state and federal government agency instead sets guidelines on its own, it could create inequities and lead to lawsuits, he said.",
      "And sticking with the 2025 standard next year could put benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk, Ghertner said. The current poverty level is $15,650 for a single person and $32,150 for a family of four.",
      "\"If you make $30,000 and have three kids, say, and next year you make $31,000 but prices have gone up 7%, suddenly your $31,000 doesn't buy you the same,\" he said, \"but if the guidelines haven't increased, you might be no longer eligible for Medicaid.\"",
      "The 2025 poverty level for a family of five is $37,650.",
      "As of October, about 79 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program, both of which are means-tested and thus depend on the poverty guidelines to determine eligibility.",
      "Eligibility for premium subsidies for insurance plans sold in Affordable Care Act marketplaces is also tied to the official poverty level.",
      "One in eight Americans rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and 40% of newborns and their mothers receive food through the Women, Infants, and Children program, both of which also use the federal poverty level to determine eligibility.",
      "Former employees in the office said they were not disloyal to the president. They knew their jobs required them to follow the administration's objectives. \"We were trying to support the MAHA agenda,\" the social scientist said, referring to Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" rubric. \"Even if it didn't align with our personal worldviews, we wanted to be useful.\"",

    "summary": "A new breed of veterinary clinic is changing how pets \u2014 and their owners \u2014 are treated. \"I'd rather see four pets a day,\" one vet said.",
    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",
      "Drs. Trice and Remnes founded Vetique after witnessing firsthand how corporate consolidation was transforming veterinary medicine \u2014 often for the worse.",
      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At  VEG ER for Pets, this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG ER for Pets represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG ER for Pets focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Glattstein, co-founder and president of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG ER for Pets' most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals, where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Glattstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG ER for Pets has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG ER for Pets is now independently able to do that,\" Glattstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Glattstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

      "China said Friday that it was raising tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, the latest development in the escalating trade war between the two countries. It said the higher tariffs would take effect on Saturday.",
      "\"The U.S.' arbitrary imposition of abnormally high tariffs on China seriously violates international economic and trade rules, disregards the post-World War II global economic order built by the U.S. itself, and violates basic economic laws and common sense,\"\u00a0a statement put out by China's Finance Ministry announcing the tariffs said.",
      "The statement called rising U.S. tariffs \"a joke\" and said it would not respond to future U.S. tariff hikes.",
      "\"If the U.S. continues to impose higher tariffs, it will no longer make economic sense and will become a joke in the history of world economy,\" China's statement said. \"At the current tariff level, there is no market acceptance for U.S. goods exported to China. If the U.S. continues to play the tariff numbers game, China will ignore it. However, if the U.S. insists on continuing to substantially infringe on China's interests, China will resolutely counterattack and fight to the end.\"",
      "President Trump's universal tariffs on China now total 145%, the Associated Press reported. Mr. Trump did not include a 20% tariff tied to the country's role in fentanyl production in his\u00a0announcement of higher tariffs on China earlier this week, the AP said.",
      "China's Finance Ministry also said Friday that it had filed another complaint with the World Trade Organization over U.S. tariffs, the Reuters news agency reported.",

      "\"Recession risk is much, much higher now than it was a couple weeks ago,\" Adam Hetts, global head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson, told Reuters.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday froze \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of countries for 90 days, while hiking levies on Chinese imports. The move followed a five-day plunge in U.S. and global financial markets, with investors sending a clear message to the White House about their concerns over the direction of American trade policy.",
      "Market analysts said Mr. Trump's decision this week to suspend most of the tariffs suggests he is willing to negotiate. But lowering the temperature with Beijing is likely to face obstacles given the escalating trade war between the two countries.",
      "\"The fact that China keeps retaliating in kind suggests that its leadership is less eager to settle,\" analysts with investment advisory firm Capital Economics told investors in a research note on Friday after China's move to up tariffs on the U.S. \"They would probably agree to a symmetrical rollback in exchange for something costless, like starting talks. But we aren't convinced that negotiations toward a more substantive deal would ultimately amount to much, given the deep mutual distrust and wider geopolitical forces pushing the two countries apart.\"",

The swings also hit the bond market despite a better-than-expected report on inflation. U.S. crude oil prices fell more than 3%.",
      "It's been a wild couple of weeks on Wall Street with Mr. Trump's tariff announcements,\u00a0reversals and retaliation from U.S. trading partners. That volatility seems unlikely to change in the coming weeks with the U.S. and China still locked in a tit-for-tat tariff battle and earnings season kicking off on Friday with the latest results from some of the nation's biggest banks.",
      "\"Despite Wednesday's announcements to lower the reciprocal tariff rate for most countries to 10%, the escalation between the U.S. and China could dramatically impact trade between the world's two largest economies,\" said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer for wealth management at UBS, in a research note.",

      "\"Everything is still very volatile, because with Donald Trump, you don't know what to expect,\" said Francis Lun, chief executive of Geo Securities. \"This is really big uncertainty in the market. The threat of recession has not faded.\"",

      "\"I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE,\" Mr. Trump said, saying more than 75 countries are negotiating on trade and not retaliating against his latest increases in tariffs. China was a huge exception, with the president raising tariffs\u00a0 on its products to 145%.",
      "Investors went \"from fear to euphoria,\" Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said in a commentary. On Wednesday, following Mr. Trump's tariff-pause announcement, the S&P 500 surged 9.5%, its third-best day since 1940.

      "CPI report brings good news",

      "\"This month's inflation report showed that CPI dropped across the board in March, which is welcome news for the Federal Reserve, which would like to cut rates if significant damage is done to the economy through increased tariffs, but otherwise would be reluctant to cut rates in the face of an inflation threat,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management.",
      "March \"saw a fairly big cooling in inflation (both headline and core) and this, coupled w/the healthy job adds from last week, point to robust underlying economic fundamentals. The downtick in inflation gives breathing room for the Fed to be more forceful in responding to market turmoil,\" said equity analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, in a report.",
      "From bear investors' perspective, however, \"inflation is still running above the Fed's target and regardless, Mar and Q1 numbers are irrelevant given how much the world has changed. Trump's tariffs are only hitting the economy now, and it will take months before they fully show up in the data,\" Crisafulli added.",
      "In other words, according to most analysts, the situation is still too uncertain to call.",
      "\"It's much too soon to blow the all clear \u2014 both on tariffs or on inflation \u2014 since the tariff damage has only been postponed as of now, and will only be relieved if tariff deals can be struck across the board,\" Zaccarelli said.",
      "\"Inflation still remains a concern because the full impact of tariffs is yet to be felt, however, at least the underlying trends (e.g. non-tariff related inflation) seems benign at this time. We will be keeping a close eye on PPI tomorrow in order to determine whether or not future inflation is already in the pipeline,\" he added.",

      "Inflation eased last month due partly to lower fuel prices, with gasoline tumbling 9.8% on an annual basis, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "Another reason prices fell was sharp drops in travel-related costs, including airfares, which decreased 5.3% just from February to March. Hotel room prices dropped 3.5%.",
      "Economists said those declines in part reflected much slower international demand as the number of tourists visiting the United States has fallen sharply amid Trump's aggressive trade policy.",
      "Visits to the United States from overseas fell nearly 12% last month, according to government data.",
      "What experts say",
      "Easing inflation combined with President Trump's announcement yesterday of a 90-day pause in his reciprocal tariffs should help alleviate some concerns for the Federal Reserve when it meets on May 7 to make its next interest rate decision, said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank.",
      "But because other tariffs orchestrated by Mr. Trump have recently gone into effect \u2014 such as auto tariffs \u2013 inflation nevertheless could pick up later this year, experts say.",
      "Yet March's data is \"backward looking\" and doesn't reflect the trade policy changes orchestrated by the Trump administration, noted Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are still expected to lift inflation later in the year as the impact of the import duties trickle through the economy. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Walmart when they accept shipments of foreign goods, they typically pass off all or some of the tariff cost onto consumers through higher prices.",
      "The president's 90-day pause excludes China, a major exporter to the U.S., which will continue to face tariffs of 125% on its goods. And Mr. Trump's 10% universal duty will also likely to push up prices in the coming months, economists say. The higher import taxes will likely weigh on the economy's growth as well.",
      "What the CPI shows about egg prices",
      "Although consumer prices cooled in March, the CPI data showed egg prices continued to inch higher last month. According to the CPI figures, egg prices increased in March to reach a new record-high of $6.23 despite a drop in wholesale prices and no egg farms having bird flu outbreaks.",
      "More recently, grocers have told CBS News that egg prices are\u00a0showing signs of easing.",
      "Bird flu outbreaks were cited as the major cause of price spikes in January and February after more than 30 million egg-laying chickens were killed to prevent the spread of the disease.",
      "Since the current bird flu outbreak began, more than 168 million birds have been slaughtered, most of them egg-laying chickens. Any time a bird gets sick, the entire flock is killed to help keep bird flu from spreading. That can have an effect on the egg supply because massive egg farms may have millions of birds.",
      "What the CPI means for your money",
      "Despite today's cooler-than-expected CPI numbers, inflationary risks are still a threat to the U.S. economy, especially as some of Mr. Trump's tariffs are still in place while others are merely delayed, experts say.",
      "\"Going forward, the Fed is likely to face a difficult trade-off as tariff-driven price increases start to feed through to the inflation data and activity remains soft,\" Haigh said. \"We expect the Fed's initial reaction to be cautious, but the risks remain that a sharper than expected slowdown in the economy could result in a resumption of the Fed's easing cycle.\"",
      "Three of four economists polled by FactSet expect the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting on May 7. The current federal funds \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 now stands in a range 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That means consumers and businesses are unlikely to see any relief on loan rates in the near term, although economists are penciling in cuts later in the year, with the majority forecasting a reduction at the Fed's June 18 meeting.",

(Bond prices move in inverse relation to their interest rates, or yields.)",
      "Such sudden moves can signal that investors are dumping their bonds. That pushes bond prices lower but boosts yields, which are the returns that bond holders pay to investors.",
      "\"Why is this happening? Fixed-income investors may be starting to worry that the Chinese and other foreigners might start selling their U.S. Treasuries,\" economist Ed Yardeni said in an April 8 research note.",
      "Yardeni, who coined the term \"bond vigilantes\" in the 1980s to describe fixed-income investors who express their disapproval of government policies by dumping Treasuries, added that the bond market was cautioning that \"the Trump administration may be playing with liquid nitro.\"",
      "In another report after Mr. Trump announced the tariff pause, Yardeni noted, \"The Bond Vigilantes have struck again. As far as we can tell, at least with respect to U.S. financial markets, they are the only 1.000 hitters in history.\"",
      "Some Trump administration officials acknowledged that the bond market's hostile reaction to the tariffs influenced the decision to pause the tariffs.",
      "\"[The] bond market was telling us, 'Hey, it is probably time to move,'\" White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett\u00a0said\u00a0on CNBC on Thursday.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump announced his April 2 tariffs, economists raised concerns\u00a0about the potential impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The president claimed the tariffs, which he called \"reciprocal\" because they were aimed at equalizing the trade barriers between the U.S. and its trading partners, would help revive manufacturing to the U.S. and raise revenue for the federal government.",
      "But experts warned that the tariffs, which ranged from a baseline 10% for most nations up to more than 100% for Chinese imports, raised the risks of a recession and would likely reignite inflation. Investors dumped stocks and bonds as they digested the economic risks of Mr. Trump's tariff barrage.",
      "While the stock market plunge hurt millions of Americans' retirement savings, the turmoil in the bond market creates very real pressures on the nation's finances. Because the Treasury Department pays interest to debt holders, any increase in yields puts more financial strain on the nation's coffers.",
      "\"Developments in the last 24 hours suggest we may be headed for serious financial crisis wholly induced by U.S. government tariff policy,\" Harvard University economist and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers\u00a0said\u00a0in an April 9 thread on social media.",
      "He added, \"Long-term interest rates are gapping up, even as the stock market moves sharply downwards. This highly unusual pattern suggests a generalized aversion to U.S. assets in global financial markets.  We are being treated by global financial markets like a problematic emerging market.\"",
      "An expensive problem",
      "Given the size of the Treasury market, the surging bond yields and broader market turmoil could create an expensive problem for the federal government. For Mr. Trump, the timing was especially poor as he pushes Congress to pass an extension of his 2017 tax cuts, which are forecast to cost trillions over the next decade.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. spent more than $1 trillion to service its debt, more than double its roughly $500 billion in 2020, according to Treasury data. That's largely due to higher interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve to battle the post-pandemic surge in inflation.",
      "An increase in bond yields could add to that expense, putting even more pressure on the federal budget.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market selloff, once the bond market began to weaken, too, it was only a matter of time before he folded on his eye-wateringly high tariffs,\" noted economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics in an April 9 research note.",

    "summary": "President Trump's aggressive use of tariffs has fueled concerns about the economy and roiled the stock market.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's barrage of \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world this year has rattled consumers, businesses and investors. Although President Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, he upped import duties on Chinese goods to 125% \u2014 escalating a conflict between the world's two largest economies.",
      "We asked you what questions you had about tariffs and answered some of those in a CBS News 24/7 special. Read on for some answers to your questions below.",
      "Are global tariffs legal, and have U.S. levies on other countries risen or fallen over the years?",
      "CBS MoneyWatch: Tariffs are legal under World Trade Organization rules, although participating countries must comply with certain restrictions and levies are generally capped.",
      "As a result, nations have long had the right to impose multilateral tariffs, although those costs vary widely based on trade agreements, product type and many other factors.",
      "In the 19th century, average U.S. tariff rates on trading partners routinely exceeded 30%. The government sharply reduced those levies after the Great Depression, cutting them to single digits. After resuming power in 2025, President Trump raised the effective U.S. tariff to 22% \u2014 the highest since 1909.",
      "For the Trump administration, are these massive tariffs intended to pressure other nations into more favorable trade deals, or is the goal to push American businesses to invest more in domestic manufacturing? Or both?",
      "Both, correct. These historically large tariffs have several main objectives. In the short term, the tariffs are intended to pressure countries to come to the table to negotiate what Mr. Trump sees as more favorable trade deals.",
      "Over the long term, Trump administration officials say that sharply raising U.S. tariffs will spur both domestic and foreign companies eager to avoid the added costs to expand here at home, creating jobs, reinvigorating manufacturers and boosting economic growth.",
      "President Trump has also long argued that global trade rules, enshrined in entities like the World Trade Organization, disdvantage the U.S. by, for example, permitting countries like China, Germany and Japan to subsidize key industries. He blames those rules for fueling large global trade imbalances that have saddled the U.S. with a large, and growing, trade deficit.",
      "Another goal of tariffs is to generate federal revenue \u2014 funds that Mr. Trump will likely need to offset additional tax cuts he has promised to Americans and to corporations.",
      "Why do some people oppose deploying tariffs against countries that impose tariffs on the U.S.?",
      "Most mainstream economists think the kind of sweeping tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump on nearly all U.S. imports act as a tax on businesses and consumers. Such levies raise the cost of many essential items, leading to higher prices for American households; depress economic growth; and could even trigger a recession.",
      "Under this view, a trade war in which countries jack up tariffs on their economic partners effectively makes them all poorer.",
      "By contrast, trade experts also say that targeted tariffs \u2014 implemented as but one element in a larger industrial strategy \u2014 can help protect critical U.S. industries and workers from unfair foreign competition.",
      "How do these tariffs impact consumers, especially when it comes to prices on everyday items like groceries or housewares?",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers such as Walmart, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass on most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices.",
      "For instance, after Mr. Trump added tariffs to imported washing machines during his first term, the median price of those appliances jumped more than 11%, tacking on about $86 to the cost of a new unit, according to University of Chicago researchers.",
      "While consumers can opt for U.S.-made merchandise, domestic manufacturers also may raise their prices due to tariffs. Sometimes that's due to an increase in the cost of imported goods they need to manufacture their products. But some companies also take the opportunity to hike prices because the newly expensive foreign-made products provide them with more pricing flexibility.",
      "Without Mr. Trump's pause, imported vegetables, fruit and nuts were set to rise by 19% due to the tariffs, according to a recent analysis from the Yale Budget Lab, a public policy think tank. That would have boosted prices for those foods by more than 6%, after adjusting for an expected 0.6% increase in the cost of the same items grown in the U.S.",
      "What's the long-term outlook \u2014 are these tariffs likely to strengthen the U.S. economy or just cause temporary disruption?",
      "Economists say Mr. Trump's tariffs have increased the risk that the U.S. and other nations could tumble into a recession in the next year. Because tariffs raise prices, Americans are expected to cut back on spending \u2014 a potentially major problem given that 70 cents of every $1 in the nation's gross domestic product is based on consumer spending.",
      "For instance, the tariffs could slow GDP growth to 1.4% in 2025, while core inflation could rise to 3.9% this year, according to an April 2 forecast from Oxford Economics. That would represent a significant slowdown from the economy's 2.8% growth rate in 2024.",
      "Other experts say leaving sharply higher U.S. tariffs in place could leave much deeper scars. GDP growth could fall by 0.6 percentage points over the next decade, the Yale Budget Lab estimated.",
      "What is the end goal for the Trump administration's tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has said he believes tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs. By making it more expensive to sell foreign-made goods in the U.S., the president wants to convince American and foreign companies to build factories here.",
      "But he's also highlighted other goals for his tariff barrage, such as convincing other nations to give more favorable trading terms to the U.S.",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a way to raise billions in revenue for the U.S. government, even though economists point out that tariffs are essentially a sales tax which are paid by American consumers.",
      "Does Mr. Trump really think he's going to be able to rebuild manufacturing in America again?",
      "Mr. Trump is adamant that tariffs can revive manufacturing in the U.S., which has been on the decline for at least half a century. Yet economists and other experts aren't so sure.",
      "There are several reasons for their skepticism. For one, building the types of factories and infrastructure to support the manufacturing that is now handled by other nations, such as China and Vietnam, would require years and billions in investment.",
      "The U.S. manufacturing sector has been shrinking for decades, so companies repatriating factories from abroad would struggle to find enough skilled workers, especially in technology and other areas higher up the industrial value chain",
      "And because of the uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, some businesses might not want to commit to such an investment given that the import duties might disappear or be sharply lowered \u2014 as they were today.",
      "What could happen to block the U.S. tariff increases?",
      "Several factors could halt the tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump, according to experts.",
      "First, Congress could introduce a resolution to terminate the emergency declaration used by Mr. Trump to issue the tariffs. Since both the Senate and House are controlled by Republicans, that would require several members of the GOP to join Democrats in voting against Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "But Mr. Trump would likely veto any such measure that reached his desk, which means that two-thirds of both chambers would need to vote in favor of the measure in order to make it veto-proof.",
      "Second, the courts could intervene and rule that Mr. Trump has exceeded his authority. Already, there has been a lawsuit filed by a small business in Florida that argues that Mr. Trump has overstepped by issuing the April 2 tariffs, and that the power should belong to Congress alone.",
      "Third, the violent reaction in financial markets that followed Mr. Trump's latest tariff salvo could persuade him to change course. His move on Wednesday to pause many of the tariffs followed a five-day plunge in stocks that put the S&P 500 on the verge of entering a bear market \u2014 when equities fall at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "That steep decline in stock prices hurts tens of millions of Americans saving for retirement and could lead them to cut their spending, a big drag on economic growth.",

      "Still, the trade war continues between the U.S. and China continues to rage. On Wednesday, China said it is raising its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%, up from its previously announced 34%, after President Trump's import duties on Chinese good\u00a0went into effect\u00a0today at a rate of 104%. The retaliation signals Beijing isn't backing down from Mr. Trump's global trade war.",

      "One argument took place between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro in chief of staff Susie Wiles' office in late March, in the days before Mr. Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs were announced.",
      "The following account is from multiple sources familiar with the meeting. Navarro wanted 25% across-the-board tariffs on all $3 trillion of imported goods. Bessent, who made a career as a Wall Street investor, warned of market turmoil and outlined various scenarios.",
      "Heated words flew.",
      "Navarro sneered: \"You're doing the same thing they did in the first term. Don't pull this. Don't be him.\"",
      "Advisers in the room later told people close to them that they interpreted that to mean don't be like then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin or then-economic adviser Gary Cohn, both former Goldman Sachs executives who served in the first Trump administration and pushed back against hardline tariffs ideas.",
      "Spokespeople for the Treasury Department declined to comment on the spat.",
      "Navarro told CBS News: \"Fake news from malevolent anonymous sources. Scottie and I don't argue. We think things through.\"",
      "In other internal debates before the Rose Garden announcement, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted that certain tariffs could cause global disaster.",
      "Bessent on multiple occasions pushed for a calculated rollout with more targeted tariffs than what Navarro pushed.",
      "Elon Musk, the administration's top government efficiency adviser, was not part of key decision meetings on the tariffs. Musk was careful to not broadcast his strong disdain for certain aspects of the tariff policy except in very small circles, although some of that eventually emerged in criticism of Navarro on social media. Musk also publicly advocated for zero tariffs between the United States and the European Union.",
      "Navarro maintained that there should be no negotiations \u2014 the tariffs should be left in place to generate revenue and to muscle manufacturers into domestic production.",
      "But in the days after the \"Liberation Day\" announcement, financial markets reeled, proving correct some of Trump's advisers' predictions. Trillions of dollars were erased from the major stock indexes and the bond market sent alarming signals. Wall Street investment firms like Goldman Sachs predicted higher odds of recession and some of America's top CEOs publicly expressed their concerns.",
      "In an interview on the morning of April 9, America's top banker, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told Maria Bartiromo that a recession was \"a likely outcome.\"",

      "The same morning, Mr. Trump attempted to reassure investors and executives and posted: \"BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well.\"",
      "By the afternoon, with input from Bessent and Lutnick, Mr. Trump opened a pressure release valve and paused some of the tariffs for 90 days.",
      "\"Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They were getting yippy \u2014 you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid.\"",

      "Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian man involved in protests at Columbia University, was taken into custody by federal agents Monday when he arrived at a citizenship interview in Vermont, his attorneys said in court filings.",
      "Mahdawi's detention comes as the Trump administration fights to deport fellow Columbia activist Mahmoud Khalil.",
      "Mahdawi's legal team told CBS News federal agents informed them the Trump administration detained Mahdawi under an obscure law allowing deportations if the Secretary of State decides someone poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\" The administration cited the same provision to detain Khalil. Mahdawi's lawyers filed a petition in court asking for his release, claiming his detention violated the First Amendment.",
      "\"The Trump administration detained Mohsen Mahdawi in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian,\" his attorney, Luna Droubi, alleged in a statement. \"His detention is an attempt to silence those who speak out against the atrocities in Gaza. It is also unconstitutional.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security referred CBS News' request for comment to the State Department, which did not immediately respond to questions.",
      "Mahdawi's attorney Luna Droubi said in a statement Mahdawi's legal team has \"not received confirmation as to his whereabouts despite numerous attempts to locate him.\" Federal Judge William Sessions temporarily barred the government from removing Mahdawi from Vermont on Monday.",
      "Mahdawi was born in a West Bank refugee camp and has been a U.S. lawful permanent resident for the last decade, according to his lawyers. He completed a philosophy program at Columbia late last year, and was expected to graduate in May before seeking a master's degree from the university this fall.",
      "Khalil and Mahdawi co-founded Columbia's Palestinian Student Union in 2023, Mahdawi's lawyers said in court documents. Khalil later spoke at campus protests over Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, which began after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Mahdawi has drawn attention in the past. Betar USA \u2014 a controversial pro-Israel group that regularly encourages the Trump administration to detain pro-Palestinian protest leaders \u2014 tweeted a video of Mahdawi in January and said he's on the organization's \"deport list.\"",
      "Betar spokesman Daniel Levy told CBS News in a statement the group has \"provided thousands of names of jihadis to the Trump Administration of visitors to America who support Hamas and will continue to.\"",
      "Mahdawi's lawyers say he has backed a \"peaceful political solution\" to the Palestinian conflict. In a 2023 interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" Mahdawi told Bill Whitaker about a campus rally during which an unidentified person yelled an antisemitic statement. Mahdawi said he was \"shocked\" and told the person, \"you don't represent us.\"",
      "Mahdawi is the latest student to face immigration detention. Khalil, who also holds a green card, was detained outside his Columbia-owned apartment last month. The government is seeking his removal from the country, accusing him of supporting Hamas and participating in \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities.\" When asked to provide evidence for Khalil's detention, the government cited a memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that said that Khalil's role in protests on the campus of Columbia University is in conflict with American foreign policy objectives but did not provide any evidence of Khalil declaring support for Hamas.",
      "Tufts University\u00a0student\u00a0Rumeysa Ozturk was detained weeks later, with her attorneys claiming she was targeted for co-authoring an op-ed in the student newspaper.",
      "Khalil and Ozturk are both detained in Louisiana. A federal immigration judge ruled last week the government can move forward with its push to deport Khalil, but he has until later this month to seek relief from deportation. His lawyers have suggested they will appeal, and he's separately suing over his detention. Ozturk is also suing for her release, and her attorneys faced off against the Trump administration in a hearing Monday.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has defended the practice of revoking visas, writing on X after Khalil's arrest, \"We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",

    "summary": "El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele said \"of course I'm not going to do it\" about returning Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man deported to an El Salvadoran prison.",
    "story": [
      "El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele says he won't return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States, after Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters it's \"up to El Salvador\" whether the man mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison returns to the U.S.",
      "Bukele and Bondi made the comments in the Oval Office alongside President Trump, as the two world leaders met. Over the weekend, the Justice Department said in court filings that they're willing to take \"all available steps to remove any domestic obstacles\" to facilitate his return.",
      "\"How can I return him to the United States?\" Bukele asked the press. \"I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course, I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous.\"",
      "Bukele referred to Abrego Garcia as a \"terrorist,\" and said \"I don't have the power to return him to the United States.\"",
      "Bondi, speaking before Bukele, said it's \"up to El Salvador if they want to return him.\" Bondi said that \"first and foremost, he was illegally in our country.\"",
      "\"That's not up to us,\" Bondi said. \"The Supreme Court ruled, President, that if El Salvador wants to return him ... we would facilitate it, meaning provide a plane.\"",
      "But the Supreme Court offered no qualifier of whether El Salvador wants to return Abrego Garcia. The court ruled that a lower court order properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release from El Salvador's custody. The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the release of the man, who lives in\u00a0Maryland, from custody, but ordered additional proceedings before a federal district court.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has ordered the Justice Department to provide daily updates on their efforts to return Abrego Garcia. In Monday's filing, the Justice Department noted Bukele's Oval Office comments. The filing also said that \"DHS does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers insist he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador. The Trump administration acknowledged\u00a0that his deportation to the high-security prison in El Salvador known as CECOT was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "\"It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,\" Michael G. Kozak, a senior State Department official, said in a Friday court filing. \"He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\"",
      "In a statement after the meeting, Abrego Garcia's wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura said \"the Trump and Bukele administrations continue to play political games with his life.\"",
      "The Trump administration sent deportation flights with scores of foreign nationals that they describe as members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs. An\u00a0analysis by \"60 Minutes\" last week showed that 75% of the Venezuelans sent to CECOT in El Salvador had no criminal records. At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. It was unclear if any criminal record existed for the other 3%.",
      "Among those deported was Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his wife and children. He is a native of El Salvador, and his wife is a U.S. citizen.",
      "Mr. Trump also expressed openness to sending U.S. citizens convicted of violent crimes to prisons in El Salvador, saying his administration is studying the laws right now to see if that's possible. Mr. Trump said the U.S. can cooperate with Bukele to rehabilitate criminals for \"less money.\"",
      "\"If it's a homegrown criminal, I have no problem,\" he said. \"We're studying the laws right now, Pam [Bondi] is studying. If we can do that, that's good.\"",
      "Legal scholars say sending U.S. citizens to prisons abroad brings up serious constitutional concerns. In a 1936 case,\u00a0Valentine v. United States, the Supreme Court determined a president cannot extradite a U.S. citizen except by an act of Congress.",
      "Bukele, a tough-on-crime leader, said it was an \"honor to be here\" and \"we're very eager to help\" with stopping crime and terrorism. Bukele told Mr. Trump what he's doing with the border is \"remarkable,\" praising the plunge in crossings at the U.S. southern border. Under Bukele's tenure, El Salvador has seen a dramatic decrease in its crime rate.",
      "In announcing his meeting with Bukele, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post, that their nations \"are working closely together to eradicate terrorist organizations, and build a future of Prosperity.\"",
      "\"President Bukele has graciously accepted into his Nation's custody some of the most violent alien enemies of the World and, in particular, the United States,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"These barbarians are now in the sole custody of El Salvador, a proud and sovereign Nation, and their future is up to President B and his Government. They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!\"",

With the Marine Corps Band's rendition of Queen's \"We Are The Champions\" still blaring in the background, Ohio State running back TreVeyon Henderson, who was standing next to Vance, swiftly recovered the fumble.",
      "Vance later shrugged off the near-turnover, posting on X, \"I didn't want anyone after Ohio State to get the trophy so I decided to break it.\"",
      "The moment came after Vance and President Trump spoke at the celebration, flanked by Ohio State players and coaches. The Buckeyes defeated Notre Dame 34-23 in the title game on Jan. 20 \u2014 the same day as Mr. Trump's inauguration.",
      "In a set of brief remarks, Mr. Trump congratulated the Buckeyes on their victory and praised the state of Ohio more generally: \"We won that state in a landslide.\"",
      "Vance talked up the team, but also took a moment to needle Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. The two agreed to a friendly wager on an Ohio State-University of Texas playoff game earlier this year, with the loser agreeing to wear the winning team's jersey and drop off food and beer from their home state \u2014 a bet Vance claimed Cruz has \"still not paid up on.\"",
      "\"I don't like losing any bet, but I really don't want to lose a bet to Ted Cruz,\" Vance said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Vermont considered Monday whether to release a Tufts University Ph.D. student as she challenges her detention as a violation of her free speech rights.",
      "Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at the Massachusetts university, was detained by immigration authorities last month outside of her apartment because her student visa had been revoked. The Trump administration has said hundreds of students studying at American universities have had their visas taken away or were stopped from reentering the United States after they were accused of publicly expressing support for Palestinians.",
      "Ozturk's attorneys argue that her detention violated her First and Fifth Amendment rights, and are seeking to have her either released on bail or, as an alternative, transferred to Vermont from Louisiana. She is currently detained at a federal immigration facility in Basile, Louisiana.",
      "Jessie Rossman, one of Ozturk's lawyers, told U.S. District Judge William Sessions during a hearing that the \"sole basis\" of Ozturk's arrest was an editorial she co-authored in the Tufts' student newspaper that criticized the school for its handling of several resolutions adopted by the undergraduate student senate in an effort to \"hold Israel accountable for clear violations of international law.\"",
      "Ozturk's attorneys also argued that the government's decision to transport Ozturk across three states \u2014 Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont \u2014 before she was sent to Louisiana was unusual and designed to punish Ozturk for protected speech.",
      "\"This was done to chill her speech and send a clear, chilling message to everyone watching,\" Rossman said, adding that the government knew the public was paying attention. \"If you engage in speech that the administration disagrees with, you will be punished.\"",
      "The Justice Department has argued that federal courts do not have jurisdiction over Ozturk's case under federal immigration law, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement has initiated removal proceedings against her. Michael Drescher, a Justice Department lawyer, said Ozturk must seek release through the immigration courts.",
      "\"Congress has been crystal clear on that,\" he said, adding that she can seek review of an adverse decision from a Board of Immigration Appeals from a federal appeals court.",
      "Sessions and the government engaged in a debate over the scope of habeas jurisdiction \u2014 which allows courts to review the legality of a person's detention \u2014 and discussed whether the court has the authority to consider Ozturk's detention amid ongoing removal proceedings, as well as whether her petition named the proper immigration officials.",
      "The judge suggested that if the court found a constitutional violation but was told it lacked the authority to order her release due to an immigration detention order, it could create a troubling legal conflict.",
      "\"Then we're in a constitutional crisis,\" Sessions warned.",
      "Sessions noted that the case stands at the intersection of immigration law and a detainee's right to challenge the legality of their confinement.",
      "\"The Constitution rubs up against the [Immigration and Nationalities Act] perhaps in some areas but fundamentally, the court's responsibility is to make an assessment about constitutional liberties and if there is a constitutional violation here, certainly that takes precedence,\" he said.",
      "Noor Zafar, a lawyer for Ozturk, argued she is not contesting the executive branch's authority to exercise its discretion to detain people pending their removal from the U.S., but rather the basis for Ozturk's detention.",
      "Zafar said the circumstances surrounding Ozturk's detention are \"extraordinary,\" as immigration authorities made the decision to take her into custody in retaliation for her speech.",
      "The judge did not decide immediately whether to grant the government's request to dismiss Ozturk's habeas petition, or order her returned to Vermont from Louisiana. But he raised the prospect of bringing Ozturk back to Vermont for a bail hearing while he addresses her constitutional challenge to her detention.",
      "Ozturk's lawyers also argued that the existing record is sufficient to make a determination on bail, and said that the government has had multiple opportunities to present evidence against allowing her to be released while her case proceeds, but has failed to do so. Her legal team said that there is no reason to believe the government would present new evidence to counter their case, which would demonstrate that Ozturk has met the necessary bail requirements.",
      "Drescher, in response, referred back to the Immigration and Nationality Act, asserting that the law presents limits for a court to release the petitioner on bail.",
      "\"There is a legitimate question as to whether the INA would permit such a release,\" he argued.",
      "Mahsa Khanbabai, one of Ozturk's attorneys, told CBS Boston on Sunday that it's \"pretty clear, based on the lack of evidence that the government has submitted, that she's done anything that's violated our immigration laws.\"",
      "\"It's essentially just trying to silence and show everyone from speaking out and creating basically this, you know, Soviet-style era of watch your neighbor and report on what your neighbor is doing to us,\" Khanbabi said.",
      "Ozturk's case arose after she was arrested by immigration agents outside of her Somerville, Massachusetts, apartment before attending an iftar dinner. She was transported to Methuen, Massachusetts, and then to Lebanon, New Hampshire, according to court filings. From there, she was brought to an ICE field office in St. Albans, Vermont, and was held there overnight. The following morning, on March 26, Ozturk was taken to the airport in Burlington, Vermont, and flown to Louisiana, where she was transferred to the immigration detention facility in Basile.",
      "During the hearing, Sessions scrutinized the timeline of events from when Ozturk was taken into custody to when she was flown to Louisiana. A federal judge in Massachusetts had issued an order on the night of March 25 \u2014 hours after Ozturk's arrest \u2014 that blocked the government from moving her out of the state.",
      "The judge said the Massachusetts court \"clearly expressed in a judicial order from an Article III judge\" a desire to maintain jurisdiction over Ozturk's case. That order, Sessions said, \"had no impact upon what ultimately happened to\" Ozturk, as she was transferred to Louisiana anyway.",
      "Drescher, the Justice Department lawyer, said Ozturk was already in Vermont when that order was issued, which \"created complications\" of how to interpret and respond to it.",
      "Ozturk's whereabouts emerged as a key question in the challenge to her detention, as the Justice Department has repeatedly sought to have her case transferred to Louisiana because it is where she is detained.",
      "Earlier this month, a Massachusetts judge rejected an earlier effort by the Justice Department to throw out the challenge to Ozturk's detention after she was first taken into custody, but moved the case to Vermont because it is where she was located when her lawyers filed a habeas petition contesting her confinement.",
      "Ozturk's attorney on Monday also referenced a Washington Post report filed with the court, which cited internal memos indicating that the State Department found no evidence linking Ozturk to antisemitic activity or support for terrorism. Those underlying memos have not yet been produced in court. CBS News reached out to the State Department for comment.",
      "In a separate filing last week, Ozturk, 30, detailed how she was detained by ICE. Surveillance footage showed six plainclothes ICE agents who appeared to be wearing masks stopping Ozturk on the street and taking her into custody.",
      "\"I felt very scared and concerned as the men surrounded me and grabbed my phone from me,\" Ozturk said in the statement, writing that the officers told her they were police, and one quickly showed what might have been a gold badge. \"But I didn't think they were the police because I had never seen police approach and take someone away like this,\" she said.",
      "She added that the officers did not tell her why they were arresting her, and that they repeatedly denied her requests to speak to an attorney.",

Republicans stand apart from the public overall in showing that patience.",
      "But in the short term, a big majority of Americans think new tariffs are going to raise prices, and many think that's the case in the long term, too. So, an inflation-weary public is bracing for that to hit their bottom line: a growing number think Trump's policies are making them financially worse off, not better, and most think that tariffs will make the economy worse more immediately, too.",
      "In turn, Trump's ratings for handling inflation and the economy have become more negative.",
      "Either way one lasting impression may be this: in the public mind it is Donald Trump's economy now. A majority say his policies, not Joe Biden's, are responsible for it.",
      "Views about the potential impact on prices are especially important in this context because in recent years inflation has consistently been a top concern for Americans, and it is still a top way people evaluate their finances and the economy.",

      "As does the view on whether or not Trump has a plan, where almost all Republicans say so.",
      "Most Americans don't think the tariffs will stay \u2014 they think Mr. Trump is using them for negotiations and will remove them later. Republicans especially think that \u2014 and it's related to how they view the long-term impact on prices.",
      "Despite many anticipating short-term price increases, Republicans and most independents say judging Trump's trade policies will take at least a few months to evaluate, while Democrats are more ready to evaluate them sooner.",
      "Support for tariffs is also connected to who people think they'll help or hurt. Either way large numbers think the wealthy and corporations will benefit. Those in favor see the middle and working class benefitting too.",
      "Trump's job handling",
      "When Mr. Trump was entering office, a sizable four in 10 Americans thought he'd make them financially better off \u2014 it was a key reason he won the election. That changed in March, with more seeing the impact as worse, and now that worsening view has continued today.",
      "The market was volatile this week while the poll was being conducted, but overall more Americans said Mr. Trump's policies were making the market go down.",
      "In all, the trend is for sliding ratings for Mr. Trump on handling the economy, handling inflation, and overall. (That overall number is down from its high at the start, but still higher than anything he had in his first term.)",
      "Some of the change in Mr. Trump's overall approval has come from independents disapproving more.",
      "As has been the case, Mr. Trump gets better marks for handling immigration than either the economy and inflation.",
      "Impacting the economy",
      "Ultimately, every president's policies put their stamp on the U.S. economy. In political terms, most of the public considers this Donald Trump's economy now: the majority view his policies (not Joe Biden's) as mostly responsible for the way things are today. And combined, three-quarters assign him at least shared impact.",
      "Here's another way Mr. Trump is a central figure in the economy: given a list of reasons why they might think the economy is either good or bad, in either case, sizable numbers give Mr. Trump as a reason. For the large majority who think it's bad, prices and general lack of confidence are top reasons, along with Donald Trump specifically. Those who think the economy is good \u2014 a group that includes a lot of Republicans \u2014 list Mr. Trump, along with general confidence, and the job market.",
      "Polarization also plays a role in a difference between people's assessments now and their outlook. In the last few weeks, their collective outlook has changed a little more.",
      "First, views about their own outlook for the economy got a little worse, with fewer expecting it to hold steady and more expecting a recession.",
      "And a slight majority of Americans \u2014 and slightly more than last month \u2014 said they think the economy is getting worse. That came from Democrats, as most Republicans say it's getting better. (Separately, in a different study, the consumer confidence index slipped in April.)",
      "Meanwhile, current views of the U.S. economy have been majority negative for years and still are. More Republicans are calling it good now, a partisan effect we often see over the years when the White House changes hands. And Republicans say that's in part due to their confidence in general and because of Donald Trump in particular. Those Republicans pushed the overall economy rating up a bit, even as Democrats and independents rated it worse.",
      "Partisan differences on trade \u2014 how the base sees it",
      "We can see more into Mr. Trump's support from the GOP base by where people go for trusted information about the tariffs and their impact: for Republicans, they trust Trump \"a lot\" for that information, far more than they do Wall Street or business leaders in general.",
      "Along with economics and jobs, Republicans also see tariffs and trade as a matter of fairness and patriotism.",
      "And most Republicans don't want Congress involved, even though it's a Republican-controlled Congress. Democrats and independents, who are less supportive of tariffs, likely for pragmatic reasons would call for more congressional involvement to stop them.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer said Sunday that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping \"don't have any plans\" to speak amid an escalating trade war between the two countries.",
      "\"Since April 2, we have this at the leaders level, and at some point, as President Trump has pointed out, we expect that we'll be able to have a conversation with them,\" Greer said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "In what Mr. Trump dubbed \"Liberation Day\" on April 2, the president announced that the U.S. would impose a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on goods imported from all foreign countries, along with higher, \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nations that impose tariffs on U.S. exports. Then, shortly after the tariffs went into effect, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs after U.S. and global financial markets plunged. At the same time, the president said he would increase the tariff rate on goods imported from China to 125%. A 20% fentanyl tariff brings Mr. Trump's universal tariffs on China to a total of 145%.",
      "China said Friday that it would raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125% in response, arguing in a statement that the U.S. imposition of the levies violates international economic and trade rules, while also calling the rising tariffs a \"joke.\"",
      "Despite questions swirling about how the lower the temperature between the two countries, Greer insisted that the president is working to reshore American manufacturing and trade as part of a broader global issue. Greer said \"the only reason we're really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate.\"",
      "\"So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, 'we want to negotiate with the Americans,'\" Greer said. \"And the Chinese made a different decision \u2026 It was a Chinese decision. They have agency here.\"",
      "The trade representative said when asked whether the U.S. is prepared for the possibility that China could sell assets it holds in the United States that the issue is \"we've become so dependent on China\" and haven't had fair market access for decades.",
      "\"We see China taking action, implementing their policy to try to be less tied up with us as well. So it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves,\" Greer said, adding that \"we obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy.\"",
      "When asked what happens after the 90-day pause, and whether the period given enough time to negotiate with 70 countries, Greer said conversations have been underway since before the tariffs were announced, \"because everyone knew tariffs were coming.\"",
      "\"The reality is, we're working around the clock, day and night, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States,\" Greer said.",

      "Our new CBS poll shows President Trump's job approval rating has fallen to 47 percent. That's a three-point drop since President Trump announced his global tariff plan as part of what he called liberation day. That's a drop, but it is still a better approval rating than he ever saw in his first term. We will have more on that in just a few minutes.",
      "The president hiked tariffs on imports from China to 145 percent last week, and Beijing responded with a 125 percent tariff on American goods sold in China. Late Friday, President Trump changed course again, lifting some of those duties off of Chinese-made tech products, including smartphones, chips and computers.",
      "Speaking with reporters last night, the president said more details would be revealed Monday.",

      "Good morning to you, Mr. Ambassador.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER (U.S. Trade Representative): Good morning, Margaret. How are you?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm well.",
      "I'm hoping you can give us some news of movement on this clash. Is the Trump administration opening any kind of channel to Beijing right now? Are there any plans for presidents Trump and Xi to speak?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Right now, we don't have any plans on that. This issue is truly at the leaders level.",
      "Before April 2, I had a conversation with my counterpart, and others did since April 2. We have this at the leaders level. And, at some point, as President Trump has pointed out, we expect that we'll be able to have a conversation with them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China holds about $1.5 trillion in assets in this country. About half of them are U.S. treasuries.",
      "In the past, you've talked \u2013 you've spoken about strategic decoupling from China and acknowledged it would cause some short-term pain. Are you trying to get China to sell some of those assets? Is that part of your goal as well?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's not part of this plan.",
      "President Trump has a global program to try to reshore American manufacturing and address the trade deficit. It's a global issue. The only reason we're really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate. So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, we want to negotiate with the Americans.",
      "And the Chinese made a different decision. So, it's not a plan to do that. It was a Chinese decision. They have agency here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you prepared for China to consider selling assets it holds in the United States? And do you want that to happen?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, remember, China has been selling off treasuries for some time. It's not a \u2013 it's not a brand-new development.",
      "You know, the treasuries market will fluctuate. You know, I'm not the Treasury secretary, so I'm not the best poised to talk about that. But I think the issue is, we've become so dependent on China, and for so many decades, we haven't had fair market access. And so \u2013 so again, we see China taking action, implementing their policy to try to be less tied up with us as well.",
      "So, it's not \u2013 it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves. We obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, last Friday, late in the day, the administration published some exceptions to the tariffs on countries including China with smartphones, computers, electronics and machines that make semiconductor computer chips.",
      "Last Sunday, on this program, the commerce secretary told us the tariffs are part of a strategy to bring high-tech factories to the U.S. Take a listen.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "HOWARD LUTNICK (U.S. Commerce Secretary): The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America. It's going to be automated. And great Americans, the tradecraft of America is going to fix them, is going to work on them.",
      "Our high school-educated Americans, the core to our work force, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But now those high-tech items are given these exceptions. So, is the goal still to move electronics manufacturing to the United States?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: We certainly need to have semiconductors and the downstream electronics supply chain move to the United States.",
      "What happened is \u2013 it's not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it. What happened is, this type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime, where we have studies ongoing for pharmaceuticals, for semiconductors, metals, et cetera.",
      "So, it's not that they won't be subject to tariffs geared at reshoring. They'll just be under a different regime. It's shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But those tariffs aren't in place?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So they are exempt from them.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: That is \u2013 that is subject to study by the Commerce Department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: For now, they're subject to a 20 percent tariff. They're subject to a 20 percent tariff that's on China.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The commerce secretary was on another network this morning, and he said semiconductors are \u2013 quote \u2013 \"exempt from reciprocal tariffs, but that won't be a permanent sort of exemption.\"",
      "Here's what you told my colleague Nikole Killion April 8.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "NIKOLE KILLION: Why aren't there any exemptions with some of these tariffs, sir?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: The president decided that we're not going to have exemptions. We can't have a Swiss cheese solution to this universal problem that we're facing.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I hear you saying the carve-outs are temporary, but isn't that still the Swiss cheese situation you said you were trying to avoid?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I would just disagree with that, Margaret.",
      "We have two different tariff programs. You have the global reciprocal tariff getting at the trade deficit, and you have critical sector national security tariffs, where we \u2013 we have tariffs in place on auto, steel and aluminum, and we have them coming on semiconductors in the supply chain, pharmaceuticals, lumber, copper, et cetera.",
      "They're just different approaches to do it. We have to be much more deliberate about the semiconductor supply chain\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: \u2026 because we don't even import semiconductors, as such, that much, right? They go into downstream products. So, we have to be very careful. And we want the whole supply chain here, not just one product.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president said on Monday he'd be much more specific. Will we see those sectoral tariffs announced?",
      "I mean, he \u2013 he's saying he's already putting big tariffs on pharma. You're telling me that there's going to be an investigation into it. That's something that sounds like it's far in the future. What \u2013 what time frame are we talking about?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, you have \u2013 for the national security tariffs, you have to do an investigation in order to impose the tariffs. That's just legal process. That's \u2013 that's how we do it. That's how it's done for steel, aluminum, autos, et cetera.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you've decided the outcome.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: \u2026. investigations for those.",
      "No, we have not. We have not. That's why they're exempt. That's why they're \u2013 you know, they don't have a tariff covered right now, because you have to go through the investigation to determine the outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Is it\u2026",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: We expect there will have to be some kind of tariff on that, but we have to go through the investigation, figure out what's appropriate. And that \u2013 and that's a Commerce Department function to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "I understand you and the Treasury secretary are going to be meeting on the 17th of \u2013 of the month with Japanese officials to talk about the potential of a trade deal. I have been told you've been looking at some of these non- tariff barrier issues that the United States sees problems with in current \u2013 including their currency.",
      "Are you asking governments to do things like that, not just, you know, to buy into America, but to actually change their own currency and change, like, their central bank policy?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So, our view, Margaret, is that currency manipulation or misalignment, whatever you want to call it, that can have a negative impact on U.S. exporters and unfairly advantage foreign exports into the United States.",
      "In the USMCA and in the Japan-China \u2013 the Japan-U.S. deal from the first Trump term, we had chapters with the parties committing not to do currency manipulation. You know, the Treasury Department has a statute to avoid that. So we certainly are in these kinds of discussions with these countries to see if they're willing to make these types of commitments as well, as have been done in other contexts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a pretty big ask.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, the Japanese agreed to it in the first Trump term.",
      "The Canadians and the Mexicans agreed to it. This is something that periodically has \u2013 has happened over the years. Countries have had to revalue to make sure they aren't giving artificial competition \u2013 you know, artificial competitive advantage to their exports.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: I mean, it's a big ask because we're in a \u2013 we're in a nefarious situation.",
      "We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit that Biden left us with.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: It's the highest in human history. And currency is certainly part of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 but \u2013 but I say it's a big ask because it takes time to negotiate. It could take you longer than 90 days, right?",
      "So, does that mean this 90-day reprieve could continue to be renewed? I mean, do you know what happens at the end of 90 days? Is that the amount of time you have to negotiate deals with the 70 countries the White House says are calling?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, I'm \u2013 I'm considering that we have 90 days. Before April 2, we were already having many talks with other countries, because everyone knew tariffs were coming.",
      "This was \u2013 this was not some secret. Everyone knew. And so we already were in conversations with several countries. You know, it's going to be up to these countries to come to the table, continue coming to the table, and make these kinds of offers.",
      "I mean, the reality is, we're working around the clock day and night, you know, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But 90 days could be a rolling deadline, is what I hear you saying?",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Well, I \u2013 I would not say that. In the president's Cabinet meeting last week, he was asked about this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And he said, well, we'll see.",
      "I mean, my goal is to get meaningful deals before 90 days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: And I think we're going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, the president \u2013 I know you were testifying on \u2013 on the Hill when the president changed the policy on reciprocal tariffs.",
      "He said later to reporters that he didn't have access to lawyers when he made the announcement of the change in policy \u2013 quote \u2013 \"We wrote it up from our hearts. It was written from the heart.\"",
      "He said that a few times. Why doesn't the president have access to trade lawyers when he's announcing policy? These are massive policy shifts. I'm sure there's somebody who could have taken a call.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: So that type of \u2013 that type of discussion had been happening for \u2013 for several days. He's talking about drafting the tweets. He drafted the tweet from his heart.",
      "But that kind of policy, that was always a possibility, and the order was drafted by lawyers to ensure that the president could modify the policy to further the underlying goals of the order.",
      "So \u2013 so lawyer \u2013 you know, trade lawyers like \u2013 like myself and a huge staff that works for me, White House Counsel, et cetera, they've all been involved from day one to give the president the kind of flexibility he needs to address the emergency he's declared that's \u2013 forms the basis for these tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Greer, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be watching what you get done.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI (President, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and we saw soybeans are Minnesota's largest export, something like two billion annually. A lot of those soybeans go to China.",
      "Do you have a sense yet of what the sustained trade war with China would cost farmers in the midsection of the country?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's funny you said that.",
      "I just heard from an ag leader two days ago in Minnesota, who said that, even if there's a 10 percent tariff from China on soybeans, zero Minnesota soybeans will go to China, because it's a competitive global market. It's a commodity. They will have to go someplace else.",
      "And so, in many sectors, whether it's a 10 percent tariff or 50 percent or 100 percent tariff, it has dramatic effect on the trade flows. And so a lot of my folks that I hear from here are quite concerned about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, Bloomberg was already reporting that China was purchasing soybeans from Brazil, so looking to other suppliers, potentially.",
      "I want to ask you more broadly, beyond your state, you said on CNBC this past week, investors may now be saying America is no longer the most attractive place in the world to invest.",
      "What makes you say that?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we have to start at what causes a trade deficit.",
      "It's just economic math that if investors around the world say one country is the best place to invest, the math works out that that country will have a trade deficit. And part of how that shows up for that economy is, interest rates will be lower across the economy because investors are investing and bringing their money into that economy.",
      "So, now, if we're not going to have a trade deficit going forward, then investors must conclude that there are other attractive places to invest too. And as we see yields go up, we're seeing the treasury yields go up. The reason the Fed cares about this is, we have to make sure that it's not inflation that's driving those yields up.",
      "It could be that investors are saying, hey, there are other places we also want to invest, that it won't just be everybody wants to pour money in America. So these are very complicated details to sort out. The Fed's job is to keep inflation under control and not let it get unanchored.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, people typically think of U.S. treasuries as the safe thing to buy in a crisis, because they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.",
      "So when the president says the bond markets got queasy, and that was part of his decision in delaying these reciprocal tariffs, what does that say to you? How do you interpret that the bond market got spooked like it did?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, I think investors in the U.S. and around the world are trying to determine, what is the new normal in America?",
      "You know, I saw an interview on Friday where BlackRock CEO Larry Fink speculated that maybe the 10-year treasury would go to a 5 percent yield. He just offered it as a possibility.",
      "We don't know where that new normal level is going to be, and we at the Fed have no ability, zero ability, to affect that destination. And I think markets are searching for, where are these trade negotiations going to end up? Ultimately, that destination, whether it's a 5 percent treasury or 4 or something else, that's 100 percent determined by trade policy and fiscal policy.",
      "And I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets about what is that new destination, and we're going to have to watch and see. And, at the Fed, our job is to keep inflation under control so that rate isn't even higher.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And just for our audience, when what \u2013 yields going up indicates people are selling treasuries.",
      "And when Larry Fink, who I believe is the world's largest asset manager, spoke, he said something about the Fed might not have the ability to do any real easings. Is that what you \u2013 what concerned you?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's not a concern.",
      "It's just a recognition of the tools that we have. So, we at the Fed, we can manage kind of near-term ups and downs in the economy. But, ultimately, where the economy settles in the long run as a result of all of these renegotiations and these new trade flows and fiscal policy, that new normal is completely out of the Central Bank's control. We cannot affect that.",
      "All we can do is keep inflation expectations anchored and try to manage some of the ups and downs on that journey, but that destination is up to the executive branch and Congress, not the Fed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the tariffs on things like steel and lumber and all the things you use to build a building and a house, those may raise prices.",
      "Shelter already was a big contributor to the inflation rate. If \u2013 what does all this add up to? Do you have any expectations? It certainly sounds like the trajectory is prices going up.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, there's no question that tariffs, by themselves, are inflationary. They push prices up, just as you articulated.",
      "The question is, is it a one-time increase in prices and then prices grow slowly from there, or is it something more sustained and ongoing? And it's the Fed's job to make sure that it's only a one-time adjustment in prices, and nothing longer-term than that.",
      "So that's the part that we have a role to play here, and we're committed to doing so. But you're right. Tariffs push up prices and push down economic activity, and that's a challenging situation, because the Fed simply does not have the tools to undo the economic effects of tariffs and a trade war. We can just keep inflation from getting out of hand.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't meet again until, what, May 7?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: In a few weeks, we meet.",
      "But, yes, obviously, we are continuing to monitor all the economic data. The economy was fundamentally very healthy January, February, March. The job market has been strong. The underlying inflationary dynamics have been coming down, just as we hoped for and we've been trying to engineer.",
      "But, obviously, this is the biggest \u2013 in the last month or so, this is the biggest hit to confidence that I can recall in the 10 years that I have been at the Fed, except for March of 2020, when COVID first hit. So when there's that type of hit to confidence, it can have large effects on the economy.",
      "And we're monitoring that very carefully through the data and through all of our discussions with businesses all around the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the odds of recession are now 50/50. Goldman Sachs says 45 percent chance of recession.",
      "Is the risk that high, in your estimate?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: You know, it's really going to be determined by, is \u2013 are there quick resolutions? To your prior guest, are there quick resolutions to these trade uncertainties with our major trading partners?",
      "The faster those resolutions come, I think the more that confidence can be restored, and, hopefully, those odds can be brought down. But it is a serious situation. If everybody gets nervous at the same time, businesses and consumers, and they all pull back at the same time, that can lead to an economic downturn just by itself, setting aside the math of what the tariffs end up doing to prices.",
      "And so there's a lot to try to unwrap right now, and we're doing our best to try to keep our arms around it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the financial markets look orderly to you at this point?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: They are.",
      "I mean, obviously, the market participants are trying to grasp for, where is this all going to settle? And that's causing volatility as they're \u2013 as they're trying to do these assessments. So that volatility is to be expected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: But markets are functioning. Transactions are happening. And so I anticipate that's going to continue.",

      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: For more on our latest poll on how Americans are reacting to the Trump economic agenda, we're joined now by our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Anthony, President Trump put tariffs at the center of his campaign. Now he's enacting them. Is there support for what he's doing?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Like a lot of the way people look at investments, it depends on what you see as your goals and your time horizon. By which I mean, in the immediate we see three quarters of Americans think that tariffs will raise prices. At least in the short term. And a lot think in the long term, too. Now, they're sensitive to that because, as we've discussed for many years, inflation and prices are top concerns right?",
      "The second thing we see is an increase in the number of people who think that Donald Trump's policies now are making them financially worse off. And it's not just that movement, but it's the setup against expectations. Back at the start of his term a few months ago, a lot of people thought that his policies would make them financially better off. So, that's a big change.",
      "But now let me talk about the time horizon, because this applies to his political base, to Republicans, many of whom say, hold on a second, you can't evaluate this right now. You have to give it six months. You have to give it a year to see how his tariff and trade policies are going to play out.",
      "So, with that, they're much more supportive of tariffs and of his approach. They also think that he is just using this as a negotiating tactic. Most of them think that he's going to ultimately remove those tariffs, maybe when he gets what he wants. And so that's why you still see a lot of Republican support for all of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the White House had said it's not up for negotiation, but then President Trump said there is a negotiation, and that's where there's some of the confusion right now.",
      "But you did indicate the approval rating itself is under pressure. Where is that pressure centered?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, more people say that they like his goals with trade and tariff policies than his approach. And that approach part is weighing on his ratings for handling the economy, which are down, his ratings for handling inflation, tied to what I described about prices, which are also down.",
      "But look, the market, in the public mind, is not the economy. There's a -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not. The stock market isn't.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's a pricing mechanism of the future of the economy.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Exactly. And it is an indicator, especially for people who say they have money, not just in the market, but that their finances are sensitive to what happens in the market. They're much less approving of his approach right now.",
      "But having said that, consider also jobs. The public is mixed on whether Trump's approach is going to lead to more manufacturing jobs. Republicans think it will. But again, that's kind of a long-term issue.",
      "Back to the politics for a second. You know, people often ask, when does a president own the economy? And right now this looks like Donald Trump's economy. A majority of people say it's his policies that are responsible, either way, good or bad, for how it is, not Joe Biden's. And that, of course, sets things up going forward.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to California Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna, who joins us this morning from another state, Ohio.",
      "Good morning to you, Congressman.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA (D-CA): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to what's happening to Silicon Valley in just a moment on the trade and tech front. But, first off, I want to ask you, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, for any insight you might have on one of the announcements made late on Friday. The president authorized the U.S. military to take over a large swath of public land along the southern border, including in the state of California. And I understand that that means the Pentagon's budget can now be used for things like border security or potentially to even detain migrants in that area.",
      "Has Congress been briefed on these plans? Do you have any sense of what's happening?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: We have not. And, Margaret, it's longstanding law that you can't use the military for domestic enforcement. It's a violation of the Constitution. I'm hopeful the Supreme Court would 9-0 rule that way, just like they've ruled that the deportation of Abrego (ph) was unconstitutional. But we have not heard any specifics of it, and it's blatantly against the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You there were talking about Maryland resident Abrego Garcia, who was detained and then sent to a prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court said that the Trump administration actually has to facilitate getting him back, but they didn't actually rule on whether he was a gang member or not. I mean the Justice Department can't substantiate it. But why did you bring up that specific case as proof of something?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, it just shows that this administration is taking actions that are unconstitutional. Look, Vice President Vance said that the - Abrego was an M-13 gang member with no legal rights here. And the Supreme Court said, well, we don't know. And he does actually have legal rights.",
      "And so, similarly, you now have an administration that is using the military for domestic enforcement, which is illegal. And I believe that even this Supreme Court, a conservative Supreme Court, would rule it's unconstitutional.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Garcia, ICE said it was an administrative error that led to this man's arrest in the first place. It seems the Trump administration is saying it's now in the hands of the president of El Salvador, who will be at the White House this week. So, we will watch for developments on that space.",
      "But going back to the line of questioning here regarding Armed Services, we understand that the president sent his envoy, Steve Witkoff, to talk to Iranian officials over this past weekend. We don't know much, other than they're going to meet again. But in the meantime, the U.S. military has positioned as many as six B-2 bombers in the Indian Ocean. That's the kind of aircraft that would carry a weapon that could be used to take out underground facilities for a nuclear program.",
      "Do you believe President Trump would need congressional approval to carry out a strike, even if it was just in support of Israel leading that attack on Iran?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Absolutely. And almost a third of our B-2 bombers are there.",
      "Look, it's unconstitutional what they're doing in Yemen. I said it was unconstitutional when Biden made those strikes. We - they need to come to Congress.",
      "And look, the president was elected by the American people to say, we don't want our tax dollars going for more bombing in the Middle East, for more wars in the Middle East. I think he's ignoring the base that actually elected him that does not want more of these strikes.",
      "In the case of Yemen, the Saudis had war there for almost ten years. And the - it didn't do anything to address the situation with the Houthis. The president campaigned on diplomacy. He hasn't seen that. And what we're seeing is escalation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see what the diplomacy he's attempting achieves in the near term.",
      "But let me ask you why you're out in Ohio talking to us this morning. I understand in the coming days you're also going to go to Connecticut, to Yale Law, on Tuesday. Are you trying to sort of troll Vice President Vance? And, if so, why?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, no. I mean the Cleveland City Club invited me to give a speech on the economy. And let's talk about these tariffs. I mean, they were chaotic and they were totally haphazard. So, you had Howard Lutnick on saying that we were going to bring manufacturing back, electronics manufacturing back to the United States. And they realized suddenly that that wasn't going to happen. Actually, the iPhone price would go up to $1,700 or $2,000. And, by the way, if that manufacturing moved, it would probably move to Malaysia or Vietnam.",
      "So, they suddenly reversed. They exempted all of electronics manufacturing, which is about a third of our trade deficit. And I'm here at the Cleveland City Club to say, if you want to have electronics manufacturing here, the way to do it is not blanket tariffs. You have to create an electronic manufacturing hub, the kind we did with the Chips Act. That means investing in tool engineering and workforce. It means having investment tax credits. It means having government buy things from the United States. The president has no plan of how to actually have high-end advance manufacturing in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the district you represent includes Silicon Valley. So, you must be hearing from some of these CEOs. Who are they lobbying, apparently successfully, to get these carve-outs?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: I think they're talking about sound economic policy. I mean it really would have been - they're talking to anyone they can at the White House. They're talking to anyone they can who has the president's ear. But what they're saying is pretty simple. First they're saying that Howard Lutnick, the screws and the screwing only is about 0.1 percent of an iPhone's cost. I mean you need to - the actual components are memory, are camera, are ram. I mean it's like you - I understand they have 19th century policies of McKinley, but they need to have a 21st century understanding of the economy.",
      "And then they're saying, OK, you really want to do this? The iPhone will cost $1,600 to $1,700 but we're not going to be able to bring it back to the United States. We'll go to India. We'll go to Malaysia. We'll go to Vietnam.",
      "And if you want to bring back the manufacturing to the United States, you have to invest in the workforce, you have to have some investment tax credit for the facilities, and you have to be able to buy the things we make in the United States.",
      "So, all I'm saying is, let's have sound economic policy. And, you know, I saw the poll earlier.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: This is not a hypothetical. This is not something the president will be able to spin. Either we're going to see new factories come, or we're not. And tariffs just aren't going to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we didn't get a clear answer on when these semiconductor tariffs are coming. But the administration argues they're in the pipeline and that, you know, China's not going to get a free pass when it comes to tech. What is that going to mean for your part of the country?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, it's - again, they don't have any sense of when the tariff will come, when it won't come, and they're against the Chips Act. So, how are you going to - let's say you suddenly put tariffs on China. What it would mean is the production would move to other parts of the Asia. It still isn't going to come here unless you're financing those factories here, willing to buy here. Tariffs can be a tool used as a broader Hamiltonian industrial policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: And that's what I'm here in Ohio to talk about, which is, what is actually going to bring advanced manufacturing to this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "All right, Congressman Khanna, we'll be watching.",

      "The measles virus, which was once effectively eradicated here in America thanks to widespread vaccination, is now in two dozen states.",
      "We spoke Friday with Dr. Peter Marks, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine program, who was forced to resign last month as part of Kennedy's redesign of America's health policy. Our conversation began on the subject of the measles outbreak and the response by the Trump administration.",

      "ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (Health and Human Services Secretary): The federal's government's position, my position is, people should get the measles vaccine. But at - if - the - the government should not be mandating those.",
      "LAPOOK: Understand. But the -",
      "KENNEDY: You know, I've always said during my campaign and - and every part that - every public statement I've made, I'm not going to take people's vaccines away from them.",
      "LAPOOK: Right.",
      "KENNEDY: What I'm going to do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a sufficient endorsement?",
      "PETER MARKS (M.D., Former Director, FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research): As a public health professional, I'm going to tell you what an endorsement of the measles vaccine sounds like right now. If you can hear my voice right now and you have a child that is unvaccinated against measles, we have measles spreading it this country very significantly. You wouldn't put your child in a back seat of a car without being strapped into their car seat. You want to get your child vaccinated against measles so that they don't have a one in a thousand chance of dying from measles if they contract it. There is no reason to put your child at that risk because the vaccine does not cause death. It does not cause encephalitis. And it does not cause autism. So, that's what an endorsement sounds like. Just make the comparison.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That has to be extremely frustrating for you as someone who worked in the vaccine space for so long. You clearly feel that this is safe and effective and that not saying it clearly is endangering people. And I understand the frustration.",
      "PETER MARKS: Right. So, another way of - yes, no, exactly. Exactly. And - but - there's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks that to not use it is the equivalent of, again, throwing - I mean if you saw a child - if you saw a 15-month-old rolling around in the back seat of a car, you'd probably call child protective services.",
      "Now, I'm not saying we should have - we should order parents to do this because I don't want to get into the whole issue of mandates. But we should have a moral responsibility to protect our children against something that could potentially be life-threatening, particularly when it's spreading across the United States the way it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said there are people like you who can't speak freely. You can speak freely because you're no longer at the FDA?",
      "PETER MARKS: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying your former colleagues can't directly answer a question, they can't honestly answer a question and endorse a vaccine right now?",
      "PETER MARKS: I think it's challenging in this environment for some of them, but you'd have to ask them directly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "In your resignation letter you wrote of the measles outbreak, and what happens when confidence in science is undermined. You said it's clear truth and transparency are not desired by the secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.",
      "Did you ever speak to him about your concerns?",
      "PETER MARKS: So, just a matter of record, I never interacted with the secretary. I don't - I don't intend to engage on, you know, disputing any of that. If the administration can have me come and go, that's fine. The more important thing here is that we deal with the issue at hand, which is vaccine confidence is really important for this country and it's been undermined over and over again over the past years. And now we're seeing the result of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are saying here that the man running HHS doesn't take in information, wishes subservient confirmation of misinformation and lies. There's presumed outcomes, is what you're saying?",
      "PETER MARKS: I think that my words then spoke for itself. I don't need to belabor it here.",
      "You know, science is the pursuit of objective truth for the benefit of mankind. And those of us who believe in it, we - we take it very seriously. And it hurts us deeply when there are those who would undercut the name of science, undercut the very name of science because it's convenient for them to purvey lies.",
      "And that's just - it's not OK because at the end of the day I was so strongly affected by what happened last week with the death of a second child, that I actually - I actually used profanity with a reporter without - while - while I was on the record without realizing it, which is something I've never done. I really - I don't believe that we should be saying, well, these are people who believe that they shouldn't be vaccinated because my experience -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're from the Mennonite community.",
      "PETER MARKS: The Mennonite community.",
      "My experience is that if you meet people on their level, they generally will eventually come around.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Many parents probably know ASD diagnosis rates are on the increase in this country. The CDC says the current numbers are one in 36 American children. This is a huge - a very broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. There is no established cause.",
      "On Thursday, the HHS secretary, Kennedy, said he's got hundreds of scientists from around the world working on it, and he promised this.",
      "KENNEDY: By September we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be - we'll be able to eliminate those exposures.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That gives tremendous hope to a lot of people. Do you know anything about that ongoing research?",
      "PETER MARKS: I know a minimal amount of effort that's being - going on to try to relook at prior autism research. But I am not aware of what is being discussed there.",
      "I cared for leukemia patients for a significant number of years. Giving people false hope is something you should never do. It is absolutely - you could be incredibly supportive of people. But giving them false hope is wrong.",
      "If you just ask me, as a scientist, is it possible to get the answer to quickly? I don't see any possible way.",
      "And, remember, you're talking to the person who came up with Operation Warp Speed for vaccines. Autism is an incredibly complicated issue. So, we have the issue of diagnosis bias. We don't know how many of those cases are true, how much of this is true growth of autism, how much of this is just that we now have diagnostic criteria and we diagnose it more often.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president of the United States said, something artificial is causing autism rates to go up. On Thursday he said, maybe you stop taking something. You stop eating something. Or maybe it's a shot. But something's causing it. Right after that, RFK appeared at - the HHS secretary appeared on Fox News and dismissed 14 studies that have shown no link between autism and vaccines. He said it is an epidemic.",
      "KENNEDY: Epidemics are not caused by genes. Genes can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin. So, we know that it is an environmental toxin that is causing this cataclysm. And we are going to identify it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there scientific evidence ruling out genetics as a cause of ASD?",
      "PETER MARKS: There is no - there's no scientific evidence ruling out genetics. In fact, there is data that had been published that say that genetics may contribute to autism. There are, obviously, data that can - that suggest that perhaps environmental factors may. But one has to be incredibly careful, incredibly careful about making associations between environmental factors and autism.",
      "There is a wonderful graphic that shows that Coca-Cola increase goes along with the increase in autism, but there's also a wonderful graphic that you can find online that shows that the increase in spending on organic food also goes along with the rise in autism false causality. Scientists do not want to find false causality. We want to find true causality.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It stood out to us that Secretary Kennedy has hired someone named David Geier to conduct analysis of the links between autism and vaccines. He was charged by the state of Maryland in 2011 with practicing medicine without a license. That was weeks after his father's medical license was suspended for putting autistic children at risk by giving them a hormone blocking agent.",
      "So, what should the public know or expect from the work that he will do for the U.S. government?",
      "PETER MARKS: So, all I can say is, I would not - he's - to the best of my knowledge, he's not had any training after college in any of the sciences that we value here.",

    "summary": "Dr. Peter Marks said that the deaths of unvaccinated children is \"just not acceptable.\"",
    "story": [
      "The former top vaccines official at the Food and Drug Administration criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for downplaying the deaths of unvaccinated children from measles, amid this year's record outbreak of the virus.",
      "\"To dismiss children's deaths due to infectious diseases that are preventable by vaccines as just expected or not a big deal, that's just not acceptable to me,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, in an interview airing Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Weekly measles cases have climbed to the highest levels seen in the U.S. since a 2019 wave of the virus, which had been the worst in decades. Three deaths have been linked to this year's measles outbreak, including two unvaccinated children in Texas.",
      "\"We've had three measles deaths in this country over 20 years, and we're trying to refocus the press to get them to pay attention to the chronic disease epidemic,\" Kennedy said Thursday at a White House Cabinet meeting.",
      "Kennedy also contrasted U.S. measles case numbers to Europe, where thousands more infections and dozens of deaths have been reported in recent months. Kennedy has also used the comparison as evidence that his response to the outbreak was a success.",
      "Marks criticized Kennedy's comparison, noting that Europe's figures \"includes Romania, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, other places that have less robust public health efforts than we do.\" He also said that \"even a single death in this country from measles, it's just\u2014 it's just not excusable.\"",
      "\"That's just not the right thing to do. We should be comparing our measles response now to what we accomplished during the first two decades of the 20th century, until the 2019 measles outbreak, which is, we shouldn't be having any deaths from measles,\" said Marks.",
      "Changes at the FDA",
      "Before he was ousted by Kennedy's aides, Marks was the director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which regulates vaccines and other medical products derived from living sources. He was also the architect of the Operation Warp Speed effort to speed the development of COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic.",
      "He warned that it is now \"challenging in this environment\" for some of his former colleagues in the federal government to endorse vaccines.",
      "\"There's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks,\" Marks said.",
      "Days after Marks submitted his resignation letter, Kennedy implemented steep layoffs and forced resignations across the FDA, as part of a sweeping restructuring of the nation's health agencies.",
      "The cuts have forced federal health officials to confront difficult decisions, including over how to prioritize fewer food and drug safety inspections. Marks praised the remaining staff at the agency as \"heroes in public health\" who are \"struggling because there's a lot to be done.\"",
      "\"They keep tabs on the infections. They make sure that the vaccines that are coming in for approvals might work their way through. They make sure that outbreaks are investigated. Those people are continuing to do their job the best they possibly can,\" Marks said.",
      "Marks said the delay to an approval decision on Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, which was expected to be greenlighted earlier this month by the FDA, was concerning. And he warned that his own ouster could signal a change to the agency's approach to vaccines.",
      "\"Why would you de-emphasize something that is so basic to public health,\" Marks said.",
      "\"Does a disservice to pseudoscience\"",
      "Marks said he never interacted directly with Kennedy as secretary. He also said he did not know much about the administration's efforts to reopen research into the repeatedly debunked theory that vaccines cause autism, amid broader plans to determine the cause of autism.",
      "Asked about Kennedy's claim that \"we know it is an environmental toxin\" causing autism, Marks said it was \"very rare for scientists to speak in absolutes.\" Kennedy has been criticized for years for claiming that vaccines cause autism, among a range of unfounded claims he has espoused about the danger posed by immunizations.",
      "\"Most things are not that black and white, and we don't speak in absolutes. Whereas pseudoscientists find it very easy to speak in absolutes because they're not actually looking to use science for the benefit of mankind, they're usually using science for their own benefit,\" he said.",
      "Marks said he was familiar with the past work of Dr. Mark Geier and his son, David Geier, who The Washington Post reported has been tasked by Kennedy this year to revisit a past Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study on vaccines and autism.",
      "\"They have a firm and fixed notion that vaccines cause autism. So it's very hard for me to see how we're going to get to any other idea than vaccines cause autism,\" Marks said.",
      "Describing the work by Geier and his father as pseudoscience \"does a disservice to pseudoscience,\" Marks said.",
      "David Geier was fined by Maryland regulators for practicing medicine without a license, including for prescribing the drug Lupron to autistic children. Lupron is also used as a chemical castration drug for sex offenders.",
      "\"I don't know. I can't even conceive as a physician of how he thought that could be a good idea,\" said Marks.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 13, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to California Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna, who joins us this morning from another state, Ohio. Good morning to you, Congressman.",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to what's happening to Silicon Valley in just a moment on the trade and tech front. But first off, I want to ask you, since you sit on the Armed Services Committee, for any insight you might have on one of the announcements made late on Friday, the President authorized the US military to take over a large swath of public land along the southern border, including in the state of California. And I understand that that means the Pentagon's budget can now be used for things like border security or potentially to even detain migrants in that area. Has Congress been briefed on these plans? Do you have any sense of what's happening?",
      "REP. KHANNA: We have not. And Margaret, it's longstanding law that you can't use the military for domestic enforcement. It's a violation of the Constitution. I'm hopeful the Supreme Court would nine to zero rule that way, just like they've ruled that the deportation of Abrego was unconstitutional, but we have not heard any specific- specifics of it, and it's blatantly against the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You, there, were talking about Maryland resident Abrego Garcia, who was detained and then sent to a prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court said that the Trump administration actually has to facilitate getting him back, but they didn't actually rule on whether he was a gang member or not. The Justice Department can't substantiate it. But why did you bring up that specific case as proof of something?",
      "REP. KHANNA: Well, it just shows that this administration is taking actions that are unconstitutional. Look, Vice President Vance said that the- Abrego was an M-13 gang member with no legal rights here, and the Supreme Court said, well, we don't know, and he does actually have legal rights. And so similarly, you now have an administration that is using the military for domestic enforcement, which is illegal. And I believe that even this Supreme Court, a conservative Supreme Court, would rule it's unconstitutional.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Garcia, ICE said it was an administrative error that led to this man's arrest in the first place. It seems the Trump administration is saying it's now in the hands of the President of El Salvador, who will be at the White House this week. So we will watch for developments on that space. But going back to the line of questioning here regarding armed services, we understand that the President sent his envoy, Steve Witkoff, to talk to Iranian officials over this past weekend. We don't know much other than they're going to meet again, but in the meantime, the US military has positioned as many as six B-2 bombers in the Indian Ocean. That's the kind of aircraft that would carry a weapon that could be used to take out underground facilities for a nuclear program. Do you believe President Trump would need congressional approval to carry out a strike, even if it was just in support of Iran- Israel leading that attack on Iran?",
      "REP. KHANNA: Absolutely, and almost a third of our B-2 bombers are there. Look, it's unconstitutional what they're doing in Yemen. I said it was unconstitutional when Biden made those strikes. We- they need to come to Congress. And look, the President was elected by the American people saying we don't want our tax dollars going for more bombing in the Middle East, for more wars in the Middle East. I think he's ignoring the base that actually elected him, that does not want more of these strikes with- in the case of Yemen, the Saudis had war there for almost 10 years, and though it didn't do anything to address the situation with the Houthis. The President campaigned on diplomacy. He hasn't done that, and what we're seeing is escalation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see what the diplomacy he's attempting achieves in the near term. But let me ask you, why you're out in Ohio talking to us this morning? I understand in the coming days, you're also going to go to Connecticut to Yale Law on Tuesday. Are you trying to, sort of, troll vice president Vance? And if so, why?",
      "REP. KHANNA: Well, no, I mean, Cleveland City Club invited me to give a speech on the economy and- let's talk about these tariffs. I mean, they were chaotic, and they were totally haphazard. So you had Howard Lutnick on, saying that we were going to bring manufacturing back and- electronics manufacturing back to the United States, and they realized suddenly that that wasn't going to happen. Actually, the iPhone price would go up to 1700 or 2000 dollars. And by the way, if that manufacturing moved, it would probably move to Malaysia or Vietnam. So they suddenly reverse. They exempt all of electronics manufacturing, which is about a third of our trade deficit. And I'm here at the Cleveland City Club to say, if you want to have electronics manufacturing here, the way to do it is not blanket tariffs. You have to create an electronic manufacturing hub, the kind we did with the CHIPS Act. That means investing in tool engineering and workforce. It means having investment tax credits. It means having government buy things from the United States. The President has no plan of how to actually have high end advanced manufacturing in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the district you represent includes Silicon Valley. So you must be hearing from some of these CEOs. Who are they lobbying- apparently successfully, to get these carve outs.",
      "REP. KHANNA: I think they're talking about sound economic policy. I mean, it really would have been- they're talking to anyone they can at the White House. They're talking to anyone they can who has the President's ear. But what they're saying is pretty simple. First, they're saying that Howard Lutnick the screws and the screwing only is about 0.1% of an iPhone's cost. I mean, you need to- the actual components or memory or camera or RAM. I mean, it's like, I understand they have 19th century policies of McKinley, but they need to have a 21st century understanding of the economy. And then they're saying, okay, you really want to do this. The iPhone will cost 16 to 1,700 dollars but we're not going to be able to bring it back to the United States. We'll go to India, we'll go to Malaysia, we'll go to Vietnam. And if you want to bring back the manufacturing to the United States, you have to invest in the workforce, you have to have some investment tax credit for the facilities, and you have to be able to buy the things we make in the United States. So all I'm saying is, let's have sound economic policy. And I saw the poll earlier. This is not a hypothetical. This is not something the President will be able to spin. Either we're going to see new factories come or we're not, and tariffs just aren't going to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we didn't get a clear answer on when the semiconductor tariffs are coming, but the administration argues they're in the pipeline, and that, you know, China is not going to get a free pass when it comes to tech. What is that going to mean for your part of the country?",
      "REP. KHANNA: Well, it's- again, they don't have any sense of when the tariff will come, when it won't come, and they're against the CHIPS Act. So how are you going to- let's say you suddenly put tariffs on China. What it would mean is the production would move to other parts of Asia. It still isn't going to come here, unless you're financing those factories here, willing to buy here. Tariffs can be a tool used as a broader Hamiltonian industrial policy, and that's what I'm here in Ohio to talk about, which is what is actually going to bring advanced manufacturing to this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Alright, Congressman Khanna, we'll be watching. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Dr. Peter Marks, former head of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, a portion of which aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 13, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined by Dr. Peter Marks, who recently resigned as the FDA's top vaccine regulator. Welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "DR. PETER MARKS: Thanks so much for having me today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about a number of things, but let's talk about one of the most immediate problems, and that is this measles outbreak. The CDC has now recommended additional measles shots for people traveling within the U.S., specifically to the states of Kansas and Texas due to record outbreaks. The guidance wasn't on the website, but it was told to local authorities, what do you make of that public health guidance?",
      "DR. MARKS: What I make of that is that we have enough spread of measles and some uncertainty in people's vaccination status that they're trying to make sure that people are as protected as they can be. Some people who were vaccinated, for instance, for a period in the early 60s, they may not be fully vaccinated in the extent that the vaccine was not as good back then. So sometimes we ask them to get revaccinated and additionally, some people don't know their vaccination status. So better to be safe than to put yourself at risk, because it is a very- it's one of the safer vaccines that we have. In fact, it is possibly characterized as among the safest vaccines that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The MMR vaccine.",
      "DR. MARKS: The MMR vaccine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you just said something interesting. You said the- the composition of the shot was different years ago, the quality of it?",
      "DR. MARKS: It- it was- right, well, it was the quality of the shot that was being given, the potency, that's the strength of it. For a period of time for a few years in the early 60s was such that there are generally people in the period between about 1957 and 1967 if they got vaccinated against measles, they may want to ask their doctor if they should be revaccinated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I focus in on that, because the HHS Secretary said that the measles vaccine quote \"wanes,\" that was the word he used in effectiveness 4.5 percent each year, and that older people are essentially unvaccinated and unprotected. That's slightly different from what you're saying. Is what he characterized correct, because it does sound like you're saying older Americans might want to look into this.",
      "DR. MARKS: Older Americans- so first of all, if you were born before 1957 it's unlikely that you have to worry about this, because you almost certainly had the measles like I did. I wasn't born before 1957 but I had the measles just the same, okay. But if you were born before 1957 we don't worry about measles vaccination because it's assumed that people had the measles, and natural measles infection gives one pretty robust lifetime immunity. There's a period between 1957, 1967 some people say 1963, but to be generous we'll say 1967, when if you got the measles vaccine, you might want to check with your doctor. And then, since that time, though, the newer version of the measles vaccine, as long as you've had two doses of that vaccine, it's generally considered to provide lifetime protection, and we don't generally see people later in life getting measles. I mean, it's true, there are people who have immunocompromising conditions that may need to be revaccinated later in life. But in general, if you've had two doses of the measles vaccine, one doesn't need to get revaccinated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two doses, it's not wearing off is what you're saying.",
      "DR. MARKS: It's- well\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not waning?",
      "DR. MARKS: It's- it's not- so let's- let's be clear, many vaccines, the protection wanes over time, but there's a threshold effect, and as long as you're above that threshold in terms of protection, you're safe. And so by and large, when people have had two doses of the existing MMR vaccine that's used in the United States, they maintain, for all intents and purposes, lifetime immunity against measles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Kennedy spoke to my colleague, Dr. Jon LaPook earlier this week, following the death of a second unvaccinated child in Texas due to measles. Kennedy reiterated people should get the MMR vaccine. Take a listen.",
      "(TAKE VIDEO)",
      "DR. JON LAPOOK: What's the position philosophically of the federal government in terms of public health?",
      "HHS SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: The federal Government's position, my position is, people should get the measles vaccine, but if- the government should not be mandating those\u2013",
      "DR. JON LAPOOK: Understand, but the\u2013",
      "HHS SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: \u2013 I always said during my campaign and in every part, every public statement I've made: I'm not gonna take people's vaccines away from them. What I'm gonna do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.",
      "(END VIDEO)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a sufficient endorsement?",
      "DR. MARKS: So I'm not going to comment to that, but I'm going to tell you as a public health professional. I'm going to tell you what an endorsement of the measles vaccine sounds like right now. If you can hear my voice right now, and you have a child that is unvaccinated against measles, we have measles spreading in this country very significantly. You wouldn't put your child in a back seat of a car without being strapped into their car seat. You want to get your child vaccinated against measles so that they don't have a one in a thousand chance of dying from measles if they contract it. There's no reason to put your child at that risk, because the vaccine does not cause death, it does not cause encephalitis and it does not cause autism. So a vaccine that is safe, yes, occasionally kids get fevers. If you don't keep the fevers down, about 15 in 100,000 will get a convulsion that happens once it goes away. But if you take their temperatures, keep it down, that's unlikely. And the other four or five side effects per 100,000 are ones that come and go. So, very safe vaccine that is going to potentially protect your child and save its life. And there's just- the issue here is we should love our children enough that if you care about your child, just like you'd strap them in that car seat, you're going to get them vaccinated with two doses of the measles vaccine. They will be well protected against this. Once you've had two doses of the measles vaccine, it's virtually unheard of that a child dies of measles. Three or four percent may get the measles, but it's not a life threatening illness, so it's really important to get vaccinated. Get your child vaccinated if you need to, you have questions, ask your pediatrician, ask your health care provider. If you have religious objections or issues, go to your clergy member, because most major religions actually understand how important vaccination is, and they will go ahead and tell you that it's okay to get vaccinated. So that's what an endorsement sounds like. Just make the comparison.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That has to be extremely frustrating for you. As someone who worked in the vaccine space for so long, you clearly feel that this is safe and effective, and that not saying it clearly is endangering people",
      "DR. MARKS: Yeah",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Am I understanding--",
      "DR. MARKS: So another way. Yes, No, exactly--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your frustration?",
      "DR. MARKS: Exactly. But there's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks that to not use it is the equivalent of, again, throwing- I mean, if you saw a child, if you saw a 15-month-old rolling around in the backseat of a car, you'd probably call Child Protective Services. Now, I'm not saying we should have, we should order parents to do this, because I don't want to get into the whole issue of mandates, but we should have a moral responsibility to protect our children against something that could potentially be life threatening, particularly when it's spreading across the United States the way it is. Just this week, we now have additional states that have been declared as outbreak states. That means they have at least three cases of measles in them. There are now seven states, the epicenter being obviously Texas, but now Indiana has an outbreak. Ohio has an outbreak. So you can see these are places that are very concerning, particularly because Ohio, Pennsylvania, these are states that have Amish populations, that typically have vaccination rates that are can be as low as in the low 20% range.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said there are people like you who can't speak freely. You can speak freely because you're no longer at the FDA.",
      "DR. MARKS: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying your former colleagues can't directly answer a question. They can't honestly answer a question and endorse a vaccine, right now?",
      "DR. MARKS: I think it's challenging in this environment for some of them, but you'd have to ask them directly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, in your resignation letter, you wrote of the measles outbreak, and what happens when confidence in science is undermined. You said it's clear truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies. Did you ever speak to him about your concerns?",
      "DR. MARKS: So just a matter of record, I never interacted with the secretary. I don't, I don't intend to engage on, you know, disputing any of that.its administration can have me come and go. That's fine. The more important thing here is that we deal with the issue at hand, which is vaccine confidence is really important for this country, and it's been undermined over and over again over the past years, and now we're seeing the result of this. By the way, it's not just measles. We had two deaths in Louisiana from whooping cough, which is caused by pertussis. Again, these are deaths that in under vaccinated or unvaccinated populations, we don't need to be seeing. And I don't buy the idea that we need to take a break from infectious diseases to deal with chronic diseases. We can do both. We are a great nation, and we should be able to do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is the current stated policy of the secretary. What you just said, looking more at chronic.",
      "DR. MARKS: You'll have to say whether it is or not. I can just tell you that, from my perspective, I think we have a broad enough public health enterprise to do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what you seem to be saying there, and I think it gets to the core of what scientists do is you're dealing in fact, and you are constantly questioning the evolution of the science and adjusting conclusions you need to be able to take in information. You are saying here that the man running HHS doesn't take in information, wishes subservient confirmation of misinformation and lies. There's presumed outcomes, is what you're saying.",
      "DR. MARKS: I think that my words then spoke for itself. I don't need to belabor it here. You know, science is the pursuit of objective truth for the benefit of mankind and those of us who believe in it, we we take it very seriously, and it hurts us deeply when there are those who would undercut the name of science, undercut the very name of science, because It's convenient for them to purvey lies. And that's just, it's not okay, because at the end of the day, I was so strongly affected by what happened last week with the death of a second child that I actually, actually used profanity with a reporter without while I was on the record without realizing it, which is something I've never done. I just- people who know me know that just I try to avoid it, and it just showed me how badly I was affected. Because even one death, even a single death in this country from measles, it's just it's not excusable. It's not, and a second death. And I really, I don't believe that we should be saying, well, these are people who believe that they shouldn't be vaccinated. Because my experience--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The Mennonite community.",
      "DR. MARKS: The Mennonite community. My experience is that if you meet people on their level, they generally will eventually come around. Because in generally, in every religious community, you eventually find someone who understands that part of that religious belief is that you don't harm those who can't help themselves. We are as adults, can take care of our children. And I think I don't have any problem of working on the faith level with people and telling them, look, you know, if you- let me try to answer all your medical questions, and if you're still left with faith issues that you know that you feel like God will provide for your child. Well, guess what, God provided me. I know about science. Science has provided us with these vaccines that can save your child's life. God helps those who help themselves. So we have to, we have to communicate better. I'm not- I'm the first to acknowledge that over the course of the past years, particularly during the COVID 19 pandemic, we could have communicated better as scientists. So you're not going to get any arguments with- from me on that. But right now, with this crisis, there is no reason why we should not as a country be making a full court press to get our measles vaccination rates above 90%, because otherwise we're not going to get this under control. And for those who can't, for those who really don't care about little babies dying or children dying, I'll tell you what will happen too, once we lose measles elimination status, we will then be forced, potentially, when we go overseas, to places in Europe which have achieved elimination status, we'll have to show little yellow cards showing that we have either immunity or been vaccinated against measles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Those little vaccination passports\u2013",
      "DR. MARKS: Right, those little passports yeah. Now, but, but, I mean, I'm, I'm embarrassed to even use that as a reason, because I couldn't care less. What I really care about is the fact that along the way of getting there, we will have more deaths.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I appreciate everything you're laying out there. I want to talk to you about some of what happened during COVID as well, but to follow up on- particularly the MMR vaccine. You know where I'm going next, the allegations of that specific vaccine and links to autism. Many parents probably know ASD diagnosis rates are on the increase in this country. The CDC says the current numbers are one in 36 American children. This is a huge- very broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. There's no established cause, but yesterday- on Thursday, the HHS Secretary, Kennedy, said he's got hundreds of scientists from around the world working on it, and he promised this.",
      "(TAKE VIDEO)",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That gives tremendous hope to a lot of people. Do you know anything about that ongoing research?",
      "DR. MARKS: I know a minimal amount of effort that's being going on to try to relook at prior autism research, but I'm not aware of what is being discussed there. And I would just say the following- so I'm somebody who in my career as a physician taking care of patients- and there are people probably who are hearing me now who know that I cared for leukemia patients for a significant number of years. Giving people false hope is something you should never do. It is absolutely- you can be incredibly supportive of people, but giving them false hope is wrong--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Can you--",
      "DR. MARKS: Unless someone- unless somebody actually knows the answer or has a pretty good idea of the answer right now, or thinks they have a good idea of the answer, I don't see how one could have- as a scientist, I'm not speaking about anything. If you just ask me, as a scientist, is it possible to get the answer that quickly? I don't see any possible way. And remember, you're talking to the person who came up with Operation Warp Speed for vaccines. Autism is an incredibly complicated issue, so we have the issue of diagnosis bias. We don't know how many of those cases are true- how much of this is true growth of autism, how much of this is just that we now have diagnostic criteria and we diagnose it more often.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying- just to be clear here, because you hear Secretary Kennedy often compare rates now to when he was a child. What you are saying is that the broad array of things under that ASD umbrella has only widened, so it was a much narrower category than what it is now.",
      "DR. MARKS: Right. And I'm not denying that there could be environmental- and we know there are probably genetic features, there have been publications in scientific journals. There are genetic and environmental possibilities here, but the totality of all these interactions and sorting out this incredible complexity, to try to do that in six months time- my calculation of how many months it is till September, I don't- you can help do that, but six months time--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unless you're buying research from somebody else who's already in the midst of it?",
      "DR. MARKS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, is that credible way to come to a conclusion?",
      "DR. MARKS: He may be aware of a bunch of research that I'm not aware of, and that's why I'm going to be respectful here. I'd love- you know something? I just- I'd love to hear it presented. But the piece, though, that I will put to- put to you that I will not accept as a cause of autism is the MMR vaccine- or, for that matter, any of the other vaccines we use because we've studied them in so many millions of children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to- I want to come up to you specifically on this issue, because the President the United States said something artificial is causing autism rates to go up on Thursday, he said, maybe you stop taking something, you stop eating something, or maybe it's a shot, but something's causing it. Right after that, RFK appeared- the HHS Secretary, appeared on Fox News and dismissed 14 studies that have shown no link between autism and vaccines. He said it is an epidemic.",
      "(TAKE VIDEO)",
      "HHS SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: Epidemics are not caused by genes. Genes can provide a vulnerability, but you need an environmental toxin. So we know that it is an environmental toxin that is causing this cataclysm, and we are going to identify it.",
      "(END VIDEO)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there scientific evidence ruling out genetics as a cause of ASD?",
      "DR. MARKS: There's no- there's no scientific evidence ruling out genetics. In fact, there's data that have been published that say that genetics may contribute to autism. There are obviously data that can- that suggest that perhaps environmental factors may, but one has to be incredibly careful- incredibly careful about making associations between environmental factors and autism. There's a wonderful graphic that shows that Coca-Cola increase goes along with the increase in autism. But there's also a wonderful graphic that you can find online that shows that the increase in spending on organic food also goes along with the rise in autism. False causality. Scientists do not want to find false causality. We want to find true causality. And maybe, let's say this- those of us who- many of the people at FDA are like me, we've spent six years- I spent six years after getting a college degree, getting an MD and a PhD. I spent six years after that training in internal medicine and getting- doing a fellowship in in hematology oncology so that I have three board certifications. After that, I worked in academic medicine, in industry and in government on really focusing on human health. We have a pretty good sense of science. And so the question is, I hope that people, at least when they're listening me today, find me a credible witness to say that if I'm telling you that- you know it's hard to trust people that you see on TV, but if you're hearing my voice, I hope I'm a credible witness in support of the science behind the benefit and risk- particularly for the MMR vaccine, but it's true for vaccines in general.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said there may be environmental factors, environmental toxins. He said, \"We know it is an environmental toxin.\" How can you know it if the study is ongoing?",
      "DR. MARKS: I'm not going to engage again with Mr. Kennedy on this, but I'm going to tell you how science works. Science, when it's done as it- at its best, is keeping an open mind to all the possibilities. I don't know about this, with a large number of cases we have, for sure what causes- and that's because I'm not an expert in autism. And at least the people I talk to are also wondering and and trying to look at all the different possibilities of environmental, genetic, and it could be one or the other or interactions, but I don't think anybody has that knowledge that they can speak dispositively like that. People who don't know science, people who don't know how science works, people who want to control other people by pseudoscience \u2013 they talk in absolute terms. But you will- the way you detect a true scientist from a pseudo scientist is because it's very rare for scientists to speak in absolutes. There are some absolutes. If I take this mug and drop it now, I know that gravity is going to make it fall to the ground, and it's going to probably break and make a mess in the studio. On the other hand, most things are not that black and white, and we don't speak in absolutes. Whereas pseudoscientists find it very easy to speak in absolutes because they're not actually looking to use science for the benefit of mankind, they're usually using science for their own benefit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You spoke about credentials, it stood out to us that Secretary Kennedy has hired someone named David Geier to conduct analysis of the links between autism and vaccines. He was charged by the state of Maryland in 2011 with practicing medicine without a license. That was weeks after his father's medical license was suspended for putting autistic children at risk by giving them a hormone blocking agent. So what should the public know or expect from the work that he will do for the U.S. government?",
      "DR. MARKS: So all I can say is I would not concede- he's to the best of my knowledge, he's not had any training after college in any of the sciences that we value here. What I think we can expect is the expected: that there will be an association determined between vaccines and autism, because it's already been determined. This is not how science is conducted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying there's a preconceived notion he's going into the study with is what you're saying.",
      "DR. MARKS: I know the body of evidence that his- his father, who recently passed away, and I know what Mr. Geier has written in the past, that they have a firm and fixed notion that vaccines cause autism. So it's very hard for me to see how we're going to get to any other idea than vaccines cause autism.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll watch for the outcome of his research, but it could have impact, clearly, on vaccines, and uptake of them or faith in them.",
      "DR. MARKS: Yeah. So I just I- I- I think, as someone who believes in the strength of our country, our strength is that we remain healthy as a nation. And we will be less healthy as a nation if we don't take advantage of vaccines, and our adversaries will laugh at us, because I sincerely doubt that countries like China will actually sit around and- and think that, you know, oh, we should have doubt about measles vaccine. They know that measles vaccine works, and they're going to have their populations vaccinated. I would also say to you one other thing, while I have a moment on measles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "DR. MARKS: To compare our numbers of measles cases to the WHO Europe region, which includes Romania, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, other places that have less robust public health efforts than we do, is just- that's just not the right thing to do. We should be comparing our measles response now to what we accomplished during the first two decades of the 20th century, until the 2019 measles outbreak, which is, we shouldn't be having any deaths from measles. We shouldn't be- I have had this problem with several individuals--and this is the closest you'll get me to a statement that may be a little bit out there--to dismiss children's deaths due to infectious diseases that are preventable by vaccines as just expected or not a big deal, that's just not acceptable to me. I've watched in my life close family members, two children who have died of parents- those parents were broken. They were broken for years, and it's bringing tears to my eyes right now. No family should have to lose a child. Even- I- I feel for the families in Texas, even those that feel that they did the right thing by not giving their child the measles vaccine because God wanted it, I feel for them, because they needlessly lost a child.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are more vaccines your colleagues at the FDA are still working on. I want to ask you about the Novavax COVID vaccine approval. It was delayed. Do you know of any reason why the FDA shouldn't be approving this COVID vaccine?",
      "DR. MARKS: So I really can't speak about matters that are still under- under consideration by the agency that I was involved in, but I would say that the fact that we haven't heard anything about it- because normally, by the goal date for these we're supposed to hear about them, it's concerning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Concerning to you because you think there may be a change in our government's approach to vaccine approval going forward?",
      "DR. MARKS: I guess on a larger scale, stepping back from any particular vaccine. I think just the fact that I was let go is a concern to me. I think- I hope that it wasn't because of my work on cell tissue gene therapies and on modernizing the blood donation policies that someone thought I did something wrong. I suspect--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why would they think that?",
      "DR. MARKS: I don't know, I don't know, but I suspect it was because we wanted to- there was a distinct change in how the approach to vaccines would be. And I- I understand that it's a- it's a choice, potentially, that we want to focus more on chronic diseases today. But this is like, you know, why would you- why would you de-emphasize something that is so basic to public health? It's like me telling you, you know, don't bother anymore separating where you get your drinking water from, from where you put your sewage. You would never do that, right? Because that's going back 300 years when it was figured out that you shouldn't do- do that. Why would we go back to putting our children at risk? Remember that- remember that in the- in the 18th century, in places around the globe, 10% of people- 10% of people, died of smallpox because they got it at some point in their life. There were populations where it was 5%, populations 20%. We don't know what smallpox is anymore. Why? Because of vaccines. And anyone who tries to tell you that it was public health or sanitation or the virus just got tired out, all they need to do is- is look at how robust that virus is to know that the only reason why it's not here is because of vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There have been massive personnel cuts to many federal agencies, particularly in the public health space. It's about 10,000, I believe more than 3,000 at the FDA itself. What does the public need to know about the impact of those cuts?",
      "DR. MARKS: It's- I think what I can comment on is that the people that are left behind are going to do their best to maintain the public health, okay? They're struggling because there's a lot to be done. But they are heroes. I- you know, the people who are the heroes in public health are the everyday people who come in every day. They keep tabs on the infections. They make sure that the vaccines that are coming in for approvals might- work their way through. They make sure that outbreaks are investigated. Those people are continuing to do their job the best they possibly can. And it's my hope that, you know, things organize appropriately.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Peter Marks, thank you for your time.",
      "DR. MARKS: Thanks so much.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For more, we go to United States Trade Representative, Ambassador. Jamieson Greer. Good morning to you, Mr. Ambassador.",
      "AMBASSADOR JAMIESON GREER: Good morning, Margaret, how are you?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm well. I'm hoping you can give us some news of movement on this clash. Is the Trump administration opening any kind of channel to Beijing right now? Are there any plans for presidents Trump and Xi to speak?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Right now, we don't have any plans on that. This issue is truly at the leaders level. Before April 2, I had a conversation with my counterpart, and others did since April 2. We have this at the leaders' level, and at some point, as President Trump has pointed out, we expect that we'll be able to have a conversation with them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China holds about one and a half trillion dollars in assets in this country, about half of them are U.S. Treasuries. In the past, you've talked- you've spoken about \"strategic decoupling from China\" and acknowledged it would cause some short-term pain. Are you trying to get China to sell some of those assets? Is that part of your goal as well?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: That's not part of this plan. President Trump has a global program to try to reshore American manufacturing and address the trade deficit. It's a global issue. The only reason we're really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate. So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, we want to negotiate with the Americans, and the Chinese made a different decision. So, it's not a plan to do that. It was a Chinese decision. They have agency here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you prepared for China to consider selling assets it holds in the United States, and do you want that to happen?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, remember, China has been selling off Treasuries for some time. It's not a- it's not a brand-new development. You know, the Treasuries market will fluctuate. You know, I'm not the Treasury Secretary, so I'm not the best poised to talk about that. But I think the issue is we've become so dependent on China, and for so many decades, we haven't had fair market access. And so- so again, we see China taking action, implementing their policy, to try to be less tied up with us as well. So, it's not- it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves. We obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So last Friday, late in the day, the administration published some exceptions to the tariffs on countries, including China, with smartphones, computers, electronics and machines that make semiconductor computer chips. Last Sunday on this program, the Commerce Secretary told us the tariffs are part of a strategy to bring high tech factories to the US. Take a listen.",
      "(START SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: The army of millions and millions of human beings, screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones. That kind of thing is going to come to America. It's going to be automated and great Americans, the tradecraft of America, is going to fix them, is going to work on them\u2026.. Our high school educated Americans, the core to our workforce, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America, to work on these high-tech factories.",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But now those high-tech items are given these exceptions. So, is the goal still to move electronics manufacturing to the United States?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: We certainly need to have semiconductors, and the downstream electronics supply chain move to the United States. What happened is- it's not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it. What happened is, this type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime, where we have studies ongoing for pharmaceuticals, for semiconductors, metals, et cetera. So, it's not that they won't be subject to tariffs geared at reshoring. They'll just be under a different regime. It's shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But those tariffs aren't in place?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER:\u00a0 That's right.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So, they are exempt from them?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER:\u00a0 -- that is- that is subject to study by the Commerce Department. For now, they're subject to a 20% tariff. They're subject to a 20% tariff that's on China.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Commerce Secretary was on another network this morning, and he said semiconductors are, \"exempt from reciprocal tariffs,\" but that won't be a permanent sort of exemption. Here's what you told my colleague, Nicole Killion, April 8.",
      "[START SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "NIKOLE KILLION: Why aren't there any exemptions with some of these tariffs, sir?",
      "GREER: The President decided that we're not going to have exemptions. We can't have a Swiss cheese solution to this universal problem that we're facing.",
      "[END SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I hear you saying the carve outs are temporary, but isn't that still the Swiss cheese situation you said you were trying to avoid?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: I would just disagree with that, Margaret. We have two different tariff programs. You have the global reciprocal tariff getting at the trade deficit, and you have critical sector national security tariffs, where we- we have tariffs in place on auto, steel and aluminum, and we have them coming on semiconductors in the supply chain, pharmaceuticals, lumber, copper, et cetera. They're just different approaches to do it. We have to be much more deliberate about the semiconductor supply chain, because we don't even import semiconductors as such that much, right? They go into downstream products. So, we have to be very careful. And we want the whole supply chain here, not just one product.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the President said on Monday, he'd be much more specific. Will we see those sectoral tariffs announced? I mean, he- he's saying he's already putting big tariffs on pharma. You're telling me that there's going to be an investigation into it. That's something that sounds like it's far in the future. What- what time frame are we talking about?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, you have- for the National Security tariffs, you have to do an investigation in order to impose the tariffs. That's just legal process. That's- that's how we do it. That's how it's done for steel, aluminum, autos, etc--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you've decided the outcome.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: -- investigations for those. No, we have not. We have not. That's why they're exempt- that's why they're, you know, they don't have a tariff covered right now, because you have to go through the investigation to determine the outcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Is it--",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: -- We expect there will have to be some kind of tariff on that, but we have to go through the investigation, figure out what's appropriate, and that- and that's a Commerce Department function to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. I understand you and the Treasury secretary are going to be meeting on the 17th of- of the month with Japanese officials to talk about the potential of a trade deal. I've been told you've been looking at some of these non-tariff barrier issues that the United States sees problems with, in current- including their currency. Are you asking governments to do things like that, not just, you know, to buy into America, but to actually change their own currency and change, like their central bank policy?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: So, our view, Margaret, is that currency manipulation or misalignment, whatever you want to call it, that can have a negative impact on U.S. exporters and unfairly advantage of foreign exports into the United States. ln the USMCA and in the Japan- China- the Japan-U.S. deal from the first Trump term, we had chapters with the parties committing not to do currency manipulation. You know, the Treasury Department has a statute to avoid that. So we certainly are in these kinds of discussions with these countries to see if they're willing to make these types of commitments as well (INAUDIBLE)--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a pretty big ask.",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, the Japanese agreed to it in the first Trump term. The Canadians and the Mexicans agreed to it. This is something that periodically has- has happened over the years. Countries have had to revalue to make sure they aren't giving artificial competition- you know, artificial competitive advantage to their exports. I mean, it's a big ask, because we're in a- we're in a nefarious situation. We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit that Biden left us with. It's the highest in human history. And currency certainly part of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but I say it's a big ask because it takes time to negotiate. It could take you longer than 90 days, right? So, does that mean this 90-day reprieve could continue to be renewed? Do you know what happens at the end of 90 days is that the amount of time you have to negotiate deals with the 70 countries the White House says are calling?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, I'm considering that we have 90 days before April 2. We were already having many talks with other countries, because everyone knew tariffs were coming. This was- this was not some secret everyone knew. And so, we already were in conversations with several countries. You know, it's going to be up to these countries to come to the table, continue coming to the table and make these kinds of offers. I mean, the reality is, we're working around the clock, day and night, you know, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But 90 days could be a rolling deadline, is what I hear you saying?",
      "AMBASSADOR GREER: Well, I- I would not say that. In the President's Cabinet meeting last week, he was asked about this, and he said, well, we'll see. I mean, my goal is to get meaningful deals before 90 days, and I think we're going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, the president, I know you were testifying on- on the Hill when the president changed the policy on reciprocal tariffs. He said later to reporters that he didn't have access to lawyers when he made the announcement of the change in policy. Quote, \"we wrote it up from our hearts. It was written from the heart.\" He said that a few times. Why doesn't the president have access to trade lawyers when he's announcing policy? These are massive policy shifts. I'm sure there's somebody who could have taken a call.",
      "JAMIESON GREER: So that type of- that type of discussion had been happening for- for several days. He's talking about drafting the tweets. He drafted the tweet from his heart. But that kind of policy, that was always a possibility, and the order was drafted by lawyers to ensure that the President could modify the policy to further the underlying goals of the order. So- so lawyer- you know, trade lawyers like- like myself and a huge staff that works for me, White House Counsel, et cetera, they've all been involved from day one to give the President the kind of flexibility he needs to address the emergency he's declared that's forms the basis for these tariffs.",

      "NEEL KASHKARI: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We checked and we saw soybeans are Minnesota's largest export, something like 2 billion annually. A lot of those soybeans go to China. Do you have a sense yet of what the sustained trade war with China would cost farmers in the midsection of the country?",
      "KASHKARI: Well, it's funny you said that. I just heard from an ag Leader two days ago in Minnesota who said that even if there's a 10% tariff from China on soybeans, zero Minnesota soybeans will go to China because it's a competitive global market, it's a commodity. They will have to go someplace else. And so in many sectors, whether it's a 10% tariff or 50% or 100% tariff, it has dramatic effect on the trade flows. And so a lot of my folks that I hear from here are quite concerned about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yep, Bloomberg was already reporting that China was purchasing soybeans from Brazil. So looking to other suppliers, potentially. I want to ask you more broadly, beyond your state, you said on CNBC this past week, investors may now be saying America is no longer the most attractive place in the world to invest. What makes you say that?",
      "KASHKARI: Well, we have to start at what causes a trade deficit. It's just economic math that if investors around the world say one country is the best place to invest, the math works out that that country will have a trade deficit. And part of how that shows up for that economy is interest rates will be lower across the economy because investors are investing and bringing their money into that economy. So now, if we're not going to have a trade deficit going forward, then investors must conclude that there are other attractive places to invest too. And as we see yields go up, we're seeing the treasury yields go up. The reason the Fed cares about this is we have to make sure that it's not inflation that's driving those yields up. It could be that investors are saying, 'Hey, there are other places we also want to invest.' That it won't just be everybody wants to pour money in America. So these are very complicated details to sort out. The Fed's job is to keep inflation under control and not let it get unanchored.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So people typically think of US Treasuries as the safe thing to buy in a crisis, because they're backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. So when the President says the bond markets got queasy, and that was part of his decision in delaying these reciprocal tariffs, what does that say to you? How do you interpret that the bond market got spooked like it did?",
      "KASHKARI: Well, I think investors in the US and around the world are trying to determine what is the new normal in America. You know, I saw an interview on Friday where Blackrock CEO Larry Fink speculated that maybe the 10 year treasury would go to a 5% yield. He just offered it as a possibility. We don't know where that new normal level is going to be, and we at the Fed have no ability, zero ability, to affect that destination. And I think markets are searching for where are these trade negotiations going to end up. Ultimately, that destination, whether it's a 5% treasury or 4 or something else, that's 100% determined by trade policy and fiscal policy. And I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets about what is that new destination, and we're going to have to watch and see and at the Fed. Our job is to keep inflation under control so that rate isn't even higher.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And just for our audience, when what yields going up indicates people are selling treasuries. And when Larry Fink, who I believe is the world's largest asset manager, spoke, he said something about the Fed might not have the ability to do any real easings. Is that what, what concerned you?",
      "KASHKARI: Well, it's not a concern. It's just a recognition of the tools that we have. So we at the Fed, we can manage kind of near term ups and downs in the economy, but ultimately, where the economy settles in the long run as a result of all of these renegotiations and these new trade flows and fiscal policy, that new normal is completely out of the central bank's control. We cannot affect that. All we can do is keep inflation expectations anchored and try to manage some of the ups and downs on that journey, but that destination is up to the executive branch and Congress, not the Fed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the tariffs on things like steel and lumber and all the things you use to build a building in the house, those may raise prices. Shelter already was a big contributor to the inflation rate. If, what does all this add up to? Do you have any expectations? It certainly sounds like the trajectory is prices going up.",
      "KASHKARI: Well there's no question that tariffs, by themselves, are inflationary. They push prices up, just as you articulated. The question is, is it a one time increase in prices and then prices grow slowly from there, or is it something more sustained and ongoing? And it's the Fed's job to make sure that it's only a one time adjustment in prices and nothing longer term than that. So that's the part that we have a role to play here, and we're committed to doing so. But you're right. Tariffs push up prices and push down economic activity, and that's a challenging situation because the Fed simply does not have the tools to undo the economic effects of tariffs in a trade war. We can just keep inflation from getting out of hand.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't meet again until what, May 7?",
      "KASHKARI: In a few weeks, we meet. But obviously we are continuing to monitor all the economic data. The economy was fundamentally very healthy, January, February, March. The job market has been strong. The underlying inflationary dynamics have been coming down, just as we hoped for and we've been trying to engineer. But obviously this is the biggest in the last month or so, this is the biggest hit to confidence that I can recall in the 10 years that I've been at the Fed, except for March of 2020 when COVID first hit. So when there's that type of hit to confidence, it can have large effects on the economy, and we're monitoring that very carefully through the data and through all of our discussions with businesses all around the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the odds of recession are now 50/50. Goldman Sachs says 45% chance of recession. Is the risk that high in your estimate?",
      "KASHKARI: You know it's really going to be determined by are there quick resolutions? To your prior guests. Are there quick resolutions to these trade uncertainties with our major trading partners? The faster those resolutions come, I think the more that confidence can be restored, and hopefully those odds can be brought down. But it is a serious situation if everybody gets nervous at the same time, businesses and consumers, and they all pull back at the same time that can lead to an economic downturn just by itself. Setting aside the math of what the tariffs end up doing to prices. And so there's a lot to try to unwrap right now, and we're doing our best to try to keep our arms around it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the financial markets look orderly to you at this point?",
      "KASHKARI: They are. I mean, obviously the market participants are trying to grasp for where is this all going to settle, and that's causing volatility as they're, as they're trying to do these assessments. So that volatility is to be expected, but markets are functioning, transactions are happening, and so I anticipate that's going to continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Neel Kashkari, always good to get your insights. Thank you for joining us. We'll be right back with more. Face the Nation.",

They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!\"",
      "The state department's filing comes one day after a U.S. government attorney struggled in a hearing to provide U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis with any information about Garcia's whereabouts.

    "summary": "The Trump administration could release files on the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy \u2014 the U.S. health secretary's father \u2014 within days, after decades of public fascination about the killing.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to release new documents on former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 assassination in the coming days, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Thursday, bringing fresh attention to a killing that has drawn public fascination for decades.",
      "It's not clear what \u2014 if any \u2014 new information will emerge from the release. But the disclosures have drawn the backing of President Trump and his health and human services secretary, the slain politician's son Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "During the cabinet meeting in which Gabbard announced the planned release, the health secretary \u2014 who has claimed for years his father's convicted assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, may be innocent \u2014 said he's \"very grateful\" for the release, while Mr. Trump said, \"it's time.\"",
      "Why is the Trump administration releasing files on RFK?",
      "Days after taking office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing his government to release files on the 1960s assassinations of three high-profile figures: President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert F. Kennedy and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "The administration released a set of newly unredacted files on John F. Kennedy's 1963 killing last month. Gabbard said in a Cabinet meeting Thursday there are \"over a hundred people working around the clock to scan the paper\" around Robert F. Kennedy and King's 1968 assassinations, and her team will \"have those ready to release here within the next few days.\"",
      "What do we expect in the newly released RFK files?",
      "It's unclear what documents on Robert F. Kennedy's assassination are held by the federal government or slated for release. It also remains to be seen whether the disclosures will contain new information, though, on Thursday, Gabbard referenced files that have been \"sitting in boxes in storage for decades\" and \"have never been scanned or seen before.\"",
      "Many files on Robert F. Kennedy's assassination \u2014 which was handled by local police investigators in California, where he was killed \u2014 are already public. The state of California has held tens of thousands of pages of documents on the killing since the late 1980s, including troves of records from the Los Angeles Police Department's initial investigation into Sirhan. The bulk of those documents are publicly available, the state says, writing, \"every effort has been made to provide the fullest possible disclosure of the records.\"",
      "The University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, also maintains an archive with public records on the assassination.",
      "Tim Tate, a writer who argues Sirhan did not fire the bullets that killed Robert F. Kennedy, told CBS News he's \"cautious\" about the Trump administration's promise to release new documents. He noted the files held by the California state archive \u2014 including records from a separate FBI probe on the assassination \u2014 are supposed to be comprehensive. While it would be \"disturbing\" if any files from the FBI or other agencies were omitted, it's unclear what, if anything, was withheld, he said.",
      "Tate said it's possible \"it could all turn out to be a great big nothing burger.\"",
      "Similarly, writer Dan Moldea \u2014 who says Sirhan was solely responsible for the assassination \u2014 said he \"can't imagine something coming out on the RFK files that is going to be striking.\"",
      "\"I can't imagine anything of any importance coming out of this,\" Moldea said. \"Anything important would have been in the LAPD files.\"",
      "But Lisa Pease, a writer who has argued Sirhan did not kill Robert F. Kennedy, told CBS News she believes the federal government may hold documents that could shed new light on the assassination. She pointed to records suggesting the CIA communicated with the Los Angeles Police Department about Sirhan during its probe into the killing.",
      "\"We've only ever seen the LAPD's side of that conversation, so this is our first chance to maybe, hopefully, find the CIA's records pertaining to those conversations,\" Pease said. \"I think there might be some very interesting files.\"",
      "Who assassinated RFK \u2014 and why is RFK Jr. interested in it?",
      "Robert F. Kennedy, then a New York senator and leading Democratic presidential primary candidate, was fatally shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968. Five others were injured. Sirhan was convicted of first-degree murder in the killing in 1969 and has spent over a half-century in California state prison, losing over a dozen requests for parole.",
      "Sirhan\u2014 whose family is Palestinian \u2014 has admitted to killing Kennedy and suggested he was motivated by the presidential candidate's support for Israel, though he has also asserted his innocence at various points or claimed he couldn't remember key details from the slaying.",
      "For decades, some critics of the investigation have questioned whether Sirhan was the true assassin or claimed he wasn't the only gunman. They often cite conflicts between an autopsy report and eyewitness testimony or muddled evidence about the number of gunshots. Still, plenty of other researchers have supported the conclusion that Sirhan acted alone.",
      "One skeptic is Kennedy's son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who met with Sirhan in prison in 2018 and later told the Washington Post he was \"disturbed that the wrong person might have been convicted of killing my father.\" He and his brother Douglas Kennedy backed Sirhan's 2021 bid for parole, and\u00a0California's parole board later recommended Sirhan's release, though Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom later rejected the request.",
      "Several of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s siblings disagree with the health secretary, vehemently pushing back against Sirhan's bids for parole. Chris Kennedy told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2021 that he doesn't believe Sirhan's claims of innocence: \"I know he's a murderer, so it's not a big leap to believe he's a liar,\" he said.",

      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said in a written order that the administration \"made no meaningful effort to comply\" with her directive to file a declaration addressing three questions related to the confinement of\u00a0Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u00a0at a Salvadoran supermax prison: his current physical location and custodial status; what stems the administration has taken to facilitate his return to the U.S.; and what steps they will take and when to facilitate his release.",
      "\"From this court's perspective, defendants' contention that they could not answer these basic questions absent some nonspecific 'vetting' that has yet to take place, provides no basis for their lack of compliance,\" she wrote.",
      "Xinis directed the administration to file daily declarations providing information in response to her queries. Her written order came after a hearing Friday.\u00a0 The Justice Department had told her in a filing earlier in the day that it was unable to provide the information she requested about Abrego Garcia and called a Friday morning deadline she set to provide the details \"impracticable.\"",

      "\"I'm not asking for state secrets,\" she said. \"I'm asking a very simple question: where is he?\"",
      "Ensign repeatedly said he was not given information that he could provide to the court, including Abrego Garica's custodial status and who had authority over him. Trump administration officials are still evaluating the Supreme Court's order, he said.",
      "Xinis repeatedly pressed Ensign about where Abrego Garcia is. He noted that his lawyers said Abrego Garcia's last known location is in El Salvador and acknowledged the government has not put forth information to the contrary.",
      "The judge called the lack of evidence from the Justice Department about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts \"extremely troubling.\"",
      "\"It behooves this case and how the system of justice works that the following be communicated to your clients: You are the officer of the court. You are the instrument to represent\" the government, Xinis said. She said that the record in the case currently shows that despite her directive to take steps to bring Agrego Garcia back to the U.S., \"your clients have done nothing to facilitate\" his return.",
      "\"I'm not sure what to take from the fact that the Supreme Court has spoken quite clearly and yet I can't get an answer today about what you've done, if anything, in the past,\" Xinis said.",
      "Ensign told the judge that the federal government \"intends to comply with the Supreme Court's order.\" He said that while the administration is prepared to answer her questions about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and what actions have been taken to secure his return, they may assert privileges.",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia's lawyer, said his lawyers and family have not had contact with Abrego Garcia, and accused the Trump administration of \"playing games with their own lawyers.\"",
      "\"They clearly didn't comply\" with the district court's order to turn over information about Abrego Garcia, he said.",
      "In the\u00a0filing to the court ahead of the hearing, Justice Department attorneys told the judge they \"are not in a position where they 'can' share any information requested by the court. That is the reality.\"",
      "\"Defendants received the order late in the evening last night. They are reviewing the order and actively evaluating next steps,\" they wrote. \"It is unreasonable and impracticable for defendants to reveal potential steps before those steps are reviewed, agreed upon, and vetted. Foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines, in part because it involves sensitive country-specific considerations wholly inappropriate for judicial review.\"",
      "The Justice Department lawyers said that the judge gave them an \"insufficient amount of time\" to review the Supreme Court's order and argued she has not yet provided clarity as to the scope of her initial directive, as the high court told her to do.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys opposed the government's request for more time to respond to the judge's directives and accused the Justice Department of continuing \"to delay, obfuscate, and flout court orders, while a man's life and safety is at risk.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his wife and children, was arrested and removed to El Salvador last month after Trump administration officials accused him of having ties to the MS-13 gang.\u00a0 His lawyers said he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "The 29-year-old is being confined at the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT, along with other migrants sent there by the administration as part of an agreement with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. Under the deal, the U.S. government is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to hold U.S. detainees.",
      "But Abrego Garica's case emerged as a flashpoint in President Trump's immigration crackdown after a U.S. immigration official acknowledged in a court filing that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "In 2019, an immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia relief known as withholding of removal, which forbids the government from returning him to his home country of El Salvador because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "While the Trump administration admitted the error in sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the district court has no jurisdiction over the Salvadoran government and therefore cannot force it to release Abrego Garcia from its prison. Justice Department lawyers have said that the Salvadoran government has custody of Abrego Garcia, so he cannot be returned to the U.S. unless it releases him.",
      "Abrego Garcia and his wife filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland following his arrest and removal, alleging it violated federal immigration law. They sought an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "Xinis granted that request last week following a hearing and directed the government to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The dispute ended up before the Supreme Court, and Chief Justice John Roberts put that deadline on hold to allow the high court more time to consider the matter.",
      "Then, on Thursday, the Supreme Court unanimously agreed that the Trump administration had to \"facilitate\" the release of Abrego Garcia from Salvadoran custody and \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador\" \u2014 to provide Abrego Garcia with due process of law.",
      "But the Supreme Court also directed the district court to clarify its order, and specifically the directive that the government \"effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "\"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court said. \"For its part, the government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\"",

    "summary": "Mahmoud Khalil, who led protests at Columbia University against Israel, appeared in immigration court in Louisiana Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Jena, Louisiana \u2014 An immigration judge in Louisiana on Friday allowed the Trump administration to move forward with its effort to deport Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, upholding one of the deportation grounds cited by the government.",
      "Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Jamee Comans ruled that the administration's determination that Khalil poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S. is \"facially reasonable\" and makes Khalil deportable.",
      "The judge gave Khalil's lawyers until April 23 to file applications for relief to stop his deportation to Syria or Algeria on this ground. Khalil was born in Syria but is a citizen of Algeria, according to court documents.",
      "Comans held in abeyance the second deportation ground cited by the Trump administration: a claim that Khalil committed immigration fraud because he allegedly omitted information about his work history in his green card application.",
      "Comans made the determinations Friday afternoon, inside the courtroom of the privately operated U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Jena where Khalil has been held for weeks.",
      "Khalil, a vocal member of the protests at Columbia University over the war in Gaza, was arrested in early March by ICE, outside of his New York City apartment, where he lived with his pregnant U.S. citizen wife.",
      "After Comans issued her ruling, Khalil, attired in a blue uniform and sandals, asked to be allowed to give remarks.",
      "Khalil noted that the judge had previously talked about \"due process and fundamental fairness,\" and the former Columbia student said those principles were not followed in his case.",
      "Khalil said the Trump administration shipped him \"1,000 miles away\" from his family. He concluded by telling the judge that the cases of other migrants detained here at the ICE facility in Jena, Louisiana should also be addressed with urgency.",
      "After the hearing, Marc van der Hout, an attorney for Khalil, said in a statement, \"Today, we saw our worst fears play out: Mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process, a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing, and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent. This is not over, and our fight continues.\"",
      "\"If Mahmoud can be targeted in this way, simply for speaking out for Palestinians and exercising his constitutionally protected right to free speech, this can happen to anyone over any issue the Trump administration dislikes,\" van der Hout added.",
      "The government hasn't charged Khalil with any crime, but it has argued in immigration court that he should be stripped of his green card and deported on two civil immigration grounds.",
      "The Trump administration has invoked a rarely used provision of immigration law that allows the government to seek the deportation of noncitizens whose \"presence or activities\" are determined to \"have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"",
      "Faced with a deadline this week to provide evidence against Khalil, the Department of Homeland Security filed a memorandum by Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlining the foreign policy rationale.",
      "Rubio cited no specific evidence against Khalil, a 30-year-old legal permanent resident whose American citizen wife is in the late stages of pregnancy. But he said Khalil's presence in the country undermines \"U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.\"",
      "The Trump government has separately alleged that Khalil committed immigration fraud by failing to disclose certain information in his green card application, including his work for the British Embassy in Beirut and the United Nations agency for Palestinian migrants and refugees.",
      "Khalil's attorneys harshly criticized Rubio's memo and the government's case against Khalil. They claim the government is violating Khalil's right to free speech.",
      "\"If the secretary of state claims the power to arrest, detain and deport someone, including a lawful permanent resident, simply because that person dissents from U.S. foreign policy, there are no limits. There's no beginning and no end to that kind of executive power,\" said Johnny Sinodis, an attorney for Khalil's immigration case, on Thursday.",
      "Khalil has separately sued the government over his arrest, detention and the effort to deport him. That case, in federal court in New Jersey, seeks an order that would require Khalil's release and the rescinding of the Rubio determination. It also asks a judge to prohibit the Trump administration from targeting noncitizens \"who engage in constitutionally protected expressive activity in the United States in support of Palestinian rights or critical of Israel.\"",

      "Karen Agnifilo and Avi Moskowitz, Mangione's attorneys, wrote in the motion that their client seeks relief because the attorney general prejudiced the grand jury pool and has corrupted the grand jury process by publicly issuing the death penalty direction to prosecutors via a press release.",
      "\"Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson \u2014 an innocent man and father of two young children \u2014 was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America. After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again,\" Bondi said in a statement earlier in April.",
      "His attorneys also argued that Bondi's Instagram post\u00a0following the press release in which she stated that Mangione was guilty of murder further prejudiced the grand jury process in the Southern District.

      "An ancient jawbone discovered in Taiwan belonged to an enigmatic group of early human ancestors called Denisovans, scientists reported Thursday.",
      "Relatively little is known about Denisovans, an extinct group of human cousins that interacted with Neanderthals and our own species, Homo sapiens.",
      "\"Denisovan fossils are very scarce,\" with only a few confirmed finds in East Asia, said study co-author Takumi Tsutaya at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Japan.",
      "So far, the only known Denisovan fossils include partial jawbones, a few teeth and part of a finger bone found in caves in Siberia and Tibet. Some scientists believe fossils found in a cave in Laos may also belong to Denisovans.",
      "The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya.",
      "\"Denisovans must therefore have been capable of adapting to a wide range of habitat types,\" study co-author Frido Welker told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science.",
      "Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery.",
      "The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.",
      "An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings were published in the journal Science.",
      "While the new research is promising, Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Project, said he would like to see further data before confirming the Taiwan fossil as Denisovan.",
      "Potts, who was not involved in the new research, praised the study for \"a fantastic job of recovering some proteins.\" But he added, such a small sliver of material may not give a full picture.",

      "\"The remains of three children not older than 4 years were found on three sides of the altar,\" Paiz told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Teotihuacan were traders who traveled all over the country (Guatemala),\" Paiz said. \"The Teotihuacan residential complexes were houses with rooms and in the center altars; that's what the residence that was found is like, with an altar with the figure representing the Storm Goddess.\"",

      "\"We see how the issue of sacrifice exists in both cultures. It was a practice; it's not that they were violent, it was their way of connecting with the celestial bodies,\" she said.",

      "\"You look back at Earth and it's this beautiful jewel. It was quiet. It felt like it was breathing. It was so alive,\" she said during a news conference the crew held about three hours after the launch.",
      "A video showed the six crew members floating inside the capsule, gathering together and saying, \"Take up space!\"",
      "They each moved to their large windows and took in the breathtaking scene while holding up personal items they brought with them. Perry held up a daisy, a tribute to her 4-year-old daughter Daisy.",
      "\"Flowers, for me, I believe are like God's laughter and God's smile. I brought a daisy because I have so much love for my daughter Daisy, and I have so much love for Mother Earth and I believe you can see the beauty in the Mother Earth in a single, resilient daisy,\" Perry explained.",
      "King said she was proud of the entire crew for their bravery, admitting the walk to the capsule was \"a little daunting.\"",

      "\"This is bigger than just going to space,\" said Winfrey, stressing that King has \"real, real, real anxiety flying\" and jumps at even the slightest bit of turbulence. \"This is overcoming a wall of fear, a barrier. I think it's going to be cathartic in so many ways for her.\"",
      "Winfrey, who has been friends with King for nearly five decades, said she was among those who encouraged the \"CBS Mornings\" co-host to accept the spaceflight invitation.",
      "\"I think life is about continuing to grow into the best of yourself and the fullest expression of yourself,\" Winfrey said. \"I know that, I felt deeply that she would regret it, and I didn't want to hear about it for the next 15 years.\"",
      "Her final words to King before the flight were: \"Peace. Be still. Hold to God's unchanging hand. He's got your back.\"",
      "History of Blue Origin's New Shepard flights",
      "Blue Origin named its New Shepard program after astronaut Alan Shepard, the first American to fly in space, who piloted Mercury's Freedom 7 capsule in May 1961 on its launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida.",
      "The program helps bring citizens to space in a reusable suborbital rocket system. Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, set the stage for future human spaceflights with the program when he lifted off on a capsule, named \"First Step,\" in 2021 with three crewmates.",
      "\"My expectations were high, and they were drastically exceeded. The zero G (gravity) piece may have been one of the biggest surprises because it felt so normal, it felt almost like humans evolved to be in that environment. ... It's a very pleasurable experience,\" Bezos told reporters\u00a0after the successful 2021 spaceflight.",
      "The unpiloted New Shepard capsule has space for six passengers who each have a window seat, looking out of some of the largest windows of any operational spacecraft.",
      "Blue Origin says the goal of the New Shepard program is also to advance research.",
      "\"New Shepard payload flights support a wide range of research, education, and technology development,\" the company added.",
      "How long was Gayle King and the crew in space?",
      "The journey to space and back, from liftoff to landing, lasted for about 11 minutes. Nearly three minutes into liftoff, the crew capsule separated from the booster and eventually reached the apogee, or the highest point of the flight.",
      "They floated for about 4 minutes before they made their return to Earth. First, drogue parachutes deployed followed by the main parachutes, bringing the history-making crew back down to the ground. They landed at less than 15 miles per hour, astronaut Mae Jemison, the first woman of color to travel to space, explained to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday.",
      "\"New Shepard astronauts ascend toward space at more than three times the speed of sound. They pass the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, the internationally recognized boundary of space 62 miles above Earth, before unbuckling to float weightless and gaze at our planet. The crew returns gently under parachutes, forever changed,\" Blue Origin\u00a0describes on its website.",

      "Gayle King: \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King, who recently celebrated her 70th birthday, explained that participating in a spaceflight represents an unexpected turn in her life and career. \"I can't even believe what I saw,\" she said post-launch.Katy Perry: Pop superstar Katy Perry performed a tribute to Earth during her journey as part of the historic all-women space crew mission. \"I think the perspective that we're all going to walk away from is like, 'Oh, my gosh, we have to protect our mother,'\" Perry said ahead of the spaceflight.Lauren S\u00e1nchez: Lauren S\u00e1nchez, who is engaged to Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos, helped assemble the all-women crew.

      "Unique design of Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft",
      "Blue Origin's spacecraft carries a crew of six and is fully autonomous, not controlled by a pilot on board.",
      "The crew capsule sits atop a liquid-hydrogen-fueled booster, which launches straight upwards, reaching a velocity of about 2,200 mph and subjecting the passengers to 3G \u2014 three times the normal force of gravity \u2014 before main engine cutoff, about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight.",
      "At an altitude of about 45 miles, the crew capsule is then released to continue soaring out of the lower atmosphere on its own, while the reusable booster heads back down to Earth to land on a nearby pad.",
      "About three-and-a-half minutes after lifoff, the crew capsule reaches a maximum altitude of just above 62 miles \u2014 the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale, an international body that certifies aerospace records, considers the dividing line between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The crew experiences weightlessness from the moment the capsule separates from the booster until it arcs over the top of the trajectory and begins its descent. Moments after separating from the booster, passengers are able to unstrap and float about the cabin while enjoying spectacular views of Earth.",
      "After a few extraordinary minutes, though, it's time to strap in for the return home.",
      "\"It's about three minutes before the astronauts will get a warning to get back into their seats. And at that point, they have about 30 seconds. It's not going to be a rush, it's going to be very leisurely. All they have to do is be sitting in the seat and then as the G forces come on, our reentry will naturally push them back in the seat, so they have plenty of time to buckle back in,\" Gary Lai, a former Blue Origin engineer who helped design the New Shepard, said in an earlier interview with CBS News.",
      "Plunging back into the lower atmosphere, the capsule will rapidly decelerate, briefly subjecting the passengers to more than five times the normal force of gravity, before three large parachutes unfurl to slow the descent to about 16 mph. An instant before touchdown, pressurized nitrogen gas thrusters fire to slow the descent to walking pace.",
      "The New Shepard vehicle has a number of safeguards built in. It is equipped with a \"full envelope escape system\" that would propel the crew capsule away from a malfunctioning booster at any point from the launch pad on up, using an Aerojet Rocketdyne solid-fuel rocket motor embedded in the capsule.",
      "\"It will activate in a fraction of a second, it will light off and propel the capsule away from the booster to safety,\" Lai explained. \"Once it's far away, parachutes will deploy and we will execute a normal landing.\"",
      "The system is also designed to ensure a survivable landing even if two of the main parachutes fail to open and fully inflate.",

      "\"I want other women, other survivors, or anyone who has ever had a dream deferred to know that your dreams matter. You can heal. You can make it through. And even if your dreams are wild, they can still come through. Because, mine is going to space and if I can do it, you can do it, too,\" Nguyen told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Nguyen said she is not afraid about her upcoming Blue Origin flight.",
      "\"I really think back to my family and how they were refugees in Vietnam. If they could go through that journey, I can go through this, too,\" Nguyen said.",
      "Nguyen is joining a historic all-female crew that includes \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King, pop star Katy Perry, philanthropist Lauren Sanchez, aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe and producer Kerrianne Flynn. During the mission, Nguyen plans to conduct two science experiments \u2014 one in partnership with the Vietnamese National Space Center and another focused on women's health.",

      "Nguyen discussed how she put her dreams on hold after experiencing sexual assault, choosing to pursue justice rather than her career. She subsequently drafted the Sexual Assault Survivor Bill of Rights, which was passed unanimously by chambers of Congress.",
      "The legislation she championed extended the preservation period for rape kits, which were previously destroyed after just six months in Massachusetts and 30 days in New York.",

      "Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday in a Washington, D.C., courtroom to defend his social media company from federal allegations that the technology giant is a monopoly.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is facing off with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday, for Day one of a landmark antitrust trial that could result in the company's breakup. For Zuckerberg, the case could determine whether the business empire he started building while still a student at Harvard University will be forced to break apart.",
      "The trial will be the first big test of the FTC's willingness under President Trump to challenge Big Tech, a long-time target of Republicans. The lawsuit was initially filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Mr. Trump's first term, before being amended in 2021.",
      "In its\u00a0complaint, the FTC accuses Meta of \"anticompetitive conduct,\" alleging that the company's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp gives it excessive control of the social media market.",
      "\"There's nothing wrong with Meta innovating,\" said Daniel Matheson, lead attorney for the FTC in his opening statements for the agency Monday, \"It's what happened next that is a problem.\"",
      "During his testimony Monday, Zuckerberg defended his decision to buy Instagram and pushed back against FTC claims that he did not invest in developing the app.",
      "Purchased by Facebook in\u00a02012\u00a0and\u00a02014, respectively, Instagram and WhatsApp have grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "To restore competition, Meta must part ways with Instagram and WhatsApp, the government agency says in\u00a0court filings. The FTC also wants Meta to provide the government with prior notice for any future mergers and acquisitions.",
      "With the landmark trial underway, here's what you need to know.",
      "How long will the Meta trial last, and who will testify?",
      "The trial, which begins Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., is expected to last several weeks.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg will preside over the case, which could see a range of witnesses including Meta CEO and founder Zuckerberg; former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; former Meta Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer; Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom; and executives from rival social media platforms.",
      "What is happening in court today?",
      "The FTC and Meta made their opening arguments on Monday, with witness testimony expected to start in the afternoon.",
      "In his opening statement, lead FTC attorney Matheson said Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing WhatsApp and Instagram platforms and in buying them, the tech giant was \"eliminating immediate threats,\" to their market.",
      "Meta said the company \"did nothing wrong\" by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta attorney Mark Hansen said in his opening statement that the two apps have grown substantially under the tech company's ownership and that there is no evidence to prove Meta is a monopoly.",
      "If Meta had monopoly power, it would exercise control over pricing in the social media space, Hansen said. But Meta's services are free, he noted. \"How can the FTC maintain this monopolization case when [Meta] has never charged users a cent,\" Hansen said.",
      "After the opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify. His\u00a0testimony largely focused on Facebook's efforts to build a rival photo app that could compete with Instagram, before it decided to ultimately buy the company in 2012.",
      "Zuckerberg admitted Facebook was struggling with mobile users in the early 2010s. \"Our whole company had been built up to that point\" for desktop.",
      "Referencing email communications sent by the Meta executive, the FTC pointed out that Zuckerberg had been eyeing the progress of competitor Instagram. Facebook at the time was working on launching a new photo app.",
      "According to the FTC, Zuckerberg sent an email in Feb 2011 saying \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly\" that mentioned their numbers and uploads.",
      "In 2012, Zuckerberg sent another email in which he described his rationale for buying Instagram, saying it was a good photo-sharing network, according to the FTC. At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\"",
      "Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue.",
      "\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Associated Press.",
      "\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.",
      "Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"",
      "What is Meta saying?",
      "The social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.",
      "\"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta's statement reads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\"",
      "\"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\"",
      "\"Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The FTC did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "When did this case get started?",
      "The history of the Meta case stretches back several years. The FTC initially filed the suit in 2020 during President Trump's first term in office.",
      "In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC, claiming the lawsuits were \"legally insufficient\" and did not supply sufficient evidence to prove Facebook was a monopoly.",
      "But the federal judge later cleared the path for the case to proceed after the FTC introduced more evidence in an amended complaint, according to The Washington Post.",

      "A fintech startup that raised $40 million based on the premise of its artificial intelligence capabilities was fueled by human labor, allegedly defrauding investors lured by the new technology of millions, federal prosecutors said this week in a statement.",
      "Albert Saniger, 35, the former CEO\u00a0 and founder of nate in 2018, who is from Barcelona, Spain, was indicted in the Southern District of New York for engaging in a scheme to allegedly defraud investors and making false statements about his company's AI capabilities.",
      "Nate, an e-commerce company, launched the nate app that claimed to streamline the online shopping checkout process via a single AI-powered tap option. But the app was not powered by advanced AI technology at all, according to the indictment.",
      "With the promise of custom-built \"deep learning models\" that would allow the app to directly purchase goods on product pages in fewer than three seconds, Saniger raised over $40 million. While instructing employees to keep nate's reliance on overseas workers secret, he pitched investors an AI-driven product capable of 10,000 daily transactions.",
      "Instead, the app allegedly relied heavily on overseas workers in two different countries who manually processed transactions, mimicking what users believed was being done by automation. Saniger, meanwhile, allegedly told investors and the public that the transactions were being completed by AI.",
      "\"Saniger allegedly abused the integrity associated with his former position as the CEO to perpetuate a scheme filled with smoke and mirrors,\" the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement.",
      "In the technology's absence, Saniger allegedly relied heavily on hundreds of workers at a call center in the Philippines, court documents said. When a deadly tropical storm struck the country in October 2021, the indictment said, nate established a new call center in Romania to handle the backlog of customer services. Investors were likely never exposed to the lull in transactions because Saniger directed that transactions by investors be prioritized to avoid suspicion.",
      "The aftermath of the company's fallout in 2023, left investors with near-total losses, the indictment said.",
      "U.S. private AI investment grew to $109.1 billion last year\u00a0\u2014 and the U.N. trade and development arm said market share is poised to climb to $4.8 trillion by 2033.",
      "AI is widely perceived as being free from human intervention but the reality paints a more complicated picture. Nate is not the only company that has capitalized on AI through cheap labor overseas.",

      "Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams told senators in testimony Wednesday on Capitol Hill that the social media company worked \"hand in glove\" with the Chinese government to censor its platforms, among other allegations.",
      "\"I saw Meta executives repeatedly undermine U.S. national security and betray American values,\" Wynn-Williams said in her opening remarks, which were obtained by CBS News before the hearing.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism and led the bipartisan hearing, said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"made censorship his business model.\"",
      "\"The evidence that we have in black and white is a company and leadership that is willing to do anything, anything, work with America's chief competitor, work with our chief adversary,\" Hawley said.",
      "Hawley sent a letter to Zuckerberg Thursday requesting his testimony before the subcommittee, writing, \"The American people deserve to know the truth about your company.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams began working at Meta, then known as Facebook, as the director of Global Public Policy in 2011. In her almost seven years with the company, Wynn-Williams told the panel she witnessed the company provide \"custom built censorship tools\" for the Chinese Communist Party. She said a Chinese dissident living in the United States was removed from Facebook in 2017 after pressure from Chinese officials. Facebook said at the time it took action against the regime critic, Guo Wengui, for sharing someone else's personal information.",
      "Wynn-Williams described the use of a \"virality counter\" that flagged posts with over 10,000 views for review by a \"chief editor,\" which Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called \"an Orwellian censor.\" These \"virality counters\" were used not only in Mainland China, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan, according to Wynn-Williams's testimony.",
      "Wynn-Williams also told senators Chinese officials could \"potentially access\" the data of American users. When Meta engineers expressed concern about data security, Wynn-Williams testified that Meta leadership, including Zuckerberg, were indifferent.",
      "Wynn-Williams testified Zuckerberg was \"personally invested\" in Meta's business relationship with China, claiming he committed to learning Mandarin and \"had weekly Mandarin sessions with employees.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams alleged Meta's artificial intelligence model known as \"Llama\" was used to help DeepSeek. DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company that sent shockwaves through the American technology industry earlier this year when its AI model was shown to be competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.",
      "In a statement last year on Llama, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone wrote, \"The alleged role of a single and outdated version of an American open-source model is irrelevant when we know China is already investing over 1T to surpass the US technologically, and Chinese tech companies are releasing their own open AI models as fast, or faster, than US ones.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams encouraged senators to continue investigating Meta's role in the development of artificial intelligence in China, as they continue their probe into the social media company founded by Zuckerberg.",
      "\"The greatest trick Mark Zuckerberg ever pulled was wrapping the American flag around himself and calling himself a patriot and saying he didn't offer services in China, while he spent the last decade building an $18 billion business there,\" she said.",
      "In response to her opening statement, a Meta spokesperson called Wynn-Williams' testimony \"divorced from reality and riddled with false claims.\"",
      "\"While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today,\" Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta, which changed its name from Facebook in 2021, operates some of the most popular social media platforms in the United States, including its previous namesake Facebook as well as Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.",
      "Washington is taking a more aggressive posture toward China and its growing threat to American economic interests and national security. The Trump administration increased tariffs on imported goods from China to 125% Wednesday. The administration also continues to pursue the sale of TikTtok, a short-form video platform owned by Chinese company ByteDance, to an American buyer. And on Capitol Hill in 2023, the House of Representatives created the Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party to investigate China's challenge to American global power.",
      "In March, Wynn-Williams published a memoir called \"Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed and Lost Idealism\" about her time at Meta.",

      "The iPhone maker shipped about 1.5 million iPhones, a cargo weighing roughly 600 tons, by air from India to the U.S., Reuters reported, citing sources with knowledge of the matter.",
      "The technology giant has taken a number of steps to mitigate the impact of President Trump's steep tariffs on China. That includes ramping up iPhone production in India, which is subject to far lower levies than China, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. Apple continues to make most iPhones in China.",
      "Apple has added workers in its main India factory, extending shifts to reach its goal of ramping up production by 20%, Reuters reported.",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 27% tariff on India, which Mr. Trump on Wednesday\u00a0paused for 90 days\u00a0along with import taxes on dozens of other countries as the U.S. seeks to negotiate more favorable trade deals. By contrast, a 125% \"reciprocal tariff\" on China remains in effect.",
      "Apple chartered cargo flights to transport the smartphones to the U.S. because it \"wanted to beat the tariff,\" a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Apple reportedly spent eight months lobbying Indian airport authorities to cut the phones' customs clearance time down from 30 hours to six hours. The company has chartered about six cargo jets since March, Reuters reported, citing two sources, including an senior Indian government official.",
      "Apple did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on the matter.",
      "Prices expected to rise",

      "Apple store workers report strong consumer demand for the company's devices before potential price hikes take effect. Recent data from UBS Investment Research shows that a 125% tariff on Chinese imports could lift the retail cost of an iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is assembled in China, as much as 67%, lifting the price $800 from $1,199 to $1,999.",
      "Research from Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives underscores the importance of global trade to ensure affordable consumer electronics prices in the U.S. If the iPhone were made in the U.S., a $1,000 model would cost $3,500, he said in a research note Tuesday.",

      "Apple iPhones could become even pricier under President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on roughly 90 foreign nations, which were slated to take effect Wednesday, but are now on hold for 90 days, with the exception of levies on China.",
      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",
      "The cost of an iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which is made in India and costs $999, could increase to $1,119, an increase of 12%, the investment bank found.",
      "An April 3 analysis from Rosenblatt Securities found that the Cupertino, California-based company could raise iPhone prices by 43% to offset the effects of reciprocal tariffs.",
      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on how the Trump tariffs could affect iPhone prices.",
      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",
      "But some companies, including Apple, could attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. For example, Apple plans to manufacture more iPhones in India to reduce its reliance on China, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing people familiar with the matter.",

      "Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian man involved in protests at Columbia University, was taken into custody by federal agents Monday when he arrived at a citizenship interview in Vermont, his attorneys said in court filings.",
      "Mahdawi's detention comes as the Trump administration fights to deport fellow Columbia activist Mahmoud Khalil.",
      "Mahdawi's legal team told CBS News federal agents informed them the Trump administration detained Mahdawi under an obscure law allowing deportations if the Secretary of State decides someone poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\" The administration cited the same provision to detain Khalil. Mahdawi's lawyers filed a petition in court asking for his release, claiming his detention violated the First Amendment.",
      "\"The Trump administration detained Mohsen Mahdawi in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian,\" his attorney, Luna Droubi, alleged in a statement. \"His detention is an attempt to silence those who speak out against the atrocities in Gaza. It is also unconstitutional.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security referred CBS News' request for comment to the State Department, which did not immediately respond to questions.",
      "Mahdawi's attorney Luna Droubi said in a statement Mahdawi's legal team has \"not received confirmation as to his whereabouts despite numerous attempts to locate him.\" Federal Judge William Sessions temporarily barred the government from removing Mahdawi from Vermont on Monday.",
      "Mahdawi was born in a West Bank refugee camp and has been a U.S. lawful permanent resident for the last decade, according to his lawyers. He completed a philosophy program at Columbia late last year, and was expected to graduate in May before seeking a master's degree from the university this fall.",
      "Khalil and Mahdawi co-founded Columbia's Palestinian Student Union in 2023, Mahdawi's lawyers said in court documents. Khalil later spoke at campus protests over Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, which began after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Mahdawi has drawn attention in the past. Betar USA \u2014 a controversial pro-Israel group that regularly encourages the Trump administration to detain pro-Palestinian protest leaders \u2014 tweeted a video of Mahdawi in January and said he's on the organization's \"deport list.\"",
      "Betar spokesman Daniel Levy told CBS News in a statement the group has \"provided thousands of names of jihadis to the Trump Administration of visitors to America who support Hamas and will continue to.\"",
      "Mahdawi's lawyers say he has backed a \"peaceful political solution\" to the Palestinian conflict. In a 2023 interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" Mahdawi told Bill Whitaker about a campus rally during which an unidentified person yelled an antisemitic statement. Mahdawi said he was \"shocked\" and told the person, \"you don't represent us.\"",
      "Mahdawi is the latest student to face immigration detention. Khalil, who also holds a green card, was detained outside his Columbia-owned apartment last month. The government is seeking his removal from the country, accusing him of supporting Hamas and participating in \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities.\" When asked to provide evidence for Khalil's detention, the government cited a memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that said that Khalil's role in protests on the campus of Columbia University is in conflict with American foreign policy objectives but did not provide any evidence of Khalil declaring support for Hamas.",
      "Tufts University\u00a0student\u00a0Rumeysa Ozturk was detained weeks later, with her attorneys claiming she was targeted for co-authoring an op-ed in the student newspaper.",
      "Khalil and Ozturk are both detained in Louisiana. A federal immigration judge ruled last week the government can move forward with its push to deport Khalil, but he has until later this month to seek relief from deportation. His lawyers have suggested they will appeal, and he's separately suing over his detention. Ozturk is also suing for her release, and her attorneys faced off against the Trump administration in a hearing Monday.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has defended the practice of revoking visas, writing on X after Khalil's arrest, \"We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",

    "story": [
      "El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele says he won't return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States, after Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters it's \"up to El Salvador\" whether the man mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison returns to the U.S.",
      "Bukele and Bondi made the comments in the Oval Office alongside President Trump, as the two world leaders met. Over the weekend, the Justice Department said in court filings that they're willing to take \"all available steps to remove any domestic obstacles\" to facilitate his return.",
      "\"How can I return him to the United States?\" Bukele asked the press. \"I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course, I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous.\"",
      "Bukele referred to Abrego Garcia as a \"terrorist,\" and said \"I don't have the power to return him to the United States.\"",
      "Bondi, speaking before Bukele, said it's \"up to El Salvador if they want to return him.\" Bondi said that \"first and foremost, he was illegally in our country.\"",
      "\"That's not up to us,\" Bondi said. \"The Supreme Court ruled, President, that if El Salvador wants to return him ... we would facilitate it, meaning provide a plane.\"",
      "But the Supreme Court offered no qualifier of whether El Salvador wants to return Abrego Garcia. The court ruled that a lower court order properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release from El Salvador's custody. The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the release of the man, who lives in\u00a0Maryland, from custody, but ordered additional proceedings before a federal district court.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has ordered the Justice Department to provide daily updates on their efforts to return Abrego Garcia. In Monday's filing, the Justice Department noted Bukele's Oval Office comments. The filing also said that \"DHS does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers insist he has no affiliation with MS-13, and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador. The Trump administration acknowledged\u00a0that his deportation to the high-security prison in El Salvador known as CECOT was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "\"It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,\" Michael G. Kozak, a senior State Department official, said in a Friday court filing. \"He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\"",
      "In a statement after the meeting, Abrego Garcia's wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura said \"the Trump and Bukele administrations continue to play political games with his life.\"",
      "The Trump administration sent deportation flights with scores of foreign nationals that they describe as members of the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs. An\u00a0analysis by \"60 Minutes\" last week showed that 75% of the Venezuelans sent to CECOT in El Salvador had no criminal records. At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. It was unclear if any criminal record existed for the other 3%.",
      "Among those deported was Abrego Garcia, who lives in Maryland with his wife and children. He is a native of El Salvador, and his wife is a U.S. citizen.",
      "Mr. Trump also expressed openness to sending U.S. citizens convicted of violent crimes to prisons in El Salvador, saying his administration is studying the laws right now to see if that's possible. Mr. Trump said the U.S. can cooperate with Bukele to rehabilitate criminals for \"less money.\"",
      "\"If it's a homegrown criminal, I have no problem,\" he said. \"We're studying the laws right now, Pam [Bondi] is studying. If we can do that, that's good.\"",
      "Legal scholars say sending U.S. citizens to prisons abroad brings up serious constitutional concerns. In a 1936 case,\u00a0Valentine v. United States, the Supreme Court determined a president cannot extradite a U.S. citizen except by an act of Congress.",
      "Bukele, a tough-on-crime leader, said it was an \"honor to be here\" and \"we're very eager to help\" with stopping crime and terrorism. Bukele told Mr. Trump what he's doing with the border is \"remarkable,\" praising the plunge in crossings at the U.S. southern border. Under Bukele's tenure, El Salvador has seen a dramatic decrease in its crime rate.",
      "In announcing his meeting with Bukele, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post, that their nations \"are working closely together to eradicate terrorist organizations, and build a future of Prosperity.\"",
      "\"President Bukele has graciously accepted into his Nation's custody some of the most violent alien enemies of the World and, in particular, the United States,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"These barbarians are now in the sole custody of El Salvador, a proud and sovereign Nation, and their future is up to President B and his Government. They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!\"",

      "In his opening statement, lead FTC attorney Matheson said Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing WhatsApp and Instagram platforms and in buying them, the tech giant was \"eliminating immediate threats,\" to their market.",
      "Meta said the company \"did nothing wrong\" by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta attorney Mark Hansen said in his opening statement that the two apps have grown substantially under the tech company's ownership and that there is no evidence to prove Meta is a monopoly.",
      "If Meta had monopoly power, it would exercise control over pricing in the social media space, Hansen said. But Meta's services are free, he noted. \"How can the FTC maintain this monopolization case when [Meta] has never charged users a cent,\" Hansen said.",
      "After the opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify. His\u00a0testimony largely focused on Facebook's efforts to build a rival photo app that could compete with Instagram, before it decided to ultimately buy the company in 2012.",
      "Zuckerberg admitted Facebook was struggling with mobile users in the early 2010s. \"Our whole company had been built up to that point\" for desktop.",
      "Referencing email communications sent by the Meta executive, the FTC pointed out that Zuckerberg had been eyeing the progress of competitor Instagram. Facebook at the time was working on launching a new photo app.",
      "According to the FTC, Zuckerberg sent an email in Feb 2011 saying \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly\" that mentioned their numbers and uploads.",
      "In 2012, Zuckerberg sent another email in which he described his rationale for buying Instagram, saying it was a good photo-sharing network, according to the FTC. At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\"",
      "Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue.",
      "\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Associated Press.",
      "\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.",
      "Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"",
      "What is Meta saying?",
      "The social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.",
      "\"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta's statement reads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\"",
      "\"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\"",
      "\"Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The FTC did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "When did this case get started?",
      "The history of the Meta case stretches back several years. The FTC initially filed the suit in 2020 during President Trump's first term in office.",
      "In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC, claiming the lawsuits were \"legally insufficient\" and did not supply sufficient evidence to prove Facebook was a monopoly.",
      "But the federal judge later cleared the path for the case to proceed after the FTC introduced more evidence in an amended complaint, according to The Washington Post.",

      "Unique design of Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft",
      "Blue Origin's spacecraft carries a crew of six and is fully autonomous, not controlled by a pilot on board.",
      "The crew capsule sits atop a liquid-hydrogen-fueled booster, which launches straight upwards, reaching a velocity of about 2,200 mph and subjecting the passengers to 3G \u2014 three times the normal force of gravity \u2014 before main engine cutoff, about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight.",
      "At an altitude of about 45 miles, the crew capsule is then released to continue soaring out of the lower atmosphere on its own, while the reusable booster heads back down to Earth to land on a nearby pad.",
      "About three-and-a-half minutes after lifoff, the crew capsule reaches a maximum altitude of just above 62 miles \u2014 the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale, an international body that certifies aerospace records, considers the dividing line between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The crew experiences weightlessness from the moment the capsule separates from the booster until it arcs over the top of the trajectory and begins its descent. Moments after separating from the booster, passengers are able to unstrap and float about the cabin while enjoying spectacular views of Earth.",
      "After a few extraordinary minutes, though, it's time to strap in for the return home.",
      "\"It's about three minutes before the astronauts will get a warning to get back into their seats. And at that point, they have about 30 seconds. It's not going to be a rush, it's going to be very leisurely. All they have to do is be sitting in the seat and then as the G forces come on, our reentry will naturally push them back in the seat, so they have plenty of time to buckle back in,\" Gary Lai, a former Blue Origin engineer who helped design the New Shepard, said in an earlier interview with CBS News.",
      "Plunging back into the lower atmosphere, the capsule will rapidly decelerate, briefly subjecting the passengers to more than five times the normal force of gravity, before three large parachutes unfurl to slow the descent to about 16 mph. An instant before touchdown, pressurized nitrogen gas thrusters fire to slow the descent to walking pace.",
      "The New Shepard vehicle has a number of safeguards built in. It is equipped with a \"full envelope escape system\" that would propel the crew capsule away from a malfunctioning booster at any point from the launch pad on up, using an Aerojet Rocketdyne solid-fuel rocket motor embedded in the capsule.",
      "\"It will activate in a fraction of a second, it will light off and propel the capsule away from the booster to safety,\" Lai explained. \"Once it's far away, parachutes will deploy and we will execute a normal landing.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday suggested he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs he previously imposed on the sector\u00a0to give carmakers time to overhaul their complex supply chains.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters gathered in the Oval Office that automakers \"need a little bit of time\" to relocate production from Canada, Mexico and elsewhere to the U.S.",
      "Car manufacturers' supply chains are tightly interwoven with other nations, making it almost impossible to make vehicles entirely in the United States.",
      "Because U.S. automakers source many of their car parts from key trade partners, including Canada, Mexico and China, a fully American-made car doesn't exist, according to experts.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously reversed course on tariffs, causing upheaval in financial markets and leading economists to raise the odds of the U.S. economy entering a recession this year.",
      "The 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars, which Mr. Trump designed with the intention of reshoring auto manufacturing to the U.S., is likely to boost car prices by thousands of dollars, experts say.",
      "The price of a typical car could rise by between $5,000 to $10,000 \"out of the gates\" due to the new tariffs, according to a March 31 estimate from Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives."

      "Jamison Wagner, 40, was taken into custody Saturday morning by the FBI Albuquerque and the ATF Phoenix Field Division, according to\u00a0Patel\u00a0and the Department of Justice. Patel said the arrest came after law enforcement discovered evidence from the ongoing investigation of last month's alleged arson at the Republican Party of New Mexico headquarters.",
      "\"Evidence recovered at the scene strongly suggests that this weekend, our brave agents prevented further planned arson attacks,\" Patel said.",
      "Two Tesla vehicles were damaged in the Feb. 9 attack, according to the criminal complaint. Red and black graffiti was also found on the facility's building and six other vehicles. The words said \"Die Elon,\" \"Tesla Nazi Inc,\" and \"Die Tesla Nazi,\" as well as other swastika symbols.",
      "The criminal complaint against Wagner also alleged he was responsible for the March 30 incident at the GOP headquarters in Albuquerque. The entryway was destroyed and the party alleged that the words \"ICE=KKK\" had also been spray-painted, authorities said.",

Using surveillance footage, which captured the suspect's image and vehicle, authorities determined Wagner as a \"significant person of interest.\"",
      "On Saturday, April 12, FBI and ATF officials searched Wagner's residence in Albuquerque and found several evidence linking him to the crimes, including eight assembled suspected incendiary devices, material found in the improvised napalm used in the Tesla fire, ignitable liquids consistent with the gasoline used at both fire scenes, and a stencil bearing the phrase \"ICE=KKK,\" consistent with graffiti found at the GOP headquarters, court documents show.",
      "Wagner was charged with two counts of malicious damage or destruction of property by fire or explosives, according to the complaint. He will remain in custody pending a detention hearing, the Department of Justice said. If convicted, Wagner faces between five and 20 years in prison for each count.",
      "There have been several attacks at Tesla dealerships across the U.S. amid ongoing protests against Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his role in the White House's Department of Government Efficiency.",

He had been brutally stabbed to death at his Los Angeles home while smoking a cigar on that same patio.",

Luigi offered to help, but Monica was arrested before the money was transferred.",

      "Fabio Sementilli was a superstar in the beauty business. He began cutting hair in Toronto, Canada, and eventually moved to Los Angeles when he was promoted to an executive position at Wella. He settled in a home in Woodland Hills with his wife Monica and their two teenage daughters.",
      "On Jan. 23, 2017, Fabio was in his backyard by the pool when two people broke into the home and stabbed him to death. According to prosecutors, the suspects staged the scene to look like a robbery gone wrong.

She was headed to Target where prosecutors said she was establishing her alibi. Before Monica entered the store, according to prosecutors, there is video where it appears an individual got into Monica's truck. Prosecutors said that person was Robert Baker, a local racquetball coach who Monica had been having an affair with for about a year prior to Fabio's murder. Monica's defense attorneys have disputed the prosecution's interpretation of the video from the parking lot.

      "According to the indictment, Investigators also learned that in the year leading up to Fabio's murder, Baker made thousands of calls and texts to Monica.",
      "In February 2017, an LAPD detective went to visit Monica at her home. Prosecutors said that when the investigator asked Monica about Baker, she told them\u202fshe wasn't sure of his last name.",

Any additional allegation that she wanted to have her husband murdered, or stood to benefit from his murder, or orchestrated his murder with Mr. Baker, was based on pure speculation.\"",

      "What should have been a coronation for McIlroy along the back nine at Augusta National turned into a heart-racing, lead-changing jaw-dropping finish at golf's greatest theater that ended with McIlroy on his knees sobbing with joy and disbelief.",
      "\"I started to wonder if it would ever be my time,\" McIlroy said in Butler Cabin before Scottie Scheffler helped him into the green jacket.",
      "It ended with more heartache for Justin Rose, who lost to Sergio Garcia in a playoff in 2017 and forced this one with a clutch 20-foot birdie on the 18th hole for a 6-under 66. He wound up joining Ben Hogan as the only players to lose twice in playoffs at Augusta National.",
      "McIlroy lost a two-shot lead in two holes at the start. He lost a four-shot lead on the back nine in a matter of three holes with shocking misses, one of them a wedge into the tributary of Rae's Creek on the par-5 13th.",
      "And right when it looked as though he would blow another major, McIlroy delivered two majestic shots when nothing less would do, two birdies that sent him to the 18th hole with a one-shot lead. That still wasn't enough. He missed a 5-foot par putt for a 1-over 73 and the first Masters playoff in eight years.",
      "McIlroy's wedge bounced onto the slope of the top shelf with enough spin to trickle down to 3 feet. And when Rose missed from 15 feet, McIlroy finally sealed it.",

      "So ended one of the wildest Sundays at a major that is known for them. U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who beat McIlroy at Pinehurst No. 2 last June, had the lead after two holes when McIlroy opened with a double bogey.",
      "He crashed out with a pair of three-putts and two shots into the water on the back nine, closing with a 75.",
      "Ludvig Aberg, a runner-up in his Masters debut a year ago, suddenly had a share of the lead when McIlroy fell apart on the middle of the back nine. He missed a birdie putt from the fringe to take the lead, then finished bogey-triple bogey.",
      "Rose had every reason to believe he threw away his chances on Saturday with a 75 that put him seven shots behind, and then two bogeys on the front nine. Even as he steadied himself, he was four shots back and running out of time. He did his part in a 10-birdie round and that dynamic birdie putt to cap it off.",
      "McIlroy helped in a big way.",
      "Nothing was more shocking than the 13th. McIlroy played it safe, leaving himself a big target and a lob wedge. He missed his mark by some 20 yards, the ball disappearing into the tributary of Rae's Creek and leading to double bogey.",
      "Then came a tee shot into the pine straw that led to another bogey, and the lead was gone again. But he was resilient as ever \u2014   he's been like that his entire career. Seemingly in trouble left of the 15th fairway, McIlroy hit 7-iron around the trees and onto the green to 6 feet.",
      "He missed the eagle putt - the birdie still helped him regain a share of the lead. Two holes later, facing a semi-blind shot, he drilled 8-iron and chased after it, urging it to \"Go! Go! Go! Go!\" And it did, barely clearing the bunker and rolling out to 2 feet for birdie and a one-shot lead.",
      "Turns out that wasn't enough either. He hit into a bunker from the fairway. He missed the 5-foot putt for the win. There was more work to do. But the 35-year-old from Northern Ireland never wavered in what he came to Augusta National to do.",

At the same time, the president said he would increase the tariff rate on goods imported from China to 125%. A 20% fentanyl tariff brings Mr. Trump's universal tariffs on China to a total of 145%.",
      "China said Friday that it would raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125% in response, arguing in a statement that the U.S. imposition of the levies violates international economic and trade rules, while also calling the rising tariffs a \"joke.\"",
      "Despite questions swirling about how the lower the temperature between the two countries, Greer insisted that the president is working to reshore American manufacturing and trade as part of a broader global issue. Greer said \"the only reason we're really in this position right now is because China chose to retaliate.\"",
      "\"So many other countries affirmatively said they did not want to retaliate, 'we want to negotiate with the Americans,'\" Greer said. \"And the Chinese made a different decision \u2026 It was a Chinese decision. They have agency here.\"",
      "The trade representative said when asked whether the U.S. is prepared for the possibility that China could sell assets it holds in the United States that the issue is \"we've become so dependent on China\" and haven't had fair market access for decades.",
      "\"We see China taking action, implementing their policy to try to be less tied up with us as well. So it's not surprising to see them making these kinds of moves,\" Greer said, adding that \"we obviously have to be prepared on our part to have a resilient economy.\"",
      "When asked what happens after the 90-day pause, and whether the period given enough time to negotiate with 70 countries, Greer said conversations have been underway since before the tariffs were announced, \"because everyone knew tariffs were coming.\"",
      "\"The reality is, we're working around the clock, day and night, sharing paper, receiving offers and giving feedback to these countries with respect to how they can better achieve reciprocal trade with the United States,\" Greer said.",

      "Israel is demanding that Hamas release 59 remaining hostages, of whom 24 are believed to be alive, and accept proposed new ceasefire terms.",

      "Medical facilities often come under fire in wars, but combatants usually depict such incidents as accidental or exceptional, since hospitals enjoy special protection under international law. In its 18-month campaign in Gaza, Israel has stood out by carrying out an open campaign on hospitals, besieging and raiding them, some several times, as well as hitting multiple others in strikes while accusing Hamas of using them as cover for its fighters.",
      "The war started after Hamas killed 1,200 people during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack, mostly civilians, and took 250 people captive, some of whom were eventually freed in ceasefire deals. At least 41 hostages have died in captivity.",
      "More than 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza have so far been killed in Israel's retaliatory offensive, according to the health ministry there, which does not differentiate between combatants and civilians in its count but says more than half of the dead are women and children.",

    "story": [
      "Iran and the United States will hold more negotiations\u00a0next week over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, Iranian state television reported Saturday at the end of the first round of talks between the two countries since President Trump returned to the White House.",
      "Iranian state TV also said U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi \"briefly spoke in the presence of the Omani foreign minister\" at the end of the talks, marking a direct interaction between the two nations locked in decades of tensions.",
      "The two sides spoke for over two hours at a location on the outskirts of Oman, ending the talks around 5:50 p.m. local time. The talks began at around 3:30 p.m. local.",
      "The White House said Witkoff was joined by U.S. Ambassador to Oman Ana Escrogima for the talks, which it described to be \"very positive and constructive.\"",
      "\"Special Envoy Witkoff underscored to Dr. Araghchi that he had instructions from President Trump to resolve our two nations' differences through dialogue and diplomacy, if that is possible,\" the White House said Saturday in a statement. \"These issues are very complicated, and Special Envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday evening that the talks with Iran are \"going okay\" but declined to give further details.",
      "\"Nothing matters until you get it done,\" he said.",
      "The stakes of the negotiations couldn't be higher for the two nations\u00a0closing in on half a century of enmity. Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Talks took place Saturday afternoon in Oman",
      "AP journalists saw a convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff leave the Omani Foreign Ministry on Saturday afternoon and then speed off into the outskirts of Muscat. The convoy went into a compound and a few minutes later, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei wrote on the social platform X that the \"indirect talks\" had begun.",
      "\"These talks will be held at a location planned by the Omani host, with representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States seated in the halls and sides, conveying their points of view and positions to each other through the Omani Foreign Minister,\" Baghaei wrote.",
      "About an hour later, Baghaei appeared on Iranian state television and acknowledged the talks had been going on all that time.",
      "\"The objective of the Islamic Republic of Iran is very clear \u2014 we have only one goal, and that is to safeguard Iran's national interests,\" he said. \"We are giving a genuine and honest opportunity to diplomacy, so that through dialogue, we can move forward on the nuclear issue on one hand, and more importantly for us, the lifting of sanctions.\"",
      "Baghaei added: \"Look, this is just a beginning. So it is natural that, at this stage, both sides will present their foundational positions through the Omani mediator. Therefore, we do not expect this round of negotiations to be lengthy.\"",
      "Araghchi earlier spoke to Iranian journalists.",
      "\"If there is sufficient will on both sides, we will decide on a timetable. But it is still too early to talk about that,\" Araghchi said, in an audio clip published by IRNA. \"What is clear now is that the negotiations are indirect, and in our view only on the nuclear issue, and will be conducted with the necessary will to reach an agreement that is on an equal footing and leads to securing the national interests of the Iranian people.\"",
      "Trump and Witkoff both had described the talks as being \"direct.\"",
      "\"I think our position begins with dismantlement of your program. That is our position today,\" Witkoff told The Wall Street Journal before his trip. \"That doesn't mean, by the way, that at the margin we're not going to find other ways to find compromise between the two countries.\"",
      "He added: \"Where our red line will be, there can't be weaponization of your nuclear capability,\"",
      "Sanctions relief and enrichment remain top issues",
      "While the U.S. side can offer sanctions relief for Iran's beleaguered economy, it remains unclear just how much Iran will be willing to concede. Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran could only maintain a small stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67%. Today, Tehran's stockpile could allow it to build multiple nuclear weapons if it so chooses and it has some material enriched up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. Judging from negotiations since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal in 2018, Iran will likely ask to keep enriching uranium up to at least 20%.",
      "One thing it won't do is give up its program entirely. That makes the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of a so-called Libyan solution \u2014 \"you go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision, American execution\" \u2014 unworkable.",

They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!\"",
      "The state department's filing comes one day after a U.S. government attorney struggled in a hearing to provide U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis with any information about Garcia's whereabouts.

      "Authorities said the unit \u2013 known as \"Gringo Hunters,\" which dedicates itself to arresting U.S. suspects who are fugitives in Mexico \u2013 was trying to arrest a suspect in the northern Mexican border city of Tijuana when the man opened fire, hitting and killing 33-year-old Abigail Esparza Reyes.",
      "Esparza Reyes was the head of the unit at the northern border state of Baja California.",
      "While authorities did not name the suspect, local media identified him as Cesar Hernandez, who officials in California said escaped custody in December during a transfer to court.",
      "Hernandez, 34, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to 80 years to life in prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. He was on his way to Kern County Superior Courthouse for an appearance before a judge on Dec. 2, when he jumped out of the van and evaded staff.",
      "Months later, on April 9, the so-called \"Gringo Hunters\" police unit caught up to him in Tijuana, Mexico after receiving reports that he was in a home there, CBS affiliate KBAK reported.",
      "A shootout erupted and Esparza Reyes was fatally shot while Hernandez managed to escape from the scene.",
      "Mexican news outlets, including\u00a0El Universal, reported that video surveillance showed Hernandez managed to escape while running almost naked through the streets before ducking under a tarp that was covering a vehicle. He emerged dressed in a fluorescent green uniform \u2013 similar to ones used by local traffic police \u2013 before walking away. Hernandez remains at large and a manhunt is underway.",
      "Marina del Pilar, the governor of Baja California, posted a message on social media offering her condolences for Esparza Reyes' death.",
      "\"To the family and loved ones of Officer Abigail, we recognize your bravery and dedication in the service of your state,\" she said. \"Abigail's life will be honored, and her death will not go unpunished.\"",
      "Esparza Reyes had led the regional team of the unit for eight years, carrying out more than 400 operations aimed at arresting U.S. fugitives who had fled to Mexico, Reuters reported, citing Mexican authorities.",
      "According to a profile on the group by the Washington Post, Esparza Reyes grew up in Tijuana and secretly wanted to be a police officer.",
      "The U.S Marshals, who were in the area of the sting but \"not involved in the shooting,\" said in a statement its agents helped render aid to Esparza Reyes before she died from her injuries.",
      "\"We mourn her loss along with her family, friends and colleagues,\" the statement said, according to KBAK. \"We will continue to assist our international partners with the associated investigations. Those who commit violence against law enforcement officers will be held accountable.\"",

      "China said Friday that it was raising tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, the latest development in the escalating trade war between the two countries. It said the higher tariffs would take effect on Saturday.",
      "\"The U.S.' arbitrary imposition of abnormally high tariffs on China seriously violates international economic and trade rules, disregards the post-World War II global economic order built by the U.S. itself, and violates basic economic laws and common sense,\"\u00a0a statement put out by China's Finance Ministry announcing the tariffs said.",
      "The statement called rising U.S. tariffs \"a joke\" and said it would not respond to future U.S. tariff hikes.",
      "\"If the U.S. continues to impose higher tariffs, it will no longer make economic sense and will become a joke in the history of world economy,\" China's statement said. \"At the current tariff level, there is no market acceptance for U.S. goods exported to China. If the U.S. continues to play the tariff numbers game, China will ignore it. However, if the U.S. insists on continuing to substantially infringe on China's interests, China will resolutely counterattack and fight to the end.\"",
      "President Trump's universal tariffs on China now total 145%, the Associated Press reported. Mr. Trump did not include a 20% tariff tied to the country's role in fentanyl production in his\u00a0announcement of higher tariffs on China earlier this week, the AP said.",

    "story": [
      "An ancient jawbone discovered in Taiwan belonged to an enigmatic group of early human ancestors called Denisovans, scientists reported Thursday.",
      "Relatively little is known about Denisovans, an extinct group of human cousins that interacted with Neanderthals and our own species, Homo sapiens.",
      "\"Denisovan fossils are very scarce,\" with only a few confirmed finds in East Asia, said study co-author Takumi Tsutaya at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Japan.",
      "So far, the only known Denisovan fossils include partial jawbones, a few teeth and part of a finger bone found in caves in Siberia and Tibet. Some scientists believe fossils found in a cave in Laos may also belong to Denisovans.",
      "The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya.",
      "\"Denisovans must therefore have been capable of adapting to a wide range of habitat types,\" study co-author Frido Welker told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science.",
      "Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery.",
      "The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.",
      "An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings were published in the journal Science.",
      "While the new research is promising, Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Project, said he would like to see further data before confirming the Taiwan fossil as Denisovan.",
      "Potts, who was not involved in the new research, praised the study for \"a fantastic job of recovering some proteins.\" But he added, such a small sliver of material may not give a full picture.",
      "At one time, at least three human ancestor groups - Denisovans, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens - coexisted in Eurasia and sometimes interbred, researchers say.",
      "\"We can identity Neanderthal elements and Denisovan elements\" in the DNA of some people alive today, said Tsutaya.",
      "Scientists still don't know exactly why Denisovans went extinct.",
      "\"We have so little archaeological and fossil information about Denisovans that we can only speculate as to why they disappeared,\" Welker told Reuters. \"A lasting legacy, though, is that some human populations in East and Southeast Asia carry some Denisovan ancestry in their genomes today.\"",

    "story": [
      "Russia released Ksenia Karelina, a dual U.S.-Russian national who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason in August last year, in a new prison swap on Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed her release in a social media post early Thursday, but offered no information about the terms of her release.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported\u00a0Karelina's release, saying she was freed in a swap arranged by the two countries' intelligence agencies, and a CIA official later told CBS News that the agency had played a central role in the deal on behalf of the U.S. government.",
      "\"American Ksenia Karelina is on a plane back home to the United States,\" Rubio said in his post. \"She was wrongfully detained by Russia for over a year and President Trump secured her release.\"",
      "The plane landed around 11 p.m. EDT at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where she was greeted by several people including her boyfriend, professional boxer Chris van Heerden. In a touching moment, Karelina and van Heerden had a long embrace.",
      "In a statement first published by the Journal and later provided to CBS News, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said, \"President Trump brought home another wrongfully detained American from Russia,\" and added his praise for \"the CIA officers who worked tirelessly to support this effort\" and for the United Arab Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which he said had enabled the exchange. The swap of the two detainees was carried out in Abu Dhabi.",
      "Ratcliffe was directly involved in the negotiations, which he conducted with an unnamed senior Russian intelligence official, the CIA said.",

      "In exchange for Karelina, who lives in California, the CIA official confirmed that the U.S. had freed Arthur Petrov, a German-Russian national arrested in Cyprus 2023 at the request of U.S. authorities. According to the Journal, he was being held on allegations of exporting sensitive microelectronics.",
      "\"Much of the swap was negotiated by the U.S. government, with CIA playing a key role engaging with Russian intelligence,\" a CIA spokesperson said Thursday, adding, \"The exchange shows the importance of keeping lines of communication open with Russia, despite the deep challenges in our bilateral relationship.\"",
      "Karelina was sentenced to 12 years in a Russian penal colony after pleading guilty to treason. She was arrested while on visit to Russia for donating about $51 to an American-based humanitarian group that was helping Ukrainians impacted by the war, according to Russian state media.",
      "Her lawyers said she acknowledged transferring the funds, though she did not admit she intentionally directed them to organizations that might have used the money for actions against Russia. She didn't expect that her donation would end up supporting anti-Russian activities, according to her lawyers.",
      "Van Heerden\u00a0told CBS News last year that she had made the small donation in 2022, \"exercising her First Amendment rights,\" adding that \"she has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Van Heerden said he was uneasy about Karelina's decision to return to Russia for a visit, given the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, but he said she \"had no worry in the world,\" and that she had assured him it would be safe since she was entering the country as a dual American-Russian citizen.",
      "\"She wanted to go home. She made it very clear that she wanted to go home,\" Van Heerden told Gayle King on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Wanting to fulfill her wish to visit home, Van Heerden said he bought her a plane ticket as a birthday gift, and the pair first traveled together to Istanbul. He had originally intended to travel with her to Russia from there, but he didn't feel comfortable, so she traveled alone to Russia, and he returned to Los Angeles.",
      "Russia imprisoned a number of Americans as tension with Washington soared amid the build up to, and eventually the full-scale war in Ukraine. Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich\u00a0and teacher\u00a0Marc Fogel\u00a0were all designated wrongfully detained like Karelina and freed in previous prisoner swaps with Moscow.",

      "New York City \u2013 In a bustling event on 5th Avenue that drew over 100 journalists, content creators, and industry insiders, Nintendo made waves by unveiling the much-anticipated Switch 2. The console is set to redefine gaming experiences worldwide, and Fox was there to capture the excitement.",
      "The Switch 2 is priced at $450 for the console alone, with an option to purchase a bundled package at $500, which includes the new racer \"pack-in\" game, Mario Kart World.",
      "Nintendo has listened to feedback from the initial Switch release and introduced significant upgrades to the Switch 2's hardware. The Joy-Con controllers now connect via magnets, eliminating the traditional track system. Enhanced with a gyroscope and a new mouse mechanic, players can simulate movement with precision, akin to rolling a ball across the floor. The system's fidelity has been increased, offering 1080p in handheld mode and 4K in docked mode, along with improved frames per second for smoother animations and quicker on-screen reactions for competitive gamers.",
      "The new console boasts an integrated chat feature, eliminating the clunky external phone connections of its predecessor. Equipped with a noise-canceling microphone and high-grade speakers, communication is seamless and clear. Additionally, the new webcam can separate four individuals for party games, creating a dynamic streaming experience where players can share screens, assist each other, or simply enjoy different games together.",
      "Nintendo is also offering free local sharing of digital games among Switch 2 consoles, allowing multiplayer experiences without requiring each player to own the game. While currently limited, this feature could become a staple in the broader gaming world. The console is also backward compatible with most Switch 1 games, ensuring that previous investments are not lost. Select games, like the recently released Switch 1 Mario Party Jamboree, will receive upgrades for a fee, including the expansion Jamboree TV.",
      "Mario Kart World was the first game showcased, promising bigger races, innovative modes, and exciting new power-ups. With 24 drivers per race, the largest in the series, players can now enjoy an open-world mode to explore courses with friends. The new knockout mode adds a competitive edge, requiring racers to place within a range to advance through multiple race legs.",
      "One interesting game that had us scratching our heads was Drive X Drag. Upon announcement, reactions were mixed. The game is essentially 3-on-3 wheelchair basketball, offering a challenging experience that, while not entirely reflective of actual wheelchair basketball, provides a unique gameplay twist.",
      "A new interesting way to combat scalpers has also been added to Nintendo\u2019s toolbox,\u00a0 utilizing a subscription on the Nintendo Switch Online system, and playtime of at least 50 hours are the only way you can preorder from Nintendo.\u00a0\u00a0 Originally slated to start preorders for April 9th, Nintendo blames President Trump\u2019s tariffs for a delay in that original timeline.",

      "\"There is no approved pharmacotherapy for lipoprotein(a) by regulatory authorities in any country in the world,\" Nissen confirmed.",
      "Study design",
      "The researchers performed a clinical trial of 320 individuals from Argentina, China, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the U.S. from Nov. 11, 2022, to April 17, 2023.",
      "The participants were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or one or two subcutaneous injections of lepodisiran.",
      "Diet, exercise and weight loss can help decrease LDL levels, but they do not have an impact on Lp(a) levels, experts say. (iStock)",
      "The normal level of Lp(a) is less than 75 nanomoles per liter and the average level for people in the trial was about 250 nanomoles per liter, Nissen told Fox News Digital.",

      "Those who received a second dose at six months maintained an almost 100% reduction at the one-year mark.",
      "In other words, the therapy removed virtually all lipoprotein(a) from the blood, according to Nissen.",

      "Another limitation was that only two doses of lepodisiran were administered in the trial, so the effect of more doses is not known.",

      "\"The influenza vaccine can be highly effective in reducing the severity of illness, preventing hospitalizations, and minimizing the spread of the virus, but its effectiveness can vary depending on the virus strain and individual factors, such as age and underlying health conditions,\" the Cleveland Clinic said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.",
      "While previous work by these researchers on vaccine effectiveness has been published in major journals, this most recent study is still in the pre-print stage, which means it has not yet been peer-reviewed.",

      "In the study \u2014 which was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \u2014 the participants had a fast day calorie goal that was 80% less than their baseline energy requirements, which equates to about 400 to 600 calories per day for women and 500 to 700 calories for men.",

      "The most prominent example, of course, is the two assassination attempts against the president. On the shooting in Butler, Pa. that grazed his ear, Trump would not have survived if he hadn\u2019t been turning his head to point to a chart. The second attempt was foiled by the Secret Service.",
      "More than 60 years after the death of JFK, a would-be assassin\u2019s bullet nearly changed the course of the 2024 election by taking out the man who would go on to win a second term in the White House. The photo of Trump, with a bloodied face, raising his fist became iconic.",

      "This has been going on since President Clinton tried to blame Rush Limbaugh for the Oklahoma City bombing. And since the New York Times blamed Sarah Palin for a crosshairs map never seen by the shooter who killed six people and wounded Gabby Giffords in Arizona. A retrial of her defamation suit is about to get under way.",

      "Imagine being woken up by state police at 2 a.m., with the smell of smoke in the air, and told that you, your family and friends must immediately evacuate. Who wouldn\u2019t feel vulnerable, no matter their title?",

      "Ironically, it was Shapiro who led the investigation of the attempted assassination of Trump at Butler, where a man in the crowd was killed.",
      "The president has been posting up a storm at Truth Social, including messages on\u00a0Easter Week and Passover, but hasn\u2019t said a word about Shapiro.",
      "I think Trump should call Shapiro as a way of demonstrating that he deplores political violence no matter which party is involved. FBI Director Kash Patel did call, but that\u2019s not at the same level.",

      "What is quantum internet?",
      "Quantum internet is a next-generation network that uses the power of physics to send data in a way that\u2019s ultra-secure and computationally infeasible to hack. Quantum internet, quantum networks and quantum communication are all connected but have different roles.",
      "Quantum internet refers to the entire system that allows ultra-secure communication. Quantum networks are the infrastructure that connect quantum devices. Quantum communication is the actual exchange of information over these networks. Unlike today\u2019s internet, which sends data as either a 0 or a 1, quantum internet relies on quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist as both 0 and 1 at the same time.",
      "This results in an encryption method that is nearly impossible to break, making it one of the most secure ways to communicate. What makes quantum internet even safer is a phenomenon called entanglement. When qubits become entangled, they stay connected no matter how far apart they are. If one qubit is changed, the other changes instantly. Any attempt to disrupt the entanglement, such as hacking, would immediately alert both people communicating.",

      "One of the biggest breakthroughs of quantum internet is its potential to eliminate hacking and data breaches. Here\u2019s how.",
      "Quantum key distribution: This technology allows two users to share encryption keys in a way that physically prevents third-party interference.

Quantum internet uses the laws of physics to secure data, making it resistant to even the most advanced cyberattacks.True end-to-end security:\u00a0Normally, data travels through multiple servers, making it more vulnerable to attacks. Quantum communication, however, creates a direct link between sender and receiver, eliminating interception risks.",

      "Challenges and the road ahead",
      "While the potential of quantum internet is exciting, there are still hurdles to overcome. The technology is still in early development, with most experiments confined to research labs. Unlike the traditional internet, quantum networks need specialized equipment to keep signals strong across cities or even countries. Developing this technology requires massive investments and breakthroughs before quantum internet can become widely available. Another key challenge is the transition from today\u2019s internet to quantum internet.",
      "Since most existing technology is built for current networks, the shift won\u2019t happen overnight. Instead, hybrid systems that combine elements of both traditional and quantum communication can serve as a bridge, helping businesses, governments and everyday users to adapt without disrupting the current digital infrastructure.",
      "Despite these challenges, progress is happening. Major countries, including the U.S., are investing heavily in quantum research, and scientists have successfully demonstrated that the technology works. While it may take years before quantum internet reaches everyday users, these breakthroughs are laying the foundation for a safer, more private digital future.",
      "Ways to stay safe while surfing the internet",
      "While quantum internet is a ways away, it's important to stay safe on the internet we use today. Until that new technology arrives, here are a few ways to protect yourself online.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Until a more secure internet becomes available, it's important to use tools that help protect against everyday threats like unsafe links and malware. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Be careful when using public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi remains one of the easiest ways for hackers to access your data.\u00a0The temptations and risks of free Wi-Fi make it important to think twice before connecting to an unsecured network. Avoid logging into sensitive accounts or entering personal details unless you're using a VPN or other form of encryption.",
      "3) Use a VPN: Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Until more advanced security becomes mainstream,\u00a02FA is a simple way to protect your accounts. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second step to log in, like a code sent to your phone. For even stronger protection, consider using a\u00a0security key that plugs into your device.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Quantum internet represents a large shift in how we think about communication, privacy and security. By harnessing the power of physics, it promises to create a network that\u2019s faster, more secure and more private than anything we\u2019ve seen before. While the technology is still emerging, it has the potential to change the internet forever.",

Kawasaki says the design was inspired by the skeletal structure of lions. The name CORLEO is derived from Cor Leonis, the brightest star in the constellation Leo. Riders mount it like they would a horse, but instead of gripping handlebars or using pedals, you control CORLEO with your body. Lean forward, and it moves ahead. Shift your weight to the side, and it adjusts its steps accordingly.",
      "CORLEO is also environmentally friendly. It uses a battery paired with a 150cc hydrogen engine. The hydrogen engine generates electricity, which is stored in the battery.

      "What is Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) bypass?",
      "Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) is a security feature in Windows that enforces strict rules about which applications can run. It helps block unauthorized software, but researchers have found ways to bypass these protections.",
      "Bobby Cooke, a red team operator at IBM X-Force Red,\u00a0confirmed that Microsoft Teams could be used as a WDAC bypass. He explained that during Red Team Operations, they were able to get around WDAC and execute their Stage 2 Command and Control payload.",

      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS",
      "How hackers bypass Windows Defender Application Control",
      "One of the key ways attackers get around WDAC is by using Living-off-the-Land Binaries, or LOLBins. These are legitimate system tools that come pre-installed with Windows, but hackers can repurpose them to execute unauthorized code while avoiding security detection. Since these tools are trusted by the system, they provide an easy way to slip past defenses.",
      "Some bypass techniques involve DLL sideloading, where attackers trick legitimate applications into loading malicious DLLs instead of the intended ones. Additionally, if WDAC policies are not enforced properly, attackers can modify execution rules to allow unauthorized software to run.",
      "Hackers also use unsigned or loosely signed binaries. WDAC relies on code signing to verify an application\u2019s authenticity. However, attackers sometimes exploit misconfigurations where loosely signed or unsigned binaries are mistakenly allowed, letting them execute malicious payloads.",
      "Once an attacker bypasses WDAC, they can execute payloads without being flagged by traditional security solutions. This means they can deploy ransomware, install backdoors, or move laterally within a network without triggering immediate suspicion. Since many of these attacks use built-in Windows tools, detecting malicious activity becomes even more difficult.",

      "Since this attack exploits a vulnerability within WDAC, there is little you can do to fully protect yourself. It is up to Microsoft to fix the issue. However, here are three best practices you can follow to reduce your risk.",
      "1. Keep Windows updated:\u00a0Microsoft regularly releases security updates that patch vulnerabilities, including those related to WDAC. Keeping Windows and Microsoft Defender up to date ensures you have the latest protection against known threats. If you\u2019re not sure how to do that, see my\u00a0guide on how to keep all your devices and apps updated.",
      "2. Be cautious with software downloads:\u00a0Only install applications from trusted sources like the Microsoft Store or official vendor websites. Avoid pirated software, as it can come bundled with malicious code that bypasses security protections like WDAC.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Based on the report, it does not appear that hackers require user interaction to bypass WDAC. The methods described suggest that an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities without direct user input, especially if they already have some level of access to the system.",
      "However, in real-world scenarios, attackers often combine such exploits with social engineering or phishing to gain initial access. For example, if an attacker gains access through a phishing attack, they might then use WDAC bypass methods to execute further malicious payloads.",
      "So, while direct user input may not be necessary for some bypass techniques, attackers often use user actions as an entry point before exploiting WDAC vulnerabilities. The best way to avoid becoming a victim is to have a strong antivirus software installed.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC",

      "The NeuroOne system uses ultra-thin electrodes to pinpoint the exact source of seizures in the brain. Once identified, it employs radiofrequency energy to disrupt abnormal electrical signals in problematic brain tissue without permanently damaging surrounding areas. This dual functionality, diagnostic and therapeutic, is what sets it apart from traditional methods that require two separate surgeries.",
      "NeuroOne CEO Dave Rosa explained:",
      "\"What separates our technology from others is that our device can be used for both the diagnostic part \u2013 finding the area of the brain \u2013 and then ablating or destroying that tissue, all in the same hospitalization.\"",
      "He added that this approach minimizes patient risk by reducing the number of procedures and hospitalizations required.",
      "Freund emphasized this advantage:",
      "\"Stereo EEG electrodes provide the ability to localize seizure onset with excellent precision as long as the electrode implantation is planned thoroughly and accurately. With regards to the NeuroOne electrodes, they allow for radiofrequency ablation to be performed while the electrodes are still implanted without having to remove them. We can therefore not only localize the seizure onset but provide a surgical treatment and potentially avoid a second and potentially more extensive or invasive procedure such as a craniotomy and resection of brain tissue.",
      "\"The NeuroOne electrodes allow us to control the conditions of the ablative procedure. They also provide us more confidence that the electrodes will withstand the duration of the implantation, which would include recording seizure data, performing the ablation and then recording more data after the ablation to ensure that the treatment achieved the intended goal.\"",
      "Brain implant patient Clara Fuller (NeuroOne)",
      "THIS MIND-READING TECH USING AI CAN CONVERT BRAIN ACTIVITY INTO TEXT",
      "The results",
      "The results have been nothing short of life-changing for Clara. Since undergoing the procedure, she has been completely seizure-free. She\u2019s now back to enjoying school, sports and uninterrupted sleep \u2013 things most people take for granted but were once unimaginable for her.",
      "According to Freund:",
      "\"Regarding the implantation itself, she did very well and there were no adverse effects. The first ablation did not cause any acute complications. We then performed a second ablation a few days later after data was recorded from the electrodes demonstrating ongoing seizure activity to ensure that her seizures would not recur. This was also well-tolerated without complications. We have now followed up months after the electrodes were removed and there have been no signs of ill effects due to the implantation or the ablations. She has been seizure-free since the ablation and has done amazingly well.\"",
      "Clara\u2019s story offers hope for others living with drug-resistant epilepsy, which affects about one-third of the 3 million Americans with epilepsy. According to Rosa, \"The desire to expand ablation therapy to patients suffering from seizures that do not respond to drug therapy was our driving force.\"",
      "NeuroOne One RF Ablation System (NeuroOne)",
      "A broader impact on medicine",
      "NeuroOne\u2019s innovative technology isn\u2019t just limited to epilepsy treatment. The company plans to expand its applications to other areas, such as pain management for facial pain and lower back pain, using the same RF ablation technology. Rosa also sees potential for treating neurological conditions beyond epilepsy:\u00a0\"Pain management appears to be the largest opportunity outside of brain ablation.\"",
      "Dr. Freund believes this technology could dramatically improve long-term care for pediatric epilepsy patients like Clara:",
      "\"This technology could allow for limiting the number of procedures that are required to treat drug-resistant focal epilepsy and also provide immediate feedback as to whether or not a surgical treatment was effective. This could potentially reduce the risk of adverse events by limiting the number of times that a brain surgery would be needed. This technology also allows us to access deeper parts of the brain to provide surgical treatment.\"",
      "He added that the impact may soon be widespread:",
      "\"In our practice, we are now using these electrodes in every case that requires Stereo EEG for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. I think as these types of electrodes are used at more centers and they get more experience, there would be no reason not to use them.\"",

      "Imagine receiving a notification about suspicious charges on a credit card you haven\u2019t even received yet. How could that happen?",
      "While it sounds surprising and unsettling, it's increasingly common due to the rise of digital credit card fraud. Criminals no longer need physical cards to make unauthorized transactions, thanks to methods such as data breaches, phishing schemes and card-not-present fraud.",
      "Here's how these schemes work and what steps you should take immediately to protect yourself.",

      "Illustration of a crook stealing credit card info (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How it happens",
      "Even if a new credit card hasn\u2019t arrived yet, it may already be vulnerable. In many cases, the issue isn\u2019t about the card being physically stolen but about someone gaining access to your information digitally. Criminals can exploit online account features, mobile wallets or leaked personal data to start using your card before you\u2019ve even opened the envelope. Below are some of the most common ways this type of fraud happens.",
      "If a scammer already has access to your account, either through stolen login credentials, a hacked email or\u00a0malware, they can view the newly issued card number in the online dashboard or mobile app. Many credit card companies now allow instant access to digital card numbers for use in Apple Pay, Google Wallet or online purchases. This means that as soon as a new card is issued, it may be visible digitally before the physical card is even shipped. If a fraudster has access to your account, they can add the number to a digital wallet and begin spending before the envelope ever hits your mailbox.",
      "Some card issuers allow you to add your credit card to mobile wallets instantly, even before the physical card arrives. While this feature is convenient, it can also expose you to specific security risks tied to mobile wallet activation. Criminals may exploit this process by using stolen personal information to bypass security checks and add your card to their own Apple Pay or Google Wallet accounts. They might pose as you to request a new card, intercept or reroute the digital activation process, or even start making fraudulent purchases immediately. This type of fraud can be hard to detect, especially if you're not expecting a new card or if unauthorized charges blend in with legitimate transactions.",
      "Illustration of someone using their digital wallet (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THIS IS HOW TO PROTECT YOUR CREDIT AND BANK CARDS FROM GETTING HACKED",
      "Another common scenario involves your personal information being compromised in a\u00a0phishing attack or large-scale\u00a0data breach. Thieves use this stolen data, such as your name, Social Security number, address and security question answers, to impersonate you and gain access to your account dashboard or reset login credentials. Once inside, they can retrieve new card details directly from the source or request a replacement card. Phishing scams often trick victims into revealing sensitive information through fake emails or websites, while data breaches expose vast amounts of personal data that criminals can exploit for fraudulent activities.",
      "Although charges made before a new credit card is received are rarely due to mail theft, this type of traditional fraud still poses a risk. Criminals may intercept your mail to steal sensitive documents, including credit cards, which can then be used for unauthorized purchases. To reduce this risk, avoid leaving important mail unattended in your mailbox. Consider using\u00a0Informed Delivery by USPS to track incoming mail or request that your credit card be delivered to a secure location, such as a P.O. box or directly to your bank branch.",

To protect yourself, install strong antivirus software on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable multifactor authentication (MFA): Add\u00a0MFA to all accounts tied to your financial information. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step (e.g., a code sent to your phone) before accessing sensitive accounts.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4.\u00a0Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using a personal data removal service to reduce your online exposure. These services continuously monitor and remove your sensitive information from data brokers and websites that could be exploited by criminals. This lowers the chances of your data being used in phishing scams or other fraudulent activities. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Ask your credit card company to investigate:\u00a0Contact your credit card provider directly and request a full investigation. Ask if there was any suspicious account activity, such as a login from a new device, before the fraudulent charges occurred. They may be able to trace when and how your account was accessed. Most card issuers will reverse fraudulent charges and can reissue a new card with a different number.",
      "7. Notify law enforcement:\u00a0File a report with the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. If necessary, a police report should also be filed to document the fraud. This can be helpful for disputing charges and clearing your record.",
      "DON\u2019T LET THIS CREDIT CARD FRAUD NIGHTMARE HAPPEN TO YOU",

The leaked data includes names, email addresses and nearly everything else associated with a user\u2019s X profile.",

      "What you need to know",
      "The X data leak is believed to stem from a combination of breaches, including a massive one that allegedly occurred in January 2025 and another in 2023. The leaked dataset, reportedly a 34 GB CSV file, contains 201,186,753 entries with information such as X screen names, user IDs, full names, locations, email addresses (from the 2023 breach), follower counts, profile data, time zones and profile images.",
      "ThinkingOne claimed that the data was cross-referenced from a larger breach involving 2.8 billion unique Twitter IDs and screen names. This breach may have been linked to an insider job during layoffs at X, although the company has not verified this claim. Cybersecurity researchers, including those from\u00a0Safety Detectives, partially confirmed the authenticity of the data by matching a sample with public X profiles and verifying some email addresses. However, they were not able to fully confirm ownership.",
      "The breach appears to trace back to a vulnerability identified in January 2022 through Twitter\u2019s bug bounty program. This flaw allowed attackers to access user data using only an email address or phone number. Although the vulnerability was patched, the compromised data seems to have resurfaced in later leaks.",

      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "The data breach puts X users at risk",
      "The 2025 incident alone does not include passwords or financial information, but when combined with the email addresses from the 2023 leak, it significantly increases the risk of phishing and social engineering attacks. X has not officially acknowledged this specific breach at the time of writing, although it previously downplayed the 2023 incident by claiming it involved mostly public data.",
      "The total of 2.8 billion records far exceeds X\u2019s estimated 335 to 600 million active users, suggesting that the dataset may include inactive accounts, bots or historical data. While the full scope and impact of the breach remain unclear, the incident highlights ongoing security challenges for the platform, especially following its acquisition by xAI in late March 2025.",

      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "7 ways you can stay safe from the X data breach",
      "If you have an account on X or think your data may have been part of the breach, here are seven important steps you can take to protect yourself.",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software",
      "This breach included email addresses linked to X accounts, prime fuel for phishing attacks. Hackers may now send emails that look like they\u2019re from X, Musk or support, asking you to \"verify your account\" or \"reset your password.\" These often contain links or attachments that can install malware or steal personal data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Remove your personal data from the internet",
      "Since this X leak exposed full names, email addresses and other public-facing profile details, hackers can easily cross-reference it with other data broker sites to build a full profile on you. This could lead to impersonation or spear-phishing.",
      "To reduce your exposure, use a trusted data removal service that scans data broker websites and requests the deletion of your personal information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Change your X account password",
      "Even though this particular breach may not have included passwords, there\u2019s still a significant risk, especially if you use the same password across multiple platforms. Once attackers have your email, they often try using it with common or previously leaked passwords to break into accounts.",
      "To change your X account password, go to Settings and privacy from your profile menu, then select\u00a0Your account and tap on\u00a0Change your password. Enter your current password, set a new strong password and confirm the change. You can do this via the mobile app or by logging in through the web. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Make your X profile more private to reduce future risk",
      "Adjust your X account's privacy settings to limit the visibility of personal information, such as making your profile private. Ensure that only necessary information is publicly visible. Information that seems harmless, like your location, job title or birthday, can be used by cybercriminals to impersonate you or guess your login credentials. If your X profile includes any personal details that aren\u2019t necessary, now is the time to remove them.",
      "Keeping your profile minimal not only protects your privacy but also makes it harder for scammers to craft convincing phishing messages or social engineering attacks. Think twice before posting personal updates or details publicly, especially if they can be used to guess passwords or verify your identity.",
      "Go to\u00a0Settings > Privacy and safety and lock down your account visibility.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your X and email accounts",
      "If hackers got your email from the X breach, they may try to reset your password.\u00a02FA helps stop this by requiring a second code to log in:",
      "Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy, not SMS, which can be interceptedSecure your email accounts, too, since they can be used to reset your X credentials",
      "Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy, not SMS, which can be intercepted",
      "Secure your email accounts, too, since they can be used to reset your X credentials",
      "6) Use a VPN on public Wi-Fi",
      "Protect your data when accessing X or other platforms on public networks by using a VPN to encrypt your connection. This will help safeguard your information from being intercepted by malicious actors. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7) Sign up for identity theft protection to catch if your X-linked info is abused",
      "With 200-plus million names and email addresses exposed, scammers may try opening accounts in your name or use your email in fraud attempts. Good identity protection can alert you if your info is being sold on the dark web. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my\u00a0tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "NEW PHISHING SCAM OUTSMARTS SECURITY CODES TO STEAL YOUR INFO",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The X breach is yet another reminder that patching a vulnerability is only one piece of a much larger puzzle. The persistence of leaked data \u2013 years after the original flaw was disclosed and fixed \u2013 highlights the long tail of exposure that comes with large-scale breaches. Even when credentials aren\u2019t involved, the combination of identifiers like email addresses, names and social connections can be weaponized through correlation attacks, data enrichment and AI-assisted social engineering.",

      "This same ring, the department shared, was previously charged in a similar scheme stemming from vehicles stolen under false pretenses in San Bernardino County.",

      "\"The average cost of a tow is $109, but we're seeing costs that have skyrocketed, and we're seeing costs that are 10, 15, 16, and $17,000 that are just filled with absorbent fees and very vague descriptions of what people are actually paying for all while these vehicles are being held hostage,\" Stroisch explained.",

      "Stroisch said one of the biggest things that the bureau is seeing right now is the lack of laws and the lack of policies in some cities and states.",
      "\"Every state, every municipality is different, and some states have laws against predatory towing. They have laws that require licensing of tow truck companies. They have laws that require transparency around fee schedules, but there are many cities and states that don't,\" Stroisch explained. \"So I think that from an NICB standpoint, we would recommend all lawmakers at every level, work together to put measures in place to help prevent this.\"",
      "Stroisch suggested that banning accident scene solicitations is one example of how predatory towing can be thwarted.",
      "\"That's where a lot of this is occurring. These tow truck companies that just show up on scene, so ban accident scene solicitation in the first place. So we are really encouraging lawmakers to work together to pass legislation.",
      "\"We are currently monitoring 107 different bills in 37 states that are all tied to predatory towing. So to have that many bills that are in some stage, it's just showing the problem that we're seeing right now.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 12 Apr 2025 11:30:58 -0400",
    "summary": "An Israeli official says military operations and hostage talks are fully coordinated with the U.S., as officials remain optimistic about a deal. Israel continues its advance in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meet at the White House amid reciprocal tariffs uproar, and the president addresses a wide range of questions.",
      "Nearly a month into Israel\u2019s renewed ground operation, U.S. backing appears to be shaping the conflict on multiple levels\u2014militarily, diplomatically and politically. Israeli officials have suggested the chances of a hostage deal have significantly increased, with some anticipating developments within the next two weeks.",
      "On Monday, sitting beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump told reporters, \"We are trying very hard to get the hostages out. We're looking at another ceasefire. We'll see what happens.\" The remarks highlighted Trump\u2019s dual-track approach: continued diplomatic pressure on Iran and direct support for Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza.",
      "With what Israeli officials describe as a \"free hand\" to operate, Israel has expanded its offensive into Rafah and the strategically significant Morag Corridor. The stated aim is to increase pressure on Hamas and help secure the release of the remaining 59 hostages.",
      "ISRAEL LAUNCHES NEW GROUND OPERATION IN GAZA",
      "A senior Israeli security official told Fox News Digital that the campaign is being carried out in close coordination with the United States. \"Everything is coordinated with the Americans \u2014 both the negotiations and the operational activity. The goal is to bring the hostages home. We now have a free hand to act, and no longer facing the threat of a veto at the UN Security Council, unlike during the previous administration.\"",
      "The same official pointed to a shift in humanitarian policy that, in their view, has enhanced Israeli leverage. \"Unlike the previous administration, the U.S. is not forcing 350 aid trucks into Gaza every day. That gives us leverage,\" the official said, adding that limiting aid reduces Hamas\u2019s ability to control the population.",
      "On Saturday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced the IDF had completed the takeover of the Morag Axis. The Morag Corridor \u2014 which separates Rafah from Khan Younis \u2014 is part of an effort to establish a new buffer zone and degrade Hamas\u2019s operational capabilities. \"The logic is that the more territory Hamas loses, the more likely it will be to compromise on a hostage deal,\" the official said.",
      "IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir reinforced that strategy during a visit to front-line units this week. \"I expect you to defeat the Rafah Brigade and lead to victory wherever you are fighting,\" he told troops. The IDF had previously declared the Rafah Brigade dismantled in September, but forces have returned to key strongholds, where tunnel networks remain.",

      "Activity of troops of the 36th Division in the Rafah area on April 5th, 2025.\u00a0 (IDF)",
      "In the same statement on Saturday, Katz warned Gazans, \"Hamas is unable to protect the residents or the territory. Hamas leaders are hiding in tunnels with their families or living in luxury hotels abroad, with billions in bank accounts, using you as human shields. Now is the time to rise up, to get rid of Hamas, and to release all the Israeli hostages \u2014 that is the only way to stop the war.\"",
      "In their Oval Office meeting, Trump and Netanyahu reiterated their alignment on core issues. Netanyahu stated that Gazans should be \"free to choose to go wherever they want,\" in what some analysts view as a reference to renewed discussions about third-country resettlement. Trump went further, floating the idea of a U.S. presence in the Strip, noting, \"Gaza is an incredible piece of important real estate. Having a peace force like the United States there, controlling and owning the Gaza Strip would be a good thing.\"",
      "Javed Ali, a former senior director at the U.S. National Security Council and now a professor at the University of Michigan, offered a more measured view of the current military strategy. \"Now that we're almost a full month into the resumption of high-intensity IDF operations in the Gaza Strip against Hamas, Israel's military strategy appears to be focused on clearing and holding remaining pockets of known Hamas elements, which at the same time is displacing Palestinians throughout the territory.\"",
      "CEASEFIRE OVER AS ISRAEL STRIKES GAZA AFTER HAMAS REFUSED TO RELEASE HOSTAGES, OFFICIALS SAY",
      "Israeli forces establish the Morag Corridor in Gaza. (IDF)",
      "Ali said it remains unclear how Israel intends to manage or govern areas it clears. He drew comparisons to the U.S. experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. \"The U.S. encountered its own challenges in the post-9/11 wars with similar 'clear and hold' approaches, since insurgent and jihadist elements in both conflicts utilized guerrilla warfare tactics and terrorist attacks.\"",
      "While the Biden administration had previously emphasized humanitarian access, Ali noted that the current White House has not publicly pressed Israel to scale back its operations. \"That could change,\" he said, particularly as humanitarian conditions worsen or if negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program progress. \"If those talks gain momentum, Iran may pressure the U.S. to rein in Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas to preserve what remains of the group. Whether the U.S. team, led by Steve Witkoff, entertains such demands will be a key regional development to watch.\"",
      "On the ground, Israel has moved to reshape the humanitarian landscape in Gaza. The decision to restrict Hamas\u2019s access to aid reflects a broader policy shift under IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, who reversed his predecessor's stance and authorized the military to directly oversee the distribution of supplies. \"Hamas will not regain control over the aid, because that was its lifeline,\" an Israeli security official explained. \"It\u2019s what allowed it to maintain control over the territory throughout this period. People in Gaza know that Hamas controls the aid; if they realize that Hamas no longer does, its control within the Strip becomes ineffective.\"",
      "Israeli troops deployed to Gaza. (IDF)",
      "Humanitarian organizations and international leaders continue to condemn Israel. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, speaking on April 8, condemned the ongoing blockade of aid. \"More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid into Gaza. No food. No fuel. No medicine. Gaza is a killing field \u2014 and civilians are in an endless death loop,\" he said.",
      "Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Oren Marmorstein, strongly rejected the Secretary-General\u2019s claims. \"As always, you don\u2019t let the facts get in the way when spreading slander against Israel,\" he posted on X. \"There is no shortage of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip \u2014 over 25,000 aid trucks have entered during the 42 days of the ceasefire. Hamas used this aid to rebuild its war machine. Yet, not a word in your statement about the imperative for Hamas to leave Gaza. The people of Gaza are braver than you \u2014 they\u2019re calling, loud and clear, on Hamas to leave and stop abusing them.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with Defense Minister Israel Katz (Israeli PM)",
      "Eugene Kontorovich, a senior legal scholar at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital: \"One doesn\u2019t need the Israeli Supreme Court to say there is no starvation in Gaza \u2014 this was admitted by the UN\u2019s own Food Security Phase Classification, which in June found that prior UN reports were inaccurate and that there is no famine. There is no serious evidence of starvation in Gaza, and what food scarcity does exist can be attributed to Hamas pillaging and hoarding aid. As the truth comes out, it becomes clear that the starvation claims were designed to halt Israel\u2019s legitimate self-defense against a genocidal attack.\"",

Dr. Huang Kwei-bo, a professor in the Department of Diplomacy at Taiwan\u2019s National Chengchi University, told Fox News Digital that all this \"get tough with China\" talk is mostly political theater: \"These dramatic Lai administration policy proposals are firstly maneuvers aimed at regaining control over Taiwan\u2019s parliament, as well as building momentum for upcoming local elections in late 2026.\"",
      "Huang also said Taiwan\u2019s ruling party, the DPP, is \"crying out to get the Trump administration\u2019s attention in the hope that Trump\u2019s officials will be more willing to endorse the DPP in power and work with, or include, the Lai administration in any \u2018countering China\u2019 policy.\"",

      "Taipei-based political risk analyst and lawyer Ross Darrell Feingold said Lai\u2019s moves correspond with the tough-on-China approach of Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other China hard-liners in the Trump administration: \"The Trump administration will want to see a government in Taiwan that is equally tough on China as the United States, whether in the political, trade or military spheres.\"",
      "A broad majority of Taiwanese appear to want tougher measures against acts that threaten Taiwan\u2019s national sovereignty, but some analysts note the new tough talk has arrived just in time for Lai\u2019s party as it hopes to succeed in an ongoing effort to remove opposition Chinese Nationalist Party legislators from office, win control of municipal governments in local elections in November 2026 and then help Lai secure a second term in 2028.",

      "The former Columbia University student arrested on campus and slated for deportation has filed evidence that shows claims underlying the government's case are dubious.",
      "NBC News reviewed over 100 pages of documents submitted by the federal government in its effort to deport Mahmoud Khalil, as well as evidence filed by Khalil\u2019s legal team, including his permanent residency application, several\u00a0articles about his activism and contracts and letters detailing internship and work experience.",
      "In some instances, the government appears to be relying on unverified tabloid articles about Khalil. In others, the government\u2019s claims about him are clearly erroneous because timelines don\u2019t match.",
      "Lawyers for Khalil, a 30-year-old permanent U.S. resident, have contended he was arrested on March 8 for his protected speech and  for playing a key role in the pro-Palestinian student protest movement last year.",
      "Khalil\u2019s legal team declined to comment for this article.",
      "The administration of President Donald Trump \u2014 which says it has revoked the visas of hundreds of international students, particularly targeting those who take part in political activism \u2014 has presented shifting arguments against Khalil, including claims two weeks after his arrest that he lied on U.S. residency application forms, a deportable offense.",
      "Ultimately, government officials said Khalil supported Hamas, a terrorist group; made Jewish students feel unsafe with his activism; and that his continued presence \u201cwould have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "Khalil decried antisemitism",
      "Immigration Judge Jamee Comans ruled last week that Khalil can be deported at the discretion of Secretary of State Marco Rubio under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which states any noncitizen can be removed if the secretary of state deems their presence threatens U.S. foreign policy.",
      "Rubio characterized Khalil's activities as antisemitic and, thus, contrary to U.S. foreign policy. Comans shot down a defense attempt to obtain underlying evidence and question Rubio.",
      "Khalil\u2019s attorney submitted evidence rebuking allegations of antisemitism in the Rubio memo.",
      "Khalil\u2019s legal team cited an April 2024 CNN article as evidence. In it, Khalil was asked what he would say to Jewish students who felt unsafe on campus.",
      "\"I would say that the liberation of Palestine and the Palestinians and the Jewish people are intertwined,\" he responded. \"They go hand in hand. Anti-Semitism and any form of racism has no place on campus and in this movement.\"",
      "In the article, Khalil also noted that some members of Columbia\u2019s protest encampment last year were Jewish and held Passover seders.\u00a0\"They are an integral part of this movement,\" Khalil said.",
      "Rubio\u2019s memo \u2014 which is the government\u2019s main piece of evidence in its deportation case against Khalil \u2014 said that while\u00a0Khalil\u2019s beliefs, statements, or associations were \u201cotherwise lawful,\u201d\u00a0allowing him to remain\u00a0in\u00a0the country would\u00a0undermine \u201cU.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and\u00a0in\u00a0the United States,\u00a0in\u00a0addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence\u00a0in\u00a0the United States.\u201d",
      "One of Khalil's attorneys, Marc Van Der Hout, previously said such government claims are \"baseless allegations in an attempt to hide from the fact that its true motivation in bringing all these charges against Mahmoud is to silence him.\"",
      "Mischaracterization of Khalil's work history",
      "The government case includes Khalil\u2019s permanent residency application from March 2024.",
      "In the application, Khalil wrote that he was a graduate student at Columbia University and was a program manager at the British Embassy in Beirut from June 2018 to December 2022.",
      "The Trump administration alleged Khalil also omitted \u201ccontinued employment\" at the British Embassy in Beirut \"beyond 2022.\" As evidence, the government cited an image of a profile of Khalil published for the Society for International Development\u2019s upcoming conference in June 2025. The profile stated he works at the embassy.",
      "But a spokesperson for Britain's Commonwealth and Development Office said in a comment to NBC News that Khalil \u201cdoes not work for the FCDO and has not done so for over two years.\u201d",
      "Khalil\u2019s \u201cextension of fixed term contract\u201d with the British Embassy in Beirut includes an extension until Dec. 20, 2022. The contract is dated Nov. 1, 2022, and the British Embassy in Beirut seal is stamped on the document. Signatures from both the head of corporate service and Khalil appear on the document.",
      "The Society for International Development, organizers of the conference, said in a statement that Khalil was not scheduled to participate in the upcoming event in June, though he did participate in 2020.",
      "The government alleged Khalil also failed to disclose he was a \u201cpolitical affairs officer\u201d at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, known as UNRWA, in New York in 2023, and was involved with the group Columbia University Apartheid Divest.",
      "The Trump administration cited articles, including from the New York Post, stating Khalil was a political affairs officer at UNRWA based on his LinkedIn profile.",
      "A spokesperson for UNRWA said Khalil completed a six-month unpaid internship in New York in 2023. The spokesperson added that he was not a staff member, nor was he ever on the agency\u2019s payroll.",
      "\u201cUNRWA does not have in its Human Resources the job title of \u2018Political Affairs Officer,'\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Khalil\u2019s legal team also submitted into evidence a letter from UNRWA to Columbia University informing the school that Khalil was \u201cselected for an internship at the Representative Office of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for internship at the Representative Office of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in New York.\u201d It was dated May 17, 2023.",
      "In another letter entered into evidence, Columbia University said Khalil completed an internship at UNRWA for three credits in 2023. The letter is dated April 10, 2025, and signed by an associate director of Khalil\u2019s graduate program.",
      "Columbia University declined to comment Monday, citing student privacy obligations.",
      "Government relied on tabloid stories",
      "Similarly, the government cited several articles as evidence, including from the New York Post, The Times of India, and the Washington Free Beacon, mentioning Khalil\u2019s involvement with the group Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), which the government said he omitted from his residency application.",
      "The articles were published in late April 2024 and after \u2014 a month after Khalil submitted his permanent residency application.",
      "A New York Post article published on March 9, 2025, and cited as evidence by the government, said Khalil fronted a \u201cradical group, Columbia United Apartheid Divest (CUAD), which sympathizes with terror groups like Hamas and Hezbollah and calls for the \u2018end of Western civilization.\u2019\u201d",
      "Khalil was a negotiator and spokesperson for the Columbia University student protesters, which included CUAD among a coalition\u00a0of groups at Columbia participating in the on-campus actions, Van Der Hout previously said.",
      "\u201cCUAD is a collection of organizations and there is no individual membership, so the allegation would be completely meritless even if all of the government\u2019s evidence were not from a month after Mahmoud submitted his application,\" Van Der Hout said.",
      "Khalil has until April 23 to file for relief and can remain in the United States until then."

    "summary": "Just eight days after Paige Bueckers led Connecticut to the NCAA championship, the star guard was selected first overall by Dallas in Monday\u2019s WNBA draft.",
    "story": [
      "Paige Bueckers will begin her WNBA career the same way she ended her time in college: No. 1.",
      "Dallas led off the three-round, 38-pick WNBA draft Monday in New York by selecting Bueckers first overall, as expected, just eight days after she led Connecticut to the NCAA championship.",
      "\u201cDallas, I\u2019m so excited,\u201d Bueckers said on the ESPN broadcast minutes after she was drafted. \u201cA new city, a new start, a fresh start, and so I\u2019m excited. Let\u2019s get it.\u201d",
      "Bueckers said she had an \u201coverwhelming sense of gratitude\u201d for being selected first after a collegiate career in which injuries often sidelined her.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t do it alone,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it took a village.\u201d",
      "Seattle selected French center Dominique Malonga second, and Washington took Notre Dame's Sonia Citron and USC's Kiki Iriafen third and fourth, respectively. At fifth overall, Lithuanian guard Juste Jocyte became the first draft pick taken in the history of the Golden State Valkyries, the expansion franchise set to play its first season in 2025. Like Malonga, Jocyte is a 19-year-old who will enter the league younger than their collegiate counterparts.",
      "Bueckers averaged 19.8 points, shooting 53% from the field and 42% on 3-pointers during her superlative four-year career at UConn, which ended with her winning her long-elusive national title \u2014 Connecticut\u2019s first in nine years \u2014 in her final game.",
      "Bueckers put herself in contention to become a future No. 1 overall pick as early as 2021 after she became the first freshman to win multiple awards for collegiate player of the year. Yet leg injuries sidelined her for half of her sophomore season, and then in the following offseason she tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee and missed the entire 2022-23 season.",
      "The Wings picked first after they finished 9-31 last season, the WNBA\u2019s second-worst record. As Connecticut was preparing for the Final Four of the NCAA women\u2019s basketball tournament last week, Bueckers was tight-lipped when she was asked about speculation that she didn\u2019t prefer to play in Dallas, saying there was \u201cnowhere specific\u201d she wanted to be.",
      "\u201cWherever I end up,\u201d Bueckers told reporters days before the Huskies\u2019 championship victory in Tampa, Florida.",
      "The Wings made little secret their intention to draft Bueckers and the excitement it could generate for a franchise that is trying to build buy-in from local fans. The team originated as the Detroit Shock in 1998, moved to Tulsa in 2010 and relocated again to Texas in 2016. It currently plays in Arlington.",
      "Greg Bibb, the Wings\u2019s president and chief executive, told The Dallas Morning News before the draft that he was confident drafting Bueckers \"will move the needle for the Dallas Wings and women\u2019s basketball in north Texas.\u201d",
      "The WNBA won\u2019t be the only league in which Bueckers plays next year. On Sunday, she reportedly agreed to a three-year contract to play in Unrivaled, a start-up league founded by WNBA stars Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart that takes part during the WNBA\u2019s winter offseason.",
      "Whether Bueckers would actually end up with the Wings wasn\u2019t the only intrigue involving the draft. Notre Dame\u2019s Olivia Miles, projected to be the second overall pick, LSU\u2019s Flau\u2019Jae Johnson and Connecticut\u2019s Azzi Fudd all have said they will remain in college an extra season rather than turn professional. Those choices could be influenced by the Women\u2019s National Basketball Players\u2019 Association\u2019s decision in October to opt out of its current college bargaining agreement with the league.

      "At 26, Smith brings that same buoyant spirit to his job in maintenance at the Shepherd Hotel in downtown Clemson, South Carolina, where he greets guests with warmth and enthusiasm.",
      "In a recent phone interview, his mother, Nicci Smith \u2014 a former nurse turned fitness instructor \u2014 recalls casually stumbling upon her son in the middle of a\u00a0FaceTime call with actor Mark Wahlberg.",
      "Wahlberg, she explains, has a daughter enrolled at Clemson University, and Tanner struck up a conversation with him in the lobby of the Shepherd Hotel, where they became fast friends.",
      "\u201cTanner can talk to anyone,\u201d Nicci tells TODAY, her voice brimming with pride. There was a time when Tanner \u2014 diagnosed with autism at 2-and-a-half \u2014 wouldn\u2019t make eye contact with teachers and peers. As child, while the other kids rushed to the slide, Tanner would quietly drift toward the swings.",
      "\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t me or a family member, he would turn his face away,\u201d Nicci says. \u201cThe world is seeing happy, social Tanner now, but there were years when he didn\u2019t play with other children. I couldn\u2019t take him to basketball games because the buzzers were too loud. And every time we went out as a family, we were all on edge \u2014 wondering what might upset Tanner.\u201d",
      "Looking at Tanner today, Nicci is still in disbelief. A graduate of\u00a0Clemson University\u2019s LifeSkills program, he\u2019s living with roommates, thriving in a job that he loves and stepping bravely into the spotlight \u2014 putting himself out there as he searches for love on streaming television.",
      "\u201cIf you had told me when Tanner was a little boy that he would be doing now what he\u2019s doing now,\u201d she says, \u201che\u2019s a freaking miracle.\u201d",
      "The date that made her squirm",
      "In Season 3 of \u201cLove on the Spectrum,\u201d viewers \u2014 including Nicci \u2014 tuned in as Tanner embarked on a blind date with Shyann at a goat farm. Though the two bonded over their shared love of animals, the exchange was punctuated by awkward pauses. Ultimately, Tanner realized their personalities didn\u2019t quite align; he was looking for someone outgoing and talkative, while Shyann was more reserved and soft-spoken.",
      "\u201cTo me, that date was very uncomfortable, because I know him,\u201d Nicci says. \u201cI felt bad for both of them \u2014 I think she had a bit of stage fright and didn\u2019t know what to say, and he felt like it was his responsibility to carry the conversation but didn\u2019t know how to draw her out.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody sees Tanner as the happy, joyful guy,\u201d she says. \u201cBut when you\u2019re autistic, anxiety is always there \u2014 and he was really struggling. I was ready for the goat date to be over. It just wasn\u2019t clicking. But he learned from it, and he did a good job.\u201d"

    "summary": "A San Diego summit offered treatments that promised to help heal autism, a condition the attendees believe is caused by vaccines, though science says otherwise.",
    "story": [
      "SAN DIEGO \u2014 The attendees of the second-annual Autism Health Summit had already sat through hours of presentations about treatments that promise miracles to help heal the condition \u2014 water filters and electromagnetic gadgets, supplements, stem cell treatments only available in Europe, and fecal transplants here in the U.S.",
      "Of all the speakers at the conference, the one who got the biggest round of applause wasn\u2019t even in the room.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former fixture at this kind of gathering, addressed the audience in a short, prerecorded video \u2014 not as the anti-vaccine lawyer and activist as he had so many times before, but as a member of President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet, the secretary of health and human Services.",
      "And from that seat of power, Kennedy affirmed he was still their man, praising summit organizers Tracey and Steve Slepcevic as \u201cdear friends\u201d who had \u201cgiven their lives in service to the autistic and their families.\"",
      "\u201cYour issue is no longer on the fringe,\u201d he said, finishing with a promise of a future \u201cwhere autism is once again, very rare, where families with autism are well supported, where people on the spectrum are valued for the unique gifts they have to offer in our society.\u201d",
      "These types of gatherings are on the rise. While they may advertise different themes, there\u2019s a shared belief system among them: a rejection of mainstream science, skepticism about the government and loud complaints that the powerful are hiding something from the everyday American.",
      "With Kennedy now in Washington, and the president himself suggesting there\u2019s merit to those claims, the gatherings are becoming less fringe and more politically relevant.",
      "The conference room at the Town and Country hotel was already abuzz with Kennedy\u2019s latest bombshell. While rattling off his department\u2019s early endeavors at a televised Cabinet meeting last week \u2014 they included getting \u201cbad chemicals\u201d out of food and \u201cgood food\u201d into school lunches \u2014 he stated plainly that he would, in five months, discover the cause of autism.",
      "\u201cBy September,\u201d he had said to the president, \u201cwe will know what has caused the autism epidemic. And we\u2019ll be able to eliminate those exposures.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat would be so big,\u201d Trump replied.",
      "And it would \u2014 if it weren\u2019t so unlikely. Kennedy later told Fox News that National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya had only just begun soliciting proposals from scientists around the world, and HHS hasn\u2019t said more about the timeline. Even if they handed out grants immediately, it would give them barely more than a season to solve a puzzle that has preoccupied researchers for over 80 years.",
      "Since Austrian-American psychiatrist Dr. Leo Kanner first gave it a name in 1943, doctors, scientists, parents, and people with autism have sought answers to the complex set of conditions that vary widely in presentation and severity. About 1 out of 36 children has been identified as having an autism spectrum disorder, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Research points to genetics as the primary factor, likely in combination with certain environmental and developmental influences that scientists are still researching.",
      "But the extensively studied and disproven theory that vaccines are to blame for autism has been embraced by parents and groups like those at the summit. The condition generally emerges during childhood, around when routine immunizations are administered. To this group, it\u2019s no coincidence.",
      "Science isn\u2019t built to prove a universal negative. Every variable cannot be tested in every circumstance across all time. So it is that despite large, peer-reviewed studies in the U.S., Japan, Denmark, and elsewhere showing no causal link between vaccines and autism, it\u2019s never been proven to the satisfaction of the anti-vaccine community.",
      "The question has also been litigated, and claims have fallen short against the overwhelming evidence presented by doctors and scientists. Still, because there\u2019s always a sliver of possibility \u2014 however remote \u2014 that something could be true somewhere, somehow, the theory persists.",
      "Before his autism announcement, Kennedy\u2019s short tenure as HHS secretary had already stirred condemnation among public health experts who said that his anti-vaccine views undermined trust in science.",
      "Author James Terence Fisher, who has an autistic son, said in an op-ed in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Kennedy\u2019s rise to power had \u201cre-traumatized\u201d many autism families and warned that the administration could make people like his son \u201cguinea pigs for experiments and treatments based on conspiratorial and money-making theories that have frequently led to abusive and ineffective treatments.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s happened before, he wrote. Andrew Wakefield, the British former physician whose retracted 1998 study in The Lancet helped launch the modern anti-vaccine movement, used \u201cinvasive and demeaning techniques,\u201d Fischer wrote, adding that Wakefield had paid children at his own child\u2019s birthday party for blood samples.",
      "Kennedy's faithful bristled when he recently recommended that children in Texas get vaccinated to protect against measles, after an outbreak there sickened hundreds and killed at least two. To them, the guidance was a betrayal of a movement he helped create.",
      "But with Kennedy's promise to root out and eliminate by this fall the specific environmental causes of autism \u2014 whether in food, water or, as Trump suggested at the Cabinet meeting, \u201cthe shots\u201d\u2014 Kennedy offered a return to the foundational myth of the modern anti-vaccine movement.",
      "The crowd at the Autism Health Summit heard him loud and clear, and now they were on their feet.",
      "The three-day summit didn\u2019t have an option for press coverage on its website, so I paid the $395 for a ticket using my name and work email. I wore my name badge and introduced myself as a journalist, handing out my business card to everyone I spoke with. Photos and videos were permitted, and the event was livestreamed to remote attendees.",
      "Advertised as a \u201cjourney to wellness,\u201d the Autism Health Summit was one of several anti-vaccine-adjacent events to take place in recent weeks. The Summit for Truth & Wellness was held at the end of March in Rochester, New York. Drs. Pierre Kory and Mary Talley Bowden, both known for prescribing Ivermectin for Covid-19 and long Covid despite a lack of evidence, shared a stage with the writer and conspiracy theorist Naomi Wolf and Mary Holland, president of the Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group Kennedy once chaired.",
      "Earlier this month, a hotel in Atlanta hosted Honest Medicine: Redefining Health, a conference organized by the Independent Medical Alliance \u2014 formerly the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, a group whose doctors prescribe anti-viral medications that go against medical consensus. Some of their doctors have been disciplined by medical boards for spreading misinformation.",
      "There used to be just one such marquee gathering. AutismOne, held annually by a nonprofit of the same name in a Chicago hotel near the airport, was the flagship convention for self-described Autism Moms and Dads. But with the growth of other anti-vaccine groups that thrived during the pandemic \u2014 including Kennedy\u2019s own Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 and the ease of online organizing, AutismOne\u2019s funding dried up. It quietly dissolved in January.",
      "Into that void stepped Tracy Slepcevic, an Air Force veteran and author of the book \"Warrior Mom\" (not to be confused with former anti-vaccine spokeswoman Jenny McCarthy\u2019s \"Mother Warriors\"). Slepcevic supported Kennedy\u2019s failed run for president in 2024 and registered Autism Health Inc. as a nonprofit last year. She currently coaches other parents on how to \u201cheal\u201d their autistic kids.",
      "She said she tried hyperbaric oxygen, special diets, stem cell therapy and \u201ceverything but the kitchen sink\u201d to \u201cheal\u201d her now-adult son\u2019s autism, which she believes was caused by vaccines.",
      "Slepcevic told the crowd that she spent all the money she had, even short-selling her house to pay for the treatments.",
      "\u201cIf anyone says, \u2018I can\u2019t afford it,\u2019 I\u2019m not going to feel sorry for you,\u201d Slepcevic said from the stage.",
      "After a song performed by movement stalwarts Geoff and Simone Sewell, Slepcevic called up a couple to the stage \u2014 her new clients, she explained.",
      "The father told the crowd that after just two weeks of following Slepcevic\u2019s advice restricting dairy and cutting out apple juice, their 6-year-old son had seemed to improve.",
      "He spoke of how they had been lost and hopeless and sad. They were depressed, just like many in the crowd, he suspected. But now, they were optimistic.",
      "They were going to do whatever it takes, he said.",
      "They were going to be warrior parents.",
      "Outside the ballroom were the vendors, about 50 tables packed together, all offering the same message: healing was possible \u2014 for a price.",
      "Each table pushed a product or service promising some pathway to wellness. There were water filters \u2014 one to detoxify, another to \u201calkalize\u201d\u2014 and a nearly $6,000 electromagnetic gadget that claimed to improve circulation.",
      "Contraptions emitted infrared light or pulsed electromagnetic fields. Supplement kits promised to flush out mold, heavy metals and microplastics. Vibrating plates were pitched as neurological reset tools. And there were countless devices \u2014 necklaces, patches, laptop shields, pet collars and full-body blankets \u2014 meant to block 5G, electromagnetic fields and radiation, including the Wi-Fi all around us.",
      "Alongside the gadgets were services, too \u2014 nutritionists offering on-the-spot consultations, sessions in a hyperbaric chamber and one vendor advertising something described as a \u201cblood oil change.\u201d"

I want to call them in,\u201d Suzanne Ford, the executive director of San Francisco Pride, said of disappearing sponsors. \u201cWe will remember who stood by us and who didn\u2019t. When it was politically popular, they were lined up.\u201d",
      "Eve Keller, co-president of USA Prides, a national network of LGBTQ Pride organizers, said members across the country have reported receiving significantly less in sponsorship dollars this year. Some of the smaller, rural Prides are down 70% to 90% when compared to the average year, she said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying not to sound a huge alarm or to make this the only focus, but when we are down money, we\u2019re down safety and security and accessibility as well,\u201d she said, adding that most Prides don\u2019t want to make any cuts to their security measures, so instead they are holding fewer and smaller events.",

      "Last month, Pride St. Louis announced Anheuser-Busch declined to sponsor the organization\u2019s annual PrideFest in St. Louis, where the brewing company is based, after a more than 30-year partnership. The announcement\u00a0also noted\u00a0that \u201cfunding has been coming in well below expectations,\u201d leaving Pride St. Louis more than $150,000 short of last year\u2019s total Pride budget, which organizers told NBC News was about $480,000.",
      "However, on Wednesday, Pride St. Louis\u2019 DEI and outreach director, Jordan Braxton, said the organization made up almost all of that deficit with an outpouring of individual donations. The loss of the Anheuser-Busch partnership is still \u201cdevastating,\u201d Braxton said, because it sends a hurtful message to the community that the company\u2019s support is dependent on who is president.",
      "Anheuser-Busch did not return requests for comment.",
      "The organizers of several of the country\u2019s premier Pride celebrations told NBC News they have also lost funding from corporate sponsors this year, to the tune of $200,000 to $350,000 each. For some larger organizations \u2014 like those in New York City and San Francisco \u2014 the shortage makes up about 10% of their total Pride event budget, while for others, like St. Pete Pride in Florida, it could be about half.",
      "Some organizers said past sponsors that are not returning or are reducing their sponsorship amounts this year have cited the political climate and the Trump administration\u2019s hostility toward DEI and the LGBTQ community, while others have cited fear of an economic recession. Some didn\u2019t provide any reasons at all, organizers said.",
      "Bob Witeck, president of Witeck Communications, a firm specializing in LGBTQ marketing, said he isn\u2019t surprised that corporations are reducing or withdrawing Pride sponsorships this year, because many of them are feeling vulnerable to \u201cunfair and uninvited attacks.\u201d He said publicly regulated businesses and those that work directly with federal agencies and under contracts \u201care more vulnerable to possible litigation as well as facing potential losses.\u201d",
      "Ford\u00a0said several companies that had agreed to sponsor this year\u2019s San Francisco Pride march had withdrawn: Anheuser-Busch, Comcast, Diageo and Nissan. Those sponsorships add up to about $300,000, Ford estimated.",
      "The total budget for this year\u2019s celebration, she said, is $3.2 million, and the nonprofit had hoped to raise about $2.3 million of that through corporate sponsorships, with the remainder coming from individual donations, beverage sales and other means. So far, corporate sponsors have committed $1.25 million, Ford said, adding that San Francisco Pride is still waiting to hear back from several large companies that have sponsored in the past.",
      "Lloryn Love-Carter, a spokesperson for Nissan, said the company is \u201ccurrently reviewing all marketing and sales spending, including auto shows, sports properties and other entertainment activations, to maximize both efficiency and breakthrough effectiveness.\u201d Love-Carter added that \u201cNissan remains committed to promoting an inclusive culture for employees, consumers, dealers and other key stakeholders.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Diageo said there were some changes to the company\u2019s sponsorships budget in California, but that the company was still going to be active around San Francisco for Pride Month in June and would be involved in Pride events around the country through its Smirnoff vodka brand.",
      "A spokesperson for Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, the parent company of NBC News, declined to comment on why the company isn't sponsoring San Francisco Pride this year. The spokesperson said local teams make their own sponsorship decisions and noted the company's California team is sponsoring other Pride celebrations in the state including Silicon Valley Pride, Oakland Pride and events associated with San Francisco Pride that are hosted by other nonprofits.",

      "Corporations began increasingly supporting Pride festivities in the years following the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision in favor of same-sex marriage. A few years ago, large companies had become so ubiquitous at major Pride events \u2014 with their logos emblazoned on everything from floats to paper fans \u2014 that some revelers began to lament the so-called corporatization of Pride, or what became known as \u201crainbow capitalism.\u201d",
      "However, over the last two years \u2014 as dozens of states have passed legislation restricting LGBTQ rights and conservative influencers have targeted pro-LGBTQ companies \u2014 the landscape has shifted, and some companies are leaning away from publicly supporting the community.",
      "Anheuser-Busch and Target faced particularly intense conservative pressure in 2023: Anheuser-Busch for its Bud Light partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, and Target for some of the offerings in its annual Pride collection.",
      "President Donald Trump further fueled the corporate retreat from Pride initiatives with a series of executive orders from his first day in office. In one order, Trump declared DEI initiatives \u201cillegal and immoral\u201d and barred the government from funding them. In another, he prohibited federal funds from promoting \u201cgender ideology,\u201d which has become a right-wing term to refer to transgender people and their rights.",
      "At the same time, many big corporations are facing economic headwinds, including the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to reduce government spending and the implementation of tariffs that have roiled the markets.",
      "Byron Green, the board president of St. Pete Pride in St. Petersburg, Florida, said no sponsors have officially pulled their support for the annual event, though he hasn\u2019t yet heard from many of them. Some have had to significantly reduce their sponsorships, Green said, including one major donor who previously gave $40,000 to $60,000 and is only donating about $10,000 this year.",

      "In the past, the nonprofit has relied entirely on corporate sponsors to cover the $600,000-$700,000 budget for Pride events held throughout the month of June, including its annual parade, which draws hundreds of thousands of attendees. So far, the nonprofit has received about half of that, according to Green.",
      "\u201cWe are navigating what feels like a tightrope,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we create the experience that is the largest Pride in the state of Florida and one of the largest in the Southeast and the pace of dollars coming in is drastically less than it has been in the past?\u201d",
      "Ryan Bos is the executive director of Capital Pride Alliance, which organizes annual Pride celebrations in Washington, D.C., and will host this year\u2019s WorldPride, an international celebration that is held in a new location every two years. Bos said the nonprofit was in talks with Target \u2014 which sponsored WorldPride in New York City in 2019 and has sponsored D.C.\u2019s Capital Pride march in the past \u2014 but the company ultimately decided to pass.",

      "Kevin Kilbride, the media marketing manager of NYC Pride, said the budget for the organization\u2019s annual Pride events in June is usually between $3 million and $6 million. Last year\u2019s budget was $4.6 million, and this year\u2019s will be about $3.5 million, he said.",
      "Kilbride said about two-thirds of the organization\u2019s previous sponsors have reaffirmed their support for this year\u2019s events, which include one of the largest LGBTQ Pride marches in the world.\u00a0As of\u00a0Thursday, he said, one-third of the organization\u2019s total partners had either pulled, scaled back or not yet finalized their funding commitments.\u00a0As a result,\u00a0NYC Pride is looking at a $350,000 dip in sponsorship funding, he said.",
      "\u201cA lot of it still is in the air at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cFolks are just moving a little bit more strategically and slowly than usual ... and I think it\u2019s a combination of the political environment, folks not sure what the repercussions would be, if any, but also the economy as well.\u201d",
      "Target is still sponsoring New York City\u2019s annual LGBTQ Pride march, Kilbride said, though he noted the company has \u201cchosen to take a silent partnership role,\u201d and as a result is not listed as a sponsor on its website.",

      "Otto said Twin Cities Pride, which typically spends about $800,000 on its annual Pride festival, is currently short about $200,000. In addition to declining Target\u2019s donation, Otto said the organization had one big sponsor back out of negotiations and has not heard from several of its past sponsors yet. As a result, he said, this year\u2019s festival will feature three stages for performances instead of its usual four.",
      "The organizers of San Francisco Pride, which hosts a concert, parade and street fair the last weekend of June, usually start planning the three-day event nearly a year in advance, Ford said. As a result, she said, any potential funding shortage won\u2019t affect this year\u2019s events.",

      "A video shot of their enclosure at the park Monday morning shows the five African elephants standing around in the morning sun before the camera shakes and they run in different directions. Then the older elephants \u2014 Ndlula, Umngani, Khosi \u2014 scramble to encircle and shield the two 7-year-old calves Zuli and Mkhaya from any possible threats.",
      "They remain huddled for several minutes as the older elephants look outward, appearing to be at the ready, their ears spread and flapping \u2014 even after the rocking stopped.",
      "The quake was felt from San Diego to Los Angeles, 120 miles away. It sent boulders tumbling onto rural roads in San Diego County and knocked items off store shelves in the tiny mountain town of Julian near the epicenter but caused no injuries or major damage.",
      "But it spooked the elephants.",
      "Once in a circle, \u201cthey sort of freeze as they gather information about where the danger is,\u201d said Mindy Albright, a curator of mammals at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park.",

      "Meanwhile, the female elephant, Khosi, a teenager who helped raise him along with his biological mother, Ndlula, repeatedly tapped him on the back with her trunk, and even on the face, as if patting him to say, \u201cThings are OK,\u201d and \u201cStay back in the circle.\"",

      "The former Columbia University student arrested on campus and slated for deportation has filed evidence that shows claims underlying the government's case are dubious.",
      "NBC News reviewed over 100 pages of documents submitted by the federal government in its effort to deport Mahmoud Khalil, as well as evidence filed by Khalil\u2019s legal team, including his permanent residency application, several\u00a0articles about his activism and contracts and letters detailing internship and work experience.",
      "In some instances, the government appears to be relying on unverified tabloid articles about Khalil. In others, the government\u2019s claims about him are clearly erroneous because timelines don\u2019t match.",
      "Lawyers for Khalil, a 30-year-old permanent U.S. resident, have contended he was arrested on March 8 for his protected speech and  for playing a key role in the pro-Palestinian student protest movement last year.",
      "Khalil\u2019s legal team declined to comment for this article.",
      "The administration of President Donald Trump \u2014 which says it has revoked the visas of hundreds of international students, particularly targeting those who take part in political activism \u2014 has presented shifting arguments against Khalil, including claims two weeks after his arrest that he lied on U.S. residency application forms, a deportable offense.",
      "Ultimately, government officials said Khalil supported Hamas, a terrorist group; made Jewish students feel unsafe with his activism; and that his continued presence \u201cwould have serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "Khalil decried antisemitism",
      "Immigration Judge Jamee Comans ruled last week that Khalil can be deported at the discretion of Secretary of State Marco Rubio under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which states any noncitizen can be removed if the secretary of state deems their presence threatens U.S. foreign policy.",
      "Rubio characterized Khalil's activities as antisemitic and, thus, contrary to U.S. foreign policy. Comans shot down a defense attempt to obtain underlying evidence and question Rubio.",
      "Khalil\u2019s attorney submitted evidence rebuking allegations of antisemitism in the Rubio memo.",
      "Khalil\u2019s legal team cited an April 2024 CNN article as evidence. In it, Khalil was asked what he would say to Jewish students who felt unsafe on campus.",
      "\"I would say that the liberation of Palestine and the Palestinians and the Jewish people are intertwined,\" he responded. \"They go hand in hand. Anti-Semitism and any form of racism has no place on campus and in this movement.\"",
      "In the article, Khalil also noted that some members of Columbia\u2019s protest encampment last year were Jewish and held Passover seders.\u00a0\"They are an integral part of this movement,\" Khalil said.",
      "Rubio\u2019s memo \u2014 which is the government\u2019s main piece of evidence in its deportation case against Khalil \u2014 said that while\u00a0Khalil\u2019s beliefs, statements, or associations were \u201cotherwise lawful,\u201d\u00a0allowing him to remain\u00a0in\u00a0the country would\u00a0undermine \u201cU.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and\u00a0in\u00a0the United States,\u00a0in\u00a0addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence\u00a0in\u00a0the United States.\u201d",
      "One of Khalil's attorneys, Marc Van Der Hout, previously said such government claims are \"baseless allegations in an attempt to hide from the fact that its true motivation in bringing all these charges against Mahmoud is to silence him.\"",
      "Mischaracterization of Khalil's work history",
      "The government case includes Khalil\u2019s permanent residency application from March 2024.",
      "In the application, Khalil wrote that he was a graduate student at Columbia University and was a program manager at the British Embassy in Beirut from June 2018 to December 2022.",
      "The Trump administration alleged Khalil also omitted \u201ccontinued employment\" at the British Embassy in Beirut \"beyond 2022.\" As evidence, the government cited an image of a profile of Khalil published for the Society for International Development\u2019s upcoming conference in June 2025. The profile stated he works at the embassy.",
      "But a spokesperson for Britain's Commonwealth and Development Office said in a comment to NBC News that Khalil \u201cdoes not work for the FCDO and has not done so for over two years.\u201d",
      "Khalil\u2019s \u201cextension of fixed term contract\u201d with the British Embassy in Beirut includes an extension until Dec. 20, 2022. The contract is dated Nov. 1, 2022, and the British Embassy in Beirut seal is stamped on the document. Signatures from both the head of corporate service and Khalil appear on the document.",
      "The Society for International Development, organizers of the conference, said in a statement that Khalil was not scheduled to participate in the upcoming event in June, though he did participate in 2020.",
      "The government alleged Khalil also failed to disclose he was a \u201cpolitical affairs officer\u201d at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, known as UNRWA, in New York in 2023, and was involved with the group Columbia University Apartheid Divest.",
      "The Trump administration cited articles, including from the New York Post, stating Khalil was a political affairs officer at UNRWA based on his LinkedIn profile.",
      "A spokesperson for UNRWA said Khalil completed a six-month unpaid internship in New York in 2023. The spokesperson added that he was not a staff member, nor was he ever on the agency\u2019s payroll.",
      "\u201cUNRWA does not have in its Human Resources the job title of \u2018Political Affairs Officer,'\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Khalil\u2019s legal team also submitted into evidence a letter from UNRWA to Columbia University informing the school that Khalil was \u201cselected for an internship at the Representative Office of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for internship at the Representative Office of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in New York.\u201d It was dated May 17, 2023.",
      "In another letter entered into evidence, Columbia University said Khalil completed an internship at UNRWA for three credits in 2023. The letter is dated April 10, 2025, and signed by an associate director of Khalil\u2019s graduate program.",
      "Columbia University declined to comment Monday, citing student privacy obligations.",
      "Government relied on tabloid stories",
      "Similarly, the government cited several articles as evidence, including from the New York Post, The Times of India, and the Washington Free Beacon, mentioning Khalil\u2019s involvement with the group Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), which the government said he omitted from his residency application.",
      "The articles were published in late April 2024 and after \u2014 a month after Khalil submitted his permanent residency application.",
      "A New York Post article published on March 9, 2025, and cited as evidence by the government, said Khalil fronted a \u201cradical group, Columbia United Apartheid Divest (CUAD), which sympathizes with terror groups like Hamas and Hezbollah and calls for the \u2018end of Western civilization.\u2019\u201d",
      "Khalil was a negotiator and spokesperson for the Columbia University student protesters, which included CUAD among a coalition\u00a0of groups at Columbia participating in the on-campus actions, Van Der Hout previously said.",
      "\u201cCUAD is a collection of organizations and there is no individual membership, so the allegation would be completely meritless even if all of the government\u2019s evidence were not from a month after Mahmoud submitted his application,\" Van Der Hout said.",
      "Khalil has until April 23 to file for relief and can remain in the United States until then."

      "Andrew Buen was convicted in February of criminally negligent homicide in the 2022 death of Christian Glass, which drew national attention and prompted calls to reform how authorities respond to people with mental health problems.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Buen needlessly escalated a standoff with Glass, who showed signs of a mental health crisis and refused orders to get out of his SUV near Silver Plume, a small, former mining town along Interstate 70 in the Rocky Mountains west of Denver.",

Police identified the suspect as Cody Balmer, 38.",

      "Balmer surrendered to state police Sunday\u00a0afternoon after, authorities said, an ex-girlfriend also called police. He was charged with attempted criminal homicide, aggravated arson, burglary, terrorism and other counts, the Dauphin County District Attorney's Office said Monday.",
      "Balmer told police that had he located Shapiro, \"he would have beaten him with his hammer,\" according to a probable cause affidavit, which added that \"Balmer admitted to harboring hatred\" toward Shapiro. Officials didn't provide additional detail.",
      "Investigators say they are reviewing security measures at the property to prevent such an attack from happening again.\"We look at all aspects, personnel, technical, surveillance equipment, security equipment, all of that will be reviewed, and we will do our best to ensure that the governor and his family are safe in this residence,\" State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens told reporters Sunday.",
      "The 29\u200b,000-square-foot Georgian-style brick mansion has been home to eight governors and their families over the years. It sits close to the Susquehanna River, just off a street accessible to cars.",
      "\"It is wide open to the public,\" Walp said. \"If you're driving down the street, you stop the car, you open the door and you jump over the fence. It's not way back in.\"",
      "Authorities say Balmer was dressed in black and carrying a bag when, they say, he climbed the nearly 7-foot-high iron fence that surrounds the property. (Such a security breach has been more commonly associated with the White House over the years.)",
      "Cameras are installed throughout the grounds of the Governor's Residence.",
      "At the time, security \"knew that there had been a breach on the property, and we were searching to determine what had occurred,\" Bivens said.",
      "The intruder, however, \"actively evaded troopers who were here to secure the residence,\" he added, \"even while they were searching for him on the property.\"",
      "During that time, Balmer used a hammer to break the windows of a piano room on the home's south side, police allege, and then tossed a Molotov cocktail that set off a \"substantial fire.\"",
      "He went to an adjacent window and broke the glass before he entered inside, where he deployed another device in the dining room, causing a second fire, the probable cause affidavit says. He fled the home through an exit in the room and climbed back over the perimeter fence, investigators added.",
      "\"That was all playing out over a period of several minutes,\" Bivens said, and it was a \"very quick event that occurred.\"",
      "Shapiro recounted Sunday that he and his family awoke to the noise of a state trooper banging on their door to guide them to safety.",
      "On Monday, Harrisburg Fire Chief Brian Enterline said a closed door in the area of the residence where the fires were set helped contain the flames and prevent the blaze from rapidly spreading down a hallway.",
      "Had that door been open, it \"would have definitely put the governor at even greater risk,\" Enterline told reporters.",
      "Given the size of the grounds, especially at night, it's possible that security wouldn't have immediately located the intruder, law enforcement experts say.",
      "But whether it could have gotten to the intruder sooner, before he was even able to break into the home, must be assessed, they added.",
      "\"From a professional security perspective, the fact that the individual was able to scale the fence and do what he did, that's not security,\" Walp said. \"Security should be free of danger and threat, and it shows a hole that needs to be corrected, and I'm sure the state police will correct it.\"",
      "He added that officials must determine whether more security personnel are needed and where they should be placed at the residence.",
      "\"Obviously, for this situation, security needs to be tightened up,\" he said.",
      "Jeffrey Miller, who was the state police commissioner under Gov. Ed Rendell in the 2000s, said determining whether more security is necessary for top public officials and for how long can be complicated since it involves the use of taxpayer money.",
      "Security details for past Pennsylvania governors and lieutenant governors have cost millions of dollars a year, although Shapiro's predecessor, Tom Wolf, reportedly paid for his own. Such costs also come amid a heightened political climate, when online threats have turned into dangerous swatting incidents and assassination attempts against leaders and their families.",
      "\"The divisive nature of political rhetoric in our country has contributed to an increase in both threats, as well as political violence,\" Miller said. \"People say a lot of things, post a lot of things, make a lot of threats. And you have to cut through that and try to determine which ones are the ones that you really have to be concerned about.\""

      "\u201cTanner can talk to anyone,\u201d Nicci tells TODAY, her voice brimming with pride. There was a time when Tanner \u2014 diagnosed with autism at 2-and-a-half \u2014 wouldn\u2019t make eye contact with teachers and peers. As child, while the other kids rushed to the slide, Tanner would quietly drift toward the swings.",

I couldn\u2019t take him to basketball games because the buzzers were too loud. And every time we went out as a family, we were all on edge \u2014 wondering what might upset Tanner.\u201d",

      "But Gail \u2014 and Joel \u2014 have a connection to another character: Eugene. During their first session together, Gail tells Joel, \u201cYou killed Eugene \u2026 I hate you for it.\u201d",
      "So, who is this newcomer to the hit killer fungus series, based on a video game of the same name, and why is he important? Let\u2019s find out.",
      "Who is Eugene in \u2018The Last of Us\u2019 video game?",
      "\u201cThe Last of Us\u201d started as a video game series in 2013. (There\u2019s a \u201cLast of Us: Left Behind,\u201d \u201cLast of Us Part II,\u201d and a remake of the first one called \u201cLast of Us Part 1,\u201d too.)",
      "Eugene isn\u2019t a major character, though, and he doesn\u2019t show up until \u201cThe Last of Us Part II.\u201d",
      "In \u201cPart II,\u201d Eugene was a friend of Tommy\u2019s (Joel\u2019s brother), a former Firefly-turned-patrolman living in Jackson, Wyoming. He\u2019d left his wife Claire and a daughter to fight in the rebellion, which left him lonely as he grew older.",
      "While in Jackson, Eugene became close friends with Dina (played by Isabela Merced in the show); in the game she says he taught her about things like electronics.",
      "According to the show\u2019s lore, he died in 2038 of a stroke when he was 73.",
      "Who is Eugene in \u2018The Last of Us\u2019 TV show?",
      "Eugene gets a much bigger part in Season 2, taking these bare bone details and expanding them \u2014 like it did with Bill and Frank in the \u201cLong, Long Time\u201d bottle episode from Season 1, which won episode star Nick Offerman an Emmy.",
      "He\u2019s first mentioned when Joel goes to Gail for their therapy session. He pays her in marijuana, and she remarks that Eugene could grow weed no matter what the month of the year was. Then she notes, \u201cIt\u2019s my first birthday without my husband in 41 years.\u201d",
      "Now, \u201cLast of Us\u201d Season 2 has\u00a0jumped ahead more than five years\u00a0from\u00a0Season 1. That means that if Gail is correct in accusing Joel of killing Eugene, he\u2019s done it between seasons \u2014 and it\u2019s something we haven\u2019t seen.",
      "Gail tells Joel mid-session, \u201cYou shot and killed my husband. You killed Eugene. And I resent you for it. No. Maybe a little more than that. I hate you for it. I hate you for it. And yes, I know you had no choice. I know that. I know I should forgive you. Well I\u2019ve tried, and I can\u2019t. Because of how you did it. And looking at your face, sitting in our home, makes me so f------ angry.\u201d",
      "This might not be the ideal doctor-patient relationship.",
      "But over the seven episodes of Season 2, expect Eugene\u2019s death to have repercussions for Joel and his relationship to Ellie (Bella Ramsey).",
      "Show co-creator\u00a0Neil Druckmann told Newsweek\u00a0they wanted to give more layers to the character than exists in the video game.",
      "\u201cSomeone like Eugene, we had a take on that character to say, \u2018OK, well, how does that expand Joel and Ellie\u2019s relationship? How does it expand the town of Jackson? How does that expand what the story\u2019s about, which is this idea of love and the extremes that love can take you to?\u2019\u201d",
      "Why did Joel kill Eugene?",
      "This is unknown as of the first episode. Since Gail says \u201cI know you had no choice,\u201d there\u2019s a good chance that Eugene was infected.",
      "And let\u2019s not forget that Joel is still part of the community, so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s been ostracized for murder.",
      "But it seems that Gail has a few issues of her own to work out \u2014 and that Joel is still immersed in a dangerous, if slightly more civilized, world than we saw in Season 1.",
      "Who plays Eugene?",
      "As of yet, Eugene hasn\u2019t been seen on screen \u2014 but as they\u2019ve cast Emmy-winner Joe Pantoliano in the role, there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll see him in flashbacks in coming episodes.",
      "Pantoliano is a veteran character actor who\u2019s appeared in scores of films and TV shows, including \u201cThe Goonies,\u201d \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d \u201cMemento\u201d and \u201cBad Boys.\u201d He earned his lone Emmy in for playing Ralph on \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d in 2003."

      "The 2026 Senate map starts to take shape",
      "The next battle for the Senate majority has come into clearer focus in recent weeks, with candidates in both parties making their intentions known in high-profile races across the map.",
      "As Bridget Bowman reports, Democrats face an uphill climb to take control of the chamber in the 2026 elections: The party must reach into GOP territory to net the four seats they need, while also defending competitive seats in Georgia, Michigan and New Hampshire. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to expand their 53-47 majority while defending blue-leaning Maine and battleground North Carolina.",
      "Here\u2019s the latest on who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out and who still needs to make a decision in the top Senate contests of the cycle.",
      "Michigan: The latest piece of the puzzle fell into place Monday, with former Rep. Mike Rogers becoming the first major Republican to jump into the Michigan Senate race. He quickly snagged endorsements from Senate Majority Leader John Thune and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Tim Scott. Rogers lost to Democrat Elissa Slotkin in last year\u2019s Senate race by less than 1 percentage point.",
      "On the Democratic side, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow entered the race to replace retiring Sen. Gary Peters last week. Several other Democrats, including Rep. Haley Stevens and former Wayne County health director Abdul El-Sayed, are also considering bids.",
      "New Hampshire: Former New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu announced last week he would not run for Senate, despite encouragement from President Donald Trump. Former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown is weighing a bid in the state, where he lost a 2014 Senate race.",
      "Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas launched his Senate campaign last week, and fellow Rep. Maggie Goodlander is also still considering a run for the seat being vacated by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.",
      "North Carolina: While former Rep. Wiley Nickel announced last week he would take on Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, Democrats are waiting on former Gov. Roy Cooper to decide if will run against one of the party\u2019s top targets next year.",
      "Maine: It\u2019s a similar story for the party in Maine, with Democratic Gov. Janet Mills not ruling out a campaign against GOP Sen. Susan Collins. Democrats have struggled to defeat Collins even as they\u2019ve consistently carried Maine at the presidential level.",
      "Georgia: Likewise, the GOP is waiting on a major shoe to drop in Georgia. National Republicans have been recruiting Gov. Brian Kemp to run against Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, one of their top targets on the map. If he doesn\u2019t, it would likely open the floodgates for Republicans to enter the contest.",
      "Read more from Bridget on the Senate map, including the latest from Minnesota, Ohio and Texas \u2192",
      "Homeward bound: We could see more campaign announcements over the two-week congressional recess, with lawmakers back in their home states and districts.",
      "Alexandra Marquez reports that Republicans are largely avoiding holding in-person town halls during this period, as National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Richard Hudson has advised. According to news releases and publicly posted event notices, the majority of town halls and town hall-style events taking place over the congressional recess will be hosted by Democrats.",
      "Youth movement: In addition to the battleground races, there\u2019s also activity bubbling up in Democratic primaries amid dissatisfaction from the base over the direction of the party. Faith Wardwell and Elias Miller write that a crop of candidates in their 20s and 30s is stepping in to challenge older Democrats for their seats in Congress.",
      "A growing number of Republicans identify with the MAGA movement",
      "Recent polling from NBC News shows how President Donald Trump has consolidated the Republican Party not just around himself, but also around his broader \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement.",
      "Thirty-six percent of registered voters identified themselves as MAGA supporters in an NBC News poll conducted in March. It\u2019s a significant increase from past polling \u2014 up from 23% of respondents in a merged sample of all of NBC News\u2019 polling throughout 2023, and 27% of respondents in a merged sample of 2024 polling.",
      "The overall share is powered by the 71% of Republicans who now call themselves MAGA supporters.",
      "NBC News\u2019 polling already showed signs of a shift afoot between the beginning of the 2024 presidential primary and the final weeks before Election Day, as the GOP consolidated around Trump. In January 2024, days after Trump won nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, just 20% of registered voters said they aligned with the MAGA movement. But in NBC News\u2019 combined polling in October and early November 2024, that number ticked up to 29%.",
      "A shift among Republicans moving more into Trump\u2019s camp is primarily driving this movement, with a 16-point increase in GOPers identifying with the MAGA movement between the two polls right before the 2024 election (55%) and March this year (71%). There\u2019s also been a similar shift among college-educated men, from 21% in 2024 to 37% in March \u2014 also a 16-point increase.",
      "It\u2019s the kind of pro-Trump consolidation that led to him matching his best-ever approval rating (47%) in NBC News\u2019 March poll, though a majority of registered voters, 51%, still disapproved of his job performance.",
      "\u201cAll of that shift is coming from Republicans,\u201d said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster with Public Opinion Strategies who conducted the survey along with Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt, of Hart Research Associates.",

      "Immigration authorities detained another Columbia University student in \u201cdirect retaliation\u201d for his participation in protests against the Israel-Gaza war, his lawyer said Monday.",
      "Mohsen Mahdawi, who was born and raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank and is a U.S. permanent resident, was taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security during his naturalization interview in Vermont on Monday, the lawyer, Luna Droubi, said in a filing.",
      "Mahdawi was detained amid a widening and unprecedented crackdown on foreign students. Video posted by a Vermont lawmaker showed three officers, two of whom were masked, escorting Mahdawi in handcuffs to an SUV.",
      "Andrew Delaney, another one of his attorneys, said Mahdawi is being held in Vermont.\u00a0A petition challenging his detention says it appears he was taken into custody for deportation.",
      "A federal judge temporarily blocked his removal Monday.",
      "In a joint statement, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., called Mahdawi's detention \"immoral, inhumane and illegal.\"",
      "\"Earlier today, Mohsen Mahdawi of White River Junction, Vermont, walked into an immigration office for what was supposed to be the final step in his citizenship process,\" they said. \"Instead, he was arrested and removed in handcuffs by plainclothes, armed, individuals with their faces covered. These individuals refused to provide any information as to where he was being taken or what would happen to him.\"",
      "\"Mr. Mahdawi, a legal resident of the United States, must be afforded due process under the law and immediately released from detention,\" they added.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Department of Homeland Security referred NBC News to the State Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Citing federal privacy law, a Columbia spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "Mahdawi was detained days after an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled that Columbia student and green card holder Mahmoud Khalil can be deported \u2014 even though a federal judge in New Jersey has barred his deportation while he challenges his detention in that state.",
      "Federal officials have accused Khalil, who led students protests at Columbia, of supporting terrorists and harassing people based on their faith. The White House and federal officials have cited a rarely used provision in immigration law that allows them to \"remove aliens who pose serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d",

      "Federal officials said last month that hundreds of student visas have been revoked amid the unprecedented crackdown. An NBC News analysis has found that the students, many of whom are Middle Eastern, are from at least 29 states.",
      "According to a temporary restraining order Droubi filed for Monday, Mahdawi moved to the United States in 2014. The filing describes him as an outspoken critic of Israel's military campaign who helped organized protests at Columbia University until March 2024, when he stepped back.",
      "Mahdawi recently attended Columbia and planned to return to the school in the fall for a master's degree, according to filing."

      "\u201cTo see those walls break down and the emotions ... I had been living in the archival where I had seen so much love between these brothers, and then to just watch those walls breaking down, it was devastating to witness.\u201d",

      "The conversation, she believed, was cathartic for the Backstreet Boy member.",
      "\u201cWe just sat down and it was just a real conversation. And I think that throughout this entire film, in order for it to work, it had to be authentic. It had to be the truth and unfortunately, the truth is ugly at times,\u201d Carter Conrad said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he saw that coming. I didn\u2019t think he knew that he was going to have that reaction.\u201d",
      "She added that she left the trip and thought to herself, \u201cOh my God, I think he had a breakthrough and he needed this. This was meant to happen for him, emotionally.\u201d",
      "Frye also recalled one of the last things Nick Carter saying in the room was, \u201cWow, I really must have had to get that out.\u201d",
      "Reflecting on her own child stardom and watching the Carter archival footage, Frye tells TODAY.com, \u201cHow many times can somebody break before it just explodes?\u201d",
      "Watching hours of Nick and Aaron Carter rehearsing as children, she said she also loved acting and performing \u2014 but when is it too much?",

      "Above all else, Frye calls directing \u201cThe Carters: Hurts to Love You\u201d a \u201chealing experience\u201d and was grateful to be able to show the love the Carter siblings had for one another.",
      "\u201cThat was really important to me because I could see that there was just so much love despite all of the pain,\u201d Frye says."

      "On its April 12 episode, \"SNL\" aired a\u00a0pre-recorded political spoof called \"The White Potus.\" Though the sketch mostly poked fun at the actions of the Trump administration, it also featured cast member Sarah Sherman wearing prosthetic teeth to mock Wood's real teeth.",
      "Wood, 31, initially responded to the parody in an Instagram story, calling it \"mean and unfunny.\"",
      "But Goggins, 53, who played Wood's love interest in the third season of \"The White Lotus,\" posted his approval of the sketch on the official \"SNL\" Instagram page.",
      "\"Hahahahahhahaha Amazzzingggg,\" Goggins wrote in a since-deleted comment.",
      "Goggins' response comes amid headlines about a feud between him and his British co-star that began after eagle-eyed fans of the HBO dark comedy noticed the pair no longer follow each other on Instagram.",
      "Fans have also commented online about Goggins and Wood paying homage to their characters' romance on Instagram without tagging each other.",
      "In the \"SNL\"\u00a0sketch, guest host Jon Hamm played a slightly maniacal version of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the United States' controversial secretary of health and human services.",
      "\"What if we took all the fluoride out of the drinking water? What would that do to people\u2019s teeth?\" asks Hamm's Kennedy.",
      "\u201cFluoride? What\u2019s that?\u201d responds Sherman's version of Wood's \"White Lotus\" character, Chelsea, in a campy British accent.",
      "Wood said in her Instagram response that she wished \u201cSNL\u201d had taken a \u201ccleverer, more nuanced, less cheap\u201d approach to the portion of the parody that featured her character.",
      "The former \u201cSex Education\u201d star, who described herself as \u201cnot thin-skinned,\" wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t mind caricature \u2014 I understand that\u2019s what SNL is. But the rest of the skit was punching up and I/Chelsea was the only one punched down on.\u201d",
      "Wood, who later said that \"SNL\" had reached out to her to apologize, wasn't the only viewer disappointed by the sketch.",
      "\"Brilliant sketch, except they really didn\u2019t have to make fun of Aimee Lou Wood, it\u2019s just being horrid to a lovely actress for no reason,\" one wrote on Instagram.",
      "\"You could have done it without mocking Amy, my luvs,\" wrote wrote another while a third viewer called Sherman's impression of Wood \"mean girl energy.\""

      "Read on for what we know about Rourke's time in the Big Brother mansion.",
      "What did Mickey Rourke say to JoJo Siwa?",
      "During the April 9 episode of \"Celebrity Big Brother U.K.,\" Rourke was accused of making homophobic comments by Siwa.",
      "In the episode, Rourke asked Siwa about her sexual orientation. The performer shared that she was attracted to \"girls\" and was in a relationship with a non-binary partner.",
      "Rourke responded, \u201cIf I stay longer than four days, you won\u2019t be gay anymore.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can guarantee I\u2019ll still be gay and I\u2019ll still be in a very happy relationship,\u201d Siwa replied.",

      "Cast mate Chris Hughes said, \"You can't say that, Mickey.\" Rourke replied, \"I was talking about a cigarette.\"",

      "Rourke was given a formal warning after the altercation.",
      "Rourke apologized and told Siwa he had a \u201chabit of having a short fuse, and I don\u2019t mean nothing by it.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe said some pretty hurtful things and I think one thing you really have to do in the Big Brother house is care about others, and him saying that flat out today, honestly, made the killer nomination choice pretty easy,\" she said.",
      "Why was Mickey Rourke eliminated from Big Brother?",
      "By Saturday, April 12, Rourke \"agreed to leave the Celebrity Big Brother House\" according to ITV.",
      "An ITV spokesperson told NBC News, \u201cRourke\u2019s language and behavior continued Saturday during a disagreement with (Chris) Hughes,\u201d while carrying out a task that Big Brother housemates are required to complete.",
      "ITV added that while no physical confrontation took place, the actor\u2019s \u201cbehavior toward Hughes was deemed threatening and aggressive.\u201d",
      "The scene that got Rourke eliminated was aired on April 13. In it, Rourke called Hughes an expletive during a pirate-themed task. Afterward, Rourke was asked to the Diary Room to hear directly from Big Brother, who also brought up a sexual comment he had made to housemate Ella Rae Wise.",
      "\u201cEarlier today in a disagreement with Chris, your language and behaviour was threatening and aggressive. Big Brother does not tolerate threatening language or behaviour. In addition, you have used inappropriate sexual language to Ella.\u201d",
      "\u201cOh, I\u2019m not aware of that but OK,\u201d Rourke said.",
      "\u201cThis language has caused offense to your fellow housemates and could cause offense to the viewing public. This is not the first time Big Brother has had to speak to you about your offensive and inappropriate language.\u201d",
      "The decision had been made. \u201cBig Brother considers your language and behaviour today to be seriously unacceptable and as a result Big Brother has no option but to ask you to leave the Big Brother house,\" Big Brother said.",
      "What did Mickey Rourke say about the controversy?",
      "A representative for Rourke did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment regarding his recent elimination.",
      "Rourke apologized in the April 13 episode, per a transcript on Deadline.",
      "\u201cI blame myself, I know it was my bad. You know, I\u2019ve got a short fuse and I know I upset a lot of people out there, you know. And I\u2019m sorry for that. I\u2019m actually ashamed of myself for getting that hot. I went over the line, you know, I did wrong. I guess, like they say, I\u2019m a work in progress. I just wanna pack my bags and leave, you know. I wanted to leave yesterday actually but I wasn\u2019t chosen.\u201d"

      "\u201cThe Last of Us\u201d started as a video game series in 2013. (There\u2019s a \u201cLast of Us: Left Behind,\u201d \u201cLast of Us Part II,\u201d and a remake of the first one called \u201cLast of Us Part 1,\u201d too.)",

      "Who is Eugene in \u2018The Last of Us\u2019 TV show?",
      "Eugene gets a much bigger part in Season 2, taking these bare bone details and expanding them \u2014 like it did with Bill and Frank in the \u201cLong, Long Time\u201d bottle episode from Season 1, which won episode star Nick Offerman an Emmy.",

      "Now, \u201cLast of Us\u201d Season 2 has jumped ahead more than five years from Season 1. That means that if Gail is correct in accusing Joel of killing Eugene, he\u2019s done it between seasons \u2014 and it\u2019s something we haven\u2019t seen.",

And yes, I know you had no choice. I know that. I know I should forgive you. Well I\u2019ve tried, and I can\u2019t. Because of how you did it.

How does that expand what the story\u2019s about, which is this idea of love and the extremes that love can take you to?\u2019\u201d",
      "Why did Joel kill Eugene?",

Joel, played by Pedro Pascal, is tasked with escorting 14-year-old Ellie, played by Ramsey, who is immune to the Cordyceps infection, across the devastated U.S. He must deliver her to the revolutionary militia group the Fireflies, who believe she may be the key to a cure.",
      "Without further ado, here\u2019s a look at what happened in the \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d Season 1 finale.",
      "Ellie\u2019s birth story is revealed",
      "The episode begins with a flashback: An infected is chasing a pregnant woman named Anna, who\u2019s laboring. She fights for her life and wins, but not before she\u2019s bitten. Then Anna gives birth. In hopes of saving her baby from an infection, she quickly cuts the baby\u2019s umbilical cord. Anna names the baby Ellie.",
      "Anna is then found by her close friend, Fireflies leader Marlene. As the infection begins to spread, Anna asks Marlene to kill her before it takes over her body. She tells Marlene she cut the baby\u2019s umbilical cord before she was bitten, but viewers know that\u2019s not true. She also tells Marlene to take Ellie to Boston, find someone to care for her and give her Anna\u2019s knife when she gets older.",

      "After encountering multiple dangers throughout their journey, Joel tells Ellie that perhaps they should return to Wyoming where his younger brother Tommy lives.",
      "\u201cEverything I\u2019ve done \u2014 it can\u2019t be for nothing,\u201d Ellie says. \u201cI know you mean well. I know you want to protect me. You have. And when we\u2019re done, we\u2019ll go wherever you want.\u201d",
      "But first, they must finish what they\u2019ve started: Get Ellie to the Fireflies in hopes of finding a cure. As the two leave, they are knocked unconscious by the Fireflies and taken to their lab.",
      "Ellie could be the cure to save humanity",
      "When Joel wakes up, he discovers that the Fireflies have prepared Ellie for surgery.",
      "Marlene tells Joel that they believe Cordyceps has grown in Ellie since birth and that\u2019s why she\u2019s immune. The Fireflies plan to experiment on Ellie\u2019s brain for a possible treatment against the virus. This procedure would inevitably kill Ellie.",
      "A furious Joel tells Marlene to find someone else. Marlene tells Joel she understands his anger \u2014 she was there when Ellie was born and promised her mom that she would save her \u2014 but she still has no other choice.",
      "Joel goes on a killing spree to save Ellie",
      "Marlene instructs the Fireflies to take Joel out of the premise and if he tries to fight, shoot him. She also gives Joel Ellie\u2019s mom\u2019s knife.",

      "That scene cuts away to Joel driving when Ellie wakes up and asks what happened.\u00a0He lies to her, saying that the Fireflies found dozens of people like her who are immune and their doctors stopped looking for a cure because they couldn\u2019t find one.",
      "When she asks where her clothes are, he tells her that raiders attacked the hospital and they barely made it out of there. Joel doesn\u2019t tell Ellie that he killed everyone.",
      "Viewers then see in flashbacks how the garage scene ended: Joel shoots and kills Marlene to prevent her from going after Ellie.",
      "\u201cIs Marlene OK?\u201d Ellie asks. Joel doesn\u2019t answer that. Instead he says, \u201cI\u2019m taking us home.\u201d",
      "Joel stands by his big lie to Ellie",
      "Joel and Ellie\u2019s car breaks down as they head back to Wyoming, so they walk the rest of the way. Ellie tells Joel about the first time she had to kill someone. It was her friend Riley, after she was bitten\u00a0by an infected.",

      "\u201cHe tells Ellie a bunch of lies about the Fireflies and about the cure and about how it didn\u2019t work, and how they found someone else,\u201d they said. \u201cEllie has a little doubt about it. ... Ellie looks (at him) for a long time, decides whether to believe him. In the end, (she) goes, \u2018OK,\u2019 and off they go.\u201d",
      "In a 2023 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Ramsey further touched on why Ellie doesn\u2019t want to doubt Joel.",
      "\u201cShe has to force herself to believe him enough, because the thought of it not being true is too painful,\u201d Ramsey said, adding that Ellie would have \u201cdefinitely\u201d sacrificed herself for the cure.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s her purpose,\u00a0that\u2019s the reason she\u2019s alive,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cAs soon as she found out\u00a0that she was immune and possibly held the key to providing a vaccine to the world, that\u2019s when she felt the first time that her life mattered. ...\u00a0I don\u2019t think she would even think twice. She would do it every time.\u201d"

      "It turns out the captain, Robert Daly (a not-so-friendly Jesse Plemons) had cloned his workplace and kept his colleagues captive within a video game. By the end of the episode, Daly met his (well-deserved) end, the crew was finally free. The \u201cInfinity\u201d game\u2019s universe was at their disposal.",
      "Now, almost a decade later, we\u2019re back for a new adventure. Here\u2019s what happens and what stars Cristin Milioti and Jimmi Simpson have to say about where the episode takes them.",
      "What have the clones been up to since 'USS Callister'?",
      "Taking place a few months after the events of the original Season 4 episode, we learn that the \"Infinity\" clones are now mercenaries, robbing random players for credit sticks to (illegally) survive inside the game.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 30 million players versus the five of us,\u201d clone Nanette (Milioti) points out.",
      "Their strategy is soon upended when the players they robbed file a complaint on the game\u2019s forum for two players participating in-game cheating by having no player tags.",
      "On the outside, real Dudani (Paul G. Raymond) urges Walton (Simpson) to address the in-game robberies, since it\u2019s not the first time a complaint has been filed. Walton ignores him, leading Dudani to quit on the spot.",
      "Meanwhile, a New York Times journalist visits Walton under the guise of writing a profile, but it\u2019s really a ruse to get him to talk about the banned DNA digital cloner that was found after Daly\u2019s death and the possibility of the rogue players being illegal clones. Walton kicks him out \u2014 but not before Nanette hears the entire conversation.",
      "Real Nanette takes the opportunity to help a visibly shaken Walton to ID the rogue players and discovers they\u2019re the clones of herself and Nate (Osy Ikhile).",

      "Inside the Callister, clone Karl (Billy Magnussen) throws out the idea of flying back into Daly\u2019s private game build. And though it seems improbable, it\u2019s not impossible.",
      "\u201cIf we can access the game\u2019s source code, we can compile a private development build of a whole universe of our own,\u201d clone Nanette says. \u201cThere\u2019d be no more credits, no more other players, no more threats. It would just be us, and we\u2019d be safe.\u201d",
      "The only problem? The only people who could access the source code, Daly and clone Walton, are dead. Or so they think.",
      "Clone Walton has a room aboard the Callister, which should not have spawned since he died before the ship reset itself and the rooms are assigned to players who are alive. Clone Nanette and Dudani believe that a small part of Walton must have survived, so he\u2019s alive in the game on a planet that spawned at the same time he died. Real Nanette has the same idea. She and real Walton enter the game.",
      "Clone Nanette finds clone Walton and they both bump into the real versions of themselves and decide to work together to free the clones.",

It wasn\u2019t a game but an immersive experience meant to mimic his favorite show \u201cSpace Fleet.\u201d Walton, thinking only about profits, convinced Daly to forgo his original plans and pivot to an multiplayer online game and subscription model.",

      "After realizing that real Walton is worried because the literal core of \u201cInfinity\u201d is illegal, clone Nanette tries to warn real Nanette. Clone Nanette is sadly too late, as her outside self is in coma, essentially brain dead after the accident. The accident comes as a shock to clone Nanette, but they continue on their journey to the Heart of Infinity.",
      "Back with the crew, the Callister has arrived to the Heart and clone Nanette is teleported to the core, which is an exact recreation of Daly\u2019s neighborhood.",

      "After clone Nanette finishes her story, clone Daly is grappling with the fact that his real self was a vile person, and that Walton exploited his talents.",
      "He agrees to help clone Nanette, but gives her a choice aside from simply leaving. Clone Daly explains that he can transfer her consciousness through the machine real Nanette is hooked up to. The catch? She can only choose one: go back to her old life, but the ship and the crew is wiped, or go with the original plan and save them all.",
      "Clone Nanette chooses to save them all, and clone Daly reveals there was always a choice to do them both; it was just a test of nobility based on an episode of \u201cSpace Fleet.\u201d Clone Daly begins the universe transfer, but he wants to \u201ccopy and paste\u201d instead of \u201ccut and paste\u201d so another copy of clone Nanette could stay with him.",
      "\u201cI will let her stay. I will treat her good,\u201d clone Daly insists.",
      "Clone Nanette objects, sending clone Daly into a rage and hurting her. Clone Nanette is able to save herself by killing clone Daly, but this activates a kill switch to the delete the game.",
      "Clone Nanette is thankfully able to complete transfer in the eleventh hour. \u201cInfinity\u201d is deleted, and Walton watches his company crash in real time.",
      "What happens to the Callister crew? What about Walton?",
      "Clone Nanette wakes up in the hospital in the body of real Nanette and is over the moon. She then receives a call from the Callister crew and they let her know there were saved \u2014 but they\u2019re also part of her consciousness and they can see what she\u2019s seeing.",
      "Three months later, Walton is arrested and charged after being on the run.

      "How did the stars feel about the twist?",
      "Milioti says that twist with Walton and Daly actually didn\u2019t come as a shock to her.",
      "\u201cIt felt (timely) that someone would be sentenced to the disease of capitalism. \u2018You must be productive of all costs,\u2019 but at the cost of your life,\u201d Milioti says. \u201cIt felt true for those characters. You would understand why it would drive Daly mad and it\u2019s something that Walton would completely do.\u201d",
      "The biggest twist for Milioti was actually Nanette\u2019s accident.",

      "How did they feel about the ending?",
      "Milioti loves the \u201ctwisted and unexpected\u201d ending for Nanette.",
      "\u201cI thought it was so demented and unexpected and strange and funny,\u201d she says. \u201cIt somehow enters us into a new genre of body possession comedy.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re going to explore a world like this, it\u2019s not just figuring out how to make a fun spot for people to enjoy the characters they love,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating a reason for them to need to get to know them more. Now the sequel is essential viewing.\u201d",
      "Simpson is also satisfied with the downfall of his character.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s a cracked door for sure,\u201d Milioti says.",
      "\u201cI think Charlie (Brooker), his mind, can go in 20 million different directions and I\u2019m sure if he wants to continue it, the idea would be very strange and cool and creepy and funny,\u201d she says.",
      "Simpson shared a similar sentiment.",
      "\u201cI feel like there\u2019s so many ways they could go,\u201d he says. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s like the rest of Black Mirror. It\u2019s about the writing, it\u2019s about finding the truth in what\u2019s so extraordinary.

    "story": [
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary \u2014 Hungary\u2019s parliament on Monday passed an amendment to the constitution that allows the government to ban public events by LGBTQ communities, a decision that legal scholars and critics call another step toward authoritarianism by the populist government.",
      "The amendment, which required a two-thirds vote, passed along party lines with 140 votes for and 21 against. It was proposed by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition led by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.",
      "Ahead of the vote \u2014 the final step for the amendment \u2014 opposition politicians and other protesters attempted to blockade the entrance to a parliament parking garage. Police physically removed demonstrators, who had used zip ties to bind themselves together.",
      "The amendment declares that children\u2019s rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any right other than the right to life, including that to peacefully assemble. Hungary\u2019s contentious \u201cchild protection\u201d legislation prohibits the \u201cdepiction or promotion\u201d of homosexuality to minors aged under 18.",
      "The amendment codifies a law fast-tracked through parliament in March that bans public events held by LGBTQ communities, including the popular Pride event in Budapest that draws thousands annually.",
      "That law also allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify people who attend prohibited events \u2014 such as Budapest Pride \u2014 and can come with fines of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546).",
      "D\u00e1vid Bed\u0151, a lawmaker with the opposition Momentum party who participated in the attempted blockade, said before the vote that Orb\u00e1n and Fidesz for the past 15 years \u201chave been dismantling democracy and the rule of law, and in the past two or three months, we see that this process has been sped up.\u201d",
      "He said as elections approach in 2026 and Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party lags in the polls behind a popular new challenger from the opposition, \u201cthey will do everything in their power to stay in power.\u201d",
      "Opposition lawmakers used air horns to disrupt the vote, which continued after a few moments.",
      "Hungary\u2019s government has campaigned against LGBTQ communities in recent years, and argues its \u201cchild protection\u201d policies, which forbid the availability to minors of any material that mentions homosexuality, are needed to protect children from what it calls \u201cwoke ideology\u201d and \u201cgender madness.\u201d",
      "Critics say the measures do little to protect children and are being used to distract from more serious problems facing the country and mobilize Orb\u00e1n\u2019s right-wing base ahead of elections.",
      "\u201cThis whole endeavor which we see launched by the government, it has nothing to do with children\u2019s rights,\u201d said D\u00e1nel D\u00f6brentey, a lawyer with the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, calling it \u201cpure propaganda.\u201d",
      "Constitution recognizes two sexes",
      "The new amendment also states that the constitution recognizes two sexes, male and female, an expansion of an earlier amendment that prohibits same-sex adoption by stating that a mother is a woman and a father is a man.",
      "The declaration provides a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of transgender people, as well as ignoring the existence of intersex individuals who are born with sexual characteristics that do not align with binary conceptions of male and female.",
      "In a statement on Monday, government spokesperson Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs wrote that the change is \u201cnot an attack on individual self-expression, but a clarification that legal norms are based on biological reality.\u201d",
      "D\u00f6brentey, the lawyer, said it was \u201ca clear message\u201d for transgender and intersex people: \u201cIt is definitely and purely and strictly about humiliating people and excluding them, not just from the national community, but even from the community of human beings.\u201d",
      "The amendment is the 15th to Hungary\u2019s constitution since Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party unilaterally authored and approved it in 2011.",
      "Facial recognition to identify demonstrators",
      "\u00c1d\u00e1m Remport, a lawyer with the HCLU, said that while Hungary has used facial recognition tools since 2015 to assist police in criminal investigations and finding missing persons, the recent law banning Pride allows the technology to be used in a much broader and problematic manner. That includes for monitoring and deterring political protests.",
      "\u201cOne of the most fundamental problems is its invasiveness, just the sheer scale of the intrusion that happens when you apply mass surveillance to a crowd,\u201d Remport said.",
      "\u201cMore salient in this case is the effect on the freedom of assembly, specifically the chilling effect that arises when people are scared to go out and show their political or ideological beliefs for fear of being persecuted,\u201d he added.",
      "Suspension of citizenship",
      "The amendment passed Monday also allows for Hungarians who hold dual citizenship in a non-European Economic Area country to have their citizenship suspended for up to 10 years if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security.",
      "Hungary has taken steps in recent months to protect its national sovereignty from what it claims are foreign efforts to influence its politics or even topple Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government.",
      "The self-described \u201cilliberal\u201d leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary\u2019s sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors.",
      "In a speech laden with conspiracy theories in March, Orb\u00e1n compared people who work for such groups to insects, and pledged to \u201celiminate the entire shadow army\u201d of foreign-funded \u201cpoliticians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists.\u201d"

      "\u201cUkraine is pretty close to a tipping point,\u201d he said in a wide-ranging interview. \u201cBut the worry at the moment is that Trump will do a premature deal with the Russians\u201d and make too many concessions.",
      "The \u201chighly undesirable\u201d consequences would be to \u201cembolden the Russians, over time, to be more aggressive and assertive in Europe,\u201d said Dearlove over a coffee at one of London\u2019s historic private members clubs.",
      "His remarks come as Ukraine\u2019s military chief said Russia had launched a new offensive in the Eastern European country.",
      "While often less critical of Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach than many other foreign policy experts, Dearlove said he finds Trump\u2019s general \u201clack of grace\u201d and \u201clack of decent behavior\u201d to be \u201cvery disconcerting\u201d \u2014 specifically his Oval Office bust-up with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February.",

      "The jovial, outspoken grandee of the British foreign policy establishment joined MI6 in 1966 and served as its chief \u2014 code-named \u201cC\u201d \u2014 between 1999 and 2004. He now co-hosts the \u201cOne Decision\u201d podcast, covering global news, alongside former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.",
      "He says he \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the American president\u2019s campaign to pressure European allies to spend more on defense, decrying the imbalance of Europe enjoying a relatively generous health care and benefits system while letting the U.S. foot the bill for Western defense.",
      "\u201cWhy should American taxpayers pay for indulgent social security programs in countries like Germany, France and Italy?\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cThe President\u2019s Peace Through Strength agenda has delivered historic achievements across the globe and restored American dominance on the world stage,\u201d Fields added. \u201cThe \u2018experts\u2019 have been wrong for decades, and doing the same thing while expecting a different result is the definition of insanity.\u201d",
      "The ex-MI6 head says his biggest short-term worry revolves around Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine, which has involved parallel talks with both Kyiv and Moscow and has been lambasted by Trump\u2019s critics in the West as being too favorable to the latter.",
      "\u201cIf you want to get the Nobel Peace Prize, don\u2019t do a premature deal with Ukraine \u2014 wait,\u201d Dearlove said. (According to former aides, the president still covets the landmark award won by four of his predecessors, and for which Trump has been nominated at least twice before.)",
      "Dearlove believes the Russians are on the back foot and will only come under more pressure to accept terms. \u201cThe Russians themselves badly need a ceasefire, but Putin is incapable of seeking one because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a reverse gear,\u201d Dearlove said.",
      "On Iran, responding to Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will hold direct talks with Tehran over its nuclear program, Dearlove says he believes the administration will \u201cdemand a very high price\u201d \u2014 namely that Iran give up its entire nuclear program, both for energy and weapons.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a bottom line for Trump and Israel that Iran must not have nuclear capability,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that if Iran were to try to weaponize or if the intelligence suggests that they are weaponized, then there would be a joint Israeli-American attack.\u201d",
      "Trump didn\u2019t rule out military action if the talks don\u2019t succeed, saying Tehran would have a \u201cvery bad day\u201d if diplomacy failed.",
      "Dearlove agreed: \u201cIf the Iranians don\u2019t negotiate, or if they mislead, which they\u2019re quite capable of doing, they\u2019re ones heading for a crisis.\u201d",
      "Dearlove was head of MI6 when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, and was later criticized by a public inquiry for his handling of intelligence alleging that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, a key argument steering Britain into the war alongside Washington. At the inquiry in 2017, he described claims he was too close to the British government as \u201ccomplete rubbish.\u201d And, according to a BBC interview in 2023, he is among a minority of people who believe that Iraq did have some kind of weapons program, but that its components may have been moved into neighboring Syria.",
      "Looking ahead, Dearlove believes by far the biggest issue is how the West deals with China.",
      "\u201cPax Americana\u201d \u2014 the \u201cAmerican peace\u201d that has largely held since 1945 and is a byword for Washington\u2019s postwar global dominance \u2014 has \u201cdefinitively disintegrated,\u201d he said. In its stead, there has to be \u201csome sort of understanding between the United States and China,\u201d whose President Xi Jinping \u201cwants to create a world by 2050 which is aligned with China\u2019s value system,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cChina and the West are intimately intertwined: You can\u2019t take them apart, you can\u2019t disentangle them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s totally opposed to the Western value system.\u201d",
      "He characterizes Xi\u2019s Chinese Communist Party as \u201ctalking about global domination\u201d \u2014 something vehemently rejected by Beijing.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be some sort of international agreement which accommodates what I would describe as the two spheres of influence,\u201d he said. Otherwise, China is \u201cgoing to end up in a confrontation with the United States at some point in the 21st century.\u201d"

      "Craig Williams was one of several people who had been investigated for cashing in on insider knowledge on the date then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak would call the election. Other members of the Conservative Party that controlled government at the time and a police officer were among those facing chares that carry a potential two-year prison term, if convicted.",
      "It\u2019s legal for politicians to wager on elections, but the investigation was about whether they used inside information to gain an unfair advantage. One of the popular bets at the time was to wager on the date the prime minister would call an election.",
      "At the time, the conventional wisdom was that Sunak would call an election in the fall, but he surprised people in May when he set the election date for July 4th. The announcement was a disaster as Sunak was drenched in pouring rain outside his residence and word quickly spread that a handful of people with connections to the party had placed suspiciously timed bets.",

    "story": [
      "BUDAPEST \u2014 Hungarian lawmakers are preparing to vote on a constitutional amendment viewed by many critics as both a crackdown on the freedoms of assembly and expression and the most recent move by the populist government to restrict the rights of LGBTQ+ communities.",
      "The amendment, which will almost certainly be passed Monday by the two-thirds majority of Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s nationalist Fidesz party, would permanently codify a ban on public events held by LGBTQ+ communities \u2014 including the popular Pride event that draws thousands annually in the capital, Budapest.",
      "It will also provide a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities or sexual characteristics of minority groups, and allow for some Hungarians to have their citizenship suspended if they are deemed to pose a threat to Hungary\u2019s security or sovereignty.",
      "Here\u2019s what the amendment will do, what it entails for LGBTQ+ Hungarians, and for some of the basic rights of all citizens in the Central European nation.",
      "Ban on LGBTQ+ events?",
      "The amendment, the 15th to Hungary\u2019s constitution since it was unilaterally authored and approved by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition in 2011, gives legal support to a law fast-tracked in March that made it an offense to hold or attend events that violate the country\u2019s contentious \u201cchild protection\u201d legislation, which prohibits the \u201cdepiction or promotion\u201d of homosexuality to minors aged under 18.",
      "That law also allows authorities to use facial recognition tools to identify individuals that attend prohibited events \u2014 such as Budapest Pride \u2014 and can come with fines for violators of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546).",
      "Some legal experts have argued that such a restriction on assembly rights violates Hungary\u2019s constitution. In order to bring the Pride ban in line with constitutional protections, the amendment declares that children\u2019s rights to moral, physical and spiritual development supersede any other fundamental right other than the right to life \u2014 including that to peacefully assemble.",
      "The amendment also declares that \u201ca person\u2019s sex at birth is a biological characteristic and can be either male or female\u201d \u2014 an expansion of an earlier amendment that prohibits same-sex adoption by stating that a mother is a woman and a father is a man.",
      "This declaration will provide a constitutional basis for denying the gender identities of transgender people, as well as ignoring the existence of intersex individuals, who are born with atypical sexual characteristics that do not align with binary conceptions of male and female.",
      "The human rights agency of the United Nations has written that up to 1.7% of the global population is born with intersex traits.",
      "The amendment, as well as previous legislation targeting LGBTQ+ communities, is reminiscent of similar restrictions against sexual minorities in Russia. Orb\u00e1n, seen as Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s closest ally in the European Union, has in recent years prohibited same-sex adoption and banned any LGBTQ+ content including in television, films, advertisements and literature that is available to minors.",
      "His government argues that its policies are designed to protect children from \u201csexual propaganda,\u201d but critics view them as part of a broader effort to scapegoat sexual minorities and mobilize his conservative base.",
      "Citizenship could be suspended",
      "Hungary has taken vigorous steps in recent months to protect its national sovereignty from what it claims are foreign efforts to influence its politics or even topple Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government.",
      "The self-described \u201cilliberal\u201d leader has accelerated his longstanding efforts to crack down on critics such as media outlets and groups devoted to civil rights and anti-corruption, which he says have undermined Hungary\u2019s sovereignty by receiving financial assistance from international donors.",
      "In a speech laden with conspiracy theories in March, Orb\u00e1n compared people who work for such groups to insects, and pledged to \u201celiminate the entire shadow army\u201d of foreign-funded \u201cpoliticians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists.\u201d",
      "As part of the government\u2019s sovereignty protection efforts, the newest constitutional amendment will make it possible to suspend the Hungarians\u2019 citizenship if they are deemed to pose a threat to public order, public security or national security.",
      "Such suspensions would apply to Hungarian citizens who also hold citizenship of another country that is not a member of the EU or European Economic Area. Such suspensions may last for a maximum of 10 years.",
      "\u2018This is fascism\u2019",
      "The passage of the law banning Pride set off a wave of protests in Hungary with thousands taking to the streets to demand the restoration of assembly rights. Demonstrators employed the tactic of blocking bridges and major thoroughfares in Budapest, something Orb\u00e1n later said would be prohibited by new legislation.",
      "Reacting to the ban on Pride, local organizers wrote: \u201cThis is not child protection, this is fascism.\u201d",
      "On Monday, when lawmakers vote to approve the constitutional amendment, the opposition Momentum party will attempt to blockade the parliament and prevent the vote from taking place. The party accused Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government of being an \u201cintimidating and cowardly power,\u201d writing on social media: \u201cLet\u2019s collectively prevent them from leading us down the Putin road and depriving us of our freedom.\u201d",

He also met privately with\u00a0King Charles III and Queen Camilla\u00a0this week, and made an impromptu tour of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, stopping to pray, and to thank a pair of restorers for their work on the basilica\u2019s masterpieces.",
      "On Saturday, the eve of Holy Week, Francis went to the St. Mary Major Basilica in central Rome to pray privately before a favorite icon of the Virgin Mary, Salus Populi Romani. The basilica, which he typically visits before and after his foreign trips, was also his first stop after leaving the Gemelli Hospital on March 23.",
