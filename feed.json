      "\u201cWatson\u201d is an unusual TV medical procedural",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea for a new TV show came to Craig Sweeny as he was driving. The producer and screenwriter, thinking about how to put his own stamp on a medical series, had to pull over when a familiar figure popped into his mind: Sherlock Holmes.",
      "Why not combine a hospital procedural with the lore of Britain's greatest detective? It would have a medical mystery every week and also tell stories of Holmes' good friend, Dr. John Watson. It was a mashup of two popular draws, the TV equivalent of peanut butter and jelly.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re sort of each their own show-worthy premise in a way. And we\u2019re blessed to have both. So they compete for space in a really interesting way,\u201d says Sweeny.",
      "So was born \u201cWatson,\u201d a CBS series starring Morris Chestnut as the titular character who leads a team of medical detectives set in a present-day Pittsburgh populated with Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s characters.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those blessed moments,\u201d says Sweeny, who was well-versed with the world of Holmes after executive producing and writing for \u201cElementary,\u201d a contemporary update.",
      "\u201cWatson\u201d is not alone among the networks jazzing up the tried-and-true procedural. While the traditional form remains the bedrock of modern TV \u2014 think the prime-time blocks of \u201cNCIS,\u201d \u201cFBI\u201d and \u201cChicago Med\u201d \u2014 new twists are emerging.",
      "ABC\u2019s \u201cDoctor Odyssey\u201d is a medical procedural aboard a luxury cruise ship and NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Hunting Party\u201d mashes up \u201cThe Blacklist\u201d and \u201cCriminal Minds.\u201d CBS has Kathy Bates in \u201cMatlock\u201d playing an underestimated, retirement-age lawyer \u2014 with the twist that she\u2019s really a hard-charging mom out for vengeance.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something really pleasurable about the self-contained, 43-minute procedural that gives you a beginning, middle and end, a little bit of a mystery and the fun of watching something get figured out,\u201d says Jonathan Tolins, a playwright, TV writer and showrunner. \u201cI think that the audience is so familiar with it that it does reward you if you come up with a sort of fun twist on it.\u201d",
      "Tolins' own current take on the procedural is CBS' \u201cElsbeth,\u201d which takes the quirky character Elsbeth Tascioni from \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d and plops her down in a \u201cColumbo\u201d-style police procedural.",
      "Elsbeth, played by Carrie Preston, is a sleuth in bright colors and a bucket hat, blunt and unpredictable, playing off the guest star of the week. Tolins says the writers and camera crew try not to make her feel like the show's lead, even though she's the very title.",
      "\u201cI said early on that I think the show works best when it feels like a CBS police procedural with Elsbeth thrown into it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe talked about always keeping her sort of out of the center of the frame in wide shots.\u201d",
      "Another elevated procedural with a quirky lead character is ABC\u2019s \u201cHigh Potential,\u201d a police show starring a genius \u2014 but this time, she\u2019s a single mom of three who has an IQ of 160 and is played by Kaitlin Olson.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a bit of a unicorn,\u201d says Todd Harthan, executive producer and showrunner. \u201cYou throw a unicorn into the bullpen with a bunch of detectives and they go, \u2018What are we supposed to do with this colorful creature with the horn coming out of her head?\u2019\u201d",
      "Supercharging procedurals comes as streaming increasingly offers subscribers a highly curated selection of unconventional, relatively short series with big names and high production values.",
      "\u201cI think that, inevitably, the innovations that streaming is doing bleed into what happens in network TV and challenge what we\u2019re doing to compete for eyeballs in a healthy way,\u201d says Sweeny.",
      "Procedurals are often referred to as the comfort food of TV, offering a predictable, solvable hour with a familiar cast. So strong is our attachment to the form that streaming services have also been stretching their form with shows like the also \u201cColumbo\u201d-like \u201cPoker Face\u201d on Peacock and Max's \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d which takes a medical show like \u201cER\u201d and breaks it down into different hours of a hospital shift, like \u201c24.\u201d",
      "Harthan believes the gap between the streaming and network may be closing as networks offer writers a bit of a longer leash to try different things and streaming looks enviously at the broad audiences that networks pull.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re always sort of learning and trying to glean certain things from different shows that are very different than the one you\u2019re working on day-to-day,\u201d Harthan says. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the growth of doing what we do for a living.\u201d",
      "Showrunners caution that mixing different elements into a show to raise the level can't be done willy-nilly. The creator of \u201cWatson\u201d notes that its hero was already a doctor in the world of Sherlock Holmes, so making him head of a clinic makes sense.",
      "\u201cIt is an exotic combo, but it\u2019s also very organic,\u201d says Sweeny. \u201cMechanically you don\u2019t have to force anything into place. Everything\u2019s already there.\u201d",
      "A few years ago, the term \u201cgourmet cheeseburger\u201d was given to streaming shows that were both premium and commercial \u2014 take \u201cBridgerton\u201d \u2014 and network TV may be going through their own gourmet cheeseburger phase.",
      "\u201cThe more the two converge, the better,\u201d says Robert King. He and his wife, Michelle King, are the prolific creators of shows on networks (\u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d \u201cEvil\u201d and \u201cElsbeth\u201d) and streaming (\u201cHappy Face\u201d).",
      "\u201cWe love working in both and we don\u2019t start with, \u2018Oh, we must do a network show,\u2019 or, \u2018We must do a streaming show.\u2019 It's very much, \u2018This idea we have fits more comfortably either in network or in streaming,\u2019\u201d says Michelle King.",
      "Robert King considers one of the greatest TV hybrids to be \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d which mixed a comic premise with violence and put it into a serialized format. It was a hit for HBO but was originally pitched to a network, Fox.",
      "\u201cI do think the hybrid goes back to \u2018The Sopranos,\u2019 at least and I\u2019m sure beyond that,\u201d he says.",
      "Tolins, who leads the \u201cElsbeth\u201d writing room, recently got some nice feedback about his elevated procedural skills. CBS did a focus group about the new season's premiere episode, which starred \u2014 spoilers \u2014 Nathan Lane as the killer of an obnoxious operagoer.",
      "\u201cOne of the women who saw it afterwards kept saying, \u2018This is network? I\u2019m going to have to watch more network television,\u2019 which of course was very, very satisfying for all of us listening,\u201d Tolins says."

      "A boomer hit man is given a nightmare final assignment to train his own Gen Z replacement in Simon West\u2019s lifeless action-comedy \u201cOld Guy.\u201d",
      "Christoph Waltz\u2019s Danny Dolinski is the one at an unwelcome crossroads in the film. He\u2019s only partially healed from a hand injury that\u2019s rendered him dependent on pills and unable to aim a gun as well as he used to. Dolinski also seems to be in the throes of a full crisis: We meet him not on the job, or even in flashback to his pre-injury glory, but out clubbing. The next morning, Dolinski emerges in a bathrobe to gaze proudly upon the several much younger women who have spent the night.",
      "But a room full of scantily clothed model-types who seem to be there willingly is only a temporary balm for poor Dolinski. While he might still be a viable specimen for the 20-something party girls of London, his game does not hold the same appeal in the workplace. Soon he\u2019ll be getting the dreaded \u201cwe\u2019re going younger\u201d talk from his boss, and she\u2019s talking about him, not his love interests. This is a guy who is certain he\u2019s got a lot left to give in the assassin game, and not as a mentor to a \u201chitman prodigy,\u201d as Cooper Hoffman\u2019s character Wihlborg is described.",
      "Is a familiar conceit like the wise veteran and the cocksure newcomer tired or a classic? Well, it\u2019s all in the execution. And \u201cOld Guy,\u201d stylishly filmed though it may be, is not one of the better attempts, likely hampered by the script from Greg Johnson. Generational clashes should be easy enough comedic fodder for a screenwriter and two capable actors, but here it lands with a thud. One likes to drink! The other doesn\u2019t even like to be around alcohol! The more serious ethical questions about hitman etiquette are similarly inelegant. Take this gem from Wihlborg: \u201cWhere I come from one does what one needs to do to survive. That includes killing a kid.\u201d",
      "Hoffman, so perfect leading \u201cLicorice Pizza,\u201d is not served well by this script, which never quite justifies why he\u2019s such a prodigy at such a young age and doesn\u2019t give him or Waltz any room to play off one another in a natural way. Waltz also can\u2019t seem to choose a lane with Danny, an eccentric hedonist with a soul who doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to kill kids on the job. He\u2019s also working with his normal accent which is all well and good until the movie very unnecessarily introduces his Irish mother.",
      "And because action movies of this variety need a woman, Lucy Liu, who deserves much, much better than this (they all do, but mostly her), goes along for the ride. Her character Anata is the glamorous manager of a Soho karaoke bar that might also be a front for a brothel, but that\u2019s never really explored. What is deemed important here is that she\u2019s Dolinski\u2019s longtime confidante, and tags along on their mission to Belfast for\u2026wait for it\u2026a date. It\u2019s a very strange little subplot in which Anata does go to this date only to be broken up with. The guy she\u2019s been seeing is not connected to the larger plot in any way, except as the narrative push to have her ultimately fall in Dolinski\u2019s arms.",
      "West is an action and studio system veteran behind \u201cCon Air,\u201d \u201cLara Croft: Tomb Raider\u201d and various Jason Statham vehicles. There's lots of shoot-em-up action and bullets to the head for anyone looking for that, but not much more to hang on to. \u201cOld Guy\u201d feels very of this moment in the fact that it looks good and has a good cast and yet can\u2019t seem to deliver something that\u2019s either entertaining or meaningful. But unlike so many of its peers, this one amazingly was not made by a streamer.",
      "\u201cOld Guy,\u201d a The Avenue release in limited theaters and on VOD Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201clanguage, violence, some drug use.\u201d Running time: 93 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

      "Actor Kim Sae-ron\u2019s death adds to the list of celebrity deaths in South Korea that underscore the enormous pressure they face under the gaze of a relentlessly unforgiving media that pounces on their every misstep",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In the about 1,000 days between her drunken-driving crash in May 2022 and her death, South Korean mainstream news organizations published at least around 2,000 stories on film actor Kim Sae-rom.",
      "They illustrate how the local media often cover a celebrity\u2019s fall from grace. Previously one of the brightest young stars in South Korean cinema, Kim was condemned and ridiculed for driving drunk; for talking about her financial struggles after losing roles; for taking a job at a coffee shop; for attempting a comeback in theater; for going out with friends instead of \u201cshowing remorse\u201d; and for being seen smiling on set while shooting an indie movie.",
      "After the 24-year-old actor was found dead at her home Sunday, the headlines predictably swung to calling for changes to the way celebrities are treated in the public arena.",
      "Kim\u2019s death, which police consider a suicide, adds to a growing list of high-profile celebrity deaths in the country, which some experts attribute to the enormous pressure celebrities face under the gaze of a relentlessly unforgiving media that seizes on every misstep.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: In South Korea, callers can receive 24-hour counseling through the suicide prevention hotline 1577-0199, the \u201cLife Line\u201d service at 1588-9191, the \u201cHope Phone\u201d at 129 and the \u201cYouth Phone\u201d at 1388.",
      "___",
      "Here's a look at the intense pressure faced by South Korean celebrities who fall from grace.",
      "South Korea is notoriously harsh on its celebrities, particularly women.",
      "Kim rose to stardom as a child actor with the 2010 hit crime thriller \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d and garnered acclaim and popularity for her acting in movies and TV dramas for years.",
      "But that changed after May 18, 2022, when Kim crashed a vehicle into a tree and an electrical transformer while driving drunk in southern Seoul. She posted a handwritten apology on Instagram and reportedly compensated around 60 shops that lost power temporarily because of the crash, but that did little to defuse negative coverage and she struggled to find acting work.",
      "When a Seoul court issued a 200 million won ($139,000) fine over the crash in April 2023, Kim expressed her fears about the media to reporters, saying many articles about her private life were untrue.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m too scared to say anything about them,\u201d she said.",
      "In the wake of Kim's drunken-driving crash, celebrity gossip channels on YouTube began posting negative videos about her private life, suggesting without providing evidence that she was exaggerating her financial straits by working at coffee shops, and arguing that social media posts showing her socializing with friends meant she wasn't showing enough remorse.",
      "Other entertainers, especially female, have struggled to find work after run-ins with the law, including drunken driving or substance abuse, and experts say many of them are reluctant to seek treatment for mental health problems like depression, fearing further negative coverage.",
      "Kwon Young-chan, a comedian-turned-scholar who leads a group helping celebrities with mental health issues, said celebrities often feel helpless when the coverage turns negative after spending years carefully cultivating their public image. Kwon, who stayed with Kim's relatives during a traditional three-day funeral process, said her family is considering legal action against a YouTube creator with hundreds of thousands of subscribers for what they describe as groundless attacks on Kim's private life.",
      "Peter Jongho Na, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, lamented on Facebook that South Korean society had become a giant version of \u201cSquid Game,\u201d the brutal Netflix survival drama, \u201cabandoning people who make mistakes or fall behind, acting as though nothing happened.\u201d",
      "The National Police Agency said officers found no signs of foul play at Kim's home and that she left no note.",
      "But a spate of high-profile deaths has sparked discussions about how news organizations cover the private lives of celebrities and whether floods of critical online comments are harming their mental health. Similar conversations happened after the 2008 death of mega movie star Choi Jin-sil; the death of her former baseball star husband, Cho Sung-min, in 2013; the deaths of K-Pop singers Sulli and Goo Hara in 2019; and the death of \u201cParasite\u201d actor Lee Sun-kyun in 2023.",
      "Sensational but unsubstantiated claims like from social media are widely recycled and amplified by traditional media outlets as they compete for audience attention, said Hyun-jae Yu, a communications professor at Seoul\u2019s Sogang University.",
      "Struggling with a sharp decline in traditional media readership, he said, media turn to covering YouTube drama as the easiest way to drive up traffic, often skipping the work of reporting and verifying facts.",
      "Following the 2019 deaths of Sulli and Goo Hara, which were widely attributed to cyberbullying and sexual harassment both in the public and media, lawmakers proposed various measures to discourage harsh online comments. These included expanding real-name requirements and strengthening websites\u2019 requirements to weed out hate speech and false information, but none of these proposed laws passed.",
      "South Korean management agencies are getting increasingly active in taking legal action to protect their entertainers from online bullying. Hybe, which manages several K-Pop groups including BTS, publishes regular updates about lawsuits it\u2019s filing against social media commentators it deems malicious.",
      "But Yu said it's crucial for mainstream media companies to strengthen self-regulation and limit their use of YouTube content as news sources. Government authorities could also compel YouTube and other social media platforms to take greater responsibility for content created by their users, he said, including actively removing problematic videos and preventing creators from monetizing them.",
      "The South Korean office of Google, YouTube's parent company, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Heo Chanhaeng, an executive director at the Center for Media Responsibility and Human Rights, said news organizations and websites should consider shutting down the comments sections on entertainment stories entirely.",
      "\u201cHer private life was indiscriminately reported beyond what was necessary,\u201d Heo said. \"That\u2019s not a legitimate matter of public interest.\u201d",

      "A famous YouTuber in India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on a YouTube show last week",
      "NEW DELHI -- A famous YouTuber in India is facing public outrage and a police investigation after he made an allegedly obscene remark on a YouTube show, raising questions about freedom of speech in a country where digital creators in the past have come under fire for their content.",
      "The controversy began last week when social media influencer and YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia made remarks to a participant on a comedy show about his parents' personal relationship. The joke was quickly condemned by social media users, public figures and political leaders.",
      "Multiple police complaints were filed against Allahabadia and Samay Raina, who hosts the show \u201cIndia\u2019s Got Latent.\u201d Both of them, along with some other participants on the show, were summoned by police for questioning and the issue was also raised in Parliament.",
      "On the show, Allahbadia asked a contestant: \u201cWould you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?\u201d",
      "Allahbadia, who has interviewed senior Indian ministers and Bollywood celebrities on his YouTube channel, has since apologized for the comments. Raina, meanwhile, has removed all videos of the show from his YouTube channel and said he was \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the authorities.",
      "India\u2019s Supreme Court on Tuesday shielded Allahbadia from arrest but said his conduct showed \u201clack of responsibility\u201d and was \u201ccondemnable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is something that is dirty in his mind that has been vomited by way of this program,\u201d the judge hearing the case said.",
      "The court also ordered Allahbadia to surrender his passport at a police station and barred him from leaving the country.",
      "The case, however, prompted a parliamentary panel to write to the country's Information Technology Ministry seeking steps to amend existing laws to clamp down on such content.",
      "One lawmaker also asked Parliament to enact a law to regulate social media platforms, raising fears that the controversy will be used by the federal government to regulate online content.",
      "Indian content creators on social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram and X are worried after the government last year proposed draft legislation that aims to overhaul and regulate broadcasting services in the country. The legislation, if enacted into law, would apply to all content creators including YouTubers.",
      "Many content creators, journalists and digital experts say it could lead to censorship, stifle free speech and significantly expand the government\u2019s powers to regulate digital media content.",
      "\u201cI think we are facing a threat that this particular incident might be a trigger point for obscenity laws,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, a digital policy analyst and founder of the tech website MediaNama.",
      "In Allahbadia's case, observers say the controversy was blown out of proportion and could lead to a chilling effect on India\u2019s comedy scene.",
      "\"The morality of the audience and the current political atmosphere is a very strong determining factor that decides whether our jokes are acceptable or not. And once a perception has been made about your content, no one can control its outcome. It is troubling,\u201d said Anurag Minus Verma, a cultural critic based in New Delhi.",
      "This is the not the first time Indian comedians have come under fire for their jokes and faced police crackdowns or their shows being cancelled.",
      "Stand-up comedy has become hugely popular in recent years in India, but a swelling tide of nationalism under Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's rule has also put comedians under scrutiny for making fun of politicians or making references to religion or national icons.",
      "In 2021, comedian Vir Das faced police complaints for his \u201cI Come from Two Indias\u201d show, which was critical of India over its fight against COVID-19, crimes against women and crackdowns on comedians. During his show, Das described India as a country where people \u201cworship women during the day but gang rape them at night.\u201d",
      "That same year comedians Munawar Faruqui and Nalin Yadav were arrested by police for making allegedly objectionable remarks about Hindu deities while performing in an Indian state that\u2019s ruled by Modi\u2019s party. Faruqui was jailed for a month."

      "NEW YORK -- In a James Bond shakeup that stirred the film industry, Amazon MGM announced Thursday that the studio has taken the creative reins of the 007 franchise after decades of family control. Longtime Bond custodians Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they would be stepping back.",
      "Amazon MGM Studios, Wilson and Broccoli formed a new joint venture in which they will co-own James Bond intellectual property rights \u2014 but Amazon MGM will have creative control.",

      "The trial of the only suspect ever charged in the 1996 killing of rap icon Tupac Shakur has been postponed",
      "LAS VEGAS -- A Nevada judge on Tuesday postponed the murder trial of the only suspect ever charged in the 1996 killing of rap icon Tupac Shakur for nearly a year, saying she had little choice given new developments presented by his defense attorneys and the need to ensure a fair trial.",
      "The trial of Duane \u201cKeffe D\u201d Davis, previously set for next month in Las Vegas, has been rescheduled for Feb. 9, 2026. The judge ordered prosecutors and the defense to return to court over the summer for a status hearing.",
      "\u201cIt looks like there are quite a few things that are left to be done to get this case prepared so that Mr. Davis can have effective assistance of counsel,\u201d Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny said during a short hearing.",
      "When asked by the judge if he was OK with moving the trial that far out, Davis agreed.",
      "Davis' defense team filed a motion Friday seeking more time, saying critical investigative work had to be done and witnesses needed to be interviewed to ensure he gets a fair trial. The lawyers said a private investigator identified witnesses who can testify that Davis was not at the scene of the shooting.",
      "Attorney Carl Arnold, who is leading the defense, said the case involves decades-old allegations and critical facts have yet to be fully examined.",
      "On the night of Sept. 7, 1996, Shakur was in a BMW being driven by Death Row Records founder Marion \u201cSuge\u201d Knight. They were waiting at a red light when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted.",
      "Davis, an ex-gang leader who is accused of orchestrating Shakur\u2019s killing near the Las Vegas Strip, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and has been jailed since his September 2023 arrest.",
      "Davis has acknowledged in interviews and in his tell-all memoir that he provided the gun used in the drive-by shooting and that he was in the car. But his court filings say his descriptions in recent years of orchestrating the shooting were \u201cdone for entertainment purposes and to make money.\u201d",
      "Arnold has argued that Davis never should have been charged because of immunity agreements that Davis says he reached years ago with federal and local prosecutors while living in California.",
      "Prosecutors disagree, saying they have strong evidence against Davis and any immunity agreement was limited.",
      "Defense attorneys also are raising questions about the manner of Shakur's death, saying they have witness information indicating that he was in stable condition after the shooting and died suddenly after being hospitalized for a week. They want to consult medical and forensic experts to evaluate potential alternative causes of death."

He\u2019s just the hired muscle, quietly observing and reacting to the quickly devolving situation around him. And yet you can\u2019t take your eyes off of this stranger.",
      "Up until that point it\u2019s been the Mikey Madison show, a chronicle of her character Ani\u2019s whirlwind romance with the spendy, wild son of a Russian oligarch. Igor arrives at the turning point, the end of the honeymoon and the beginning of a swift descent into a chaotic, all-night manhunt. And soon he establishes himself not just as an intriguing outsider, but the soul of the film: The henchman with a heart.",
      "It\u2019s a performance that has caught many off guard: An introduction to a fresh face with an undeniable star quality that has earned him nominations from the Oscars, the Screen Actors Guild and the BAFTAs. But Borisov, 32, is only a newcomer in some parts of the world. Already a star in Russia, Borisov broke through on the international scene in the Cannes title \u201cCompartment No. 6\u201d as the uncouth miner sharing a cramped room with a Finnish student on a long train ride through Russia.",
      "That was the performance that made filmmaker Sean Baker take note and give him a call about participating in what would become \u201cAnora.\u201d Baker has described his secret weapon, who quickly becomes the beating heart and soul of the film, as the \u201cRussian Ryan Gosling.\" Borisov is flattered, but also little confused by the comparison.",
      "\u201cI love Ryan Gosling and very interested to work with him one day. I\u2019ve seen his films. He plays very, very cool. But I don\u2019t know what he means,\u201d Borisov laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s ask Sean.\u201d",
      "Baker, for his part, knew he had a ringer in Borisov but doesn\u2019t show his hand from the top. He strings the audience along, letting them feel like they\u2019re discovering something too. The 28-minute real-time home invasion scene where we meet Igor was actually Borisov\u2019s first to film. It was rehearsed and discussed in detail before the cameras started rolling. In all, it took about eight days to film and three months to edit.",
      "\u201cWe discussed everything trying to find the balance humor and scares and drama and comedy because it\u2019s important for this scene to,\" Borisov said. \u201cBut for me I\u2019m just thinking about a real person named Igor and a real person named Anora.\u201d",
      "He and Baker spoke a lot about Igor\u2019s past, his story, his dreams and his clothes. The white Nike sneakers as contrast to Igor\u2019s all black outfit, he thought, were particularly poignant \u2014 a symbol of Igor\u2019s soul. He liked that his director would ask him if he thought Igor might do this or that instead of just telling him to do something.",
      "But Borisov is not the kind of actor who thinks that he has much interesting to say or explain about his performance. If he could, he said, he\u2019d be a writer. For him, it\u2019s the work that does the talking.",
      "\u201cThe most important is what do you feel when you see the film,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so important what we were discussing.\u201d",
      "The week that Borisov spoke to the AP was the week \u201cAnora\u201d had emerged as the frontrunner in an awards race that had previously been wide open. The supporting actor category however, competitive as it may be with nominees like Edward Norton, Guy Pearce and Jeremy Strong, has been considered Kieran Culkin\u2019s to lose for some time now. But it\u2019s still significant: Borisov is the first Russian actor to get an Oscar nomination since Mikhail Baryshnikov\u2019s nod in 1977 for \u201cThe Turning Point.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that it means something for a lot of people and that\u2019s why it means a lot for me,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople could feel some hope maybe inside them, maybe proud inside them, you know? \u201c",
      "It\u2019s been a wild ride since Cannes and the end is now in sight. Soon he\u2019d be leaving for London, to attend the BAFTAs, and in two weeks Los Angeles for the Oscars. The accolades and nominations have been exciting, though the impulse to keep the conversations going with all the interesting people he\u2019s met along the way has led to more than few late nights.",

      "The work going under the hammer is based on \u201cThe Singing Butler,\u201d a painting by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano showing a couple in evening dress dancing on a beach as servants proffer sheltering umbrellas. Banksy has added a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste.",

Gordon and Cruise have remained friendly \u2014 Cruise showed up at a 2015 NASCAR banquet to honor the retiring Gordon \u2014 which could boost the prospect of Gordon and Hendrick Motorsports' involvement in a sequel.",

If that doesn\u2019t happen, I feel pretty confident there\u2019s a project out there that will get NASCAR back on the big screen, if not just a really cool docuseries or something beyond even what we\u2019re already seeing right now.\u201d",
      "The movie ultimately introduced NASCAR to a wider audience that had very limited exposure to stock-car racing before that summer. There had been racing movies before \u2014 think \u201cThunder Road,\u201d \u201cGrand Prix,\u201d \u201cStroker Ace,\u201d or even \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d \u2014 but none that had depicted NASCAR in such a mainstream style.",
      "\u201cHard to imagine how you pull that off today because they actually had race cars with cameras in the race, and the cameras were big,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cCameras have gotten a lot smaller so maybe you could pull it off, but how do you do it and make it realistic and really authentic?\u201d",
      "NASCAR has seen more swings and misses than checkered flags when it comes to its portrayal on the big or small screen since \u201cDays of Thunder.\u201d For every \u201cTalladega Nights,\u201d there are 10 more bombs such as comedian Kevin James' ill-fated Netflix\u2019s comedy series, \u201c The Crew.\" Gordon said he was encouraged that better days are ahead for NASCAR in the entertainment industry.",
      "\u201cI am seeing just a lot more momentum in projects like coming through NASCAR and coming to Hendrick Motorsports and just more interest,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s good, right?

    "summary": "The freeze on U.S. foreign aid ordered by President Donald Trump has effectively halted one of the world's most successful responses to a disease",
    "story": [
      "The freeze on U.S. foreign aid ordered by President Donald Trump has effectively halted one of the world's most successful responses to a disease",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Florence Makumene held a plastic container of HIV medication and wondered if it would be her last as fears swelled of a return to a time decades ago when millions across sub-Saharan Africa died of AIDS.",
      "As a young adult in Zimbabwe, Makumene watched loved ones succumb to a diagnosis of HIV that was viewed back then as a death sentence. But the 53-year-old didn\u2019t have to suffer the same fate when she tested positive in 2016. A community group funded by the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, ensured she enrolled in lifesaving treatment.",
      "\u201cPeople around me, including my own children, had written me off and were preparing to bury me, but I bounced back stronger,\u201d Makumene said.",
      "PEPFAR has been credited with saving more than 26 million lives and helping change the course of AIDS globally since being introduced in 2003. But the 90-day freeze on foreign aid ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump effectively halted one of the world\u2019s most successful responses to a disease, although his administration subsequently promised waivers to keep lifesaving treatment going. A judge has ordered the administration to lift the freeze.",
      "In Africa, thousands of U.S.-funded health workers have been laid off and clinics have closed, restricting access to HIV testing and treatment. African health officials and experts have pleaded for PEPFAR to resume, fearing services that have become a key part of the health care system will be stripped in a way that sets countries back decades.",
      "\u201cPeople are finding doors closed. They are desperate,\u201d said Simon Bwanya of the Zimbabwe National Network of People Living with HIV.",
      "Globally, AIDS-related deaths have been reduced by 69% since the peak in 2004 and new HIV infections have been reduced by 60% since 1995, according to the United Nations AIDS program. Many experts see PEPFAR, which was introduced by Republican President George W. Bush, as a key part of that turnaround, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the most severely affected region.",
      "\u201cPEPFAR is the most efficient deployment of health resources I have seen,\u201d said professor Francois Venter of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, who has worked in the HIV sector in South Africa, the country with the most people living with HIV, for more than 20 years. \u201cI challenge anyone to tell me how we could have used the money better.\u201d",
      "PEPFAR\u2019s focus is Africa and the vast majority of lives have been saved there, largely through a program that helps get medication that keeps HIV in check to millions of people. Now their ability to keep taking that medication is in peril.",
      "The nongovernmental organization that helps Makumene has been closed for weeks, as has almost every PEPFAR-funded NGO across Africa while their fates are decided in Washington.",
      "\u201cWe are like orphans; we have no one to turn to,\u201d said Makumene, who has a small stockpile of medication. \u201cI fear we might be going back to the old days when being HIV (positive) was equated with death.\u201d",
      "She is one of some 20 million people worldwide who receive antiretroviral medications, or ARVs, with PEPFAR help. The drugs keep HIV from spreading in the body. Stopping them lets the virus start multiplying again and could lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains.",
      "\u201cHIV is a simple disease,\u201d Venter said. \u201cYou stop your ARVs, you get AIDS.\u201d",
      "Without the drugs, HIV can rise again to detectable levels in a person's blood, increasing the chance of its spread.",
      "United Nations AIDS program Executive Director Winnie Byanyima told The Associated Press in an interview that the funding freeze could bring a surge in AIDS and has caused \u201cpanic, fear and confusion\u201d in many African countries.",
      "PEPFAR funds thousands of NGOs but also directly supports countries\u2019 public health systems \u2014 in many cases, by paying the salaries for tens of thousands of health workers who are part of the national HIV programs.",
      "In South Africa, PEPFAR pays for 15,000 HIV-specialist health workers in government hospitals and clinics. They represent just 5% of the total number of health workers in South Africa\u2019s HIV response program but are crucial components: doctors and nurses providing ARVs, social workers and counselors, along with community-based workers reaching people far from hospitals and clinics. Removing them breaks the system.",
      "\u201cCritical health care infrastructure is being dismantled, clinics forced to close, frontline workers without support, all while lives hang in the balance,\u201d said Sibongile Tshabalala, chairperson of the Treatment Action Campaign, one of a coalition of HIV advocacy groups that have come together since the funding freeze.",
      "The coalition said basic HIV services, including testing and treatment, were \u201ccrumbling\u201d in one of the country\u2019s main hospitals in Johannesburg.",
      "The South African government said it is looking at plans to avert a crisis by finding money to keep the health workers in place. Other African countries face even bigger problems.",
      "In Kenya, more than 40,000 workers face being laid off after the aid freeze, officials said. In Lesotho, a small, poor nation in southern Africa, 1,500 health workers \u2014 about 7% of the country's entire health staff \u2014 have already been dismissed. Lesotho's Health Ministry has asked final-year medical students and recent graduates to volunteer at local health centers to stand in for them.",
      "On Jan. 28, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced waivers to keep lifesaving treatment and other parts of PEPFAR going. Rubio has said he is a \u201csupporter of PEPFAR\u201d \u2014 though he has some questions about it \u2014 and the Trump administration wants to see it continue.",
      "Last week, a federal judge ordered the administration to temporarily lift the foreign funding freeze and rejected the argument that the administration was offering waivers to allow some funding to keep flowing. The judge cited testimony that no such waiver system yet existed.",
      "Officials with the U.S. Agency for International Development, which provides much of PEPFAR's funding, and aid groups say they know of no payments getting through for that or any program.",
      "Experts and health activists have also criticized the content of the waivers published by the Trump administration, which restrict access to treatment for some.",
      "As well as ARVs, PEPFAR funds pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, a newer preventive medication. But the waivers only allow PEPFAR-funded NGOs to give PrEP to pregnant or breastfeeding women and not to gay men or sex workers, high risk groups for contracting and spreading HIV. Contraception services through PEPFAR have also been halted.",
      "\u201cThe fight against HIV is not over yet,\u201d said Dr. Kebby Musokotwane, director general of the National AIDS Council in Zambia. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of progress that has been made, but there\u2019s still a lot that needs to be done.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:48:30 -0500",
    "summary": "There was a time not long ago that the exercise mantra in gyms was &ldquo;no pain, no gain.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "There was a time not long ago that the exercise mantra in gyms was \u201cno pain, no gain.\u201d",
      "If you ever turned on the TV in the 2000s after midnight, you might have seen an informercial for P90X.",
      "The exercise program promised shredded abs and bulging biceps for anyone who pushed themselves to their limits for 90 days of 90-minute workouts. So it may come as a surprise that its creator, Tony Horton, now preaches the benefits of rest and warns against overtraining.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know then what I know now,\u201d said Horton, who had spent the \u201990s training celebrities. \u201cBack then it was all about warm-ups and cool-downs, and telling them to eat better and get off the hooch.\u201d",
      "His evolution reflects a broader shift in the exercise industry away from a \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d mentality that once dominated but often led to injury. Instead, the current buzzword in fitness is \u201crecovery.\u201d",
      "Horton \u2014 who at 66 still exudes a boyish exuberance \u2014 noted that P90X did include recovery days with stretching and low-impact movement such as yoga. But these days, he prioritizes mindfulness as much as exercise, and the time between workouts is filled with plenty of good sleep, plunges in frigid water baths, using foam rollers on tight muscles, relaxing in a sauna, and other activities in the name of recovery.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get the recovery and the rest part right, then you\u2019re never going to be able to be consistent with the fitness end of things,\u201d Horton said.",
      "Before Horton, Jane Fonda had pushed home exercisers to \u201cfeel the burn,\u201d while bodybuilders lifted weights to the point of muscle failure. Now, the American College of Sports Medicine and the National Academy of Sports Medicine, two of the largest organizations certifying personal trainers, emphasize recovery methods.",
      "NASM\u2019s \u201cFitness and Wellness\u201d certification includes training in \u201cholistic health and wellness including physical, mental, social and emotional well-being.\u201d",
      "The industry has learned from research that shows the benefit of proper rest, said Stan Kravchenko, founder of the OneFit personal training platform. During deep sleep, the body repairs muscle tissue, and studies show that well-rested people perform better and are less likely to get injured.",
      "But rest is only part of recovery. Kravchenko said personal trainers used to focus only on specific exercises a client could do during their workout. Now, they\u2019re more like life coaches who also give exercise advice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more about your lifestyle, how you eat, how you sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you stressed? What do you do for living? Are you working from a desk? So it\u2019s taking a little bit more like a broad approach.\u201d",
      "The \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d motto is great for athletes who can handle intense workouts and are looking to get stronger, but not everyone needs to push themselves that hard, Horton said. It depends on the goal.",
      "Michael Zourdos, chair of exercise science and health promotion at Florida Atlantic University, said lifting weights \u201cuntil failure\u201d may build bigger muscles, but isn\u2019t needed to increase strength. \u201cThere is a difference between training for health and training for elite performance benefits,\u201d he said.",
      "To realize the health benefits of a workout, it\u2019s still necessary to push yourself, Horton said: \u201cIn the muscles, the lungs, your heart, there\u2019s gotta be a certain amount of strain.\u201d",
      "There is a big difference, however, between discomfort and acute pain. If discomfort crosses into sharp pain in joints, tendons or muscles, stop that movement.",
      "People\u2019s needs vary depending on their goals and bodies. But Kravchencko offered a few general guidelines:",
      "For lifting weights, he recommends allowing 48 hours of recovery time per muscle group, and doing a maximum of 10 sets per muscle group per week. During the workout, he said, it\u2019s best to rest for two to three minutes between sets, as opposed to old advice to wait only a minute before exercising the same muscles.",
      "In between workouts, it\u2019s not necessary to stay still.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to do walking, jogging, very light yoga, stretching, pilates, core exercises,\u201d Kravchencko said. \u201cThat\u2019s all fine, because it\u2019s not specifically targeting the areas you\u2019ve targeted before.\u201d",
      "Horton and Kravchencko both mentioned a recovery practice not typically associated with weightlifting \u2014 meditation. Taking a few quiet minutes every morning helps you deal with the physical and emotional stress of life that can get in the way of wanting to exercise, they said.",
      "Horton recommends establishing a mindfulness routine even before formalizing an exercise plan because it will lay the groundwork to be consistent.",
      "\u201cWhat is your strategy to get to get healthy and to get fit and to stay that way?\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of it has to do with letting the pendulum swing the other way.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 08:56:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Spending all day standing can take a toll on a worker&rsquo;s body",
    "story": [
      "Spending all day standing can take a toll on a worker\u2019s body",
      "NEW YORK -- While traveling in Europe, Margaux Lantelme noticed something different about the store cashiers: they did their work sitting down. It was a stark contrast to Chicago, where Lantelme works the register at REI and cashiers typically spend eight hours a day on their feet.",
      "For Lantelme, a former kayaking instructor, prolonged standing can trigger flare-ups of chronic pain that limit her mobility. She requested a chair to use during her shift and got one. But after a change in management, she had to fill out paperwork to keep the chair, which required multiple doctor visits and insurance co-payments over a period of months. She's still waiting for final approval.",
      "\u201cNot having access to a chair without approval from a doctor, which costs money and time and energy, is really ridiculous,\u201d Lantelme said. \u201cI personally think that people should be able to have access to seating at work anytime they need it.\u201d",
      "Standing for long periods can lead to low back pain, fatigue, muscle pain and leg swelling, and it can increase the risk of cardiovascular problems and pregnancy complications, according to a review conducted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Researchers there concluded that movement, whether walking or shifting from a standing to a seated or leaning position, appeared to be the best way of reducing those health hazards.",
      "Being on one's feet for an extended time also can lead to chronic venous insufficiency, a disease in which damaged veins impact blood circulation, according to the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses, which represents operating room nurses.",
      "The association recommends trying \u201cfatigue-reducing techniques such as alternate propping one foot on a footstool, the use of anti-fatigue mats, using a sit-stand stool and wearing supportive footwear,\u201d said Lisa Spruce, senior director of evidence-based perioperative practices at AORN.",
      "Many jobs besides nursing require extended standing: department store sales clerks, hairdressers, surgeons, restaurant cooks and airport workers are just some of the people who perform their roles on their feet.",
      "Cecilia Ortiz, 43, used to work as an airport wheelchair attendant in Phoenix. \u201cIt takes a really hard toll on the knees,\u201d she said. The break room had three or four chairs, which wasn\u2019t enough for everyone, so workers often went to the hallway and sat on the floor, Ortiz said.",
      "She said she once got written up by her boss for sitting down at an electronic device charging station for 15 minutes after she'd been on her feet for five hours without a break.",
      "Ortiz now works for a warehouse that provides supplies to the airport, and when she needs to sit, she can.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not so strict over there. If we needed to sit down for any reason there wouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Ortiz said.",
      "Her former employer, Prospect Airport Services, said it adheres to all local, state and federal labor regulations regarding breaks. \"Our employees are welcome to take their breaks and meals in our designated break room or in any common-use space throughout the airport,\" company spokesperson Jackie Reedy said. \"This policy allows our employees to choose the location that best suits their needs.\u201d",
      "Unionized workers at the Barnes & Nobles store in Manhattan's Union Square have made access to chairs and the right to sit down under certain conditions a part of their negotiations for their first contract.",
      "\u201cThe longer I\u2019ve been at the job, I\u2019ve started noticing knee issues, especially because we do a lot of bending down and standing back up when we\u2019re shelving books and showing customers things and creating displays,\u201d bookseller Bear Spiegel, 28, said. \u201cBeing able to have a stool available would be really useful just so I could rest my knees for a couple of minutes throughout the day while I\u2019m doing things on the computer while I\u2019m at the registers.\u201d",
      "Spiegel\u2019s coworkers suggested wearing a knee brace and athletic tape, and those solutions have helped, but it\u2019s hard for him to predict what days he\u2019ll need the extra support because his symptoms vary each day, he said.",
      "\u201cThere have been days that I\u2019ve requested a stool and thankfully my managers have allowed me to take them out and use them when needed,\u201d Spiegel said.",
      "Barnes & Noble uses chairs or stools routinely for those working off the sales floor when it\u2019s sensible to do so, but a lot of a bookseller\u2019s work is done on the move, including unpacking, sorting and shelving books, a company spokesperson said.",
      "The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents about 100,000 workers, has been pushing to include in the contracts it negotiates, including at Barnes & Noble, a guaranteed right to sit during work that can be done seated, said Stuart Appelbaum, the union's president.",
      "During one bargaining session, an employer objected to the demand. Union negotiators used a break that emptied the conference room to underline their position. \u201cThe employer came back and saw we had removed all chairs from the negotiating table,\u201d Appelbaum said. \u201cI think the point was made.\u201d",
      "In the end, the union got the chairs it wanted written into the contract, he said.",
      "Around the turn of the 20th century, most states in the U.S. had laws requiring seating for female workers. Women were increasingly entering the workforce, and there was a fear that if their jobs were too physically taxing, they might not become pregnant, said Eileen Boris, a labor historian and professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",
      "Women were seen as the \u201cmothers of the human race, and thus we have to protect motherhood,\u201d Boris added. \u201cAlmost every state had laws, but they weren\u2019t enforced.\u201d",
      "Those laws were repealed over time because they applied only to women. One reason was that the women's movement was pushing for equal rights, rather than special treatment, Boris said.",
      "Labor movements in other countries were more successful in establishing requirements about seating. \u201cThe English shop movement was much stronger and had more men in it than the U.S.,\" Boris said.",
      "In 1964, the International Labour Organization, a U.N. agency, adopted workplace standards requiring employers to furnish sufficient and suitable seats, as well as reasonable opportunities for workers to use them. More than 50 countries ratified the agreement, but the U.S. was not one of them.",
      "Today, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon and Wisconsin are among the states with \u201cright to sit\u201d laws that obligate employers to provide suitable seating for all workers, regardless of gender, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "The city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, approved an ordinance in October that requires manufacturers, retail stores, laundromats, hotels, restaurants, hairdressers, barbers and skin care professionals to let workers sit down as along as sitting doesn\u2019t interfere with their duties. A statewide bill also was introduced in Michigan last fall.",

    "story": [
      "Vatican officials said that Pope Francis had developed pneumonia in both lungs, further complicating the pontiff\u2019s recovery",
      "LONDON -- Vatican officials said late Tuesday that Pope Francis had developed pneumonia in both lungs, further complicating the pontiff\u2019s recovery. The 88-year-old pope was hospitalized Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, doctors said he had developed a mix of infections in his respiratory tract.",
      "On Wednesday, the Vatican said Pope Francis \u201chad a tranquil night, woke up and had breakfast,\u201d saying he was in good spirits. Here\u2019s a look at what a pneumonia diagnosis can mean and potential treatments doctors might be trying:",
      "Pope Francis was admitted to Rome\u2019s Gemilli hospital in \u201cfair\u201d condition on Friday after his bronchitis worsened. On Monday, doctors said he had developed a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, or a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms were growing in his respiratory tract.",
      "Late Tuesday, the Vatican said a chest scan showed he had developed pneumonia in both lungs, requiring additional medication.",
      "Bronchitis occurs when the airways in the lung, known as the bronchial tubes, become inflamed, leading to coughing and mucus production. That infection can sometimes spread to the lungs, resulting in pneumonia, an inflammation of the lungs that's typically caused by an infection.",
      "Doctors say pneumonia in anyone can be serious, but for someone of the pope\u2019s age, it\u2019s particularly worrying.",
      "\u201cOne of the risk factors for more serious infection, like older age, meaning anyone over 65,\u201d said Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Even though the pope lost part of his right lung decades ago, McCormack said that shouldn\u2019t necessarily compromise his recovery, adding that she would be more concerned about any possible signs of weakness in His Holiness.",
      "\u201cBeing a more frail older person can increase your risk of having complications,\u201d she said, noting that having to use a wheelchair could be considered a sign of frailty. The pope has relied on a wheelchair for more than two years.",
      "It appears, however, that the pope is not bed-bound. He has been able to get out of bed and his heart function is good, according to a Vatican official.",
      "Beyond antibiotic drug therapy, there are multiple treatments available, including supplemental oxygen and therapies to support the lungs and body while it\u2019s trying to recover.",
      "Dr. Andrew Chadwick, a respiratory and intensive care specialist at Oxford University Hospital in Britain, said steroids and antibiotics would be the core elements of the pope\u2019s care, alongside nursing care and chest physiotherapy.",
      "Physiotherapy can help patients clear the fluids building up in their lungs, particularly if they aren\u2019t very mobile themselves.",
      "McCormack of Johns Hopkins said that severe cases of pneumonia were typically treated for about one to two weeks but that recovery in an older person could extend beyond that.",
      "Mainly, they\u2019ll be hoping that the pope\u2019s condition doesn\u2019t deteriorate further.",
      "\u201cWhile we give antibiotics and other therapies, we\u2019re waiting for the body to respond,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cIf he just stays as he is while he\u2019s fighting off the infection and has a gradual recovery, that lack of worsening would be an encouraging sign.\u201d",
      "Dr. Maor Sauler, who specializes in adult pulmonary and critical care at Yale University, said that antibiotics typically need the lungs to be working to recover from infections, including pneumonia, but the ability of lungs to recover diminishes with age.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone has pneumonia, there\u2019s a good chance we can treat it,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it is also one of the leading causes of death. And so there are also situations where, despite our best efforts, we cannot clear the infection.\u201d",

      "A Philippine village in the densely populated capital region has launched a battle against dengue by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos \u2014 dead or alive",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- A village in the densely populated Philippine capital region launched a battle against dengue Wednesday by offering a token bounty to residents for captured mosquitos \u2014 dead or alive.",
      "The unusual strategy adopted by the Addition Hills village in Mandaluyong City reflects growing concern after the nearby city of Quezon declared an outbreak of the mosquito-borne illness over the weekend. Eight more areas reported an upsurge in cases of the potentially deadly viral infection.",
      "At least 28,234 dengue cases have been recorded in the Philippines this year up to Feb. 1, a 40% increase compared to the same period last year, according to health department statistics. Quezon City declared a dengue outbreak Saturday after deaths this year reached 10 people, mostly children, out of 1,769 residents infected.",
      "A urban village of more than 100,000 residents living in crowded neighborhoods and residential condominium towers, Addition Hills has done clean-ups, canal de-clogging and a hygiene campaign to combat dengue. But when cases spiked to 42 this year and two young students died, village leader Carlito Cernal decided to intensify the battle.",
      "\u201cThere was an alarm,\u201d Cernal told The Associated Press. \u201cI found a way.\"",
      "Residents will get a reward of one Philippines peso (just over 1 cent) for every five mosquitos or mosquito larva they turn in, Cernal said.",
      "Critics warned the strategy could backfire if desperate people start breeding mosquitoes for the reward. Cernal said that was unlikely because the campaign would be terminated as soon as the uptick in cases eases.",
      "As the campaign began, about a dozen mosquito hunters showed up at the village office. Miguel Labag, a 64-year-old scavenger, handed a jug with 45 dark mosquito larvas squirming in some water and received a reward of nine pesos (15 cents).",
      "\u201cThis is a big help,\u201d Labag said, smiling. \u201cI can buy coffee.\u201d",
      "Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical countries worldwide. It can cause joint pain, nausea, vomiting and rashes, and in severe cases can cause breathing problems, hemorrhaging and organ failure. While there is no specific treatment for the illness, medical care to maintain a person\u2019s fluid levels is seen as critical.",
      "Officials in another village in Quezon City were considering releasing swarms of frogs to eat mosquitoes.",
      "Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said it\u2019s crucial to clean up mosquito breeding sites, and for anyone who might be infected to seek immediate medical attention. Despite an increase in dengue infections, the Philippines has managed to maintain low mortality rates, he said.",
      "Dengue cases surged unexpectedly ahead of the rainy season, which starts in June, likely because of intermittent downpours that have left stagnant pools of water where dengue-causing mosquitos can breed, Health Undersecretary Alberto Domingo said, adding that climate change was likely contributing to off-season downpours."

      "New York is suing several large electronic cigarette distributors for allegedly selling vaping flavors that can appeal to children",
      "New York on Thursday sued some of the country\u2019s biggest distributors of electronic cigarettes, accusing the companies of violating state laws that prohibit the sale of vaping flavors and designs that appeal to children.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James announced the lawsuit targeting middlemen that distribute fruit- and candy-flavored e-cigarettes like Puff Bar and Elf Bar to hundreds of convenience stories and gas stations across the state. The approach differs from past litigation by New York and other states, which targeted vaping manufacturers, such as Juul Labs.",
      "Widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping trend, Juul has paid more than $1 billion to settle dozens of state and local lawsuits and investigations into its early marketing practices, which included launch parties and product giveaways. The company stopped selling flavors like mango and mint in 2019 and is no longer popular with teens.",
      "Instead, Chinese-made disposable e-cigarettes like Elf Bar have become the top choice among high school and middle school students. None of the products are approved by federal health regulators but they continue shipping into the U.S., often mislabeled as batteries, cell phones or other products.",
      "The state\u2019s nearly 200-page legal complaint points to \u201cwidespread evidence of illegal conduct, including documents showing illegal shipments of flavored vapes to New York.\u201d The filing also includes photos of brightly colored e-cigarettes that resemble soft drinks and candy and come in flavors like \u201cfruity bears freeze,\u201d \u201ccotton candy,\u201d and \u201cstrawberry cereal donut milk.\u201d",
      "New York banned all vaping flavors other than tobacco in 2020.",
      "\u201cFor too long, these companies have disregarded our laws in order to profit off of our young people, but we will not risk the health and safety of our kids,\u201d James said in a statement.",
      "The lawsuit seeks hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from the companies, as well as a permanent ban on their sales of flavored vapes in New York.",
      "In 2022 litigation, the co-founder of Buffalo-based Demand Vape told a federal judge that his company had sold more than $132 million worth of Elf Bar e-cigarettes in the past year. The company that makes Elf Bar is based in Shenzhen, China, and sells flavors including \u201cstrawberry mango\u201d and \u201clemon mint.\u201d",
      "Despite the continued availability of disposable e-cigarettes, the vaping rate among U.S. teens has fallen to a 10-year low of under 6%, according to federal figures released last year. Government health officials attribute the drop to more aggressive U.S. enforcement, including hundreds of warning letters sent to retail stores selling unauthorized vaping products.",

      "A push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program may soon get a boost from new Trump Administration officials",
      "A push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the U.S. program that helps low-income families pay for nutritious food has been tried before \u2014 but it may soon get a boost from new Trump administration officials.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the newly confirmed health and human services secretary, and Brooke Rollins, the new agriculture secretary, have both signaled that they favor stripping such treats from SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.",
      "Kennedy has been most vocal, calling for the government to stop allowing the nearly $113 billion program that serves about 42 million Americans to use benefits to pay for \u201c soda or processed foods.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe one place that I would say that we need to really change policy is the SNAP program and food stamps and in school lunches,\u201d Kennedy told Fox News host Laura Ingraham last week. \u201cThere, the federal government in many cases is paying for it. And we shouldn't be subsidizing people to eat poison.\u201d",
      "In one of her first interviews after being confirmed, Rollins said she looked forward to working with Kennedy on the issue.",
      "\u201cWhen a taxpayer is putting money into SNAP, are they OK with us using their tax dollars to feed really bad food and sugary drinks to children who perhaps need something more nutritious?\u201d Rollins said. \u201cThese are all massive questions we're going to be asking and working on in the coming months and years.\u201d",
      "But removing certain foods from SNAP \u2014 known for years as food stamps \u2014 isn't as simple as it sounds.",
      "The program is run by the USDA, not HHS, and is administered through individual states. It is authorized by the federal Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which says SNAP benefits can be used for \u201cany food or food product intended for human consumption,\u201d except alcohol, tobacco and hot foods, including those prepared for immediate consumption.",
      "Excluding any foods would require Congress to change the law \u2014 or for states to get waivers that would let them restrict purchases, said Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research group. Over the past 20 years, lawmakers in several states have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for bottled water, soda, chips, ice cream, decorated cakes and \u201cluxury meats\u201d like steak.",
      "\u201cNone of those requests have ever been approved under either Republican or Democratic presidents,\u201d Bergh said.",
      "In the past, Agriculture Department officials rejected the waivers, saying in a 2007 paper that no clear standards exist to define foods \u201cas good or bad, or healthy or not healthy.\u201d In addition, the agency said restrictions would be difficult to implement, complicated and costly. And they might not change recipients' food purchases or reduce conditions such as obesity.",
      "Anti-hunger advocates point to research that shows SNAP recipients are no more likely than other low-income Americans to buy sugary drinks or snack foods. And they say that limiting food choices undermines the autonomy and dignity of people who receive, on average, about $187 per month \u2014 or about $6.16 per day, according to latest figures.",
      "\u201cThis is just another way to cut benefits,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino, a deputy director at the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cIt's like, how do we restrict people more? How do we stigmatize them more?\u201d",
      "Bills are pending in Congress and in several states to restrict SNAP benefits from paying for soda, candy and other items.",
      "Rep. Josh Breechan, an Oklahoma Republican, sponsored the Healthy SNAP Act.",
      "\u201cIf someone wants to buy junk food on their own dime, that\u2019s up to them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what we\u2019re saying is, \u2018Don\u2019t ask the taxpayer to pay for it and then also expect the taxpayer to pick up the tab for the resulting health consequences.\u2019\u201d",
      "One SNAP recipient said she uses her monthly $291 benefit to buy necessities such as meat, oil, milk and coffee. Martina Santos, 66, of New York City, supplements those foods with fresh vegetables and fruits from a pantry run by the West Side Campaign Against Hunger, where she's also a volunteer. Because she has diabetes and other health conditions, she said she understands the importance of using the benefits only for nutritious options.",
      "\u201cFor me, SNAP is to be used toward healthy food to get people to avoid all the disease they\u2019re having around right now: obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure,\u201d Santos said.",
      "In Kansas and elsewhere, bills that would ban soft drinks and candy highlight some of the challenges of such changes.",
      "Several pending bills seek to keep SNAP from paying for soft drinks, but they would continue to allow drinks containing milk, milk alternatives like soy or almond milk, or drinks with more than 50% vegetable or fruit juice. Candy is characterized as any unrefrigerated, flourless preparation of \u201csugar, honey or other natural or artificial sweeteners in combination with chocolate, fruits, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings in the form of bars, drops or pieces.\u201d",
      "By that definition, Kit Kat and Twix bars, which contain flour, wouldn't be banned. And juices that contain high amounts of sugar, but are more than half fruit juice by volume, would be allowed.",
      "Such conundrums have stymied changes to the SNAP program for decades. But this moment could be different, said Dr. Anand Parekh, chief medical officer of the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank based in Washington, D.C.",
      "The momentum behind Kennedy's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement could spur a new focus on solutions to poor diets that account for leading risk factors for early disease and death.",
      "\u201cWhen we talk about the SNAP program, we have to remind people that the \u2018N\u2019 stands for nutrition,\u201d Parekh said. \u201cIt's about time that both parties can come together and see what are the innovations here to improve diet quality and nutrition.\u201d",

      "The Texas Department of State Health Services said Monday that 13 people are hospitalized with measles.",
      "State health officials say this outbreak is Texas' largest in nearly 30 years. Health department spokeswoman Lara Anton said last week that cases have been concentrated in a \u201cclose-knit, undervaccinated\u201d Mennonite community \u2014 especially among families who attend small private religious schools or are homeschooled.",
      "At least three of the New Mexico cases are in Lea County, which borders Gaines County in Texas. The state health department has said people may have been exposed at a grocery store, an elementary school, a church, Nor-Lea Hospital and a Walgreens in Hobbs, New Mexico.",

      "Yes, the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective in preventing measles infection and severe cases of the disease.",
      "The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide.",

      "Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% of K-12 children in the 2023-24 school year. Health officials say that number is likely higher because it doesn\u2019t include many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported.",
      "Health workers are hosting regular vaccination clinic and screening efforts in Texas. They are also working with schools to educate people about the importance of vaccination and offering shots.",

      "More adults have sought insight on whether they have autism in the last decade",
      "ATLANTA -- Natasha Nelson, a 35-year old entrepreneur in Stone Mountain, Georgia, didn't have an innate sense of social norms. She didn't know why people meeting for the first time would choose to engage in small talk instead of deep conversations, or why people like to make their beds.",
      "Then, a few years ago, she was diagnosed with autism, just after her youngest daughter received the same.",
      "\u201cIf your life has always felt like it was in chaos and you don\u2019t feel comfortable and you don\u2019t feel like you thrive and you just feel like you\u2019re constantly surviving and going from one thing to the next, what you got to lose?\u201d Nelson said, encouraging people to seek a diagnosis.",
      "Common signs of autism include trouble with social communication and a fixation on certain routines or topics \u2014 Nelson says \u201cpeople have become my special interest now\u201d \u2014 and may go unnoticed during someone\u2019s childhood.",
      "But it can be costly and difficult to obtain an autism diagnosis later in life due to a shortage of medical professionals trained to work specifically with adults. Here's more information on what you should know about adult autism diagnoses.",
      "Autism spectrum disorder is a range of intellectual, language and social difficulties, like rigidly following routines, having fixed or obsessive interests and struggling to hold eye contact or understand nonverbal communication. Autism is typically diagnosed during childhood, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends all children be screened as early as 18 months.",
      "More adults have sought insight on their own neurodiversity in the last decade \u2014 often after their children are diagnosed or after seeing social media posts. A study published last year in JAMA Network Open showed a 452% increase in autism diagnoses among adults age 26 to 34 from 2011 to 2022.",
      "Some traits of autism can go unnoticed until adulthood, when there are new social demands. Others may have learned how to hide certain behaviors, known as masking.",
      "\u201cAdults have learned to compensate over time,\u201d said Whitney Ence, a psychologist at the University of California San Francisco who works with autistic adults. \u201cThey may have learned like \u2018I can\u2019t display that in public, and so I do that in private.\u2019\"",
      "There's also an overlap of symptoms between various disorders like ADHD and OCD that can complicate an autism diagnosis due to difficulties with nonverbal social cues or executive functions like attention span, working memory and problem-solving.",
      "Symptoms present differently for everyone, and many of the traits are common for people without autism, like enjoying routines or enjoying going down rabbit holes of information.",
      "But to meet the diagnostic definition of autism, the symptoms must cause significant impairment, said Dr. Arthur Westover, a psychiatrist who specializes in autism at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re human beings in general. We like routines ... just having a bit of pleasure and feeling better with routines does not mean you\u2019re autistic,\" Westover said. \"It goes a little bit deeper than that.\u201d",
      "Russell Lehmann, 34, has lived with his autism diagnosis for more than 20 years. The motivational speaker has routines that he describes as both comfortable and stressful. Eating the same food and buying the same groceries, he said, brings him comfort. But if he skips going to the gym for an hour and a half every day, he becomes overwhelmed with feelings of depression and failure.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like no gym, no day,\u201d he said. \u201c... My routine is an incredibly existential burden, because every night I go to bed knowing I have to do a routine I do not like simply to function.\u201d",
      "While there are various online screening tools, autism is a complex diagnosis, so experts recommend talking to your primary care physician for a psychiatry referral.",
      "That psychiatrist might want to interview people who were present in your early childhood, like family and friends, who can attest to symptoms being present at that time.",
      "Some psychiatrists may refer you to a psychologist, who can give you a standardized diagnostic autism test or will use their own clinical judgement. There is no brain scan or blood test for autism.",
      "Getting an autism diagnosis as an adult can be costly and take some time. Westover said there's a major shortage of specialists who work with autistic adults. Nelson's diagnosis took three years and she paid more than $3,000 out-of-pocket.",
      "Ence also suggests that you ask yourself a few questions when considering getting a professional diagnosis, and to know that you may run into a waitlist: \u201cWhat is leading me down this pathway to think that I need a professional diagnosis? Do I need access to services? Are there services I don\u2019t have available to me?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "At least 29 recruits have died during basic training at law enforcement academies nationwide in the last decade",
      "Ronald Donat\u2019s longtime dream of becoming a police officer was in jeopardy.",
      "The 41-year-old struggled to stand after completing a flurry of pushups, sprints and pullups in the notoriously grueling start of physical training that recruits call \u201cHell Day.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou are dead!\u201d classmates recall a sergeant berating Donat, ordering him to sit on concrete at the suburban Atlanta police academy.",
      "Donat, a Haitian immigrant on his third attempt to land a law enforcement job, assured instructors he wasn\u2019t giving up. He managed to get off the ground and rejoin recruits in a bear crawl exercise. But he soon went limp.",
      "One hundred minutes after training began that October 2021 morning, he was dead, according to records obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Donat is among at least 29 recruits who died during basic training at law enforcement academies around the country in the last decade, an AP investigation found. Most died of exertion, dehydration, heat stroke and other conditions tied to intense exercise \u2014 often on the first day of training, like Donat. Others died several weeks in, sometimes after suffering trauma during boxing or use-of-force drills or collapsing during high-stakes timed runs on hot days.",
      "Experts and police advocates were surprised by AP\u2019s findings \u2014 based on an extensive review of lists of law enforcement deaths in every state, workplace safety records and news reports \u2014 and said many of the deaths were preventable. No federal agency or outside organization comprehensively tracks recruit deaths, unlike officers who die in the line of duty.",
      "\u201cTraining shouldn't have one death, much less 29,\" said David Jude, a retired Kentucky State Police academy commander and instructor. \u201cTo hear that number, it is shocking.\"",
      "Black recruits represented nearly 60% of those who died, a striking disparity given that federal data show Black officers make up 12% of local police forces. Many carried sickle cell trait, a condition most prevalent among Black Americans that increases the risk of serious injury following extreme exertion.",
      "Overall, the deaths amount to a tiny percentage of the nation\u2019s 800,000 sworn officers but highlight another hazard in a profession where shootings, car accidents and other dangers are part of the job.",
      "AP\u2019s tally shows the deaths have grown at a time when departments are tapping an older and more diverse pool of applicants to address officer shortages. More than two-thirds of the deaths occurred since 2020.",
      "A Texas recruit collapsed minutes after instructors denied his request for water, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t get water in a fight,\u201d video obtained by AP shows.",
      "An Arkansas cadet died after he was forced to run wearing long pants in the scorching midday sun. A North Carolina trainee\u2019s temperature was 106 degrees an hour after his death, when he had no water breaks during an hourlong obstacle course.",
      "Citing similar cases, one expert warned in a medical journal in mid-2023 of a \u201ctroubling spate of exertional collapse and death\u201d of police trainees.",
      "\u201cThis sad tragedy is preventable, but will not become so until our police chiefs begin to heed the message,\u201d wrote Dr. Randy Eichner, a retired University of Oklahoma professor who has long studied exertion-related deaths.",
      "But deaths have only continued to mount. At least five were recorded in 2024, including a New York City recruit who died of heat stroke, a Kentucky man who exerted himself during water-based survival training and a Massachusetts cadet who became unresponsive during defensive tactics training.",
      "Police leaders say some deaths can be prevented through improved awareness and practices, acknowledging that the field needs to better screen for and accommodate health conditions that put recruits at risk and to rein in unnecessarily harsh drills.",
      "\u201cNot only are we potentially putting students in danger, but we\u2019re also putting instructors in precarious situations where they may not know about the risks,\u201d said Jude, an expert witness in the 2022 death of 38-year-old Jonesboro, Arkansas, recruit Vincent Parks.",
      "Jude cited a law passed in Arkansas, amid outrage over video showing Parks collapsing while training on a hot afternoon, as a positive step. It requires trainers be educated on heat exhaustion, dehydration and symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest, and mandates that instructors remove cadets from physical activities if they faint or lose consciousness.",
      "AP's investigation found instances in which recruits who were in serious medical distress were pushed to continue training before they died. In addition to calling off drills in such cases, academy leaders must ensure adequate hydration and breaks and limit training when heat makes it unsafe, experts said.",
      "Bill Alexander, CEO of the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, said the number of deaths could be reduced but probably not eliminated given the nature of policing, which can require chasing and arresting combative suspects.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re training people physically and if you\u2019re training them hard, you\u2019re going to have these very rare medical events,\u201d said Alexander, who previously led an academy in Maryland.",
      "Still, some leaders say the field needs urgent action to better protect recruits.",
      "\u201cIt was just heartbreaking. I\u2019ll never forget it. And I\u2019ll do anything at all to get this message out,\u201d said Sheriff Charmaine McGuffey of Hamilton County, Ohio, who witnessed the 2023 death of 36-year-old Marcus Zeigler after he collapsed during a training run. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about life or death.\u201d",
      "When Ronald Donat arrived at the Gwinnett County Police Department Academy in Lawrenceville, Georgia, he thought he\u2019d finally found his place in law enforcement.",
      "He always wanted to become an officer, but his wife, Sharline Volcy, said she initially discouraged him due to safety concerns when their children were young. Both immigrated from Haiti in the 1990s to New Jersey, where they met at church.",
      "Donat earned a college degree and worked various jobs, including installing satellites and cable, but longed for the responsibility and community service that policing would bring.",
      "He finally applied but was initially passed over. When Gwinnett County recruited applicants from New Jersey, Donat applied because he already had a sister living in Georgia, Volcy said.",
      "Georgia's second-largest police agency, Gwinnett County has held hiring events around the country as it struggles to fill hundreds of vacancies. It\u2019s offered bonuses to combat the officer shortage, which grew during the coronavirus pandemic and 2020 protests against police brutality.",
      "A physician who evaluated Donat for the department concluded he was healthy, with no concerning conditions, according to a form the doctor submitted to the state's police standards agency. Following the normal process for the county and most U.S. police departments, the doctor didn\u2019t screen Donat for sickle cell trait.",
      "Donat began working out with other recruits, passed a state-mandated physical fitness test and was given badge 2423. He smiled for a selfie in a squad car. He shared advice with a classmate: \u201cNever give up.\u201d",
      "Up to 3 million Black citizens in the U.S. have sickle cell trait, yet many adults with the genetic condition don't know their status, researchers say. Unlike people with sickle cell disease, they carry only one gene for sickle cell, and one normal gene.",
      "The condition, which is diagnosed through a blood test, doesn\u2019t usually affect their daily lives. But it can cause decreased blood flow and muscle breakdown after intense exertion, dehydration or high body temperatures. In very rare cases, that can result in collapse and death.",
      "The NCAA and U.S. military now screen recruits for the condition, which has contributed to some deaths during football practices and boot camps. Researchers say exertional deaths among college athletes plummeted after NCAA-mandated testing and precautions went into effect in 2010, while the impact of the military programs is under review. Slowly building intensity, resting between drills, remaining hydrated during workouts and responding quickly to signs of distress are recommended.",
      "Most police departments have no such screening programs. Many longtime law enforcement trainers say they\u2019ve never heard of the condition, which AP found was cited as a contributing factor in several deaths and serious injuries of recruits.",
      "McGuffey, the Ohio sheriff, said the cause of Marcus Zeigler\u2019s death was initially a mystery. Before his collapse in May 2023, Zeigler was in peak condition and a top recruit, she said.",
      "The sheriff said she learned about sickle cell trait afterward from another employee, who himself had been seriously injured during academy training. She asked the coroner to investigate whether Zeigler had the condition. After ruling that Zeigler died of exertional heatstroke, the coroner's office added sickle cell trait as a contributing factor.",
      "Since the death, Hamilton County has started screening recruits for the condition, which costs $75 per test.",
      "For Donat and his 27 classmates, academy staffers planned an intense hourlong workout -- a first-day ritual designed to test physical and mental fitness.",
      "Pushups. Flutter kicks. More pushups. Hill sprints. Burpees. Pullups. Bear crawls.",
      "Trainers say the exercises set the tone for the monthslong academy, which seeks to instill a never-quit mindset and prepare recruits for the most dangerous aspects of policing. But the military-style drills have long led to allegations of harsh treatment that cross the line into hazing.",
      "The risks were so well-known that an ambulance usually sat nearby on the first day at the Gwinnett County academy. But that year, a major declined the staff\u2019s request, saying an ambulance would create the perception of danger, according to statements in an internal investigation report.",
      "Donat kept up with classmates for 45 minutes but became exhausted during a set of pullups and couldn\u2019t complete the next exercise, air squats.",
      "An instructor ordered Donat to sit: \u201cYou are dead!\u201d six recruits recalled him screaming, according to the investigation.",
      "The instructor insisted that he told Donat \u201cYou are done!\u201d Either way, it was intended as a reminder, the investigation found, that giving up on police work could lead to death.",
      "Donat didn\u2019t want to quit. Three minutes later, he got up with the help of another recruit and got in formation for a 25-foot bear crawl. \u201cEverything is all right, Donat,\u201d a recruit assured him. But Donat collapsed and stopped breathing.",
      "A paramedic on scene quickly treated Donat with oxygen and chest compressions. An ambulance arrived 10 minutes later.",
      "After Donat was pronounced dead at a hospital, instructors wondered whether his life could have been saved with an ambulance on site.",
      "Hours after Donat died, Gwinnett County released a statement saying Donat had been \u201cinstructed by supervising staff to rest\u201d after becoming lethargic.",
      "A fellow recruit who saw that statement on the news questioned the claim, texting classmates, \u201cas far as I know I never heard that or saw that.\u201d One responded that Donat was last seen in the planking position before his collapse.",
      "A county medical examiner ruled Donat died of natural causes, saying he had an enlarged heart prone to abnormal rhythms. That shocked his wife, Volcy, who said her husband was a fit soccer player with no known heart issues.",
      "The autopsy report didn\u2019t mention sickle cell trait. Volcy believes her husband had it \u2013 she\u2019s learned their daughters do, she said, and she has tested negative. Today, Gwinnett County still doesn\u2019t screen recruits for the condition, spokesperson Sgt. Collin Flynn said.",
      "The department\u2019s investigation, completed weeks after Donat\u2019s death, found no policy violations and resulted in no disciplinary action. A major who led the investigation concluded, \u201cI cannot imagine a scenario, had different actions been taken, that would have changed the tragic death of Recruit Donat.\u201d",
      "Still, the department now requires an ambulance with emergency responders on scene during the first day of physical training, Flynn said. Changes to the workout allow instructors to keep a closer eye on those who are struggling, he said.",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration didn\u2019t investigate because local government agencies aren\u2019t under its jurisdiction. That\u2019s the case in many states, which have not extended workplace safety protections to municipal employees such as police officers.",
      "Because most of the recruits in AP\u2019s investigation hadn\u2019t been sworn in as officers before they died, their names don't appear on the national memorial for deceased officers or some state memorials. And many of their families can\u2019t qualify for death benefits.",
      "Aware of those stakes last year, the police chief in Knoxville, Tennessee, summoned a judge to the hospital room of unconscious recruit Wisbens Antoine.",
      "On that February night, a fellow recruit took the oath on behalf of Antoine, who\u2019d collapsed during training a week before graduation.",
      "Hours later, Officer Antoine, 32, died.",
      "Like Donat, he was a Haitian immigrant who left behind a wife and two daughters.",
      "In Gwinnett County, officials honored Donat by adding his name to its Fallen Heroes Memorial in 2022. But his name isn't on federal or state memorials. Donat\u2019s family was ineligible for state death benefits because he hadn\u2019t graduated.",
      "Congress in 2021 passed a law allowing trainees\u2019 relatives to be eligible for the same federal death benefits as those of sworn officers. The program includes a payment of nearly $450,000, plus college assistance.",
      "But three years later, Volcy said, she\u2019s still awaiting a ruling from the Department of Justice on her application for benefits, which she said she desperately needs to afford college tuition and other expenses.",
      "Volcy was unaware of the investigation into her husband\u2019s death until AP gave her the report last year. She said the department put recruits like Donat \u2013 and their families \u2013 at risk.",
      "\u201cIt is disappointing to know that excessive strain and physical activities brought an end to his life,\u201d Volcy said. \u201cWhat was supposed to be a new beginning, a lifetime achievement, a dream come true turned children into orphans, a wife into a widow and a lifetime of grief.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Republicans are weighing billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, jeopardizing health care coverage for some of the 80 million U.S. adults and children enrolled in the safety net program",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans are weighing billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid, threatening health care coverage for some of the 80 million U.S. adults and children enrolled in the safety net program.",
      "The signing up of millions of additional Americans for taxpayer-funded health care coverage like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's marketplace during the Biden administration was lauded by Democrats as a success. But Republicans, who are looking to slash federal spending and offer lucrative tax cuts to corporations and wealthier Americans, now see a big target ripe for trimming. The $880 billion Medicaid program is financed mostly by federal taxpayers, who pick up as much as 80% of the tab in some states. And states, too, have said they're having trouble financing years of growth and sicker patients who enrolled in Medicaid.",
      "To whittle down the budget, the GOP-controlled Congress is eyeing work requirements for Medicaid. It's also considering paying a shrunken, fixed rate to states. All told, over the next decade, Republican lawmakers could try to siphon billions of dollars from the nearly-free health care coverage offered to the poorest Americans.",
      "Weeks before Congress began debating those changes, Republican governors in Arkansas, Ohio and South Dakota were making moves to implement Medicaid work rules of their own, likely to be approved by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "And other cuts could be on the way. Already on Friday, the Republican administration announced it would shrink the Affordable Care Act's navigator program annual budget by 90% to $10 million. Navigators are stationed throughout the country to help people enrolled in ACA and Medicaid coverage and have helped boost enrollment in health care programs.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has floated the idea of tying work to Medicaid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s common sense,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cLittle things like that make a big difference not only in the budgeting process but in the morale of the people. You know, work is good for you. You find dignity in work.\u201d",
      "But about 92% of Medicaid enrollees are already working, attending school or caregiving, according to an analysis by KFF, a health policy research firm.",
      "Republicans have suggested a work requirement similar to the conditions for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps. Those ages 16 to 59 must work or volunteer at least 80 hours a month if they are not in school, caring for a child under age 6, disabled, pregnant or homeless. On average, a SNAP enrollee's monthly household income is $852, and the enrollee typically receives $239 in benefits.",
      "During a GOP House retreat last month at Trump's golf resort in Doral, Florida, Republicans said the requirement could motivate people to find employment \u2014 maybe even a job that comes with health insurance.",
      "Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said the spending cuts should not be \u201con the back of the poor and needy\" but instead target those who shouldn't be getting the benefit.",
      "\u201cWhy should somebody literally sit on the beach and surf, buy their sandwiches from the food truck with their food stamps and then pick up low-cost housing and so on, while writing a book,\" Issa said, noting that he was describing a constituent from more than a decade ago.",
      "Other cuts on the table include a proposal to change the federal government's reimbursement to a per-person limit.",
      "That would shift the costs to states, which might be forced to make tough choices about who or what they cover, said Joan Alker, executive director of the Georgetown Center for Children and Families.",
      "\u201cPeople still have health care needs even if you cut their coverage,\u201d Alker said. \u201cTheir health care needs are not going to go away.\u201d",
      "Cuts to the program could also prompt upset, with just over half of U.S. adults saying the government spends \u201ctoo little\u201d on Medicaid. Only 15% say it\u2019s spending \u201ctoo much,\u201d according to a January Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration largely blocked states from enacting work rules of their own and required 10 states to remove the requirement for Medicaid coverage.",
      "With Trump now back in charge, some Republican-led states are pressing ahead of Congress to add work rules again. Governors in Arkansas, Iowa and Ohio have announced they'd pursue approval from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to introduce work requirements again. And last fall, South Dakota voters signed off on a plan to add a work rule.",
      "When Arkansas enacted a work requirement during the Trump years, about 18,000 people lost coverage. The rule was later blocked by a federal judge and Biden's Democratic administration.",
      "Some people lost coverage because they had trouble accessing the state's website to log their hours or had other procedural problems, said Trevor Hawkins, an attorney with Legal Aid of Arkansas. The organization sued on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries who were dropped from coverage.",
      "\u201cThese hoops, these things are very consequential,\u201d Hawkins said \u201cThere were a lot of people having hard times.\u201d",
      "In Georgia, 47-year-old Paul Mikell is all too familiar with those hoops.",
      "He's enrolled in Georgia's Pathways to Coverage plan, which offers Medicaid for a slice of impoverished people who make just too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid. Georgia, which has not expanded Medicaid like most other states, requires that people work, volunteer or go to school for 80 hours a month in exchange for accessing the expanded health coverage.",
      "Mikell makes 15-mile (24-kilometer) monthly drives to a government office where he reports his work hours. Sometimes, he said, when he goes online to check whether his hours were logged, they\u2019re not there.",
      "He likened navigating the online system to a battle \u2014 one fought on a computer at the library or borrowed from a friend.",
      "In Idaho, where lawmakers are considering a state work rule and a three-year limit for Medicaid benefits, family physician Peter Crane estimates about two-thirds of his patients are enrolled in the program.",
      "Many work on farms, on ranches or in the local phosphate mines. Before the state expanded Medicaid to cover those with incomes of up to 138% of the poverty level, many of his uninsured patients avoided the doctor entirely. One ignored abdominal pain for months, to the point of needing hospitalization for a severe gallbladder infection, he said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not outliers,\" Crane said of those enrolled in Medicaid during a state hearing last week. \u201cThey\u2019re hardworking citizens of our state who are employed and running small businesses.\u201d",
      "Democrats are warning of the side effects for health care facilities, including rural hospitals and nursing homes. Hospitals have benefited from increased enrollment in health insurance programs such as Medicaid because it guarantees payment for a patient's treatment.",
      "\u201cHospitals will close, including in rural America and urban America and the heartland of America,\u201d House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York warned during a recent speech on the House floor. \u201cNursing homes will be shut down, and everyday Americans, children, seniors, those who are suffering with disabilities, will be hurt.\u201d",

      "Abortions are set to resume in Missouri after a judge blocked regulations that had restricted providers even after voters approved enshrining abortion rights into the state\u2019s constitution",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Abortions are set to resume in Missouri after a judge blocked regulations that had restricted providers even after voters approved enshrining abortion rights into the state\u2019s constitution.",
      "Friday's ruling came after a Kansas City judge ruled last year that abortions were now legal in the state but kept certain regulations on the books while a lawsuit by abortion-rights advocates played out.",
      "One regulation required abortion facilities to be licensed by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Planned Parenthood said most of its facilities could not comply with some of the licensing rules, including \u201cmedically irrelevant\u201d size requirements for hallways, rooms and doors.",
      "Planned Parenthood argued that the licensing law required providers to give \u201cmedically unnecessary and invasive\u201d pelvic exams to anyone receiving an abortion, including medication abortions, according to court documents. The plaintiffs also said some of the regulations on Planned Parenthood centers were so strict, \u201cmost health centers or doctors\u2019 office simply do not meet\u201d them.",
      "Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang said in her ruling that the licensing requirement is \u201cfacially discriminatory because it does not treat services provided in abortion facilities the same as other types of similarly situated health care, including miscarriage care.\u201d",
      "Voters approved the measure adding abortion rights to the constitution in November. That amendment did not legalize abortion in the state outright but instead required judges to reconsider laws that had almost completely banned the procedure.",
      "Margot Riphagen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, said the group is working quickly to start providing the procedure again in the coming days.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision affirms what we\u2019ve already long known \u2014 the state\u2019s abortion facility licensing requirements were not about patient safety, but rather another politically motivated barrier to prevent patients seeking abortion from getting the care they need,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "The ruling is a temporary order pending the outcome of the lawsuit by abortion-rights advocates.",
      "Planned Parenthood and other advocates sued to overturn Missouri\u2019s near-total abortion ban almost immediately after voters amended the constitution to protect reproductive rights. Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey is fighting the lawsuit.",
      "There was no immediate response to a voice message seeking comment from a spokesperson for the attorney general.",

Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

      "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a busy soccer calendar",
      "LONDON -- Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a congested soccer calendar.",
      "Arteta said he felt a \u201cbig pain in the tummy\u201d after seeing Kai Havertz pick up a serious hamstring injury at the end of a light training session in Dubai that will rule the Germany forward out for the rest of the season.",
      "It further stretches Arsenal\u2019s resources up front, with Gabriel Jesus having ruptured his ACL, winger Bukayo Saka having not played since December because of a hamstring issue and another wide player, Gabriel Martinelli, set to miss the next month also with a hamstring injury.",
      "Two more games per team were added to the first stage of this season's Champions League, while Arsenal also went deep in the English League Cup \u2014 it was eliminated by Newcastle in the two-legged semifinals \u2014 and is in a title race with Liverpool in the Premier League.",
      "An expanded and revamped Club World Cup, which takes place in the United States at the end of the season and lasts a month, also extends the schedule for many teams, though not Arsenal this year. Some players have openly complained that it is detrimental to their performance and health and the busy match schedule is facing legal challenges and the possibility of strike action.",
      "For Arteta, it\u2019s no surprise to see injury rates soar at Arsenal because of the extra load on players and what he perceives to be an increased intensity in modern-day soccer.",
      "\u201cYou cannot prove it and the evidence we can provide is very limited in many aspects and every case is very different but already some of them (injuries) we know are based on load and minutes. It's inevitable,\u201d Arteta said Friday. \u201cWe have players who have been injured who have played 130 games over the last two seasons. In the end, it\u2019s an accident waiting to happen if you continue to load and load and load.",
      "\u201cIs this season an accumulation of that? Is it the stress of that? Is it luck? Is it preparation? Is it methodology? There are a lot of factors. It\u2019s very difficult to point at something but the schedule that's planned is super-demanding and for certain players, especially explosive players, it\u2019s a real issue.\u201d",
      "Havertz appears to have been unlucky in picking up his injury, with Arteta explaining how the German stretched his leg to stop a shot at a set-piece and \u201cfelt his hamstring go.\u201d",
      "Given the number of injuries sustained by Arsenal players this season \u2014 others to have had long spells out include Ben White, Martin Odegaard, Riccardo Calafiori and Takehiro Tomiyasu \u2014 some have questioned whether Arteta\u2019s training methods are to blame.",
      "Maybe that was the reason why Arteta was eager to point out that Arsenal\u2019s players now \u201ctrain less than ever\u201d and go into a deeper explanation about how too many games \u2014 and, as a result, not enough training \u2014 affects players\u2019 recovery.",
      "\u201cThe muscle is undertrained and then you expose the muscle and the tendon to an exposure that they cannot absorb because the tendon needs 72 hours to recover,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cA lot of people talk about what we're doing outside. It\u2019s not outside, it\u2019s inside.",
      "\u201cWhen you have to load that muscle for two or three or six or eight weeks that you haven\u2019t in training, the risk of injury is much bigger \u2014 one, because the tendon is not recovered, and then it\u2019s not prepared to absorb the load and stress you are going to put it under every three days.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In the rural villages of South Africa, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s sudden freeze on foreign aid impacts hundreds of thousands of HIV patients",
      "UMZIMKHULU, South Africa -- At a rural village in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province, unemployed 19-year-old Nozuko Majola is trying to figure out if she has enough money for the one-hour ride to collect her much-needed HIV medication, usually delivered to her home that can't be easily reached due to rough, untarred roads.",
      "Majola is one of millions of patients in South Africa affected by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s global foreign aid freeze, raising worries about HIV patients defaulting on treatment, infection rates going up and eventually a rise in deaths.",
      "In 2024, think tank Human Sciences Research Council released figures showing that Majola's province recorded the second-highest HIV prevalence in the country, at 16%, with at least 1,300 young people estimated to contract the disease every week.",
      "KwaZulu-Natal also had the highest number of people living with HIV in South Africa in 2022, about 1,980,000. The country counts more than 7.5 million people infected with the virus that causes AIDS \u2014 more than any other nation.",
      "There are 5.5 million South Africans receiving antiretroviral treatment, whose funding is now in question after Trump suspended the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. It contributes more than $400 million a year to South Africa's HIV programs and nongovernmental organizations, about 17% of the total funding, according to the Health Ministry.",
      "Globally, PEPFAR is credited with saving at least 26 million lives since its inception in 2003, according to the U.N. AIDS agency.",
      "Last week, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to temporarily lift the funding freeze, while the U.S. Embassy in South Africa said PEPFAR projects would resume under a limited waiver. However, aid groups dealing with HIV have already shuttered with closure notices hanging at the entrances and PEPFAR-branded vehicles standing idle, with patients diverted to struggling health facilities.",
      "Most of the PEPFAR funding is channeled through non-governmental organizations, which run programs that compliment health care services provided by the government.",
      "For Majola and other HIV patients in the Umzimkhulu region, where unemployment is rife and most people rely on subsistence farming and government welfare grants, the aid freeze has disrupted their lives.",
      "\u201cThings will be tough around here, and a lot of people will default on their treatment because we really struggle with transport,\" she said. \u201cThe mobile clinics hardly come here.\u201d",
      "The freeze has hurt various groups that can no longer provide treatment, causing an influx of patients to already overstretched public facilities. Along with the medication, these programs also allowed health personnel to test HIV patients in far-flung villages, which has been a lifeline for many, especially those afraid to visit public facilities due to the social stigma attached to HIV.",
      "In addition, nearly 15,000 health workers whose salaries are funded through PEPFAR are left wondering if they have lost their livelihoods.",
      "About an hour away in the district of Umgungundlovu, which the think tank says has the highest number of HIV cases in South Africa, HIV counselors gathered in a small office discussing how best to assist patients like Majola. A manager at a nearby health clinic wondered how to handle the administrative work that is piling up after PEPFAR-funded workers withdrew.",
      "\u201cPeople who were doing administration and data capturing, whose salaries were funded by PEPFAR, have left. We are a small facility and we cannot handle such a workload,\u201d said the manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.",
      "Nozuko Ngcaweni has been on HIV treatment for about 30 years. One of her children was also infected and died at age 17. She said the aid suspension already impacted her community and many missed their treatment.",
      "\u201cNot long ago, we said by 2030, we want to see an HIV-free generation. But if things remain as is, we will not achieve that. We will have to deal with deaths,\u201d she said.",
      "Mzamo Zondi, a provincial manager of the Treatment Action Campaign, which advocates for access to HIV treatment for the poor, has been monitoring the impact of the aid freeze in Umgungudlovu.",
      "\"Our response (to HIV) is likely to falter as we struggle to stop newly infected cases,\" he said. \u201cThis is a matter of life and death.\u201d",

      "Unlike for produce that is consumed, regulations in Europe on cut flowers place no limits on the level of pesticides, UFC-Que Choisir notes.",
      "The group is calling on authorities to introduce maximum levels of pesticide residues, a ban on imports of flowers treated with pesticides that are banned in Europe, and mandatory labelling of the origin and treatment of flowers.",
      "The group bought 15 bouquets of flowers. In each one, between seven and up to 46 different pesticide residues were identified, of which an average of almost 12 were deemed hazardous because they are possibly carcinogenic or endocrine disrupting, the group said. Residues of pesticides banned in the EU were found in two-thirds of the bouquets.",
      "Valhor, the French inter-trade organization for horticulture, floristry and landscaping, however pointed to a study in Germany that concluded there were no risks for consumers who buy cut flowers.",

      "Valhor added that it promotes health and safety practices in the flower industry workplace to limit exposure, including the use of gloves.",
      "Pierre Lebailly, a pesticide expert at University of Caen, regrets that there have been only a small number of studies on the impact of pesticides on florists\u2019 health. Among those, a study in Belgium showed that pesticides could be absorbed through the skin when handling contaminated flowers, with a potential damaging effect on health.",
      "The Dutch branch of the Pesticide Action Network \u2014 a network of European NGOs promoting sustainable alternatives to pesticides \u2014- tested 13 bouquets of tulips, roses, and mixed bouquets in a certified laboratory. Residues of pesticides were found in all bouquets.",
      "According to PAN, Valentine\u2019s roses are typically sourced from Dutch growers with greenhouses or fields in Kenya and Ethiopia.",
      "A total of 71 different active substances were found in the bouquets, of which 28 are banned in the EU. The study found that, on average, each bouquet contained 25 toxic substances."

      "The bill\u2019s Republican sponsor, Rep. Rex Shipp of Cedar City, said it's aimed at preventing accidental shootings by and of young children. The lessons, he said, will be age-appropriate for each grade level, with younger students learning to avoid touching a gun and alert an adult immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times when they don't have any firearms in their homes or don't do any hunting and shooting, then these kids are not taught what to do when they come in contact with a firearm,\u201d Shipp said.",
      "One other state, Tennessee, has a law on the books requiring firearm safety training in public schools, but it lets education officials determine in which grade they think it's appropriate for students to start receiving that instruction. The lessons, set to begin next school year, will be annual and cannot include live firearms or ammunition.",
      "A Utah statute already allows firearm safety to be taught in schools, but Shipp said teachers don't currently do so. His bill makes it mandatory but allows parents to opt their kids out of the instruction.",
      "If it passes the similarly Republican-led Senate and is signed into law, the lessons would begin next school year.",
      "Gun violence prevention advocates have applauded Utah Republicans for pushing for more gun safety education, but some argue those lessons should be aimed at adults.",
      "The proposal unfairly places the responsibility of gun safety on children rather than their parents, said Barbara Gentry of the Gun Violence Prevention Center of Utah.",
      "\u201cGuns and gun safety are the responsibility of the adult gun owner, not school children,\" Gentry said. \"We support schools sending home materials to parents outlining the importance of safe storage in keeping our families and schools safe from gun violence.\"",
      "Jaden Christensen, a volunteer with the Utah chapter of Moms Demand Action, said lawmakers should instead look to grow programs that teach parents the importance of keeping firearms away from children.",
      "\u201cThe burden should always be on adults,\u201d Christensen said.",

      "Rights activists in Singapore and Malaysia will hold candlelight vigils to protest capital punishment as Singaporean authorities prepare to execute a Malaysian man for drug trafficking despite mounting pressure to halt the sentencing",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Rights activists in Singapore and Malaysia will hold candlelight vigils Wednesday to protest capital punishment as Singaporean authorities prepare to execute a Malaysian man for drug trafficking despite mounting pressure to halt the sentencing.",
      "Pannir Selvam Pranthaman was arrested in 2014 for having 52 grams (about 1.8 ounces) of heroin and sentenced to death in 2017. He is due to be hanged on Thursday, making him the fourth person to be put to death in the Southeast Asian country this year alone; two others were executed for drug-related crimes and one for murder.",
      "Singapore\u2019s strict laws mandate the death penalty for anyone caught carrying more than 15 grams (0.5 ounces) of heroin and 500 grams (17.6 ounces) of cannabis. However, critics say the laws only target low-level traffickers and couriers.",
      "Pannir's family, lawyers, some Malaysian lawmakers and various rights groups noted that the Singapore court had found that he was merely a courier transporting the substance. The 36-year-old has said he didn't know he was carrying drugs. Still, the court had to hand down the death sentence after prosecutors refused to issue Pannir a certificate of substantive assistance, vouching that he helped their investigation, which would have spared him the noose, they said.",
      "\"This process violates the right to a fair trial, as it placed the decision between a life-or-death sentence in the hands of the prosecution\u2013which is not a neutral party in the trial,\u201d Amnesty International said. \u201cWe urge the Singapore government to immediately end its unlawful resort to the death penalty and immediately establish a moratorium on all executions.\"",
      "Malaysian lawmakers called on their country to intervene to halt Pannir's execution and have him extradited to facilitate further investigation.",
      "The Malaysian government, which recently scrapped the mandatory death penalty, didn't respond to media queries.",
      "\u201cWe oppose the use of the death penalty on drug mules who are themselves victims in the million-dollar transactions by syndicates that are roaming free,\u201d Malaysian lawmaker Ram Karpal Singh was quoted as saying by The Star newspaper.",
      "Pannir, the third of six children, is the son of a church pastor who worked as a lorry driver to make ends meet, said Singapore anti-death penalty activist Kokila Annamalai. He loves music and played in the church choir growing up, she said.",
      "Behind bars, Pannir has written letters, songs and poems about the anguish of being on death row and hopes of a second chance, she said. His family has shared some of his songs, which were replicated by several Malaysian singers.",
      "Activists in Malaysia will hold a vigil outside the Singapore High Commission in Kuala Lumpur later Wednesday. Another vigil will be held simultaneously at a park in Singapore to protest Pannir\u2019s execution and the death penalty, as well as to remember those hanged by the city-state."

      "The Afghan embassy in Islamabad says Pakistan wants to remove all Afghan refugees from the country and they face expulsion in the near future",
      "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan wants to remove all Afghan refugees from the country and they face expulsion in the near future, the Afghan embassy in Islamabad warned Wednesday.",
      "The embassy issued a strongly worded statement about Pakistan\u2019s plans, saying Afghan nationals in the capital, Islamabad, and the nearby garrison city of Rawalpindi have been subjected to arrests, searches, and orders from the police to leave the twin cities and relocate to other parts of Pakistan.",
      "\u201cThis process of detaining Afghans, which began without any formal announcement, has not been officially communicated to the Embassy of Afghanistan in Islamabad through any formal correspondence,\u201d it said.",
      "\u201cUltimately, officials from Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that there is a definitive and final plan to deport all Afghan refugees not only from Islamabad and Rawalpindi but also from the entire country in the near future,\u201d the embassy said.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Pakistani government on the embassy statement.",
      "The latest development follows Pakistan\u2019s threat to deport Afghans living in the country illegally. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif approved a deadline of March 31 to deport those awaiting relocation to third countries unless their cases are swiftly processed by the governments who have agreed to take them.",
      "The Afghan embassy criticized \"the short timeframe\" given and \"the unilateral nature of Pakistan\u2019s decision\u201d.",
      "Besides the hundreds of thousands living illegally in Pakistan, some 1.45 million Afghans are registered with the UNHCR as refugees. Pakistan says those who were registered earlier had their stay extended until June 2025, and will not be arrested or deported at least until the extension expires.",
      "Earlier this month, Shafqat Ali Khan, the spokesman at Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said: \u201cThis resettlement problem can\u2019t be indefinite. So, for us, the Afghans who are here, awaiting resettlement, also has to be a transitory phase. This is not a permanent thing.\u201d",
      "He said Pakistan has been collaborating with Western countries to expedite the resettlement program and \u201cwill continue to do that.\u201d",
      "In the past three years, tens of thousands of Afghans have fled to Pakistan. Many of them were approved for resettlement in the U.S. through a program that helps people at risk because of their work during the war with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. However, after U.S. President Donald Trump paused U.S. refugee programs last month, around 20,000 Afghans are now in limbo in Pakistan.",
      "They have been facing harassment and arrest since October 2023, when Pakistan began cracking down on foreigners living in the country illegally.",
      "Although the government said the campaign was not aimed at Afghans, they make up the majority of foreigners in Pakistan.",
      "The International Organization for Migration reported an increase in deportation of Afghans in January.",
      "The IOM this week said Afghans were being deported from Islamabad and Rawalpindi. It said there was a 13% increase in Afghans returning home from Jan. 16 to 31 compared to the first two weeks in January. It said 824,568 Afghans have returned home since 2023.",
      "Ahmad Shah, a member of an Afghan advocacy group, urged Pakistan on Wednesday to allow Afghans waiting for relocation to continue living in Islamabad at least until the Trump administration makes a final decision about their fate.",
      "He said it would be hard for them to visit Western embassies in the Pakistani capital if they were moved to other areas."

      "The government of Ecuador has taken another step in its effort to gain help from foreign military forces to combat drug cartels and various organized crime groups",
      "QUITO, Ecuador -- QUITO, Ecuador (AP) \u2014 Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa on Wednesday took another step in his effort to enlist foreign military assistance to combat the drug cartels and organized crime groups that have been behind the escalation in violent crime over the past four years.",
      "Noboa, according to a statement from the communications secretariat, ordered the foreign ministry to seek cooperation agreements with \u201callied nations\u201d that would allow \u201cthe incorporation of special forces\u201d on a temporary basis as support for the Ecuadorian police and armed forces. He also urged the opposition-controlled National Assembly to back his initiative.",
      "The statement did not say which countries Ecuador would seek military assistance from.",
      "The spike in violence across the South American country is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. Mexican, Colombian and Balkan cartels have set down roots in Ecuador and operate with assistance from local criminal gangs.",
      "Under Noboa\u2019s watch, the homicide rate dropped from 46.18 per 100,000 people in 2023 to 38.76 per 100,000 people last year. But the rate remained far higher than the 6.85 per 100,000 people in 2019, and the country is already on track to exceed that number this year. January was Ecuador\u2019s deadliest month on record, with 731 homicides.",
      "The conservative Noboa earlier this month won one of two spots in an April runoff election.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s announcement comes months after he asked Ecuador\u2019s Constitutional Court to clear a partial constitutional reform that would allow the installation of foreign military bases in the country. The court ruled in favor of his initiative, which now must be debated twice by the National Assembly and, if approved, ratified in a referendum.",
      "The U.S. military for a decade operated a base in Ecuador that was mainly focused on anti-narcotic operations. But that stopped in 2009, when then-President Rafael Correa ended an agreement with the U.S. citing sovereignty issues.",
      "Security expert Mario Pazmi\u00f1o told The Associated Press he believes that the government\u2019s proposal does not seek foreign troops for combat, but instead, for help with intelligence gathering and support of ports and maritime interdictions.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has blamed Ukraine for starting the war that has cost tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- President Donald Trump this week falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war that has cost tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives, causing outrage and alarm in a country that has spent nearly three years fighting back a much larger Russian military.",
      "Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201c a dictator without elections\u201d and claimed his support among voters was near rock-bottom.",
      "Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the disinformation is coming from Russia, and some of what Trump has said does echo Russia's own narrative of the conflict.",
      "Here's a look at some of Trump's statements:",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: \u201cYou\u2019ve been there for three years. You should have ended it ... You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.\u201d",
      "THE FACTS: Russia\u2019s army crossed the border on Feb. 24, 2022, in an all-out invasion that Putin sought to justify by falsely saying it was needed to protect Russian-speaking civilians in eastern Ukraine and prevent the country from joining NATO.",
      "But Russia's aggression against Ukraine didn't start then. In 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin saw signs that Ukraine was pulling away from Russia's sphere of influence, seeking alliances with western European nations.",
      "Putin illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula and started an armed aggression in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas that grew into a long-running conflict that left thousands dead.",
      "That conflict simmered until 2022, when Putin ordered what he called military exercises along Ukraine's borders. He told the world that the roughly 150,000 soldiers that he had amassed would not be used to invade Ukraine. But in the early hours of Feb. 24, Russia launched widespread airstrikes and soldiers began pouring over the border.",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: \u201cWe have a situation where we haven\u2019t had elections in Ukraine, where we have martial law,\u201d Trump said in Mar-a-Lago, adding on Wednesday in a post on social media: \u201cA Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.\u201d",
      "THE FACTS: Zelenskyy was elected to a five-year term in 2019, and the next presidential elections had been scheduled for spring 2024. But Ukrainian law prohibits parliamentary or presidential elections during a state of martial law, so Zelenskyy has remained in office. He has said he believes elections will be held in Ukraine after martial law is lifted. The country would need to amend the law if it decided to hold a vote.",
      "There are numerous factors that, according to Ukraine\u2019s government, \u201cwould render it literally impossible to ensure a fair electoral process in the circumstances of a total war.\u201d",
      "According to the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency, some 6.9 million Ukrainian refugees have been registered worldwide since February 2022. Of those, millions remain outside the country due to the war. It would be nearly impossible for all of those who have been displaced to participate in an election, potentially robbing millions of their right to vote.",
      "Furthermore, around 800,000 soldiers are currently serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces as they struggle to contain Russian advances. An election would necessitate pulling soldiers off the front lines to vote, weakening Ukraine\u2019s military position. Additionally, those fighting would be unable to run for office, a right that is guaranteed to them by Ukrainian law.",
      "Many Ukrainians are living in areas under Russian occupation, essentially precluding their participation in any electoral process. And since Russia continues to regularly strike both military and civilian targets across the country, packing millions of citizens into crowded polling places could create additional danger.",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: \u201cThe leader in Ukraine, I mean, I hate to say it, but he\u2019s down at 4% approval rating.\u201d",
      "THE FACTS: Zelenskyy \u201cretains a fairly high level of public trust\u201d \u2014 about 57 percent - according to a report released Wednesday by the Kyiv International Institution of Sociology, whose executive director is Anton Hrushetskyi.",
      "Speaking in Kyiv on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said the number given by Trump, for which the president cited no sources, was \u201cdisinformation\u201d that originated in Russia, and that the president \"unfortunately lives in this disinformation space.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said he will ask pollsters in the coming weeks to conduct surveys on the public's trust in him and share the results with the Trump administration.",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: \u201cWhen you see what\u2019s taken place in Ukraine with millions of people killed, including the soldiers, millions of people killed, a big percentage of their cities knocked down to the ground, I don\u2019t know how anybody even lives there.\u201d",
      "THE FACTS: No estimates by any reputable analysis place deaths near the millions.",
      "While exact figures of the number of deaths are unknown, Zelenskyy said earlier this month that over 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the start of the full-scale war in February 2022. He has also said that \u201ctens of thousands of civilians\u201d had been killed in occupied areas of Ukraine, but that no exact figures would be available until the war was over. The most recent data from the Russian Defense Ministry, published in January 2023, pointed to just over 6,000 military deaths, although reports from U.S. and U.K. officials put that number significantly higher."

      "Tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled home following recent Israeli military operations across the northern West Bank",
      "FAR'A REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank -- By car and on foot, through muddy olive groves and snipers\u2019 sight lines, tens of thousands of Palestinians in recent weeks have fled Israeli military operations across the northern West Bank \u2014 the largest displacement in the occupied territory since the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "After announcing a widespread crackdown against West Bank militants on Jan. 21 \u2014 just two days after its ceasefire deal with Hamas in Gaza \u2014 Israeli forces descended on the restive city of Jenin, as they have dozens of times since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",
      "But unlike past operations, Israeli forces then pushed deeper and more forcefully into several other nearby towns, including Tulkarem, Far\u2019a and Nur Shams, scattering families and stirring bitter memories of the 1948 war over Israel\u2019s creation.",
      "During that war, 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes in what is now Israel. That Nakba, or \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d as Palestinians call it, gave rise to the crowded West Bank towns now under assault and still known as refugee camps.",
      "\u201cThis is our nakba,\u201d said Abed Sabagh, 53, who bundled his seven children into the car on Feb. 9 as sound bombs blared in Nur Shams camp, where he was born to parents who fled the 1948 war.",
      "Humanitarian officials say they haven\u2019t seen such displacement in the West Bank since the 1967 Mideast war, when Israel captured the territory west of the Jordan River, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, displacing another 300,000 Palestinians.",
      "\u201cThis is unprecedented. When you add to this the destruction of infrastructure, we\u2019re reaching a point where the camps are becoming uninhabitable,\" said Roland Friedrich, director of West Bank affairs for the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency. More than 40,100 Palestinians have fled their homes in the ongoing military operation, according to the agency.",
      "Experts say that Israel's tactics in the West Bank are becoming almost indistinguishable from those deployed in Gaza. Already, President Donald Trump's plan for the mass transfer of Palestinians out of Gaza has emboldened Israel's far-right to renew calls for annexation of the West Bank.",
      "\"The idea of \u2018cleansing\u2019 the land of Palestinians is more popular today than ever before,\" said Yagil Levy, head of the Institute for the Study of Civil-Military Relations at Britain\u2019s Open University.",
      "The Israeli army denies issuing evacuation orders in the West Bank. It said troops secure passages for those wanting to leave on their own accord.",
      "Over a dozen displaced Palestinians interviewed in the last week said they did not flee their homes out of fear, but on the orders of Israeli security forces. Associated Press journalists in the Nur Shams camp also heard Israeli soldiers shouting through mosque megaphones, ordering people to leave.",
      "Some displaced families said soldiers were polite, knocking on doors and assuring them they could return when the army left. Others said they were ruthless, ransacking rooms, waving rifles and hustling residents out of their homes despite pleas for more time.",
      "\u201cI was sobbing, asking them, \u2018Why do you want me to leave my house?\u2019 My baby is upstairs, just let me get my baby please,\u2019\u201d Ayat Abdullah, 30, recalled from a shelter for displaced people in the village of Kafr al-Labd. \u201cThey gave us seven minutes. I brought my children, thank God. Nothing else.\"",
      "Told to make their own way, Abdullah trudged 10 kilometers (six miles) on a path lighted only by the glow from her phone as rain turned the ground to mud. She said she clutched her children tight, braving possible snipers that had killed a 23-year-old pregnant woman just hours earlier on Feb. 9.",
      "Her 5-year-old son, Nidal, interrupted her story, pursing his lips together to make a loud buzzing sound.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re right, my love,\" she replied. \u201cThat\u2019s the sound the drones made when we left home.\u201d",
      "In the nearby town of Anabta, volunteers moved in and out of mosques and government buildings that have become makeshift shelters \u2014 delivering donated blankets, serving bitter coffee, distributing boiled eggs for breakfast and whipping up vats of rice and chicken for dinner.",
      "Residents have opened their homes to families fleeing Nur Shams and Tulkarem.",
      "\u201cThis is our duty in the current security situation,\u201d said Thabet A\u2019mar, the mayor of Anabta.",
      "But he stressed that the town\u2019s welcoming hand should not be mistaken for anything more.",
      "\u201cWe insist that their displacement is temporary,\u201d he said.",
      "When the invasion started on Feb. 2, Israeli bulldozers ruptured underground pipes. Taps ran dry. Sewage gushed. Internet service was shut off. Schools closed. Food supplies dwindled. Explosions echoed.",
      "Ahmad Sobuh could understand how his neighbors chose to flee the Far\u2019a refugee camp during Israel's 10-day incursion. But he scavenged rainwater to drink and hunkered down in his home, swearing to himself, his family and the Israeli soldiers knocking at his door that he would stay.",
      "The soldiers advised against that, informing Sobuh's family on Feb. 11 that, because a room had raised suspicion for containing security cameras and an object resembling a weapon, they would blow up the second floor.",
      "The surveillance cameras, which Israeli soldiers argued could be exploited by Palestinian militants, were not unusual in the volatile neighborhood, Sobuh said, as families can observe street battles and Israeli army operations from inside.",
      "But the second claim sent him clambering upstairs, where he found his nephew\u2019s water pipe, shaped like a rifle.",
      "Hours later, the explosion left his nephew's room naked to the wind and shattered most others. It was too dangerous to stay.",
      "\u201cThey are doing everything they can to push us out,\u201d he said of Israel's military, which, according to the U.N. agency for refugees, has demolished hundreds of homes across the four camps this year.",
      "The Israeli army has described its ongoing campaign as a crucial counterterrorism effort to prevent attacks like Oct. 7, and said steps were taken to mitigate the impact on civilians.",
      "The first thing Doha Abu Dgehish noticed about her family's five-story home 10 days after Israeli troops forced them to leave, she said, was the smell.",
      "Venturing inside as Israeli troops withdrew from Far'a camp, she found rotten food and toilets piled with excrement. Pet parakeets had vanished from their cages. Pages of the Quran had been defaced with graphic drawings. Israeli forces had apparently used explosives to blow every door off its hinges, even though none had been locked.",
      "Rama, her 11-year-old daughter with Down syndrome, screamed upon finding her doll\u2019s skirt torn and its face covered with more graphic drawings.",
      "AP journalists visited the Abu Dgehish home on Feb. 12, hours after their return.",
      "Nearly two dozen Palestinians interviewed across the four West Bank refugee camps this month described army units taking over civilian homes to use as a dormitories, storerooms or lookout points. The Abu Dgehish family accused Israeli soldiers of vandalizing their home, as did multiple families in Far\u2019a.",

      "European Union envoys have approved new sanctions against Russia, with the measures set to enter into force next week on the third anniversary of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine",
      "BRUSSELS -- European Union envoys have approved a new raft of sanctions against Russia, with the measures set to enter into force next week on the third anniversary of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a top EU official and diplomats confirmed on Wednesday.",
      "The move comes with the Europeans sidelined from U.S.-led talks to end the war.",
      "The EU has slapped several rounds of sanctions on Russia since President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine in February 24, 2022. More than 2,300 officials and entities \u2013 usually government agencies, banks and organizations \u2013 have been hit.",
      "The diplomats confirmed approval of the sanctions \u2014 the 16th package of measures including travel bans, asset freezes and trade restrictions \u2014 on condition that they not be named. The measures are still not entirely finalized until EU foreign ministers endorse them on Monday, allowing them to enter force.",
      "Among the latest sanctions are measures targeting Russia\u2019s so-called \u201c shadow fleet \u201d of ships that it exploits to skirt restrictions on transporting oil and gas, or to carry stolen Ukrainian grain. Some 70 vessels believed to be part of the shadow fleet will be added to more than 50 already listed.",
      "EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, whose services drafted some of the measures for consideration, welcomed their prospective adoption by the 27-nation bloc\u2019s ambassadors.",
      "\u201cThe EU is clamping down even harder on circumvention by targeting more vessels in Putin\u2019s shadow fleet and imposing new import and export bans. We are committed to keep up the pressure on the Kremlin,\u201d she said in a social media post.",
      "Almost 50 Russian officials will be targeted, joining a list that already includes Putin, several of his associates and scores of lawmakers, while dozens more entities face sanctions. Among the measures are restrictions on 13 Russian banks and 3 financial institutions, the diplomats said.",
      "The sanctions would also place restrictions on the use of 11 ports and airports in Russia that the EU considers are being used to help Moscow bypass an oil price cap and other measures already imposed by the bloc.",
      "Trade bans on some chemicals and aluminum are also included."

      "South Africa\u2019s budget announcement by the finance minister has been abruptly canceled and rescheduled for next month over a dispute among parties in the governing coalition",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The South African government's annual presentation of its budget was abruptly canceled Wednesday and rescheduled for next month over a dispute among parties in the governing coalition.",
      "The finance minister's budget speech normally takes place in February. Parliament Speaker Thoko Didiza said it was the first time that the presentation had been canceled over such a disagreement in the 31 years of South Africa\u2019s democracy after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.",
      "South Africa has a 10-party coalition in government after the long-ruling African National Congress, or ANC, lost its majority in an election last year for the first time since apartheid ended. That means it cannot pass the budget without support from other parties in Parliament.",
      "The Democratic Alliance, the country\u2019s second biggest party, said the budget postponement was over a 2% increase in value-added tax proposed by the ANC. The DA said in a statement that the tax increase \u201cwould have broken the back of our economy.\u201d",
      "The budget delay came just over a week after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered U.S. aid and assistance to South Africa to be cut over a contentious land law. That move by Trump was expected to put pressure on South Africa\u2019s government to find funds to plug gaps, especially in the public health service. South Africa was already impacted by Trump\u2019s 90-day global freeze on U.S. aid.",
      "Africa\u2019s most advanced economy has hardly grown in recent years. Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana, who was meant to present the budget to Parliament, told reporters that the South African government was facing fiscal challenges.",
      "\u201cDo we borrow more, and what are the implications of that?\u201d Godongwana said. \u201cDo we continue cutting expenditure? What are the implications of that? Do we raise tax and what are the implications of that?\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is general agreement that in the current environment, we need to find ways of funding our priorities.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine three years ago has turned into Europe\u2019s largest conflict since World War II",
      "When Russian troops rolled into Ukraine three years ago, they brought their parade uniforms with them on the push to Kyiv. President Vladimir Putin expected a quick victory.",
      "What Putin dubbed the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d has turned into Europe\u2019s largest conflict since World War II. Tens of thousands have been killed, entire cities have been reduced to smoldering ruins, millions of Ukrainians became refugees, and Russia was isolated from the West.",
      "Now as senior Russian and U.S. officials are talking again and setting the stage for summit meeting, Putin appears closer than ever to cementing Moscow\u2019s gains of about a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory and keeping it out of NATO.",
      "President Donald Trump sharply reversed the three-year U.S. policy of isolating Russia when he called Putin and said afterward they agreed \u201cto work together very closely\u201d to end the war. He said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cwill be involved\u201d in negotiations but didn't elaborate.",
      "Trump also expressed understanding of Putin\u2019s key demand on the pivotal issue of Ukraine\u2019s prospective NATO membership that the U.S. and other alliance members previously described as irreversible. \u201dThey\u2019ve been saying that for a long time that Ukraine cannot go into NATO,\u201d Trump said of Russia. \u201cAnd I\u2019m OK with that.\u201d",
      "Putin invaded on Feb. 24, 2022, after demanding that NATO abandon membership for Ukraine and pull back the alliance\u2019s troops on NATO\u2019s eastern flank -- actions rejected by the West.",
      "He claimed his move was necessary to safeguard Russia\u2019s security interests and protect Russian speakers in Ukraine. Kyiv and its allies denounced his move as an unprovoked act of aggression. Ukrainians saw it as Moscow's attempt to destroy their national sovereignty and identity.",
      "Russian troops reached the outskirts of Kyiv early in the invasion but pulled back a month later amid heavy losses and Ukraine's attacks on supply lines. More humiliating setbacks came in September and October 2022, when a Ukrainian counteroffensive forced Russia to pull back from large parts of the Kharkiv region in the northeast and the Kherson region in the south.",
      "Fortunes changed in 2023 when a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south failed to cut Russia's land route to the Crimea Peninsula, which Moscow illegally annexed from Kyiv in 2014.",
      "Russia seized the combat initiative last year with offensives along the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front, making slow but persistent gains. In the fall, Russian forces captured the most territory since the opening of the war.",
      "Moscow also pummeled Ukrainian infrastructure with waves of missiles and drones, destroying much of its power generating capacity.",
      "Ukraine struck back in August with an incursion into Russia's Kursk region to try to distract Moscow's forces in the east and gain more leverage in potential peace talks. Ukraine still holds some of those gains, but its limited resources are stretched, making it difficult to defend strongholds in the east.",
      "While Zelenskyy earlier demanded Russia\u2019s full withdrawal from all occupied areas as a precondition for talks, he later acknowledged Kyiv can\u2019t immediately reclaim all its territory. He said Ukraine won't abandon its goal of joining NATO \u2014 even though Trump dismissed that as \u201cimpractical\u201d \u2014 and Zelenskyy emphasized needing reliable Western security guarantees and a robust European peacekeeping force to prevent Russian attacks.",
      "Trump\u2019s call with Putin and ensuing Russia-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia shattered the Biden administration's \u201cnothing about Ukraine without Ukraine\u201d policy. Trump blamed Kyiv for failing to make a deal with Moscow that could have prevented the war, praised Russia's military might and even suggested that Ukraine \u201cmay be Russian someday.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine won\u2019t accept any deal negotiated without Kyiv and insisted that European allies must participate in peace talks. He dismissed a U.S.-proposed draft agreement that would give Washington a large share of Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals as too focused on U.S. interests and had no security guarantees for Kyiv.",
      "Trump\u2019s approach stunned European allies, whose shock deepened when Vice President JD Vance sharply rebuked them at the Munich security conference over free speech and migration.",
      "While the Trump administration said European allies weren't welcome at the peace talks, it encouraged them to provide security guarantees for Kyiv in what former British ambassador Nigel Gould-Davies called a contradictory approach.",
      "Washington \"has signaled that the U.S. alone will negotiate an end to the war but also that Europe alone must pay for and enforce an outcome it has not played a role in deciding,\u201d said Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "Putin's key goals remain much the same \u2014 that Ukraine renounce joining NATO and enforce the use of the Russian language to keep the country in Moscow's orbit \u2014 but now wants Kyiv to withdraw its forces from the four regions Moscow has seized but doesn't fully control.",
      "He said a peace agreement could be broadly based on a draft negotiated early in the war that obliged Ukraine to declare neutrality, scale down its military and protect Russian language and culture. Those talks collapsed in April 2022 with no deal.",
      "Putin ruled out a truce, arguing it would benefit Kyiv. But some Kremlin-watchers believe he could accept it if Kyiv agrees to hold elections after a ceasefire.",
      "Trump echoed Putin's line that Zelenskyy, whose term expired last year, needs to face voters, while Kyiv maintains elections are impossible to hold amid a war. Trump escalated that notion Wednesday by posting on social media that Zelenskyy was \u201ca Dictator without Elections.\u201d",
      "Putin could hope an election would weaken Zelenskyy and lead to political instability, said Tatiana Stanovaya, senior fellow at Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.",
      "\u201cIn his view, most potential outcomes would be advantageous for Moscow \u2014 whether through heightened political infighting, possible protests, or a fragile victory for a new president,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Jack Watling of London's Royal United Services Institute says Ukraine faces \u201ca politically divisive election, economic paralysis due to a lack of foreign direct investment, and coercive threats from Russia to restart the war\u201d after a truce.",
      "It's unclear who would monitor any potential ceasefire.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said NATO should play no role and that any European troops taking part should not be covered by NATO\u2019s charter obliging allies to aid of any member under attack -\u2013 conditions that could dampen European enthusiasm about the mission.",
      "While the U.K. and others signal readiness to deploy troops for such a mission, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said after the U.S.-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia that Moscow won't accept troops from any NATO members in a peacekeeping force.",
      "Some reports suggested Chinese or Brazilian troops as part of a monitoring force, but those countries haven\u2019t signaled any intention of participation.",
      "Many believe Putin is no rush to make a peace deal.",
      "\u201cNegotiations appear desirable but by no means necessary for Russia to achieve its goals in its war against Ukraine,\u201d Stanovaya wrote.",
      "\u201cVirtually any outcome will be a good result for Moscow,\u201d she said, pointing at the erosion of Western unity and reduced Western support for Kyiv amid Moscow\u2019s gains.",
      "\u201cPutin has repeatedly made it clear that he believes Russia can achieve its goals in Ukraine without any U.S.-brokered deal,\u201d Stanovaya noted. \u201cAs far as he is concerned, Moscow simply needs to wait until Ukraine falls apart of its own accord, after which the Russian army will crush any remaining resistance among the Ukrainian army.\u201d",

      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Kenya\u2019s foreign ministry said Wednesday it is ready to support peace efforts in Sudan, a day after Khartoum accused Kenya of violating its sovereignty by hosting a meeting of Sudan\u2019s paramilitary Rapid Support Force, RSF, in the capital, Nairobi.",
      "In a statement, Sudan called Kenya's move to host Tuesday's meeting \u201ctantamount to an act of hostility,\u201d particularly as it preceded a planned announcement of a parallel government by the RSF.",
      "RSF Deputy Commander Abdel-Rahim Hamdan Dagalo led the Sudanese delegation at the government-owned Kenyatta International Conference Center in Nairobi, stating a significant announcement would be made on Friday.",
      "Kenya\u2019s foreign ministry said the country hosts many Sudanese refugees and has a history of facilitating dialogue \u201cwithout any ulterior motives.\u201d",

      "While Hemedti was not present at Tuesday's event, he enjoys a close friendship with Kenya\u2019s President William Ruto and his brother has met the president on several occasions.",
      "The ongoing conflict in Sudan between the military and the RSF has killed more than 24,000 people and driven over 14 million people \u2014 about 30% of the population \u2014 from their homes, according to the United Nations. An estimated 3.2 million Sudanese have escaped to neighboring countries.",

      "The United States government is formally designating eight Latin American organized crime groups that also operate in the U_S_ to be \u201cforeign terrorist organizations.\u201d",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The United States government is formally designating eight Latin American organized crime groups that also operate in the U.S. to be \u201cforeign terrorist organizations.\u201d They are involved in drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and extend their territory through violence.",
      "The Trump administration is applying a \u201cterrorist\u201d designation that\u2019s normally reserved for groups like the Islamic State group or al-Qaida that use violence for political ends \u2014 not for money-focused crime rings such as the Latin American cartels. The aim is to increase pressure on the groups and anyone who the U.S. sees as aiding them. The designation will be published in Thursday\u2019s edition of the Federal Register, according to a notice Wednesday.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the eight Latin American drug cartels labeled as foreign terrorist organizations:",
      "The Sinaloa Cartel, through various incarnations, is Mexico\u2019s oldest criminal group \u2013 dating to the 1970s. It is a criminal conglomerate, an umbrella of sorts for various groups, based in the mountains of the state by the same name in northwest Mexico. It holds firm control of the western portion of the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Sinaloa moves all sorts of drugs across continents using boats, planes, migrants and cross-border tunnels. It\u2019s considered the most corrupting criminal organization in Mexico. A former security chief was convicted of helping them.",
      "One of their most lucrative businesses in recent years has been the production of the synthetic opioid fentanyl, blamed for tens of thousands of overdose deaths each year in the U.S. Sinaloa imports the precursor chemicals from China, produces the drug and smuggles it across the border.",
      "The arrest of Sinaloa\u2019s eldest leader, Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada in July set off months of internal jockeying for power between Zambada loyalists and sons of the cartel\u2019s best known former leader Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, already serving a life sentence in the U.S.",
      "The gruesome discovery of some thirty dismembered bodies dumped in the hotel zone of Veracruz in 2011 announced the arrival of the \u201cZeta Killers,\u201d who soon established themselves as the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, a hyper-violent and fast-growing group that spread through sort of franchise agreements with local gangs.",
      "Jalisco, named for a west-central Mexican state where it\u2019s based, has aggressively attacked Mexican authorities, including military helicopters, using explosive-dropping drones and improvised explosive devices. It even attempted a spectacular assassination of the then-Mexico City police chief \u2014 now Mexico\u2019s security director \u2014 in the heart of the capital.",
      "Led by Nemesio \u201cEl Mencho\u201d Oseguera, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says Jalisco distributes tons of cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl in all 50 states.",
      "Both the Gulf Cartel and Northeast Cartel operate along the eastern end of the U.S.-Mexico border, moving drugs, immigrants, guns and money in what is the most direct route to the U.S. from Central and South America.",
      "The Gulf Cartel has a long history in Mexico, but has fractured in recent years spurring frequent clashes between factions.",
      "Its former leader, Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n (now imprisoned in Mexico after serving a sentence in the U.S.), recruited members of Mexico's military in the late 1990s to form a fearsome element known as the Zetas that eventually split and became their own drug trafficking organization.",
      "The Northeast Cartel is a remnant of the Zetas.",
      "The Northeast cartel has retained a relatively small portion of what the Zetas once ruled through relentless violence. Their base is Nuevo Laredo, the busiest commercial port on the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "These local organized crime groups, operating in west-central Mexico, produce synthetic drugs, but they are a concern to the U.S. because of something else: avocados.",
      "Security analyst David Saucedo points out that the state of Michoacan exports $2.8 billion of avocados, a trade threatened by local criminal groups. U.S. inspectors working in Michoacan checking for pests have been threatened on multiple occasions by these groups, which control production and, to an extent, the price of avocados through extortion and threats to growers.",
      "This organized crime group emerged from a prison in central Venezuela more than a decade ago. In recent years, it has spread from Chile to the United States, capitalizing on the exodus of some 8 million Venezuelans escaping their country\u2019s political and economic crises.",
      "While its origins are in drug trafficking, its main businesses are migrant smuggling, human trafficking, sexual exploitation and forced labor. It\u2019s known for extreme violence \u2014 decapitations and burying victims alive \u2014 that has generated panic in countries across the hemisphere.",
      "U.S. authorities say Tren de Aragua insinuated itself into criminal networks in South America, launders its proceeds through crypto currencies and now poses a threat in various U.S. cities. Trump and his allies have seized on the gang\u2019s presence and made it the face of the alleged threat posed by undocumented immigrants.",
      "Also known as MS-13, this violent street gang was one that Trump seized on during his first presidency as the threat posed by immigration, much like he\u2019s using Tren de Aragua now. What he failed to mention was that it originated in Los Angeles in the 1980s in communities made up largely of refugees from El Salvador\u2019s civil war and other immigrants, but grew to include many U.S. citizens in its ranks.",
      "In the U.S. the gang is known for brutal violence and street-level drug drug sales.",
      "Deported Salvadorans spread the gang to El Salvador where it quickly grew, corrupting and overwhelming local authorities. The gang and its rivals controlled swaths of territory, forcibly recruiting and extorting residents.",
      "The gang has been severely weakened in El Salvador since President Nayib Bukele launched an all-out assault on it and other street gangs nearly three years ago. His administration has arrested more than 80,000 people during that time for alleged gang ties, though civil rights groups say there has been little due process.",

      "Hong Kong\u2019s largest pro-democracy party took an initial step toward dissolving on Thursday",
      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong\u2019s largest pro-democracy party took an initial step toward dissolving Thursday, in the latest sign of the Chinese territory's narrowing space for civil society groups following Beijng's crackdown on dissent.",
      "The Democratic Party's central committee decided to set up a task force to look into the procedures involved in dissolving the party. A final decision would require approval of the party's members.",
      "Party Chairperson Lo Kin-hei said at a news conference late Thursday that party leaders made the decision based the current political situation and social climate, and said the party did not have any acute financial burdens.",
      "\u201cWhen we have to move toward this direction, we, of course, feel it is a pity. I believe every member cherishes the existence of the Democratic Party in Hong Kong,\u201d he said.",
      "Founded in 1994, the Democratic Party is one of the few pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong, where political activism has faced a stern crackdown from China's central government in Beijing following anti-government protests by Hong Kongers in 2019.",
      "Its prominent party members include Martin Lee, nicknamed the city\u2019s \u201cFather of Democracy,\u201d Albert Ho, former leader of a now-defunct group that organized Tiananmen vigils, and journalist-turned-activist Emily Lau.",
      "Over the years, the party has long been seen as a moderate opposition party that once maintained friendly relationships even with Beijing officials. Some of its former members had become top government officials, while radical members had criticized the party for being too mild.",
      "But following the massive protests that rocked the Chinese territory in 2019, the city's political environment changed drastically. Months of social unrest triggered Beijing to impose a national security law \u2014 which authorities insist is necessary for the city\u2019s stability.",
      "Since the law took effect in 2020, dozens of civil society groups have shut down, including the city\u2019s once second-largest pro-democracy party and a decades-old group that organized the annual vigil to commemorate Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen crackdown in 1989. Many leading activists were prosecuted under the law, including members of the Democratic Party. Others were forced into self-exile or silenced.",
      "Last year, some of the party\u2019s former lawmakers were convicted and sentenced over their roles in an unofficial primary election in the city\u2019s largest national security case. That verdict drew criticism from foreign governments though Beijing defended it.",
      "In recent years, the party has had limited influence over the city\u2019s politics after the authorities overhauled the electoral rules in changes they said ensured that \u201cpatriots\u201d administered Hong Kong, and that effectively barred pro-democracy candidates from running for seats in district councils.",
      "Despite the changing climate, the party pressed on with its work. It continued holding news briefings on livelihood issues and even submitted opinions on proposed national security legislation to the government before the law was enacted last March.",
      "In Thursday\u2019s news conference, Lo said disbandment would require support from 75% of the attending members of a general assembly. The party now has 400 members, but typically not all members attend general meetings. In the past, the party has had both successful and failed attempts to secure enough votes to change its constitution, he said.",
      "When the former British colony was returned to China's rule in 1997, the governing principle of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d was supposed to guarantee Western-style civil liberties and autonomy not enjoyed by mainland Chinese territories.",
      "But Lo said his party's interpretation of this governing principle may differ from that of the Beijing government. He said he hoped these different views could remain in society, saying that societies improve only with diverse voices.",
      "\u201cThe path to democracy is always difficult,\u201d Lo said. \u201cI have confidence in Hong Kongers and Hong Kongers can always find ways to handle different matters.\u201d"

    "summary": "U.N. special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen has said that formation of a &ldquo;new inclusive government&rdquo; in Damascus by March 1 could pave the way for lifting sanctions imposed by western countries",
    "story": [
      "U.N. special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen has said that formation of a \u201cnew inclusive government\u201d in Damascus by March 1 could pave the way for lifting sanctions imposed by western countries",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- Creating an inclusive government in Syria in coming weeks will help determine whether Western sanctions are lifted as the country rebuilds after the ouster of former President Bashar Assad, the U.N. special envoy to Syria said Thursday.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping is that with a truly new inclusive government in place on the 1st of March, this will help us in lifting sanctions\u201d imposed on Syria by Western countries during Assad's rule, Geir Pedersen told The Associated Press in an interview during a visit to Damascus.",
      "After Assad was toppled in a lightning rebel offensive in December, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the main former rebel group now in control of Syria, set up an interim administration comprising mainly members of its \u201csalvation government\u201d that had ruled in northwestern Syria.",
      "The country\u2019s de facto authorities said at the time that a new government would be formed through an inclusive process by March. In January, former HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa was named Syria\u2019s interim president after a meeting of most of the country\u2019s former rebel factions.",
      "In recent weeks, a committee has been holding meetings in different parts of Syria in preparation for a national dialogue conference to chart the country's political future, the date of which has not yet been announced.",
      "Pedersen said that in his first meeting with al-Sharaa in December, al-Sharaa had insisted that the interim government would rule for only three months, although Pedersen warned him the timeline was tight.",
      "\u201cI think the important thing is not whether it is three months or not, but it is whether they will deliver on what they have said all along, that this is going to be an inclusive process where all Syrians will be included,\u201d Pedersen said.",
      "The U.S. and European countries have not lifted sanctions that were imposed on the Syrian government under Assad\u2019s rule, which the new authorities have said is handicapping their ability to rebuild the country after nearly 14 years of civil war and restore essential services like state electricity. Officials from some Western countries have said they want to see if the interim rulers will follow through on their promises of inclusive governance and protecting minorities.",
      "Organizers of the national dialogue have said the conference will include all segments of Syrian society except for Assad loyalists and the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led force in the northeast that has so far refused to dissolve and be absorbed into the new national army. The SDF is currently in negotiations with the central government, and Pedersen said he hopes to see a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d to the impasse.",
      "Pedersen said he is also concerned about a security vacuum following the disbanding of the former national army and security services by the country\u2019s new rulers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very important that the new structures of the state are coming in place quickly and that there is an offer to those who are no longer in service of the army or the security services, that there are other job opportunities and that people do not feel that they are excluded from the future of Syria,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.N. envoy said he also remains concerned about Israel\u2019s incursions into Syrian territory since the fall of Assad. The Israeli army has seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in the Golan Heights established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement with Syria and has also made forays beyond the buffer zone. The U.N. has said that Israel is violating the agreement.",
      "Israeli officials have said they took the action to protect Israel\u2019s security and that their presence would be temporary.",
      "Pedersen said the security concerns are being addressed and \u201cthere is really, in my opinion, no argument for why the Israelis should be staying.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe solution is very simple. The Israelis need to withdraw,\u201d he said."

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The Netherlands agreed on Wednesday to return a collection of 119 artifacts to Nigeria, the latest objects to be sent back to their homelands as museums grapple with their colonial-era holdings.",
      "The artifacts, known as the Benin Bronzes and mostly housed in a museum in Leiden, were looted in the late 19th century by British soldiers from what is now Nigeria. They will be returned at the request of the Nigeria\u2019s National Commission for Museums and Monuments.",
      "The artifacts include human and animal figures, plaques, royal regalia and a bell.",

      "The Benin Bronzes were stolen in 1897 when British forces sacked the Benin kingdom, which is now in modern-day Nigeria.",
      "The decision to return the items in the Dutch collection followed an assessment of a committee tasked with looking into requests by countries for restitution of artifacts in state museums. It marked the fifth time Dutch cultural institutions have returned objects based on the committee's recommendation.",

      "The committee is currently considering requests from Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia for the return of objects. In 2023, two Dutch museums returned hundreds of cultural artifacts back to Indonesia and Sri Lanka taken, often by force, during the colonial era."

Days later, he appeared in a cage before a military tribunal in Kampala, charged with offenses concerning a threat to national security.

The charges have not been substantiated, but the president\u2019s son, army commander Muhoozi Kainerugaba, has alleged that Besigye plotted to assassinate Museveni.",

      "Besigye\u2019s case is being watched closely by Ugandans anxious over political maneuvers ahead of presidential elections next year. Although Museveni is expected to seek re-election, some observers believe he may step aside in favor of Kainerugaba in a bloodless coup.",
      "Many expect an unpredictable political transition because Museveni has no obvious successor within the ranks of the ruling National Resistance Movement party.",
      "Besigye, a qualified physician who retired from Uganda\u2019s military at the rank of colonel, is a former president of the Forum for Democratic Change party, for many years Uganda\u2019s most prominent opposition group.

      "Pope Francis slept well, got out of bed and ate breakfast Wednesday, the Vatican said, after tests confirmed the 88-year-old pontiff had developed pneumonia in both lungs in a further complication that raised concerns about his ability to fight off the infection.",
      "In an early update Wednesday, the Vatican said Francis spent his fifth night in Rome's Gemelli hospital peacefully. \u201cHe had a tranquil night, woke up and had breakfast,\u201d spokesman Matteo Bruni said.",
      "The pope, who had the upper lobe of his right lung removed as a young man, was in good spirits and grateful for the prayers for his recovery, Bruni said.",
      "On Wednesday, Francis' vicar for Rome urged all the faithful to devote an hour of silent prayer for the pope before evening vespers services, and pilgrims who had planned to attend his weekly general audience came to St. Peter's Square anyway to offer a prayer after it was cancelled.",
      "\u201cI think many people are disappointed but I think more importantly we really have to pray for his health,\" said Sister Charlene, a nun from Singapore who was in the piazza.",
      "Francis was admitted to the Gemelli hospital Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, medical personnel determined that he was suffering from a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, meaning a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms had colonized in his respiratory tract. Late Tuesday, the Vatican said a chest CT scan showed the onset of bilateral pneumonia on top of asthmatic bronchitis, which is being treated with cortisone and antibiotics.",
      "Bronchitis can lead to pneumonia, which is a deeper and far more serious infection of the lungs\u2019 air sacs. Pneumonia can develop in part or all of one lung or in both lungs. It tends to be more serious when both lungs are affected because there isn\u2019t healthy tissue to compensate.",
      "Treatment varies by severity but can include providing oxygen through a nasal tube or mask, intravenous fluids \u2014 and treatment of the underlying cause of the infection. To date, Francis is breathing on his own and his heart function is said to be good. He has eaten breakfast every day, gotten out of bed, read the newspapers and done some work from his hospital room.",
      "\u201cPope Francis is a strong man who does not let difficulties get him down,\u201d said the Rev. Enzo Fortunato, who heads a new Vatican committee on children. The fact that Francis is keeping up with his ordinary routine, including receiving the Eucharist, \u201cis a sign of a man who wants to experience the ordinariness of illness in the hospital.\u201d",
      "The Vatican hasn't provided any information about how Francis is responding to any of the drugs he has been given other than to say he isn't running a fever. The Argentine pope, who has previously admitted to being a non-compliant patient, has a number of conditions that make him particularly at risk for complications: Aside from his age, he is not physically active and uses a wheelchair, limiting his ability to clear the fluids building up in his lungs.",
      "Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University, said doctors will be looking to see if Francis responds to the therapy, which can include physiotherapy to help clear the lungs. Severe cases of pneumonia are typically treated for about one to two weeks, but recovery in an older person could extend beyond that.",
      "\"Lack of worsening would be an encouraging sign,\u201d said McCormack, who is not involved in Francis' care.",
      "The Vatican has given no indication of how long the pope might remain hospitalized, only saying that the treatment of such a \u201ccomplex clinical picture\u201d would require an \u201cadequate\u201d stay.",
      "Despite the less than positive news about Francis' condition, Francis was receiving get-well drawings and cards from children being treated in the hospital's oncology ward. And at the Vatican on Wednesday, Holy Year pilgrimages continued, with groups of faithful walking through the Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica on a chilly and cloudy day.",
      "\u201cWe are very happy to be here but we are also sad for the pope\u2019s sickness,\" said Amparo Alcala\u2019, who was leading a large group of pilgrims from Valencia, Spain. \"He is doing great things, most of all for the women in the church, and this gives us a lot of joy. We are praying for his recovery and that he might come back, if this is God\u2019s will.\u201d",
      "A group of South Korean pilgrims in traditional costumes had planned to attend Francis' weekly Wednesday general audience and show off their national dress, as pilgrims often do for the pope's weekly appointment. When it was cancelled, they came anyway.",
      "\u201cThe Lunar New Year was very recent so we also wanted to bow traditionally and formally in front of him,\" said Junhee Christina Kim, a pilgrim from Seoul, South Korea. \"It was too good of a chance to pass up so we came anyway so that we can be in the Vatican in our traditional costumes.\u201d",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared in court Thursday for a hearing where his lawyers contested his arrest on a criminal charge alleging he was orchestrating a rebellion when he briefly imposed martial law in December.",
      "Security was heightened as the motorcade transporting Yoon arrived at the Seoul Central District Court and dozens of his supporters rallied nearby.",
      "The preliminary hearing will involve discussions of witnesses and other preparations for his criminal trial, and the court was also to review the request by Yoon\u2019s lawyers to cancel his arrest and release him from custody. Such challenges are rarely successful.",
      "Yoon was indicted Jan. 26 on the rebellion charge carrying a potential punishment of death or life in prison. In South Korea, presidents have immunity from most criminal prosecutions, but not on charges of rebellion or treason.",
      "The indictment alleges his imposition of martial law was an illegal attempt to shut down the National Assembly and arrest politicians and election authorities. The conservative Yoon has said his martial law declaration was intended as a temporary warning to the liberal opposition and that he had always planned to respect lawmakers\u2019 will if they voted to lift the measure.",

      "Martial law was lifted about six hours after Yoon declared it but has caused political turmoil, disrupted high-level diplomacy and tested the resiliency of the country\u2019s democracy.

      "The layoffs affect probationary employees with roughly one year or less of service at the agency and largely include workers in compliance departments, according to the person, who was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday. Compliance work includes ensuring that taxpayers are abiding by the tax code, filing their returns and paying their taxes, among other duties.",
      "The layoffs are part of the Trump administration's intensified efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who have not yet gained civil service protection. They come despite IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season being told earlier this month that they would not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until mid-May, after the taxpayer filing deadline.",
      "It's unclear how the layoffs may affect tax collection services this year. As the nation's revenue collector, the IRS was tasked during the Biden administration with targeting high-wealth tax evaders for an additional stream of income to the U.S., which is $36 trillion in debt. By the end of 2024, the IRS collected over $1.3 billion in back taxes from rich tax dodgers.",

      "CABO DE LA VELA, Colombia -- Giant wind turbines tower over a cemetery sacred to Zoyla Velasquez and her Indigenous Wayuu community, native to the La Guajira region in northern Colombia.",
      "This arid, wind-swept region, dotted with cacti and roaming herds of goats, holds immense potential to position Colombia as a wind and solar energy leader. However, resistance from the Wayuu community has stalled many proposed projects by multinational companies and the government. The Wayuu have concerns about the environmental and cultural impacts and the lack of prior consultation in what's one of the nation\u2019s poorest regions. Now, these companies are also eyeing the region\u2019s offshore wind farm prospects.",
      "\u201cThis cemetery is sacred to us, the Wayuu,\u201d 64-year-old Velasquez said in Spanish, though she is more comfortable speaking in her native Wayuunaiki. Wayuu leaders say what is threatened isn\u2019t the cemetery itself but the spirituality of the territory. \u201cIt is here that the bones of our ancestors rest. That's what matters most to us.\u201d",
      "The region could generate approximately 15 gigawatts of wind energy, according to Colombia\u2019s Mining and Energy Planning Unit, which could power up to an estimated 37.5 million homes annually. It's part of Colombia\u2019s just energy transition, aiming to replace fossil fuels with renewables while supporting vulnerable groups like Indigenous peoples. The Wayuu say this isn\u2019t happening.",
      "Construction started on the La Guajira 1 wind farm \u2014 which looms over the cemetery near Cabo de la Vela \u2014 in 2020 after a mix of legal processes, government backing, and controversial negotiations and unsatisfactory prior consultation. It faced significant opposition from the Wayuu and has been producing electricity since 2022, but is not yet hooked up to the interconnected system.",
      "\u201cWayuu spirituality is the fundamental base of our life and existence,\u201d said An\u00edbal Mercado, a \u201cPalabrero,\u201d head of the regional Wayuu council.

The 2016 Peace Agreement also touched on Indigenous communities\u2019 rights, land restitution, and participation in political processes.",
      "Social issues have begun to spook companies, with 57 planned projects stalled, according to Indepaz, a Bogot\u00e1-based development organization with extensive research on the matter. While some projects are Colombian, the majority involve international companies from Brazil, Europe, U.S. and Canada.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear they\u2019re worried. There\u2019s been a slowdown in the progress of these energy transition projects precisely because of that conflict,\u201d Lanao said. \u201cI believe that the national government plays an important role in achieving a community-company agreement.\u201d",

      "The region is home to Cerrejon, one of the largest open-pit coal mines in the world and a major player in Latin America\u2019s mining sector, which has been in operation since 1985. The mine has just nine years left in its lifespan, and its closure, without alternative plans in place, will deal a significant blow to the region\u2019s economy.",

      "But the issue is also causing internal friction within the Wayuu community which stems from differing views on economic benefits, with some supporting development for financial gain.",
      "The AP spoke to several Wayuu families living near wind turbines who do not oppose the companies operating there, as they have received financial assistance and housing.",
      "Others are not convinced.",
      "\u201cAn old saying goes that if you\u2019ve never owned a chicken, manure looks like an egg to you,\u201d Mercado, the Palabrero, said when asked about those in the community who accept help from the companies, which is much less than what he'd consider fair compensation.",
      "\u201cThere are many communities that have never had anything. In the midst of so much need, so much crisis, so much hunger, any little penny that they are being offered now seems like a miracle cure and the greatest wealth in the world to them,\u201d he said.",

      "Lanao, of the environmental authority, says just because the project is in the sea, it does not mean the communities do not have influence.",
      "The Apalanchii use traditional fishing techniques, with nets, hooks and sometimes spearfishing. It is not only a means of sustenance but also a culturally important activity which they say ties them to their ancestors and the land.",
      "\u201cWe are really worried about the offshore wind farms,\u201d said fisherman Aaron Laguna Ipuana, 57, during an early morning fishing trip in Cabo de la Vela with his crew. \u201cThey're going to displace us and the sea is everything to us. It sustains us.\"",
      "Mercado says the government needs to do more to ensure Wayuu people are involved.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that these projects continue and that the government is letting them go ahead, without even coming to say what is going to happen and what is in the interest of the Wayuu people,\" said Mercado.",
      "\u201cThe Wayuu defend their territory with blood and death, if necessary,\u201d he said.",
      "At the cemetery, Velasquez, dressed in a traditional Wayuu robe and headscarf, gently strokes and observes the graves alongside her sister and young niece. In the background, the turbine blades continue to turn.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The heads of four major labor unions on Wednesday called on President Donald Trump to boost American shipbuilding and enforce tariffs and other \u201cstrong penalties\u201d against China for its increasing dominance in that sphere.",
      "The presidents of the United Steelworkers, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers argue that China's efforts have hurt American workers and national security.",
      "In the letter obtained by The Associated Press, they urged Trump to \u201cimpose tough penalties against vessels built according to the plans, policies, and actions of the Chinese Communist Party and to adopt complementary policies that rebuild America's shipbuilding capacity and workforce.\u201d",
      "Last year under President Joe Biden, the unions filed a petition seeking to address China\u2019s shipbuilding under Section 301 of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act, hoping to start a process by which tariffs and other measures could be enacted.",
      "The letter notes China manufactured more than 1,000 ocean-going vessels in 2023, while the United States made fewer than 10 ships. It adds that the Chinese shipbuilding industry received more than $100 billion in government support from 2010 to 2018, such that Chinese shipyards accounted for the majority of worldwide orders last year.",
      "\u201cAs a shipyard worker myself, out of Bath Iron Works in Maine, I have seen firsthand the crippling impacts of China\u2019s predatory actions on our domestic shipbuilding industry,\u201d Brian Bryant, the machinists and aerospace workers union president, said in a separate statement. \u201cFor decades, we\u2019ve seen everything from layoffs to shipyard closures to atrophy of our domestic shipbuilding industrial base.",
      "Trump has made control of the Panama Canal and resetting the global terms of trade with tariffs a key priority. But many of his concerns have been directed at U.S. allies such as Canada, Mexico and the European Union, while he has imposed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China due to its role in making the opioid fentanyl.",
      "In January, Trump floated the possibility of more shipbuilding in an interview with Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio talk show host.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t build ships anymore,\" Trump said. \"We want to get that started. And maybe we\u2019ll use allies, also, in terms of building ships. We might have to.\u201d",
      "In a Fox News Channel interview that aired Tuesday night, Trump noted the decline in American shipbuilding and indicated he wanted that to change.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t build the way we used to build. Yeah, we used to build like a ship a day, and now to build a ship is like a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to get this country back on track.\u201d",

      "South Africa\u2019s budget announcement by the finance minister has been abruptly canceled and rescheduled for next month over a dispute among parties in the governing coalition",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The South African government's annual presentation of its budget was abruptly canceled Wednesday and rescheduled for next month over a dispute among parties in the governing coalition.",
      "The finance minister's budget speech normally takes place in February. Parliament Speaker Thoko Didiza said it was the first time that the presentation had been canceled over such a disagreement in the 31 years of South Africa\u2019s democracy after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.",
      "South Africa has a 10-party coalition in government after the long-ruling African National Congress, or ANC, lost its majority in an election last year for the first time since apartheid ended. That means it cannot pass the budget without support from other parties in Parliament.",
      "The Democratic Alliance, the country\u2019s second biggest party, said the budget postponement was over a 2% increase in value-added tax proposed by the ANC. The DA said in a statement that the tax increase \u201cwould have broken the back of our economy.\u201d",
      "The budget delay came just over a week after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered U.S. aid and assistance to South Africa to be cut over a contentious land law. The move by Trump was expected to put pressure on South Africa\u2019s government to find funds to plug gaps, especially in the public health service. South Africa was already impacted by Trump\u2019s 90-day global freeze on U.S. aid.",
      "Africa\u2019s most advanced economy has barely grown in recent years. Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana told reporters that the government was facing fiscal challenges.",
      "\u201cDo we borrow more, and what are the implications of that?\u201d Godongwana said. \u201cDo we continue cutting expenditure? What are the implications of that? Do we raise tax and what are the implications of that?\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is general agreement that in the current environment, we need to find ways of funding our priorities.\u201d",
      "The opposition Umkhonto we Sizwe Party said the government\u2019s failure to propose a budget was proof that \u201cthis country has no leadership.\"",
      "Most recently the ANC and the DA disagreed over the passing of the Land Expropriation Act, which empowers the government to seize private land for public benefit.",
      "The parties have also fallen out over an education bill, which would give the government more control over white minority language schools.",
      "The Black Business Council, which advocates for Black-owned businesses' inclusion in the country's economy, has cautioned that the budget postponement might cause uncertainty among investors.",
      "\u201cWe are busy dealing with the Trump issue, and we are working on sending envoys to the world to say (South Africa) is intact, but when you have something like this that you can control, and you just basically throw your arms in the air, it doesn\u2019t bode very well for South Africa and for the government,\" said the council's CEO Kganki Matabane.",

      "Car companies are always introducing compelling new models, making it harder to decide if you should get a new car, truck or SUV now or wait to see what else might be available within the year",
      "Ready to buy a new car? Well, you might want to wait because there are some cool and compelling models coming soon to a showroom near you. They range from a retro-themed performance sedan with a traditional gasoline engine to a rugged off-road SUV powered by electricity. There\u2019s even a pickup truck that offers a gas engine and electric propulsion simultaneously, which could be a game changer. Edmunds\u2019 editors highlight what they think will be the most interesting vehicles for car shoppers coming out later this year.",
      "Maybe you\u2019ve seen the Charger Daytona R/T, Dodge\u2019s new electric performance coupe that draws design inspiration from the classic 1969 Charger. But what if you don\u2019t want an EV? And what if you need four doors? Good news is on the horizon, and it takes the form of the 2026 Charger Sixpack four-door sedan equipped with a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder gas engine.",
      "Dubbed the \u201cHurricane,\u201d the engine makes 420 horsepower in standard-output specification, more than the 5.7-liter V8 available in the old Charger. We also expect Dodge will follow it up later with a high-output engine making 550 horsepower.",
      "The Honda Prelude was a showcase of Honda design and engineering in the 1980s and 1990s. But after the 2001 model year, it disappeared from the automaker\u2019s lineup. A quarter of a century later, it\u2019s finally coming back.",
      "The all-new 2026 Honda Prelude will be a hybrid. We expect Honda will use the hybrid powertrain that it uses in the hybrid versions of the CR-V and Civic. Honda hasn\u2019t said how much power it will make or what kind of fuel economy you can expect. However, the Prelude will come with a Honda S+ Shift feature that the company says will make the it more fun to drive than your typical hybrid.",
      "With few exceptions, most electric SUVs are best driven on the pavement instead of off-road. Jeep plans to change that with the upcoming 2026 Recon, a bold and boxy EV with promising trail-rated off-roading capability and a similar open-air driving experience to a Wrangler.",
      "Jeep recently featured the Recon in a commercial starring Harrison Ford. Beyond that, however, the company has provided few details. We don\u2019t know how much range the Recon will have or how much it will cost. But we do know it will come with all-terrain tires, skid plates, a power-opening top, and removable windows and doors. And with trail guide maps embedded into the infotainment system and electronic locking axles, the Jeep Recon should be ready to rock on the path less traveled.",
      "Boasting one of the most appropriate vehicle names in history, the Ram Ramcharger is a full-size pickup truck equipped with electric motors and a battery pack. So far, that\u2019s just like a Ford F-150 Lightning. The trick is that it also has a gasoline-fueled V6 engine to eliminate the problem of range anxiety.",
      "Ram\u2019s range-extending powertrain solution sounds complex, but there is a simple explanation of how it works. When the battery is out of charge, the gas engine serves as a backup generator, allowing the Ramcharger to travel an estimated 690 miles before requiring electricity or gasoline to continue the journey. In theory, you can drive the Ramcharger without ever visiting an EV charging station, or you can skip traditional gas stations altogether.",
      "Better yet, there aren\u2019t any downsides when it comes to capability. Ram says the Ramcharger can tow up to 14,000 pounds and zoom to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds.",
      "Current Rivian trucks and SUVs are expensive, but the upcoming R2 SUV addresses that with a target price of $45,000. Smaller than the existing R1S but equipped with the same rugged, high-tech good looks, the Rivian R2 holds five people and travels more than 300 miles on a full battery. It comes with all-wheel drive and a healthy 9.8 inches of maximum ground clearance to help you out when going off-road.",
      "With rear vent windows and back glass that powers down into the tailgate, the Rivian R2 will give the Jeep Recon some competition. Just remember the R2\u2019s doors don\u2019t come off like the Recon\u2019s. As for timing, it should be available in the first half of 2026.",
      "We like these five upcoming models for their nostalgic appeal, technological innovation, or promise of fun no matter where you\u2019re going or what you\u2019re doing. At least one of them, the Jeep Recon, delivers all three of those traits.",

    "summary": "Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits with its competitive prices an increasingly strong magnet for inflation-weary shoppers, but this year appears to come with new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape",
    "story": [
      "Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits with its competitive prices an increasingly strong magnet for inflation-weary shoppers, but this year appears to come with new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape",
      "NEW YORK -- Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits with its competitive prices an increasingly strong magnet for inflation-weary shoppers, but 2025 appears to come with new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "The outlook from the nation's largest retailer for 2025 is as much as 27 cents below analyst projections for per-share earnings and for the quarter, Walmart's expectations are as much as 7 cents below Wall Street projections.",
      "Its sales outlook is also disappointing, potentially a reflection of rising challenges ahead as consumers pull back on spending and President Donald Trump's tariffs on China and other countries threaten the low-price model that is the core of Walmart's success.",
      "Walmart has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Groceries account for roughly 60%, of its U.S. business, according to the company\u2019s most recent annual report, meaning a huge chunk of sales are not reliant on goods made in China or elsewhere.",
      "Still, shares tumbled nearly 9% before the opening bell Thursday and it pulled other big retailers down with it. The retail sector is the biggest decliner in premarket trading and Target slid 2%.",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly financial results and numbers could provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper, particularly amid new trade barriers that according to most economists threaten to reignite inflation. Consumers over the past year have increasingly focused more on necessities rather than TVs, furniture or appliances. They've become much more discerning about big-ticket purchases because of higher costs for credit as well as for groceries.",
      "Walmart has flourished in that environment, using its clout to keep prices down. It's gained market share, notably among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart\u2019s online offerings and paid membership, Walmart +, have also drawn wealthier customers",
      "\u201cWe have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an eCommerce business driven by faster delivery times,\u201d said CEO Doug McMillon. \u201cWe\u2019re gaining market share, our top line is healthy, and we\u2019re in great shape with inventory.\u201d",
      "Still, Walmart could be faced with challenges with the new tariffs carrying more economic risks than during Trump's first term. If Americans are hit by a new wave of price increases, economists say, and with 70% of the U.S. economy driven by consumers a broad pullback in spending would have ramifications beyond Walmart\u2019s sales.",
      "Government data last week revealed a sharp drop in January retail sales as cold weather kept more Americans indoors. But it was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest in a year. Sales were revised higher for December, possibly indicating a pullback by consumers after a holiday season splurge.",
      "Yet grocery prices, a sore point for American households, continued to rise.",
      "Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, reported earnings of $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31. That compares with $5.49 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share for the most recent quarter was 66 cents.",
      "Sales rose 4.1% to $180.55 billion in the quarter.",
      "Analysts expected 65 cents per share on sales of $180.07 billion in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet.",
      "For Walmart\u2019s U.S. division, comparable store sales \u2014 which include online and stores open for the past 12 months \u2014 rose 4.6% in the U.S., a bit lower than the 5.3% in the previous quarter. The retailer had a 4.2% jump in the U.S. in the second quarter and 3.8% in the first quarter.",
      "Global e-commerce sales rose 16% in the latest quarter, notably slower than the 27% increase in the third quarter.",
      "Walmart expects first quarter earnings per share of between 57 cents and 58 cents, well below the 64 cents Wall Street was expecting, and for the year. Walmart expects earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. That\u2019s also off the $2.77 that analysts are predicting, according to FactSet.",
      "It forecast a 3% to 4% increase in quarterly sales or between $166.35 billion and $167.97 billion. That could be a letdown for industry analysts, who had expected sales of $167.05 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Walmart expects sales to be up anywhere between 3% to 4% for the current year, or between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That too falls short of the $708.72 billion that analysts predicted, according to FactSet.",

      "Rising home prices and elevated mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, have kept many prospective home shoppers on the sidelines, especially first-time buyers who don\u2019t have equity from an existing home to put toward a new home purchase.",

      "LONDON -- Inflation in the U.K. rose to a 10-month high in January, official figures showed Wednesday, an increase that will likely diminish expectations of rapid interest rate reductions from the Bank of England.",
      "The Office for National Statistics said inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, rose to 3% in the year to January, up from the equivalent 2.5% rate the month before.",
      "The spike, which took inflation further above the bank's target of 2%, was largely due to increases in airfares, food casts and private school fees in the wake of the new Labour government's decision to impose a sales tax.",
      "Economists had anticipated an increase to 2.8% but the scale of the spike has come as a big surprise and will likely cause concern among rate-setters at the central bank at a time when they are voicing worries about about the U.K.'s tepid economic growth.",
      "Earlier this month, the bank cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.50%, its third reduction in six months, as it halved its 2025 growth forecast for the U.K. to 0.75%.",
      "If growth remains that modest, it will be hugely disappointing news for the U.K.\u2019s new Labour government, which has made growth its number one mission as it will boost living standards and generate funds for cash-starved public services.

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 07:46:48 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump says his administration will ensure a major natural gas pipeline in Alaska gets built",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says his administration will ensure a major natural gas pipeline in Alaska gets built",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Since his election, President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed support for a major natural gas pipeline in Alaska \u2014 comments that have drawn fresh attention to a project that's floundered for years despite support from state leaders.",
      "Trump mentioned the pipeline at a news conference with Japan\u2019s prime minister earlier this month, drawing praise from Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy and U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, both Republicans. As proposed, the nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline would funnel gas from Alaska\u2019s vast North Slope to port, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries.",
      "Critics, however, see this as a repackaged version of a decades-old effort that has struggled to gain traction. Hurdles include the cost \u2014 an estimated $44 billion for the pipeline and related infrastructure \u2014 competition from other projects and questions about its economic feasibility. One state senator said Alaska has put around $1 billion over the years into trying to get a pipeline built.",
      "It\u2019s natural gas that\u2019s been cooled to a liquid form for shipping and storage. Natural gas, a fossil fuel, is extracted from underground.",
      "The Alaska project calls for a pipeline from the gas fields of the North Slope to south-central Alaska. A liquefaction facility in Nikiski, southwest of Anchorage, would process and export the liquefied natural gas.",
      "Trump, following his election, said his administration would ensure the project gets built \u201cto provide affordable energy to Alaska and allies all over the world.\u201d He highlighted it as a priority in an Alaska-specific executive order aimed at spurring resource development he signed on his first day in office. And during a recent news conference with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan, Trump touted the Alaska project's relative proximity to that country and said there were talks \u201cabout a joint venture of some type.\u201d He did not elaborate.",
      "Japan's Foreign Ministry, in a statement, said the meeting between the leaders \u201cwas carried out in a way that would be beneficial to both sides and confirmed that the two nations will cooperate bilaterally toward strengthening energy security, including increasing LNG exports to Japan.\u201d It did not specifically reference the Alaska project.",
      "Trump was a booster of the project during his first term. In 2017, he was there for the signing in Beijing of an agreement between then-Alaska Gov. Bill Walker and representatives of Chinese companies that called for the parties to work together on elements of the project. That effort ultimately fizzled: Walker, an independent, left office in 2018, and his successor, Dunleavy, took the project in a different direction. The project has a history of new governors taking a different tack than their predecessors; Walker did it, too.",
      "Walker called Trump\u2019s recent actions significant: \u201cWhat he has done is a tremendous boost to the awareness of the project worldwide.\u201d",
      "Currently, there is no way to bring Alaska's large gas reserves to market. The focus for decades by major companies on the North Slope has been on producing more profitable oil. The 800-mile (1,280-kilometer) trans-Alaska oil pipeline \u2014 which began operating in 1977 \u2014 is the state's economic lifeline. Gas that occurs with deposits of oil is reinjected into the fields.",
      "Changing markets and costs have been major obstacles, too.",
      "State leaders are facing the likelihood that Alaska could have to import gas to help meet the needs of its most populous region due to production constraints in the aging Cook Inlet basin in south-central Alaska, hundreds of miles (kilometers) from the North Slope. Cook Inlet is Alaska's oldest producing oil and gas basin, dating to the 1950s.",
      "Even a year ago, the idea of importing gas was widely seen by lawmakers as a humiliating possibility. But it's now being met with resignation and hopes by some that it might simply be a short-term solution until a gas line is built.",
      "Alaska House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, a Republican, said Alaskans \u201cneed to be hopeful\" and cautioned against negative thinking.",
      "\u201cWe need to watch how we talk because it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and an energy project of this size, if it was successful, would be transformative to the economic security of our state,\u201d he said.",
      "Roger Marks, an oil and gas economist in Alaska, said he can't see the pipeline project happening and said more energy should be devoted to preparing for possible imports. \u201cCreating these false expectations has just been a big distraction from what needs to be done,\u201d he said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Tapestry Inc. says it has penned an agreement to sell the Stuart Weitzman brand to Caleres, a portfolio of footwear brands for $105 million in cash.",
      "Tapestry said Wednesday that selling the brand would enable the fashion company to focus on sustaining the growth of Coach, while reinvigorating sales at Kate Spade. Meanwhile Caleres said that buying Stuart Weitzman would help accelerate sales, with the luxury brand being the lead label in its portfolio. It also owns such labels as Famous Footwear, Sam Edelman, Allen Edmonds, Naturalizer and Vionic.",
      "\u201cI have long admired Stuart Weitzman for the brand\u2019s pivotal role in shaping the footwear industry,\" said Jay Schmidt, president and CEO of Caleres, in a statement. \"As we bring this iconic brand into the Caleres portfolio, we are committed to preserving its legacy of craftsmanship, quality and fit while driving it forward.\u201d",
      "The deal comes roughly four months after a U.S. District judge halted the merger between Tapestry and Capri Holdings Inc., whose labels include Versace, Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo brands. In her ruling, the judge said the merger would reduce competition and hurt consumers. The decision came six months after the Federal Trade Commission sued to block Tapestry's $8.5 billion acquisition of Capri, saying that the deal would eliminate direct competition between the fashion companies' brands like Coach and Michael Kors in the so-called affordable luxury handbag arena.",
      "Tapestry and Caleres said the transaction is expected to close this summer, subject to customary closing conditions"

      "Johor in Malaysia is being transformed by the construction of giant data centers",
      "JOHOR BAHRU, Malaysia -- Winson Lau has always had contingency plans. But he wasn't prepared for data centers.",
      "Lau relies on water and electricity to operate his thriving export business in Malaysia\u2019s Johor province. His contingency plans in the event of an outage involve an intricate system of purifying wastewater through friendly bacteria and an alarm system to quickly switch to backup power.",
      "But these measures can\u2019t compete with the gigantic, power-guzzling and thirsty data centers being built in Johor. The province is on track to have at least 1.6 gigawatts of data centers at any given moment from nearly nothing in 2019, making it the fastest-growing data center market in Southeast Asia, according to a report published in April.",
      "Data centers are large, windowless buildings filled with racks of computers that need lots of electricity. To prevent overheating, they rely on energy-intensive air conditioning systems using pumped water. Increasingly used by tech companies for running artificial intelligence systems, the power demand from future facilities in Malaysia may rise to over 5 gigawatts by 2035, according to researchers at Malaysia\u2019s Kenanga Investment Bank. This is more than half of Malaysia\u2019s entire renewable capacity in 2023.",
      "Over 95% of the energy available to Malaysia in 2022 was from fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. The country is now fifth-largest exporter of liquefied natural gas globally. And with planned renewable projects, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in September that the country was \u201cconfident of a surplus of energy\u201d to fuel large projects and keep exporting.",
      "But Lau doesn't fancy the chances of his homegrown business competing against the foreign-funded behemoths for energy. To survive, he is moving to Thailand and already scouting potential locations for a new fish farm.",
      "\u201cBig data center is coming and there is shortage of power,\" he said. \"It\u2019ll be crazy.\u201d",
      "Malaysia is betting that potential economic growth from data centers justifies the risk. Once touted as an Asian tiger on the cusp of becoming rich, its industries shrunk in the late 1990s after the Asian financial crisis. It has since languished in the middle-income trap. Data centers, the government hopes, will modernize its economy and indirectly create thousands of high-paying jobs.",
      "But experts worry that Malaysia, and others like Vietnam, Indonesia and India vying for billion-dollar investments from tech giants, may be overstating data centers' transformative capabilities that also come at a price: Data centers gobble up land, water and electricity while creating far fewer jobs than they promise. Most data centers provide 30 to 50 permanent jobs while the larger ones create 200 jobs at most, according to a report by the American nonprofit Good Jobs First.",
      "Add to this the rapid increase in power and water use and some experts like Sofia Scasserra, who researches digital economies at the Amsterdam-based think tank Transnational Institute, said that tech companies exploiting resources in poorer countries while extracting data from their populations to get rich is akin to \u201cdigital colonialism.\u201d She compared data extraction to silver mining in Bolivia, which enriched colonial Spain but left nothing behind for Latin America.",
      "\u201cThey are extracting data in the same way. Data doesn\u2019t even leave (behind) taxes,\u201d she said.",
      "For now, artificial intelligence is driving the hunger for even more data centers, with tech companies seeking out bigger \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 sites worldwide as a part of a \u201cglobal strategy,\u201d said Rangu Salgame, chairman and CEO of Singapore\u2019s Princeton Digital Group, which is building a 170-megawatt site in Johor. Data centers larger than 40 megawatt typically need land the size of seven football fields \u2014 about enough power for 36,000 American homes, according to data center service provider Stream Data Centers.",
      "That\u2019s costly to build in rich nations like the U.S., which over time has built more data centers than any other country but where land comes at a high price. Enter Malaysia, with its inexpensive land, excess power capacity and tax incentives. The country was the fastest growing data center market in Asia Pacific in the first half of 2024, according to global real estate firm Cushman and Wakefield. This makes Malaysia the eighth-largest data center market in terms of operations and the fifth-largest behind China, India, Japan and Australia when accounting for projects already in the pipeline.",
      "Globally Malaysia ranks 14th in terms of operational capacity \u2014 still smaller than Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin \u2014 but it is on track to be among the top 10 markets in five to seven years, according to Pritesh Swamy, who heads research on data centers in Asia for the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about a region that really grew at a pace that nowhere in the world has seen,\u201d Salgame said.",
      "Next door to Malaysia is Singapore, which paused the construction of new data centers in 2019. The moratorium was over concerns that the energy-guzzling infrastructure was straining the tiny country\u2019s limited resources. In 2019, data centers consumed 7% of the total electricity in the city-state that imports both power and water while aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. They have been trying to build data centers sustainably since 2022, when the moratorium ended.",
      "In the meantime, Malaysia has stepped in to fill the void, attracting investments of over $31 billion \u2014 three times the investments for 2023 \u2014 in the first 10 months of 2024, according to research by real estate firm Knight Frank. Johor already has 22 mostly foreign data centers spanning over 21 hectares, according to the research firm Baxtel. That's the equivalent of nearly 40 football fields, although not all of the data centers are operational.",
      "Salgame said that he hoped data centers could accelerate clean energy growth and experts like Putra Adhiguna of the Jakarta-based think tank Energy Shift Institute agreed that this could happen, but warned that the sheer volume of unforeseen, future demand complicates the transition.",
      "\u201cAdd data centers on top of that, it just becomes much more challenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Tropical Malaysia is warmer than the countries that were initially preferred by data centers, including Ireland, and would require more water and power for cooling, said Alex de Vries, the founder of Digiconomist, a research company studying the unintended consequences of digital trends. He said that these companies are moving to new countries after their promises of economic growth were found to be \u201cempty.\" And while new solar or wind farms can be built faster than other forms of energy, data centers need a lot of electricity from the get-go.",
      "\u201cThese big tech companies are trying to distract you from the really simple math,\u201d he said.",
      "Malaysia acknowledges that the energy demand from data centers is \u201csubstantial\u201d but believes that Johor\u2019s rise as a \u201cdata center powerhouse\u201d will make it a \u201ckey player in Southeast Asia\u2019s digital ecosystem,\u201d said Malaysian Investment, Trade and Industry minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz in an email. He added that Malaysia was writing efficiency guidelines for data centers and has a policy to let them buy clean energy directly from producers.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Wednesday he is considering buying used Boeing aircraft \u2014 perhaps from an overseas seller \u2014 to use as Air Force One when he's aboard, as he fumes over the U.S. plane-maker's delays in producing two specially modified ones for presidential use.",
      "Speaking to reporters aboard one of the two nearly 35-year-old Boeing 747-200 aircraft in current use, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking at alternatives, because it\u2019s taking Boeing too long.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe may go and buy a plane,\u201d Trump said, adding that he could then \u201cconvert it.\u201d He later clarified that he was ruling out purchasing aircraft of Airbus, the European company that is the only other global supplier on large wide-body aircraft, but would consider a second-hand Boeing plane. \u201cI would not consider Airbus. I could buy one from another country perhaps or get one from another country.\"",
      "Boeing has the contract to produce updated versions, based on the more modern Boeing 747-8, but delivery has been delayed while the aircraft maker has lost billions of dollars on the deal, which was negotiated by Trump during his first term in office.",
      "It's not the planes, rather the heavy modification to make them suitable for the requirements of presidential travel and the top-level security clearances required for those involved, that has added to the cost and delays. Trump already dropped a requirement for the new generation of planes, which will be known as the VC-25B, to be capable of air-to-air refueling, like the pair of existing VC-25As, which were designed during the Cold War.",
      "Other modifications include highly classified communications equipment suitable for the country's commander-in-chief, survivability enhancements for a range of contingencies, and self-contained air-stairs, allowing for their use in austere landing environments.",

      "The planned rail network will be 100% electric, span approximately 1,000 kilometers, (622 miles) and reach speeds of up to 300 kph (187 mph). There will be stations in Toronto, Peterborough, Ottawa, Montr\u00e9al, Laval, Trois-Rivi\u00e8res and Quebec City.",
      "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a news conference the government will commit CDN$3.9 billion (US$2.74 billion) over six years, starting in the 2024-25 fiscal year, to iron out specifics, including where the stations will be located in each city and the trajectory of the network, before construction can begin.",
      "Officials say it\u2019s too soon to estimate the final cost of the project or when it will be completed.",
      "\u201cA reliable, efficient high-speed rail network will be a game changer for Canadians,\u201d said Trudeau.",
      "The new rail system, which will be known as Alto, will get travelers from Montr\u00e9al to Toronto in just three hours. The announcement from Trudeau and Transport Minister Anita Anand comes after years of debate and extensive study of options to improve commuter rail service in central Canada.",
      "Passenger rail service currently relies on tracks used by freight trains, limiting service frequency and often causing delays. The high-speed train network would be Canada\u2019s largest ever infrastructure project, Trudeau said.",
      "Trudeau made the announcement even though there is uncertainly over how long the Liberal Party will continue to govern. He announced Jan. 6 he is resigning as party leader and prime minister. The Liberals will choose a new leader March 9.",
      "All three opposition parties have vowed to bring down the Liberals\u2019 minority government in a no-confidence vote after Parliament resumes March 24.",
      "Trudeau was confident the rail link would be built even if the Liberals lose the next election.",
      "\u201cHigh-speed rail in this country was always going to be a project that would take long enough to build that it would cover multiple governments,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cIt takes a will and a determination by a government to move forward and lock in this progress.\u201d",
      "Martin Imbleau, president and CEO of Alto, said Canada needs a viable, sustainable alternative to car and plane travel.",
      "\u201cA high-speed rail network is not a luxury. It is a necessity,\u201d Imbleau said. \u201cHighways are more congested than ever, airports are stretched to their limits for too many people, intercity travel is frustrating, unreliable and unsustainable.\u201d",
      "The government has selected Cadence, a consortium of companies, to co-design, build, finance, operate and maintain the rail megaproject.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 08:17:27 -0500",

      "A new poll finds Americans\u2019 confidence in air transportation and the federal agencies tasked with maintaining air safety has slipped a little from last year, following a recent crash in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Americans' confidence in air travel and the federal agencies tasked with maintaining air safety has slipped a little from last year, following a recent crash in Washington, according to a new poll, but most still believe air transportation is generally safe.",
      "The survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that 64% of U.S. adults say plane travel is \u201cvery safe\u201d or \u201csomewhat safe.\u201d That's down slightly from last year, when 71% said that. About 2 in 10 U.S. adults now say air transportation is very or somewhat unsafe, up from 12% in 2024.",
      "Faith in government agencies' ability to ensure safe air travel dipped as well. Just over half of U.S. adults have \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca moderate amount\u201d of confidence in federal government agencies to maintain air safety, down slightly from about 6 in 10 last year.",
      "The poll was conducted Feb. 6-10, shortly after the Jan. 30 collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter in Washington but before a Delta jet flipped on its roof while landing in Toronto. The Washington collision, which killed all 67 people aboard the two aircraft, was the country\u2019s deadliest aviation disaster since 2001. The decline in confidence, while small, suggests that the event may have rattled some Americans. The 2024 poll was conducted after another incident that raised questions about the safety of air travel, in which a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines jetliner above Oregon, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane.",
      "Overall, Americans think traveling by plane is about as safe as walking or taking a car. About two-thirds say either walking or driving are safe forms of transportation. Only about half of U.S. adults say a local subway, metro or light rail system is safe, in line with 2024.",
      "After the Washington crash, President Donald Trump, a Republican, blamed federal diversity and inclusion promotion efforts and reassured Americans that it is safe to fly. That may help explain why Democrats and independents, but not Republicans, have seen a drop in trust.",
      "Independents' belief that plane travel is safe fell substantially, from about 6 in 10 calling it safe last year to about 4 in 10 now. About 7 in 10 Democrats say plane travel is safe, down slightly from about three-quarters in 2024. Republicans have not changed their views about air travel being safe.",
      "Democrats and independents also have less faith in the government's ability to ensure air safety than they did four years ago. The poll was conducted before the firing of probationary Federal Aviation Administration employees, but at least some of the shift is likely related to the change in presidential administration, from Joe Biden, a Democrat, to Trump.",
      "In January 2024, when Biden was still president, about 7 in 10 Democrats said they had high confidence in federal government agencies to maintain air safety. Now only 6 in 10 Democrats say that. Independents' confidence also declined, while Republicans' opinions did not move.",
      "The poll found that U.S. adults' confidence in pilots and commercial airlines remains unchanged. About 8 in 10 U.S. adults have a high level of confidence in pilots, and about three-quarters say that about commercial airlines.",
      "___",
      "The AP-NORC poll of 1,112 adults was conducted Feb. 6-10, using a sample drawn from NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.",

      "Birkenstock sandals are ubiquitous in the summer",
      "BERLIN -- Birkenstocks: they are ubiquitous in the summer, comfy and very German, come in many colors and shapes, look sometimes chic and sometimes shabby. But can these sandals be considered art?",
      "That's what Germany's Federal Court of Justice had to decide on Thursday, and it ruled they're just comfy footwear.",
      "Birkenstock, which is headquartered in Linz am Rhein in western Germany and says its tradition of shoemaking goes back to 1774, had filed a lawsuit against three competitors who sold sandals that were very similar to its own.",
      "The shoe manufacturer claimed its sandals \u201care copyright-protected works of applied art\" that may not simply be imitated. Under German law, works of art enjoy stronger and longer-last intellectual property protections than ordinary consumer products.",
      "The company asked for an injunction to stop its competitors from making copycat sandals and order them to recall and destroy those already on the market The defendant companies were not identified in the court statement.",
      "Before Germany's highest court for civil trials weighed in this Thursday, the case had been heard at two lower courts, which disagreed on the issue.",
      "A regional court in Cologne initially recognized the shoe models as works of applied art and granted the orders, Cologne's higher regional court later overturned the orders on appeal, German news agency dpa reported.",
      "The appeals court said it was unable to establish any artistic achievement in the wide-strapped sandals with the big buckle.",
      "On Thursday, the Federal Court of Justice sided with Cologne's higher regional court and dismissed the case. In its ruling, it wrote that a product can't be copyrighted if \"technical requirements, rules or other constraints determine the design.\"",
      "So when it comes to Birkenstock's sandals, functionality and craft trumps art \u2014 at least in the eyes of the law.",
      "\u201cFor the copyright protection of a work of applied art \u2014 as for all other types of work \u2014 the level of design must not be too low,\u201d the court wrote. \u201cPurely technical creation using formal design elements is not eligible for copyright protection.

      "The Trump administration is falsely claiming that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving improper Social Security payments",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is falsely claiming that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments.",
      "Over the past few days, President Donald Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have said on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly getting benefits \u2014 a \u201cHUGE problem,\u201d Musk wrote, as his Department of Government Efficiency digs into federal agencies to root out waste, fraud and abuse.",
      "It is true that improper payments have been made, including some to dead people. But the numbers thrown out by Musk and the White House are overstated and misrepresent Social Security data.",
      "Here are the facts:",
      "On Tuesday, Trump said at a press briefing in Florida that \u201cwe have millions and millions of people over 100 years old\u201d receiving Social Security benefits. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously fraudulent or incompetent,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cIf you take all of those millions of people off Social Security, all of a sudden we have a very powerful Social Security with people that are 80 and 70 and 90, but not 200 years old,\u201d he said. He also said that there\u2019s one person in the system listed as 360 years old.",
      "Late Monday, Musk posted a slew of posts on his social media platform X, including: \u201cMaybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security,\u201d and \u201cHaving tens of millions of people marked in Social Security as \u201cALIVE\u201d when they are definitely dead is a HUGE problem. Obviously. Some of these people would have been alive before America existed as a country. Think about that for a second \u2026\u201d",
      "A July 2024 report from Social Security\u2019s inspector general states that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, including $71.8 billion \u2014 or less than 1% \u2014 in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people.",
      "In addition, in early January, the U.S. Treasury clawed back more than $31 million in a variety of federal payments\u2014 not just Social Security payments\u2014 that improperly went to dead people, a recovery that former Treasury official David Lebryk said was \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg.\u201d",
      "The money was reclaimed as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Department of Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration\u2019s \u201cFull Death Master File\u201d for three years as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in 2021. The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died, and the file contains more than 142 million records, which go back to 1899, according to the Treasury.",
      "Treasury estimated in January that it would recover more than $215 million during its three-year access period, which runs from December 2023 through 2026.",
      "No.",
      "Part of the confusion comes from Social Security's software system called COBOL, which has a lack of date type in its programming. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birthdates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago. The news organization WIRED first reported on the use of COBOL programming language at the Social Security Administration.",
      "Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration\u2019s inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these individuals were receiving benefits.",
      "The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million.",
      "A July 2023 Social Security OIG report states that \"almost none of the numberholders discussed in the report currently receive SSA payments.\u201d And, as of September 2015, the agency automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old.",
      "Chuck Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said, \u201cTwo cheers for Elon Musk if he can root out and put a stop to improper payments.\u201d",
      "But to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, \u201cSocial Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,\u201d Blahous said. \"Medicaid improper payment rates are quite substantial, and soared after the Medicaid expansion of the ACA.\"",
      "\u201cBy all means \u2014 go after any improper payments that are found, but let\u2019s not pretend that\u2019s where the system\u2019s biggest financial problems are,\u201d he said.",
      "Sita Nataraj Slavov, a professor of public policy at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, said the claims by Musk and Trump will make people think the solutions to the government's financial problems are simpler than they appear.",
      "\u201cThe real concern is that this claim may mislead people into thinking there\u2019s an easy fix to Social Security\u2019s financial problems \u2014 that we can somehow restore solvency without making sacrifices through higher taxes or lower benefits,\u201d Slavov said. \u201cThis is simply not true.\u201d",
      "Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokesperson, referred back to the Social Security's inspector general report.",
      "\u201cA previous investigation revealed the SSA paid at least $71.8 billion in improper payments,\u201d she said. \"The Social Security Administration is now working to find even more waste, fraud, and abuse in the Administration\u2019s whole-of-government effort to protect American taxpayers.\u201d",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov attended a meeting Thursday of the Group of 20 nations in South Africa, where top European diplomats are expected to reinforce their support for Ukraine and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is a high-profile absentee.",
      "Lavrov traveled to Johannesburg for the G20 foreign ministers' meeting two days after landmark bilateral talks between the United States and Russia over ending the war in Ukraine. Those talks sidelined Washington's European allies and Ukraine, who weren't involved.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump further upended the West's position by criticizing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and falsely blaming Ukraine for the full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24, 2022. The all-out war's third anniversary is next week.",

      "While South Africa, which holds the G20 presidency this year, hopes that the group's first major meeting of the year will make progress on issues affecting the developing world like debt refinancing and climate change, its opening session will involve discussions on the global geopolitical situation, according to the agenda.",
      "The United Kingdom, France, Germany and the EU have all pledged continued support for Ukraine and condemned Russia's aggression, while seeking to be a part of any ceasefire negotiations. The G20 meeting in South Africa offers European nations a chance to speak with a united voice on the Russia-Ukraine war and any peace process amid their own divisions.",
      "The G20 is supposed to bring developed and developing countries together to create a foundation for global economic stability and foster cooperation. But the grouping often struggles to reach any meaningful consensus on issues because of the disparate interests of the U.S., Europe, Russia and China.",
      "In a speech opening the meeting, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said that it was an opportunity for the G20 \u201cto engage in serious dialogue\u201d against a global backdrop of geopolitical tensions and war, climate change, pandemics and energy and food insecurity.",
      "\"There is a lack of consensus among major powers, including in the G20, on how to respond to these issues,\u201d Ramaphosa said.",
      "Rubio's decision to boycott this week's meeting and his pledge to also skip the main G20 summit in South Africa in November threatens to further undermine the G20's effectiveness.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said that he won't attend a G20 finance ministers meeting in South Africa next week because of other commitments in Washington, which many saw as a further indication of Trump's indifference to global institutions and international collaboration in favor of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy.",
      "The Trump administration punished South Africa with an executive order this month that cut all U.S. aid and assistance to the country over what it called its anti-American stance. The order criticized South Africa's decision to accuse U.S. ally Israel of genocide in Gaza in an ongoing case at the United Nations' top court as veiled support for the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The Trump administration also cited what it called South Africa's relationship with Iran and the Communist Party in China.",

      "South Africa downplayed suggestions that Rubio's absence was undermining its G20 presidency. Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola said on the eve of the meeting in Johannesburg that there was \u201cnot a complete boycott of South Africa\u2019s G20\" by the U.S.",

      "A judge has approved an emergency plan to keep Britain\u2019s largest water company afloat and averted a possible temporary government takeover",
      "LONDON -- A judge approved an emergency plan Tuesday to keep Britain\u2019s largest water company afloat, averting the possibility of a temporary government takeover.",
      "Thames Water, which serves 16 million customers in and around London, was seeking court approval for about 3 billion pounds ($3.8 billion) in rescue loans to prevent it from being nationalized when it runs out of cash next month.",
      "Justice Thomas Leech ruled in the High Court in London that the company's restructuring proposal was a better alternative for the public than having Thames Water become insolvent and come under government administration, or a competing plan by a small group of investors.",
      "\u201cThere is a public policy in favor of rescuing the Thames Water Group and giving the market a chance to agree a permanent restructuring plan before the government is forced to fund a special administrator,\" Leech said.",
      "Leech gave permission to appeal to the smaller group of creditors who had proposed a plan that they said would be cheaper and a member of Parliament pushing for a government takeover.",
      "Without the funding, Thames Water would run out of money next month, which could force the government to temporarily take the reins. Both the government and Thames Water said water would continue flowing to customers regardless of what happens.",
      "The decision was applauded by Thames Water Chairman Adrian Montague as a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d to strengthen the company's finances.",
      "Thames Water has been the focus of criticism from consumers and politicians who say the company was the author of its own misfortune, paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries and bonuses to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs.",
      "Company executives say the fault lies with regulators who kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of the cash it needed to fund improvements.",
      "Thames Water and the industry that manages water and wastewater services have been the subject of nationwide disgust and outrage over rampant sewage spills in rivers and along the coast.",
      "\u201cThis national scandal is a disaster for Thames Water billpayers and the environment,\" said Charles Watson, chairman of River Action, an environmental group. \u201cInstead of recognizing now is the time for a special administration of Thames Water, the decision saddles customers with the responsibility for funding billions of junk-rated debt while its executives, investors and shareholders escape responsibility.\"",
      "Ofwat, which regulates water companies in England and Wales, in December approved a 35% increase in Thames Water\u2019s consumer charges over the next five years. The company argued that bills needed to rise by 53% in order to finance needed projects and provide the financial returns necessary to attract investors.",
      "The company faces massive penalties for sewage discharges, including a fine of more than 100 million pounds ($126 million) by Ofwat in August for failing to manage its wastewater treatment.",
      "Leech had been considering competing proposals to provide credit to the cash-strapped utility \u2014 one from Thames Water and a second supported by a smaller group that claimed the company's plan was too expensive and favored bigger investors. Creditors holding most of the company\u2019s debt backed the company deal.",
      "Critics of the plan said the high interest rate \u2014 9.75% \u2014 would enrich creditors who are making the loans, a point noted by the judge.",
      "\u201cThe costs of finance and adviser fees in the present case are very high. Indeed, they might be described as eye-watering,\u201d Leech said. \u201c50% of the scheduled loans go round in a circle and back into the pockets of the plan creditors.\u201d",
      "Still, Leech said the alternative of government administration, which he said was preferable to the so-called Plan B, wasn't as attractive as the company plan.",
      "Charlie Maynard, a member of Parliament from the Liberal Democrat party who had argued in court for the government takeover, said he planned to appeal the ruling, insisting that the short-term bailout wasn't in the long-term interest.",
      "\u201cThis restructuring is simply throwing good money after bad,\" Maynard said. \u201cThe money from our bills which is being spent on interest repayments is desperately needed to repair water infrastructure, improve customer service and clean up our rivers.\u201d"

      "Luka Doncic is going back to work with the Los Angeles Lakers, and he\u2019s likely back to full speed as well",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Luka Doncic is going back to work with the Los Angeles Lakers, and he's likely back to full speed as well.",
      "Coach JJ Redick says Doncic probably won't have a minutes restriction this week after his deliberate start to his Lakers tenure before the All-Star break.",
      "When the Lakers host Charlotte on Wednesday night, Doncic will play in his third game back following a 6 1/2-week absence due to a strained left calf suffered on Christmas while playing for the Dallas Mavericks.",
      "The Slovenian superstar played in both of the Lakers' final two games before the All-Star break, but he logged only 47 total minutes while the Lakers eased him back into competition. Doncic then got several days of recovery while the rest of the NBA's top players convened in San Francisco for the All-Star Game.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Redick told reporters Tuesday night after the Lakers' first practice back following the break. \u201cThat extra five, six days of All-Star break was good for him. His minutes will be up (Wednesday), and I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s going to be any sort of restrictions going forward.\u201d",
      "The Lakers acquired Doncic from the Mavs on Feb. 2 in a seismic trade that sent Anthony Davis to Dallas.",
      "LeBron James is listed as questionable to face the Hornets after he missed the final game before the All-Star break and then sat out the midseason exhibition, ending his 20-year run of All-Star participation. The 40-year-old James is dealing with a sore left foot and ankle.",
      "The Lakers and Hornets are returning from the break earlier than every other NBA team because they are playing a game that was rescheduled last month because of the catastrophic wildfires that ravaged the Los Angeles area. Redick and his family lost their home in the Pacific Palisades blaze.",
      "Los Angeles returns from the break with three games in three cities over four days, playing in Portland on Thursday and Denver on Saturday.",

    "story": [
      "Kevin Durant went back to the Bay Area last weekend",
      "Kevin Durant went back to the Bay Area last weekend. He's now going back to school.",
      "A nostalgic time for Phoenix's All-Star forward continues Thursday, when Durant and the Suns play San Antonio in Austin, Texas \u2014 a home game for the Spurs and a homecoming for Durant, since the game brings him back to where he played his one college season with the Longhorns.",
      "\u201cIt does mean a lot to me,\u201d Durant said. \u201cI\u2019m excited that we get to go back to play a regular-season game there. Austin is a place where I kind of started this journey, and to have so many friends and family that are still there from, what, 16, 17 years ago is pretty sweet. So, I appreciate the NBA for setting this up. This is a unique time.\u201d",
      "Durant\u2019s lone season in Austin was 2006-07, and he was college basketball\u2019s best player that year. He averaged 25.8 points and 11.1 rebounds, finishing the season ranked fourth nationally in both of those categories on his way to being selected as player of the year by The Associated Press and a number of other outlets.",
      "He declared for the draft after that season, went No. 2 overall to Seattle in 2007 and the accolades keep piling up. Durant is the only men's player in USA Basketball history to win four Olympic gold medals, he won two championships with Golden State \u2014 returning to the Bay this past weekend after being selected as an All-Star for the 15th time \u2014 and just became the eighth player in NBA history to eclipse the 30,000-point mark.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an awesome opportunity for himself \u2014 and for the city of Austin to come out and support one of our great players who is still in the prime of his career right now,\" Texas coach Rodney Terry said. \"He's scored over 30,000 points, he's one of the all-time scorers at the next level, one of the all-time scorers at the collegiate level. But to have an opportunity come back where you played collegiately, to play a professional game against one of the best organizations in all of professional sports in the Spurs, you can\u2019t ask for a better scenario.\u201d",
      "This is the third consecutive season where the Spurs have played two home games in Austin, about 75 miles northeast of San Antonio. The Spurs see Austin as part of a mega-region that they've been cultivating for years, even stretching into Mexico \u2014 and this year's home games help break up the annual rodeo road trip. The San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo typically sends the Spurs on the road for much of February, so this year's games in Austin break up that window.",
      "The Spurs also play in Austin on Friday against Detroit. The Suns got to Austin on Tuesday and one of Durant's first stops was the Longhorns' practice.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to try to roam around the city a little bit,\u201d Durant said this past weekend when asked if he had plans to check out some of his favorite places in Austin. \u201cI don\u2019t have a set schedule, but I\u2019ve got some stuff I want to see.\u201d",
      "Austin is very much a Spurs town; the team's G League affiliate plays there and plenty of fans at the Moody Center on Thursday and Friday will surely be wearing Victor Wembanyama jerseys. But there's going to be a slew of Texas jerseys and Durant garb visible in the crowd on Thursday, for good reason.",
      "\u201cTo have him come back here and be here this week and be around our guys and see our guys, I mean, you can\u2019t ask for anything better than that,\" Terry said. \"A lot of our guys' favorite player is Kevin Durant. Why they chose to come to Texas was Kevin Durant. He's had an incredible impact not only on our basketball program but also on our athletic program as a whole. He\u2019s an incredible ambassador for Texas athletics.\u201d",

      "To help reach it, the USTA on Wednesday pledged $10 million in grants in 2025 \u201cto help build, refurbish and extend playable hours on courts across the United States.\u201d That is up from last year's commitment of $1.2 million, which covered more than 500 courts open to the public.",

      "The statistics the USTA touted Wednesday are based on the National Golf Foundation's compilation of data from two surveys that the USTA helps fund, each of 18,000 people aged 6 and over: The Physical Activity Council (PAC) Study on Sports and Physical Activity, and the PLAY study.",
      "Other findings noted by the USTA include:",
      "\u2014 Players under age 25 drove 45% of the growth in tennis participation last year, while those under 35 accounted for more than 60%.",
      "\u2014 There was 26% growth among Black players and 15% among Hispanic players for tennis in 2024.",

      "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- USA Swimming named University of Delaware athletic director Chrissi Rawak as its new CEO and president on Wednesday.",
      "Rawak fills a role previously held by Tim Hinchey, who left the governing body of one of the biggest Olympic sports shortly after last year's Paris Games.",
      "Rawak was named Athletic Director of the Year in 2024 by a national group of ADs. She spearheaded a $38 million fundraising campaign for the construction of a new athletic department facility.",
      "Before Delaware, Rawak was an executive in the Michigan athletic department. She also was on the Michigan swimming and diving team and served as an assistant coach for the program from 1992-97.",
      "Rawak will be in charge of revitalizing an Olympic program that many in the sport's inner circles felt fell short of expectations in 2024. The U.S. won 28 swimming medals in Paris, matching its fewest since 2004, when there were 12% fewer overall medals awarded.",
      "In addition to Hinchey's departure, national program director Lindsay Mintenko also left the federation after the Paris Games.",

      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has praised the Los Angeles Dodgers for their big-spending ways",
      "GLENDALE, Ariz. -- Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred shared conflicting feelings about the big-spending Los Angeles Dodgers this week, praising the franchise's competitive spirit in one breath before worrying about the financial disparity they've created in the next.",
      "Players elsewhere around the league don't seem nearly as conflicted.",
      "\u201cTeams spending money is never bad for baseball and never bad for players. Ever. In any situation,\u201d Athletics slugger Brent Rooker said.",
      "If Manfred is looking to find some sympathy from Major League Baseball's rank-and-file regarding his worry over the sport's financial health, it's probably not going to come from the guys on the field.",
      "MLB is the only major professional sport in America that doesn\u2019t have a salary cap, though there are luxury tax penalties for passing certain spending thresholds. Last season, the Dodgers had a $353 million luxury tax payroll and had to pay a $103 million tax. The Athletics had the lowest luxury tax payroll at just under $84 million.",
      "Los Angeles' spending didn't slow this offseason. The Dodgers signed two-time Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell to a $182 million, five-year deal during the offseason and also made sizable investments in players like Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez, Michael Conforto, Tanner Scott, Kirby Yates and Roki Sasaki.",
      "That came one year after the organization splurged on more than $1 billion in commitments to Japanese stars Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto.",
      "LA's spending has dwarfed all but a few franchises. Opposing players might be envious of those fat paychecks, but it's hard to find them complaining.",
      "Even Manfred \u2014 who said he's received emails from fans worried about competitive balance \u2014 can't fault the Dodgers' approach.",
      "\u201cThe Dodgers have gone out and done everything possible, always within the rules that currently exist, to put the best possible team on the field and that\u2019s a great thing for the game,\u201d Manfred said on Tuesday. \u201cThat type of competitive spirit is what people want to see.\u201d",
      "Walker Buehler threw the final pitch of the 2024 season, recording the final out for the Dodgers in their World Series-clinching Game 5 victory. He signed a $21.05 million, one-year with the Boston Red Sox during the winter, but the right-hander isn\u2019t about to talk smack about his former employer.",
      "The 30-year-old knows exactly why players are flocking to Chavez Ravine.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s odd,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a first-class organization and obviously coming off a huge World Series and, I think on top of that, you layer in that on a team right now where there\u2019s probably four or five Hall of Famers, I think it\u2019s an attractive place to play.\u201d",
      "That doesn't mean there isn't some awe from players about the formidable roster that the Dodgers have built thanks to their deep pockets.",
      "\u201cI worked out with some guys that ended up signing with the Dodgers and was like, at a certain point, \u2018I didn\u2019t know they had room on the 40-man (roster),'\" Red Sox pitcher Patrick Sandoval said.",
      "The Arizona Diamondbacks are one of the teams trying to keep pace with the Dodgers in the NL West. They signed ace right-hander Corbin Burnes to a $210 million, six-year deal in December, but they are still projected to have a payroll that will be roughly half the size of the Dodgers.",
      "\u201cI don't think it's unfair at all,\u201d D-backs manager Torey Lovullo said. \u201cThey're within the rules, they're doing what they have to do to get the best players on the field. When I was a kid, it was the Yankees, remember? George Steinbrenner was going crazy with his spending and it yielded World Championships. That's what we're all chasing.\u201d",
      "Lovullo makes a good point about the Yankees. Baseball has had a long history of financial disparity, particularly since free agency started in the 1970s.",
      "Even so, there haven't been many dynasties over the past 40 years. The Dodgers are trying to become the first team to win back-to-back World Series titles since Steinbrenner's Yankees had a three-peat from 1998 to 2000.",
      "Third baseman Max Muncy is in the eighth season with the Dodgers and says a big payroll certainly helps to build a talented roster, but it doesn't mean much once the season starts. He points to 2023, when the Diamondbacks swept the Dodgers out of the postseason in the NL Division Series despite having a much smaller payroll.",
      "\u201cThis sport is really tough,\u201d Muncy said. \u201cIt doesn't matter what kind of roster that you have. Time after time, teams have shown that you get into the playoffs and anything can happen.\u201d",

      "The iPhone 16e unveiled Wednesday is the fourth-generation of a model that\u2019s sold at a dramatically lower price than the iPhone\u2019s standard and premium models. The previous bargain-bin models were called the iPhone SE, with the last version coming out in 2022.",
      "Like the higher-priced iPhone 16 lineup unveiled last September, the iPhone 16e includes the souped-up computer chip needed to process an array of AI features that automatically summarize text, audio and create on-the-fly emojis while smartening up the device\u2019s virtual assistant, Siri. It will also have a more powerful battery and camera.",
      "All those upgrades will translate into a higher starting price for an iPhone 16e at $600, a 40% increase from $430 for the last iPhone SE. But iPhone 16e will be more affordable than the cheapest standard iPhone 16 at $800. The new phone will be available in stores Feb. 28, but can be pre-ordered beginning Friday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re so excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone experience to even more people,\u201d said Kaiann Drance, an Apple vice president in charge of promoting a device lineup that accounts for more than half of the company's revenue.",
      "Although Apple has been hyping its foray into AI since last June, the complete set of features still haven\u2019t been released in the U.S. and the technology still isn\u2019t even available in some parts of the world.",

      "Apple has primarily been losing the ground in China, where it hasn\u2019t yet specified when the iPhone's AI technology will be available. But the company recently struck an AI partnership with Alibaba in China that could pave the way for the technology coming to iPhones in that country this spring.",
      "Besides being able to handle AI for the first time, the iPhone 16e has a different look from previous SE models. It boasts a 6.1-inch display screen, slightly larger than the 4.7-inch display on SE model and no longer has a home screen button like the SE had. The new iPhone 16e will rely include a facial recognition option for unlocking the device, just like the higher priced models do.",
      "Apple's shares edged up during Wednesday's late mornng trading to nearly $245, below the stock's peak price of roughly $260 reached in late December.",

      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is planning to endorse a statewide ban on cellular devices in public schools",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is aiming to improve student achievement, social interaction and the mental health of public school students by proposing a statewide ban on cellphones in classrooms, an idea that is rapidly gaining traction nationally regardless of political persuasion.",
      "The Democrat's top education aide, Martin Torres, said Pritzker is expected to endorse \u201cscreen-free schools\u201d during his combined State of the State/Budget address at noon Wednesday.",
      "Legislation introduced in both houses of the General Assembly would require school districts to set policies that ban personal wireless devices during class time, with notable exceptions, create a means for secure but accessible storage of phones and tablets, and review those guidelines at least every three years.",
      "Eight states have policies that ban or limit schoolhouse cellphone use. Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio. Iowa, Kentucky and Michigan are among the 15 states where bans or other restrictions have been proposed.",
      "The Pew Research Center has found that seven in 10 high school teachers in the U.S. consider cellphone distraction a major classroom problem.",
      "Torres, Pritzker's deputy governor for education, told The Associated Press that at least 10 Illinois school districts have adopted screen-free policies, and they have had positive results.",
      "\u201cStudents are more engaged, they\u2019re more attentive in class. There\u2019s improved participation in classroom dynamics,\u201d Torres said. \u201cThis is a proposal that\u2019s going to help teachers with instruction. It\u2019s going to reduce screen time. It\u2019s going to reduce social media exposure. And there\u2019s research that suggests that social media is linked with anxiety, depression, body dissatisfaction.\u201d",
      "The legislation, which would require policies be in place by the 2026-2027 school year, has enough flexibility in the plan to allow school districts to develop a policy that best suits them.",
      "Pritzker's idea is to ban wireless devices during instructional periods unless there is an emergency or a need to respond to a threat. They would also be allowed when a teacher approves their use, when a physician deems it essential for a student, for an individual special education plan or to help English learners.",
      "This school year, Peoria schools adopted a plan in which each student is issued a neoprene pouch with a magnetized lock that only teachers or administrators can open. Midway through the school year, a survey of 8,000 students from grades 5 to 12 found they had more focus, more engagement and reduced distractions, Superintendent Sharon Desmoulin-Kherat said.",
      "She said that in an email, a teacher reported: \u201cI am looking into students' eyes who have never looked up from a screen before.\u201d",
      "Illinois was way ahead of the curve on the issue, but it then backpedaled. Legislation banned cellphones as early as the 1990s when cellular devices were new, expensive and thought to be the domain of drug dealers. As technology improved, they were seen as vital links to the outside, particularly family, and in 2002, the Legislature reversed itself and approved their presence in schools.",
      "Despite being turned off and locked up, Peoria students retain ready access when necessary, Desmoulin-Kherat said, noting one of the few concerns parents had was being able to reach their children in an emergency.",
      "\u201cJust like the old days, you can call the office,\u201d Desmoulin-Kherat said. \u201cYou can send an email. You don't need a cellphone to be able to communicate with your family.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients bring their own blood or choose their own donor for medical procedures under legislation gaining momentum in Utah",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah may soon loosen its B.Y.O.B. rules, but not in the way some might hope. The acronym has taken on a new meaning in the state Legislature: \u201cBring Your Own Blood.\u201d",
      "Health care facilities in Utah would be required to let patients use their own blood for procedures or choose their own donor under a bill that passed the state House with unanimous support Wednesday, despite concerns from the American Red Cross.",
      "Directed donations, which typically involve a patient\u2019s friend or family member giving blood for their procedure, are allowed under federal law. But the requests undergo a rigorous screening process that the bill's sponsor, an outspoken opponent of vaccines, said does not give patients enough personal choice in their medical decisions.",
      "Hospitals and blood collectors like the American Red Cross currently have broad discretion to decide whether it's safe and feasible for a patient to use their own blood or that of a chosen donor. Many facilities saw a rise in requests during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concerns about vaccine transmission that medical professionals say are unfounded.",
      "The Republican proposal, which now heads to the Senate, makes it so Utah health providers can no longer block someone from supplying their own blood, except in emergencies. Hospitals would not be liable for any injuries or deaths that may result from using the blood.",
      "Similar legislation is being considered in Texas and was floated in past legislative sessions in Iowa and Kentucky, but did not pass.",
      "\u201cThis bill was brought to me by patients who have requested to use directed blood donation, including their own blood, at Utah hospitals and have been denied,\u201d said freshman Rep. Kristen Chevrier, the bill's sponsor. \u201cTheir situations are serious and delicate.\u201d",
      "The Republican from Highland argued patients should be able to receive blood from people they trust, rather than go through blood banks that do not disclose to patients their donor's medical history.",
      "Before her election to the Legislature, Chevrier led multiple anti-vaccine organizations that warned against taking COVID-19 shots and fought against vaccination requirements imposed by schools and employers. She and other supporters have acknowledged that the bill would let patients who are weary of COVID-19 vaccines handpick donors with a similarly unvaccinated status.",
      "According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, justification for such requests \u201cis not supported by any medical or scientific evidence.\u201d Vaccine components do not replicate through blood transfusions or alter a blood recipient's DNA, meaning an unvaccinated patient could not receive the COVID-19 vaccine via a vaccinated donor's blood.",
      "Requests to use blood from a known donor are often driven by a patient\u2019s preference rather than a medical need, said Daniel Parra of the American Red Cross, the largest blood collector in Utah. An increase in those requests would divert resources away from those requiring lifesaving care, he cautioned.",
      "\u201cThis bill would create unnecessary and harmful impacts on the delivery of lifesaving blood to patients,\u201d Parra told The Associated Press. \u201cWhile this bill may be well-intentioned, it offers no public health benefit and could negatively impact patient care.\u201d",
      "Kristina Pexton, a blood transfusion specialist at a Utah hospital, told lawmakers at a recent committee hearing that she worried the bill would place a strain on the system.",
      "Directed donations also carry a greater risk than the community blood supply, Parra warned. Family and friends may feel pressure to donate and might not be fully transparent about their health history, which he said increases the risk of the recipient contracting an infectious disease.",
      "There is no evidence that patients can select safer donors than the volunteer blood system provides. Still, several residents told lawmakers the choice was important to them.",
      "\u201cSomething so personal as our health care, something that is especially as personal as blood, we should always have that choice,\u201d said Gayle Ruzicka."

But challenges over pricing, longevity, supply and app constraints may limit its success.",
      "Huawei said at a launch event in Kuala Lumpur that the Huawei Mate XT, first unveiled in China five months ago, will be priced at 3,499 euros ($3,662). Although dubbed a trifold, the phone has three mini-panels and folds only twice. The company says it's the thinnest foldable phone at 3.6 millimeters (0.14 inches), with a 10.2-inch screen similar to an Apple iPad.",

      "Huawei, China\u2019s first global tech brand, is at the center of a U.S.-China battle over trade and technology. Washington in 2019 severed Huawei\u2019s access to U.S. components and technology, including Google\u2019s music and other smartphone services, making Huawei's phone less appealing to users. It has also barred global vendors from using U.S. technology to produce components for Huawei.",
      "American officials say Huawei is a security risk, which the company denies. China\u2019s government has accused Washington of misusing security warnings to contain a rising competitor to U.S. technology companies.",
      "Huawei launched the Mate XT in China on Sept. 20 last year, the same day Apple launched its iPhone 16 series in global markets. But with its steep price tag, the Mate XT \u201cis not a mainstream product that people are going to jump for,\u201d Ma said.",
      "At the Kuala Lumpur event, Huawei also unveiled its MatePad Pro tablet and Free Arc, its first open-ear earbuds with ear hooks and other wearable devices.",
      "While Huawei\u2019s cutting-edge devices showcase its technological prowess, its long-term success remains uncertain given ongoing challenges over global supply chain constraints, chip availability and limitations on the software ecosystem, said Ruby Lu, an analyst with the research firm TrendForce.",
      "\"System limitations, particularly the lack of Google Mobile Services, means its international market potential remains constrained,\u201d Lu said.",

In the global market, it had 23% market share, trailing behind Samsung's 33% share in 2024, he said. IDC predicted that total foldable phone shipments worldwide could surge to 45.7 million units by 2028, from over 20 million last year.",
      "While most major brands have entered the foldable segments, Lu said Apple has yet to release a competing product.",
      "\u201cOnce Apple enters the market, it is expected to significantly influence and stimulate further growth in the foldable phone sector,\u201d Lu added."

      "A new study links a particular gene to the ancient origins of spoken language, proposing that a protein variant found only in humans may have helped us communicate in a novel way. Speech allowed us to share information, coordinate activities and pass down knowledge, giving us an edge over extinct cousins like Neanderthals and Denisovans.",
      "The new study is \u201ca good first step to start looking at the specific genes\u201d that may affect speech and language development, said Liza Finestack at the University of Minnesota, who was not involved with the research.",
      "What scientists learn may someday even help people with speech problems.",
      "The genetic variant researchers were looking at was one of a variety of genes \"that contributed to the emergence of Homo sapiens as the dominant species, which we are today\u201d said Dr. Robert Darnell, an author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Darnell has been studying the protein \u2013 called NOVA1 and known to be crucial to brain development \u2013 since the early 1990s. For the latest research, scientists in his lab at New York's Rockefeller University used CRISPR gene editing to replace the NOVA1 protein found in mice with the exclusively human type to test the real-life effects of the genetic variant. To their surprise, it changed the way the animals vocalized when they called out to each other.",
      "Baby mice with the human variant squeaked differently than normal littermates when their mom came around. Adult male mice with the variant chirped differently than their normal counterparts when they saw a female in heat.",
      "Both are settings where mice are motivated to speak, Darnell said, \u201cand they spoke differently\" with the human variant, illustrating its role in speech.",
      "This isn't the first time a gene has been linked to speech. In 2001, British scientists said they had discovered the first gene tied to a language and speech disorder.",
      "Called FOXP2, it was referred to as the human language gene. But though FOXP2 is involved in human language, it turned out that the variant in modern humans wasn't unique to us. Later research found it was shared with Neanderthals. The NOVA1 variant in modern humans, on the other hand, is found exclusively in our species, Darnell said.",
      "The presence of a gene variant isn't the only reason people can speak. The ability also depends on things like anatomical features in the human throat and areas of the brain that work together to allow people to speak and understand language.",
      "Darnell hopes the recent work not only helps people better understand their origins but also eventually leads to new ways to treat speech-related problems.",
      "University of Minnesota's Finestack said it\u2019s more likely the genetic findings might someday allow scientists to detect, very early in life, who might need speech and language interventions.",

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- U.S. tech giants have quietly empowered Israel to track and kill many more alleged militants more quickly in Gaza and Lebanon through a sharp spike in artificial intelligence and computing services. But the number of civilians killed has also soared, fueling fears that these tools are contributing to the deaths of innocent people.",
      "Militaries have for years hired private companies to build custom autonomous weapons. However, Israel's recent wars mark a leading instance in which commercial AI models made in the United States have been used in active warfare, despite concerns that they were not originally developed to help decide who lives and who dies.",
      "The Israeli military uses AI to sift through vast troves of intelligence, intercepted communications and surveillance to find suspicious speech or behavior and learn the movements of its enemies. After a deadly surprise attack by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, its use of Microsoft and OpenAI technology skyrocketed, an Associated Press investigation found. The investigation also revealed new details of how AI systems select targets and ways they can go wrong, including faulty data or flawed algorithms. It was based on internal documents, data and exclusive interviews with current and former Israeli officials and company employees.",
      "\u201cThis is the first confirmation we have gotten that commercial AI models are directly being used in warfare,\u201d said Heidy Khlaaf, chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute and former senior safety engineer at OpenAI. \u201cThe implications are enormous for the role of tech in enabling this type of unethical and unlawful warfare going forward.\u201d",
      "As U.S. tech titans ascend to prominent roles under President Donald Trump, the AP\u2019s findings raise questions about Silicon Valley\u2019s role in the future of automated warfare. Microsoft expects its partnership with the Israeli military to grow, and what happens with Israel may help determine the use of these emerging technologies around the world.",
      "The Israeli military\u2019s usage of Microsoft and OpenAI artificial intelligence spiked last March to nearly 200 times higher than before the week leading up to the Oct. 7 attack, the AP found in reviewing internal company information. The amount of data it stored on Microsoft servers doubled between that time and July 2024 to more than 13.6 petabytes \u2014 roughly 350 times the digital memory needed to store every book in the Library of Congress. Usage of Microsoft\u2019s huge banks of computer servers by the military also rose by almost two-thirds in the first two months of the war alone.",
      "Israel\u2019s goal after the attack that killed about 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages was to eradicate Hamas, and its military has called AI a \u201cgame changer\u201d in yielding targets more swiftly. Since the war started, more than 50,000 people have died in Gaza and Lebanon and nearly 70% of the buildings in Gaza have been devastated, according to health ministries in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "The AP\u2019s investigation drew on interviews with six current and former members of the Israeli army, including three reserve intelligence officers. Most spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss sensitive military operations.",
      "The AP also interviewed 14 current and former employees inside Microsoft, OpenAI, Google and Amazon, most of whom also spoke anonymously for fear of retribution. Journalists reviewed internal company data and documents, including one detailing the terms of a $133 million contract between Microsoft and Israel\u2019s Ministry of Defense.",
      "The Israeli military says its analysts use AI-enabled systems to help identify targets but independently examine them together with high-ranking officers to meet international law, weighing the military advantage against the collateral damage. A senior Israeli intelligence official authorized to speak to the AP said lawful military targets may include combatants fighting against Israel, wherever they are, and buildings used by militants. Officials insist that even when AI plays a role, there are always several layers of humans in the loop.",
      "\u201cThese AI tools make the intelligence process more accurate and more effective,\u201d said an Israeli military statement to the AP. \u201c\u2060They make more targets faster, but not at the expense of accuracy, and many times in this war they\u2019ve been able to minimize civilian casualties.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military declined to answer detailed written questions from the AP about its use of commercial AI products from American tech companies.",
      "Microsoft declined to comment for this story and did not respond to a detailed list of written questions about cloud and AI services provided to the Israeli military. In a statement on its website, the company says it is committed \u201cto champion the positive role of technology across the globe.\u201d In its 40-page Responsible AI Transparency Report for 2024, Microsoft pledges to manage the risks of AI throughout development \u201cto reduce the risk of harm,\u201d and does not mention its lucrative military contracts.",
      "Advanced AI models are provided through OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, through Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform, where they are purchased by the Israeli military, the documents and data show. Microsoft has been OpenAI's largest investor. OpenAI said it does not have a partnership with Israel's military, and its usage policies say its customers should not use its products to develop weapons, destroy property or harm people. About a year ago, however, OpenAI changed its terms of use from barring military use to allowing for \u201cnational security use cases that align with our mission.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s extremely hard to identify when AI systems enable errors because they are used with so many other forms of intelligence, including human intelligence, sources said. But together they can lead to wrongful deaths.",
      "In November 2023, Hoda Hijazi was fleeing with her three young daughters and her mother from clashes between Israel and Hamas ally Hezbollah on the Lebanese border when their car was bombed.",
      "Before they left, the adults told the girls to play in front of the house so that Israeli drones would know they were traveling with children. The women and girls drove alongside Hijazi\u2019s uncle, Samir Ayoub, a journalist with a leftist radio station, who was caravanning in his own car. They heard the frenetic buzz of a drone very low overhead.",
      "Soon, an airstrike hit the car Hijazi was driving. It careened down a slope and burst into flames. Ayoub managed to pull Hijazi out, but her mother \u2014 Ayoub\u2019s sister \u2014 and the three girls \u2014 Rimas, 14, Taline, 12, and Liane, 10 \u2014 were dead.",
      "Before they left their home, Hijazi recalled, one of the girls had insisted on taking pictures of the cats in the garden \u201cbecause maybe we won\u2019t see them again.\u201d",
      "In the end, she said, \u201cthe cats survived and the girls are gone.\u201d",
      "Video footage from a security camera at a convenience store shortly before the strike showed the Hijazi family in a Hyundai SUV, with the mother and one of the girls loading jugs of water. The family says the video proves Israeli drones should have seen the women and children.",
      "The day after the family was hit, the Israeli military released video of the strike along with a package of similar videos and photos. A statement released with the images said Israeli fighter jets had \u201cstruck just over 450 Hamas targets.\" The AP\u2019s visual analysis matched the road and other geographical features in the Israeli military video to satellite imagery of the location where the three girls died, 1 mile (1.7 kilometers) from the store.",
      "An Israeli intelligence officer told the AP that AI has been used to help pinpoint all targets in the past three years. In this case, AI likely pinpointed a residence, and other intelligence gathering could have placed a person there. At some point, the car left the residence.",
      "Humans in the target room would have decided to strike. The error could have happened at any point, he said: Previous faulty information could have flagged the wrong residence, or they could have hit the wrong vehicle.",
      "The AP also saw a message from a second source with knowledge of that airstrike who confirmed it was a mistake, but didn\u2019t elaborate.",
      "A spokesperson for the Israeli military denied that AI systems were used during the airstrike itself, but refused to answer whether AI helped select the target or whether it was wrong. The military told the AP that officials examined the incident and expressed \u201csorrow for the outcome.\u201d",
      "Microsoft and the San Francisco-based startup OpenAI are among a legion of U.S. tech firms that have supported Israel\u2019s wars in recent years.",
      "Google and Amazon provide cloud computing and AI services to the Israeli military under \u201cProject Nimbus,\u201d a $1.2 billion contract signed in 2021 when Israel first tested out its in-house AI-powered targeting systems. The military has used Cisco and Dell server farms or data centers. Red Hat, an independent IBM subsidiary, also has provided cloud computing technologies to the Israeli military, and Palantir Technologies, a Microsoft partner in U.S. defense contracts, has a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d providing AI systems to help Israel\u2019s war efforts.",
      "Google said it is committed to responsibly developing and deploying AI \u201cthat protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.\u201d Dell provided a statement saying the company commits to the highest standards in working with public and private organizations globally, including in Israel. Red Hat spokesperson Allison Showalter said the company is proud of its global customers, who comply with Red Hat's terms to adhere to applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Palantir, Cisco and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. Amazon declined to comment.",
      "The Israeli military uses Microsoft Azure to compile information gathered through mass surveillance, which it transcribes and translates, including phone calls, texts and audio messages, according to an Israeli intelligence officer who works with the systems. That data can then be cross-checked with Israel\u2019s in-house targeting systems and vice versa.",
      "He said he relies on Azure to quickly search for terms and patterns within massive text troves, such as finding conversations between two people within a 50-page document. Azure also can find people giving directions to one another in the text, which can then be cross-referenced with the military\u2019s own AI systems to pinpoint locations.",
      "The Microsoft data AP reviewed shows that since the Oct. 7 attack, the Israeli military has made heavy use of transcription and translation tools and OpenAI models, although it does not detail which. Typically, AI models that transcribe and translate perform best in English. OpenAI has acknowledged that its popular AI-powered translation model Whisper, which can transcribe and translate into multiple languages including Arabic, can make up text that no one said, including adding racial commentary and violent rhetoric.",
      "\u201cShould we be basing these decisions on things that the model could be making up?\u201d said Joshua Kroll, an assistant professor of computer science at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, who spoke to the AP in his personal capacity, not reflecting the views of the U.S. government.",
      "The Israeli military said any phone conversation translated from Arabic or intelligence used in identifying a target has to be reviewed by an Arabic-speaking officer.",
      "Errors can still happen for many reasons involving AI, said Israeli military officers who have worked with the targeting systems and other tech experts. One intelligence officer said he had seen targeting mistakes that relied on incorrect machine translations from Arabic to Hebrew.",
      "The Arabic word describing the grip on the launch tube for a rocket-propelled grenade is the same as the word for \u201cpayment.\u201d In one instance the machine translated it wrong, and the person verifying the translation initially didn\u2019t catch the error, he said, which could have added people speaking about payments to target lists. The officer was there by chance and caught the problem, he said.",
      "Intercepted phone calls tied to a person\u2019s profile also include the time the person called and the names and numbers of those on the call. But it takes an extra step to listen to and verify the original audio, or to see a translated transcript.",
      "Sometimes the data attached to people\u2019s profiles is wrong. For example, the system misidentified a list of high school students as potential militants, according to the officer. An Excel spreadsheet attached to several people\u2019s profiles titled \u201cfinals\u201d in Arabic, contained at least 1,000 students\u2019 names on an exam list in one area of Gaza, he said. This was the only piece of incriminating evidence attached to people\u2019s files, he said, and had he not caught the mistake, those Palestinians could have been wrongly flagged.",
      "He said he also worried that young officers, some still younger than 20, under pressure to find targets quickly with the help of AI would jump to conclusions.",
      "AI alone could lead to the wrong conclusion, said another soldier who worked with the targeting systems. For example, AI might flag a house owned by someone linked to Hamas who does not live there. Before the house is hit, humans must confirm who is actually in it, he said.",
      "\u201cObviously there are things that I live peacefully with and things that I could have done better in some targeted attacks that I\u2019m responsible for,\u201d the soldier told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s war, things happen, mistakes happen, we are human.\u201d",
      "Tal Mimran served 10 years as a reserve legal officer for the Israeli military, and on three NATO working groups examining the use of new technologies, including AI, in warfare. Previously, he said, it took a team of up to 20 people a day or more to review and approve a single airstrike. Now, with AI systems, the military is approving hundreds a week.",
      "Mimran said over-reliance on AI could harden people\u2019s existing biases.",
      "\u201cConfirmation bias can prevent people from investigating on their own,\u201d said Mimran, who teaches cyber law policy. \u201cSome people might be lazy, but others might be afraid to go against the machine and be wrong and make a mistake.\u201d",
      "Among U.S. tech firms, Microsoft has had an especially close relationship with the Israeli military spanning decades.",
      "That relationship, alongside those with other tech companies, stepped up after the Hamas attack. Israel\u2019s war response strained its own servers and increased its reliance on outside, third-party vendors, according to a presentation last year by the military\u2019s top information technology officer. As she described how AI had provided Israel \u201cvery significant operational effectiveness\u201d in Gaza, the logos of Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services appeared on a large screen behind her.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already reached a point where our systems really need it,\u201d said Col. Racheli Dembinsky, commander of the Center of Computing and Information Systems, known by its Hebrew acronym, Mamram.",
      "One three-year contract between Microsoft and the Israeli Ministry of Defense began in 2021 and was worth $133 million, making it the company's second largest military customer globally after the U.S., according to a document reviewed by the AP. The Israeli military is classified within Microsoft as an \u201cS500\u201d client, meaning that it gets top priority as one of the company's most important customers globally.",
      "The Israeli military's service agreements with Microsoft include at least 635 individual subscriptions listed under specific divisions, units, bases or project code words. Subscription names reviewed by the AP included \u201cMamram\u201d and \u201c8200,\u201d an elite intelligence unit known for its technological prowess.",
      "One urgent Azure support ticket filed about two weeks after the Oct. 7 attack asked for delays of planned maintenance outages for the rest of the year due to the war, because any downtime could have \u201ca direct impact on life-saving systems.\u201d The request was flagged as being from \u201cGlilot \u2013 8200,\u201d a highly secure army base that houses Unit 8200, responsible for clandestine operations, collecting signal intelligence and code decryption, cyber warfare and surveillance.",
      "Records show Microsoft\u2019s global Azure support team responded to about 130 direct requests from the Israeli military through the first 10 months of the war. Microsoft\u2019s consulting services unit also works closely with Israel\u2019s military, which represented half of that section\u2019s overall revenue, an internal document said.",
      "Within Israel, a team of at least nine Microsoft employees is dedicated to serving the military\u2019s account. Among them is a senior executive who served 14 years in Unit 8200 and a former IT leader for military intelligence, according to their online resumes. Microsoft data is housed in server farms within two massive buildings outside Tel Aviv, enclosed behind high walls topped with barbed wire. Microsoft also operates a 46,000-square-meter corporate campus in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, and another office in Gav-Yam in southern Israel, which has displayed a large Israeli flag.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces has long been at the forefront of deploying artificial intelligence for military use. In early 2021, it launched Gospel, an AI tool that sorts through Israel\u2019s vast array of digitized information to suggest targets for potential strikes. It also developed Lavender, which uses machine learning to filter out requested criteria from intelligence databases and narrow down lists of potential targets, including people.",
      "Lavender ranks people between 0 and 100 based on how likely it is they are a militant, said an intelligence officer who used the systems. The ranking is based on intelligence, such as the person\u2019s family tree, if someone\u2019s father is a known militant who served time, and intercepted phone calls, he said.",
      "In May 2021, the Israeli military launched what Israeli intelligence officials described as their \u201cFirst AI War,\u201d an 11-day bombing campaign against Hamas. At the time, Israeli military officials described AI as a \u201cforce-multiplier,\u201d allowing them to carry out far more airstrikes than in prior conflicts.",
      "A 2021 post by the Israeli military also described the stakes surrounding the use of AI in war: \u201cUnlike in the realms of AdTech and Gaming, wrong decisions in the realm of intelligence may cost lives,\u201d it read. The same post described the military\u2019s incorporation of AI approaches to analyze the emotional tone of communications, a technique experts have found can fail to pick slang, jargon or nuance in people\u2019s speech.",
      "The relationship between tech companies and the Israeli military also has ramifications in the U.S., where some employees have raised ethical concerns.",
      "In October, Microsoft fired two workers for helping organize an unauthorized lunchtime vigil for Palestinian refugees at its corporate campus in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft said at the time that it ended the employment of some people \u201cin accordance with internal policy\u201d but declined to give details.",
      "Hossam Nasr, one of the employees fired by Microsoft who works with the advocacy group No Azure for Apartheid, said he and former colleagues are pushing for Microsoft to stop selling cloud and AI services to the Israeli military.",
      "\u201cCloud and AI are the bombs and bullets of the 21st century,\u201d Nasr said. \u201cMicrosoft is providing the Israeli military with digital weapons to kill, maim and displace Palestinians, in the gravest moral travesty of our time.\u201d",
      "In April, Google fired about 50 of its workers over a sit-in at the company\u2019s California headquarters protesting the war in Gaza.",
      "Former Google software engineer Emaan Haseem was among those fired. Haseem said she worked on a team that helped test the reliability of a \u201csovereign cloud\u201d \u2014 a secure system of servers kept so separate from the rest of Google\u2019s global cloud infrastructure that even the company itself couldn't access or track the data it stores. She later learned through media reports that Google was building a sovereign cloud for Israel.",
      "\u201cIt seemed to be more and more obvious that we are literally just trying to design something where we won\u2019t have to care about how our clients are using it, and if they\u2019re using it unfairly or unethically,\u201d Haseem said.",
      "Google said the employees were fired because they disrupted work spaces and made colleagues feel unsafe. Google did not respond to specific questions about whether it was contracted to build a sovereign cloud for the Israeli military and whether it provided restrictions on the wartime use of its AI models.",
      "Gaza is now in an uneasy ceasefire. But recently, the Israeli government announced it would expand its artificial intelligence developments across all its military branches.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. tech titans keep consolidating power in Washington. Microsoft gave $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. Google CEO Sundar Pichai got a prime seat at the president\u2019s inauguration. And OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met with the president on Trump\u2019s second full day in office to talk up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for AI infrastructure.",
      "In a new book set to be published Tuesday, Palantir CEO Alexander Karp calls for the U.S. military and its allies to work closely with Silicon Valley to design, build and acquire AI weaponry, including \u201cthe unmanned drone swarms and robots that will dominate the coming battlefield.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fate of the United States, and its allies, depends on the ability of their defense and intelligence agencies to evolve, and briskly,\u201d Karp wrote, according to an advance copy obtained by the AP.",
      "After OpenAI changed its terms of use last year to allow for national security purposes, Google followed suit earlier this month with a similar change to its public ethics policy to remove language saying it wouldn\u2019t use its AI for weapons and surveillance. Google said it is committed to responsibly developing and deploying AI \u201cthat protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security.\u201d",

It says that Google will not change the policy it outlined after U.S. President Donald Trump declared the body of water the Gulf of America.",
      "\u201cWe will wait for Google\u2019s response and if not, we will proceed to court,\u201d Sheinbaum said Monday during a morning press briefing.",
      "As it stands, the gulf appears in Google Maps as Gulf of America within the United States, as Gulf of Mexico within Mexico and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America) elsewhere. Turner in his letter said the company was using Gulf of America to follow \u201clongstanding maps policies impartially and consistently across all regions\" and that the company was willing to meet in person with the Mexican government.",
      "\u201cWhile international treaties and conventions are not intended to regulate how private mapping providers represent geographic features, it is our consistent policy to consult multiple authoritative sources to provide the most up to date and accurate representation of the world,\" he wrote.",
      "Mexico has argued that the mapping policy violates Mexican sovereignty because the U.S. only has jurisdiction over around 46% of the Gulf. The rest is controlled by Mexico, which controls 49% and Cuba, which controls around 5%. The name Gulf of Mexico dates back to 1607 and is recognized by the United Nations.",
      "In response to Google's letter, Mexican authorities said they would take legal action, writing that \u201cunder no circumstance will Mexico accept the renaming of a geographic zone within its own territory and under its jurisdiction.\"",
      "The renaming of the body of water by Trump has flared tensions between Mexico and the U.S. at a pivotal time for the neighboring allies.",
      "Sheinbaum has had to walk a fine line with Trump amid threats of tariffs and Mexico and other Latin American countries have braced themselves for promised mass deportations, the brunt of which has still not been felt.",
      "Along with the legal threat to Google, the Mexican president also announced Monday that Mexico and the U.S. would hold high-level meetings this week on trade and security in an effort to maintain a \u201clong-term plan of collaboration\" between the two countries.",
      "It's the latest round of talks between the two countries in which Mexico hopes to hold off a larger geopolitical crisis.",
      "The renaming of the water body has fueled strife within the U.S. as well.",
      "Last week, the White House barred Associated Press reporters from several events, including some in the Oval Office, saying it was because of the news agency\u2019s policy on the name. The AP is using Gulf of Mexico to ensure that names of geographical features are recognizable around the world but also acknowledging Trump\u2019s renaming of it as well.",
      "Other journalistic organizations such as the White House Correspondents' Organization and the New York Times have echoed the AP in raising alarm about press freedom violations.",

      "Meteorologists warn that the coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy and prolonged exclamation point on America\u2019s winter of repeated polar vortex invasions starting this weekend",
      "The coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy exclamation point on America's winter of repeated polar vortex invasions, meteorologists warn. And it will stay frozen there all next week.",
      "Different weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole not just into the United States, but also Europe, several meteorologists tell The Associated Press.",
      "This will be the 10th time this winter that the polar vortex \u2014 which keeps the coldest of Arctic air penned in at the top of the world \u2014 stretches like a rubber band to send some of that big chill south, said Judah Cohen, seasonal forecast director at the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research. In a normal winter, it happens maybe two or three times.",
      "This winter, with record snow in New Orleans and drought and destructive wildfires in Southern California, has not been normal.",
      "The latest projected cold outbreak should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains Saturday and then stick around all next week. The cold will likely concentrate east of the Rockies with only the far American west and central and southern Florida exempted, meteorologists said.",
      "On Tuesday, expect the Lower 48 states to have an average low of 16.6 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8.6 Celsius), and then plunge to 14 degrees (minus 10 Celsius) on Wednesday, calculated private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist.",
      "Sometime next week, 89% of the contiguous United States will be below the freezing mark and 27% of the Lower 48 will be below zero (minus 18 degrees Celsius), according to National Weather Service forecasts.",
      "Meteorologists expect strong winds to make the cold feel even worse. Every U.S. state but Hawaii, California and Florida have some or all parts forecast to have a good chance of windchills of 20 degrees or below sometime next week, the National Weather Service predicted.",
      "Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and Iowa will have \u201cprobably the most impressive\u201d cold, with temperatures as much as 35 degrees (19 degrees Celsius) below what's normal for this time of year, said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist at the weather service's Weather Prediction Center. NOAA weather models predict Wednesday lows below zero in Oklahoma, Colorado, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.",
      "Some storms \u2014 with flooding, heavy snow or even a nor'easter \u2014 could hit during next week's prolonged cold outbreak, but details on those aren't certain yet, Taylor said.",
      "\u201cEverything, all the stars align, all the wind directions in the atmosphere are dragging the cold polar air out of the Canadian Arctic,\u201d Maue said. \u201cIt\u2019s the depths of winter. Everything signals extreme biting, winter cold. Obviously this isn\u2019t the first polar vortex episode of the winter, but it looks to be the most severe.\u201d",
      "A stretched polar vortex like this one happens lower in the atmosphere and is different than when the polar vortex has sudden warming, weakens and all the cold air escapes south and out of the poles, Cohen said. During stretching events, the polar vortex remains in place and strong, but it also just pulls and bends. Stretch outbreaks are usually slightly milder than the big polar escape events and often hit the United States, not Europe.",
      "Meteorologists are going to want to study why this stretching is happening so often this year, but it could just be natural randomness, said Laura Ciasto, a meteorologist at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center who specializes in the polar vortex.",
      "\u201cWhat we're observing right now is interesting, but not unprecedented,\u201d said Martin Stendel, a scientist at the National Center for Climate Research in Denmark.",
      "Another factor adding to the polar vortex stretching is a big blob of high pressure in the upper atmosphere over Greenland. It's moving west and will push the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that moves weather systems such as storms \u2014 into a pattern that causes polar air to plunge and stay there, Cohen said.",
      "Human-caused climate change may be making the jet stream wavier and more likely to be stuck in that wavy pattern, one of the factors involved, Stendel said.",
      "There haven't been many winters like this in the past to help meteorologists forecast what will happen next and when the cold will finally go away, Maue said.",
      "Despite the unusually cold winter across the U.S., the world remains in an overall warming pattern. Earth's average overall temperature set yet another monthly heat record in January. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 C (2.7 F) above pre-industrial times.",

      "William Ray Lucas, who led the NASA facility that shouldered much of the blame for the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, has died. Lucas was 102.",
      "Lucas died Monday at his home in Huntsville, Alabama, according to an obituary published Friday by Laughlin Service Funeral Home in Huntsville. A funeral service has been set for March 1 on what would have been his 103rd birthday, funeral director Bryan Peek said Saturday.",
      "Lucas was director of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville when the Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, just 73 seconds after liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida. It was the deadliest U.S. space flight disaster at that time.",
      "The explosion killed all seven crew members, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, who had been tapped to become the first U.S. civilian to travel to space. Her inclusion on the flight meant thousands of schoolchildren across the country were watching the Challenger's launch and witnessed the televised disaster in real time.",
      "A presidential commission charged with investigating the cause of the explosion pointed to the shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets as the likely culprit and criticized NASA managers for not taking safety concerns surrounding the rockets more seriously. The Marshall center had supervised development of the rockets.",
      "Lucas pushed back on the criticism, telling reporters a month after the explosion that it was too soon to pinpoint the cause of the explosion, adding, \u201cI think it was a sound decision to launch.\"",
      "But within months he had resigned, just days ahead of the release of a commission report blaming faulty design of the booster rockets.",
      "The explosion and resulting shakeup within NASA overshadowed what was an otherwise stellar career for Lucas, who was born and raised in rural western Tennessee and graduated from high school in 1939 as the class valedictorian. He earned a bachelor of science degree from Memphis State College, served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and later earned a doctorate in metallurgy from Vanderbilt University.",
      "Lucas began his career in the guided missile development division of the U.S. Army's Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville. He became a charter member of the Marshall Space Flight Center when it was established in 1960 before rising through the ranks to become its director in 1974."

      "Two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, voted against Patel. Democrats were unanimous in their opposition.",
      "Despite his controversial nomination, Republicans rallied around Patel, arguing he is the right person to bring reform to the nation's top law enforcement agency they allege has been corrupted.",
      "\"Mr. Patel should be our next FBI director because the FBI has been infected by political bias and weaponized against the American people. Mr. Patel knows it, Mr. Patel exposed it, and Mr. Patel has been targeted for it,\" Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said last week as the committee met to consider and advance his nomination.",
      "Though not all GOP members backed him. Collins, explaining her decision to vote against his confirmation, said there is a need for an FBI director who is \"decidedly apolitical\" and Patel's \"time over the past four years has been characterized by high profile and aggressive political activity.\"",
      "Murkowski voiced similar concerns.",
      "\"My reservations with Mr. Patel stem from his own prior political activities and how they may influence his leadership,\" the senator said in a post on X. \"The FBI must be trusted as the federal agency that roots out crime and corruption, not focused on settling political scores. I have been disappointed that when he had the opportunity to push back on the administration\u2019s decision to force the FBI to provide a list of agents involved in the January 6 investigations and prosecutions, he failed to do so.\"",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, objected to Patel up until the last minute. Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, held a press conference outside FBI headquarters on Thursday morning railing against Patel's \"bizarre political statements\" on Jan. 6 to retribution.",
      "He accused Republicans of \"willfully ignoring red flags on Mr. Patel,\" who he argued has \"neither the experience, the judgment or the temperament\" to be FBI chief for the next 10 years.",
      "\"Mr. Patel will be a political and national security disaster,\" Durbin said.",

      "He faced pointed questions from Democrats on those comments and more -- including support for Jan. 6 rioters and quotes that appeared favorable to the \"QAnon\" conspiracy movement -- during his confirmation hearings last month.",
      "Patel sought to distance from some of his past rhetoric, and told lawmakers he would take \"no retributive actions\" despite his history of comments about targeting journalists and government employees.",
      "Patel will take over an agency facing uncertainty and turmoil amid firings and other key changes.",

      "\"If naval operations suffers, at least we can hold our heads high. Because at least we have another first! The first female member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- hooray. For social justice ideologues, PR matters more than reality,\" he wrote.",
      "Hegseth also criticized Brown several times in the book.",
      "\"The military standards, once the hallmark for competency, professionalism, and 'mission first' outcomes, have officially been subsumed by woke priorities,\" he wrote. \"You think C.Q. Brown will think intuitively about external threats and internal readiness? No chance. He built his generalship dutifully pursuing the radical positions of left-wing politicians, who in turn rewarded him with promotions.\"",
      "Also in his book, Hegseth cast doubt as to whether Brown merited his promotion to be America's top general.",
      "\"We'll never know, but always doubt -- which on its face seems unfair to C.Q.,\" he wrote. \"But since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it really doesn't much matter.\"",
      "Brown was nominated under the first Trump administration in early 2020 to become the first Black Air Force chief of staff. While awaiting Senate confirmation for that job, Brown began to share his thoughts on racial injustice in the military after George Floyd's death sparked nationwide protests. As the top Air Force general in the Pacific, Brown put out a video where he described racial incidents he had experienced.",
      "Brown has also been vocal about what he sees as the importance of race-based diversity in the military. In 2022, while chief of staff of the Air Force, Brown signed a memo calling for the service to work toward lowering the percentage of white officer applicants while raising those of other races.",
      "When asked by ABC News' Martha Raddatz in January 2024 whether how important diversity, equity and inclusion is to the military, Brown said, \"Depending where you grew up, when you come into our military, this may be the most diverse experience you've ever had.\"",
      "\"In order for us to be leaders, we need to know the backgrounds and understand some things about those we're privileged to lead,\" he added. \"And that's the value of some of our programs. So, we get a chance to know a little bit more about their, you know, culture, history, experiences and building that personal connection.\"",
      "At his confirmation hearing in January, Hegseth danced around a question about whether he would fire Brown when asked by Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., if Brown might be on a list of senior officers to be removed from their jobs, saying, \"Senator, every single senior officer will be reviewed based on meritocracy standards, lethality and commitment to lawful orders they will be given.\"",
      "But there were some positive signs for Brown beginning last December, when he had an amiable encounter with Trump at the Army-Navy football game. Hegseth met Brown briefly at the Army-Navy game, where Brown and then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met for 20 minutes during the second quarter of the game and talked about football.",
      "Then on Jan. 27, on Hegseth's first day arriving at the Pentagon as secretary, he seemed to give another sign of softening his position in regard to the general.",
      "Brown saluted Hegseth as his motorcade arrived, then shook his hand as the two exchanged pleasantries. With Brown by his side, Hegseth approached a line of waiting reporters and took several questions, including one on whether he intended to fire the general.",
      "\"I'm standing with him right now,\" Hegseth said, patting Brown on the shoulder. \"I look forward to working with him.\"",

    "story": [
      "Trump and Zelenskyy engaged in a fierce back and forth on Wednesday.",
      "LONDON -- National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said Thursday that officials in Kyiv \"need to tone it down\" after a fierce back and forth between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy related to a potential deal to end Russia's three-year-old invasion of its neighbor.",
      "U.S.-Russia talks began this week in Saudi Arabia without Ukrainian participation, Kyiv's exclusion prompting condemnation in Ukraine and across Europe as well as a vow from Zelenskyy that his country would not sign any deal agreed over its head. Zelenskyy also pushed back on a proposed deal that would give the U.S. access to hundreds of billions of dollars worth of minerals.",
      "Responding to the discord, Waltz told Fox News that the Ukrainians \"need to tone it down and take a hard look and sign that deal,\" referring to the proposed minerals agreement.",
      "\"There's obviously a lot of frustration here,\" Waltz said after Wednesday's war of words.",
      "Seeking to explain the strong remarks from Trump and Vice President JD Vance, Waltz said, \"We presented the Ukrainians really an incredible and historic opportunity to have the United States of America co-invest with Ukraine, invest in its economy, invest in its natural resources and really become a partner in Ukraine's future in a way that's sustainable, but also would be -- I think -- the best security guarantee they could ever hope for, much more than another pallet of ammunition.\"",
      "Trump on Wednesday attacked European allies and the Ukrainian leadership for having failed to end Russia's war. The president went on to call Zelenskyy a \"dictator without elections,\" claiming -- without providing evidence -- that his Ukrainian counterpart's public approval rating was as low as 4%.",
      "Trump also wrote on Truth Social that Zelenskyy \"better move fast or he is not going to have a country left.\"",
      "Zelenskyy, meanwhile, suggested Trump is in a \"disinformation space,\" attributing at least some of the U.S. leader's criticism to Russian disinformation campaigns.",
      "Vance then warned that Zelenskyy's approach to dealing with the Trump White House was \"atrocious.\"",
      "In Moscow, meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday that Ukrainian officials had made \"unacceptable and impermissible\" remarks about foreign leaders \"in recent months.\"",
      "\"Rhetoric used by Zelenskyy and numerous other representatives of the Kyiv regime in general leaves much to be desired,\" Putin's spokesperson said.",
      "The diplomatic spat was set against the backdrop of continued Russian strikes across Ukraine. On Thursday, Ukraine's air force said Russia launched 14 missiles and 161 drones into the country in a massive overnight bombardment.",
      "Ukraine's air force said it shot down 80 of the drones launched in the latest Russian barrage, with another 78 lost in flight without causing any damage. The 14 missiles targeted energy infrastructure, the air force said, adding it would not reveal how many were intercepted.",
      "Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko wrote on Facebook that Russia conducted a \"massive\" missile and drone attack on \"gas infrastructure.\"",
      "The aim of the \"criminal attacks\" was to \"stop the production of gas, which is necessary to provide citizens' household needs and centralized heating,\" he said.",
      "\"While Russia continues to blatantly lie about not attacking civilian critical infrastructure, we are witnessing multiple missiles targeting Ukrainian gas mining facilities at once,\" Galushchenko wrote.",
      "\"Such actions of the enemy prove only once again that Russia is trying to hurt ordinary Ukrainians, plunged into the cold in the middle of winter,\" he added. \"This is outright terrorism.\"",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said its strike targeted \"gas and energy infrastructure facilities that ensure the operation of the military-industrial complex of Ukraine.\"",
      "\"The strike's objective has been achieved,\" the ministry said. \"All facilities have been hit.\"",
      "Russia's long-range strikes into Ukraine have not eased despite the opening of talks aimed at ending Moscow's three-year-old full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Russia's latest salvo came with Trump's Ukraine-Russia envoy Keith Kellogg in Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian leaders. Following the meeting, Zelenskyy said the two had a \"good conversation\" in a readout on Telegram. He said he was \"grateful to the United States for all the assistance and bipartisan support,\" but also emphasized Ukraine is ready for peace and has been \"seeking peace from the first second of this war.\"",
      "On Thursday, Zelenskyy marked the anniversary of the culmination of Ukraine's 2014 Maidan Revolution -- in which pro-Western protesters overthrew Moscow-aligned President Viktor Yanukovych.",
      "\"It was in these days of 2014 that Russia chose war -- it began the first steps towards the occupation of Crimea,\" Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. \"While people were being killed in Kyiv, and people were defending their freedom, Putin decided to strike another blow.\"",
      "\"Since then, the world has been living in a new reality, when Russia is trying to deceive everyone,\" the president wrote. \"And it is very important not to give in, to be together. It is very important to support those who defend freedom.\"",
      "Ukraine is continuing its own long-range campaign against Russian military and industrial infrastructure, especially targets linked to the country's lucrative fossil fuel industry. Ukrainian security services have referred to the campaign as \"drone sanctions.\"",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry said on Thursday that its forces shot down 13 Ukrainian drones over the previous 24 hours.",

      "The idea of Carter, Truman, Eisenhower, McKinley, Roosevelt and Grant taking a vacation together in Florida might sound like a fantasy, but the Society of Presidential Descendants makes it happen every year.",
      "It's a club that you literally have to be born into. Each Presidents Day, first families meet up at a historic spot called the Little White House in scenic Key West.",
      "\"The first time we did anything like this was in 2010 with Margaret Hoover, President Hoover's great granddaughter, and her husband,\" Clifton Truman, the oldest grandson of 33rd President Harry Truman, told ABC News. \"And the next year, we added Susan Ford and Luci Baines Johnson.\"",
      "Since 2018, the group has met annually and amassed 75 direct descendants from 26 presidents. They know their families are wrapped up in the nation's history.",
      "\"Susan Ford said, I wasn't sure, that the job was sort of twofold. One, to keep up with the legacy -- your ancestor's legacy -- to preserve that, promote it, defend it,\" Clifton said. \"But the second part of the job is to do something with it on your own, make it your own in some way.\"",
      "Part of the preservation is sharing stories with eager audiences at Harry and Bess Truman\u2019s second home. The Little White House is a museum now, but Clifton used to come here with his grandparents in the '60s.",

      "While this is the yearly formal gathering, this specially connected group of friends gather elsewhere from time to time on other special occasions. Before former President Jimmy Carter died in December, almost a dozen descendants -- including his grandson James Earl Carter IV -- gathered to celebrate the 39th president's 100th birthday last October.",
      "They're descended from Democrats and Republicans, but party affiliation and policy discussion have never stood in the way of the group's mission to stick together.",
      "\"One of the things that all of our ancestors had in common was a great love for the country, a great respect for the institution of the presidency, regardless of politics, and that's something that we all share as well,\" James said.",
      "It also acts as a support system in more challenging times.",
      "\"I had a heart attack back in July, and all of these friends contacted me and were there for me, so they're family,\" Massee McKinley, who is the great-great nephew of 25th President William McKinley and the great, great grandson of 22nd and 24th President Grover Cleveland, told ABC News.",

      "This group is determined to use their famous family names to push the legacy forward.",
      "\"Presidents Day is an opportunity to begin to remind people of what their civic duties are. Everybody seems to know their rights, but they seem to have forgotten that those rights come with duties,\" Tweed Roosevelt said. \"One of the things we're trying to do is help Americans understand what their role is, so that democracy will survive.\""

      "The cuts will reduce the World Trade Center Health Program supervising staff.",
      "The Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce affect the World Trade Center Health Program, putting the health of 9/11 first responders at risk, critics said.",
      "Sixteen probationary staff members at the World Trade Center Health Program have been fired as part of the layoffs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Several other full-time staff members have agreed to take a buyout, according to Citizens for the Extension of the James Zadroga Act.",
      "The firings and buyouts amount to a 20% reduction in the staff that supervises and administers the World Trade Center Health Program. There are also cuts to research grants that fund efforts at the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) to determine whether new health conditions are related to service at the World Trade Center site on and after 9/11.",
      "Decisions on certifications to allow for treatment of new cancers and other conditions will be delayed because of the firings and layoffs, Benjamin Chevat of Citizens for the Extension of the James Zadroga Act told ABC News. Additionally, decisions on pending petitions to expand coverage to autoimmune and cardiac conditions will be delayed and there will be fewer people to intervene when there are problems with prescriptions and treatment, according to Chevat.",
      "\"We cannot believe that the Trump administration or the new HHS Secretary, Robert Kennedy Jr., intends to harm 9/11 responders and survivors in the World Trade Center Health Program, but that will be the outcome of these cuts,\" Chevat said.",
      "In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., New York Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer demanded that the funds be restored.",
      "\"'Never forget' is not just a slogan. It is a sacred promise to always stand by 9/11 heroes, a promise being broken by slashing funding and vital staffing for their healthcare in the World Trade Center Health Program. It's unacceptable, and un-American,\" said Schumer in a joint statement with Gillibrand. \"To say funding for 9/11 first responders is government waste is outrageous and insulting.\"",
      "\"These brutal cuts mean layoffs for staff who have dedicated their careers to caring for our 9/11 survivors. It means delayed care for our sick first responders. It is telling 9/11 survivors that after they risked everything to protect us, we can't support their healthcare needs,\" the statement continued.",
      "New York Republicans (and one from New Jersey) are also expressing \"serious concerns\" in a biting letter to Trump \u2013 pleading with the president to ensure that any reductions to the workforce at HHS \"is done in a targeted manner so as to not impact the vital functions\" of the World Trade Center Health Program.",

      "\"To fulfill our moral obligation to 9/11 survivors and responders, we must ensure that the Program not only has the necessary resources, but also is properly administered, so that Program members receive the high-quality care that they need and deserve. We urge you, as a native New Yorker who lived in New York City as it recovered from the 9/11 terrorist attacks, to reverse these actions by rehiring the terminated probationary staff, restoring the canceled FDNY research grant contract, and fencing off the WTC Health Program, which was authorized in statute as mandatory spending, from any further staff and funding reductions.\"",

      "About 140,000 survivors have enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Program, including about 12,000 last year alone, according to the CDC.",
      "\"Slashing funding and laying off workers who run this vital program will have a devastating impact on its ability to provide sick responders and survivors with the care they need. This is betrayal of our heroes who stepped up and risked their lives to put our community back together in one of our nation's darkest hours, and we will not let it stand. HHS Secretary Kennedy must reverse these cuts and terminations immediately,\" Gillibrand said in the statement.",

Russian President Vladimir Putin has also repeatedly framed Zelenskyy as illegitimate, citing the postponement of the country's 2024 presidential elections due to martial law.",
      "Zelenskyy hit back at Trump's call for the country to hold fresh presidential elections during a Wednesday press conference in Kyiv. He challenged Trump's claim, pointing to respected recent surveys showing him polling consistently above 50% with voters and describing Trump's assertion as Russian \"disinformation.\"",
      "\"If someone wants to replace me right now, then right now it won't work,\" Zelenskyy said. \"If we are talking about 4% then we have seen this disinformation, we understand that it comes from Russia. And we have evidence.\"",
      "The Ukrainian president said he would conduct opinion polls for trust ratings for world leaders, including Trump, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "Zelenskyy said he took Trump's comments \"calmly.\"",

      "Trump additionally claimed on Wednesday that the U.S. has invested $350 billion on aid for Ukraine and spent $200 billion more than Europe, which is inaccurate.",
      "The Kiel Institute for the World Economy, based in Germany, estimates that the U.S. has committed about $119 billion in aid for Ukraine since Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022. This figure combines military, financial and humanitarian assistance.",
      "In comparison, Europe has allocated approximately EUR 267 billion, or approximately $278 billion, according to the Kiel Institute.",

      "Putin -- in his first public comments since the talks -- said on Wednesday he had been informed of the results of the meeting in Riyadh, and that the meeting \"passed in a very well-meaning manner in general.\"",
      "\"As our participants told me, those were absolutely different people on the American side, who were open to a negotiating process, without any bias and without any disapproval of what's been done in the past. At least there was none of that during the bilateral contacts,\" Putin said.",
      "The Russian leader said the talks were intended as a trust-building exercise, which produced positive outcomes, saying the \"purpose of this meeting was to elevate confidence between Russia and the U.S.\"",
      "Putin also said he would be happy to meet with Trump in person, though he did not offer any information on when such a meeting might occur.",
      "\"It must be prepared. I would gladly meet with Donald, I have not seen him for a long time. We don't have any close relations, but still, we have met in past years, in the four years of his presidency, and discussed relations between our states in a very level way. I would be glad to meet him now, too. And I think he would, too,\" Putin said.",

      "Kellogg arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday morning, where he was expected to hold talks with Ukrainian leaders.",
      "Kellogg told reporters his \"mission is to sit and listen\" and then report back to Trump. He parried questions about whether Trump is siding with Putin, saying Trump wants to end the war because \"he understands the human suffering\" it's causing.",
      "Kellogg said he agrees with Trump that the war would never have begun if he had been president at the time.",
      "Kellogg met with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte earlier this week before traveling to Ukraine. Zelenskyy said he discussed the meeting with Rutte on Wednesday.",
      "\"The key messages align with our goal of achieving guaranteed peace, not just a temporary ceasefire. There must be confidence that in a few months or years, Putin won't return with his war,\" Zelenskyy wrote on X.",
      "\"We also discussed our future contacts with partners and coordinated our next steps,\" he continued, adding, \"We cannot allow Putin to deceive everyone again.\"",

      "Russia launches drone strike on Ukraine in wake of talks",
      "Hours after the U.S.-Russia discussions concluded with a commitment to continue talks, Russia launched a major missile and drone barrage into Ukraine.

      "Odesa Mayor Gennadiy Trukhanov reported a \"massive enemy strike on a densely populated area of \u200b\u200bthe city\" causing electricity, heating and water outages.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a post to social media that the strike targeted \"civilian energy facilities,\" in keeping with longstanding Russian doctrine. \"For nearly three years now, the Russian army has relentlessly used missiles and attack drones against them,\" he said.",
      "\"Just yesterday, after the notorious meeting in Riyadh, it became clear that Russian representatives were once again lying, claiming they do not target Ukraine's energy sector,\" Zelenskyy continued.",
      "\"Yet, almost simultaneously, they launched another attack, with drones striking electrical transformers,\" he wrote. \"And this is during winter -- it was minus 6 degrees Celsius at night.\"",
      "\"We must never forget that Russia is ruled by pathological liars -- they cannot be trusted and must be pressured,\" the president said.",
      "Trump says Ukraine has 'had a seat for 3 years'",
      "Kyiv's exclusion from the Saudi talks has badly unsettled Ukraine and its European allies. Trump was unapologetic when speaking with reporters Tuesday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, just as Odesa came under attack.",
      "\"They've had a seat for three years and a long time before that,\" Trump said of Ukraine, suggesting Kyiv could have made a deal with Moscow to avoid the huge loss of lives and land.",
      "Trump said he believes he has \"the power to end this war,\" while falsely claiming Ukraine started the conflict against Russia. The war began when Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, a campaign that followed eight years of cross-border Russian aggression in Crimea and Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.",
      "\"I think it's going very well,\" Trump said of U.S. efforts to end the war. \"But today I heard, oh, 'Well, we weren't invited.' Well, you've been there for three years. You should have ended it three years -- you should have never started it.\"",
      "Speaking on Wednesday, Zelenskyy criticized the Trump administration's recent demand for a treaty that would hand over 50% of Ukraine's natural resources to the U.S., in exchange for no security guarantees. Trump himself has repeatedly said he wants $500 billion worth of Ukraine's rare minerals to pay back the U.S. for its support during Russia's invasion.",
      "Zelenskyy said such a demand was \"not serious,\" and corrected Trump's claim that the U.S. has provided more money than Europe.",
      "\"There wasn't a word there about security guarantees,\" he said. \"There is nothing precise there. I can't sell the state.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said that if Ukraine cannot join NATO, it needs a strong army backed by Western weapons and air defense. He said Ukraine was looking for a troop contingent from European countries to help protect Ukraine after a ceasefire, but warned that Ukraine's own troops needed to be backed by air defense, which only the U.S. can provide.",
      "\"Only the Americans, President Donald Trump, have this protection, this air defense, it's exclusively from them, and that's what's important,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We have a map that shows us this, but we are ready for dialogue, for discussion, about what quantity, how much is needed. We've calculated everything; we've figured it all out. So this is essentially the main point of what we are requesting.\"",
      "Zelenskyy suggested Tuesday that the U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh merely revived ultimatums issued by Moscow in the early stages of its invasion.",
      "\"I have the impression that there are now some negotiations happening and they have the same mood, but between Russia and the United States,\" Zelenskyy said during a visit to Turkey.",
      "\"Again, about Ukraine without Ukraine,\" he added. \"It's interesting, if Ukraine didn't yield to ultimatums in the most difficult moment, where does the feeling come from that Ukraine will agree to this now?\"",
      "\"I never intended to yield to Russia's ultimatums and I don't intend to now,\" Zelenskyy added.",

      "David Boren, the former Oklahoma governor and longtime U.S. Senate intelligence chief who went on to lead the University of Oklahoma after his retirement from politics, has died",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Former Oklahoma Gov. David Boren, who became one of the nation's youngest governors in the 1970s at age 33 and later helped shape national intelligence as a U.S. senator, has died. He was 83.",
      "Boren, who went on to serve as president of the University of Oklahoma after retiring from politics, died early Thursday at his home near Newcastle, said Bob Burke, a longtime family friend. He said Boren's death was the result of complications from diabetes.",
      "The son of a Democratic congressman, Boren quickly followed in his father's footsteps into elected office and oversaw a dramatic downsizing of government in Oklahoma, where over decades in legislative corridors and university offices he became one of the state's most influential figures. His son, Dan Boren, also served four terms as an Oklahoma congressman.",
      "In 2019, David Boren cut ties with the university he had led for 24 years amid a probe into allegations that he had sexually harassed male subordinates. Boren denied wrongdoing and the allegations never resulted in charges or civil litigation.",
      "\u201cHe was the smartest person I ever knew,\u201d Burke, an attorney and author who managed Boren\u2019s first campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1978. \u201cHe was a Rhodes Scholar, yet he could communicate with a farmer in overalls on the Main Street of a small Oklahoma town.",
      "\u201cNo Oklahoman had more influence on the state\u2019s progress in its first century than David Boren,\u201d he said.",
      "Boren served in the U.S. Senate between 1979 and 1994 and was the longest-serving chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. He became president of Oklahoma's largest public university after leaving the Senate and held the position until stepping down in 2018.",
      "\u201cHe saw public service as a noble calling and dedicated his life to it,\u201d Boren's son, Dan Boren, said in a statement. \"The countless heartwarming stories I hear almost daily from people across this state who he helped are reminders of his remarkable life. We shall cherish the memory of his service and remarkable life.\u201d",
      "A year after leaving the University of Oklahoma, a former student alleged he was touched and kissed inappropriately by Boren on several occasions about a decade earlier, allegations that Boren repeatedly denied.",
      "An investigation into Boren\u2019s alleged misconduct by the Jones Day law firm, which ended when Boren severed ties to the university in 2019, was never publicly released. The allegations against Boren tarnished his reputation and led him to withdraw from public life.",
      "Boren served four terms in the Oklahoma House before being elected governor at the age of 33 in 1974, which at the time made him the youngest governor in the country. He ran a reformist campaign that became known as the \u201cBoren Broom Brigade\u201d to demonstrate his pledge to \u201csweep out the old guard.\u201d",
      "As governor, Boren worked to eliminate the inheritance tax, cut the state income tax and reorganize a state government he described as \u201ccluttered\u201d with 214 boards, agencies and commissions.",
      "\u201cThis excessive red tape in government is a constant drain on taxpayer dollars,\u201d Boren once said, adding that the government needed to \u201cget out of the horse and buggy era.\u201d",
      "While in the U.S. Senate, Boren forged close relationships with the leaders of the nation's intelligence community, including former CIA Director George Tenet, whom Boren tapped as the Intelligence Committee's chief of staff prior to Tenet's appointment as CIA director.",
      "On the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, Boren was having breakfast with Tenet at a Washington hotel when Tenet, then CIA director, learned that an aircraft had flown into the World Trade Center tower in New York City. Boren later recalled that neither he nor Tenet was \u201ctotally shocked\u201d by the terrorist attack because the two men had spoken frequently about the possibility of international terrorists launching an attack in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI thought George was obsessed with Osama bin Laden and terrorism around the world,\u201d Boren told The Oklahoman months after the attacks. \u201cI don\u2019t think everything changed Sept. 11; only our perception and understanding changed.\u201d",
      "In the Senate, Boren also helped build bipartisan support to oppose South Africa's oppressive racial apartheid regime ahead of Nelson Mandela\u2019s release from prison in 1990. Shortly after his release, Mandela traveled to the U.S. and appeared as a guest on an ABC News town hall moderated by Ted Koppel. Boren was in the audience and Mandela led a standing ovation after Boren summed up the evils of apartheid and called for its end.",
      "\u201cHe has said all the things that are required to be said in regards to the problems of South Africa,\u201d Mandela said.",
      "During his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Boren also said he was heavily involved with helping influence U.S. policy in Central America, particularly in Nicaragua, during conflict in that country between the right-wing Contras and the leftist Sandinistas, working as an \u201cinformal emissary\u201d for former President George H.W. Bush.",
      "\u201cThe fact that I was in a different party \u2014 and the fact that we trusted each other -- was a big benefit,\u201d Boren told The Oklahoman in 1994.",
      "In 2016, Boren spearheaded a campaign in Oklahoma to adopt a 1 percent sales tax increase that would have raised about $550 million annually for public education, including pay raises for school teachers who were at the time among the lowest paid in the nation. But it was defeated in a statewide referendum.",
      "David Lyle Boren was born on April 21, 1941, in Washington, the son of U.S. Rep. Lyle Hagler Boren and the former Christine McKown. He was married twice, to the late Janna Little Robbins and then to Molly Shi Boren, a former judge, English teacher and president emeritus of the Oklahoma Arts Institute.",
      "Boren suffered from a minor stroke at a statue dedication ceremony in April 2018 and was hospitalized for several days. Boren also underwent heart bypass surgery in March 2017.",

    "summary": "A law firm representing Elon Musk and Tesla helped draft a bill some experts say could, if passed, possibly restore Musk's lost multibillion-dollar compensation package.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are split on whether the bill could revive Musk's compensation deal.",
      "A law firm representing Elon Musk and Tesla helped draft legislation to overhaul Delaware's corporate law amid an ongoing court battle over Musk's multibillion-dollar compensation package from his electric car company, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to ABC News.",
      "The proposed state legislation would amend the Delaware General Corporation Law to ease the rules that determine whether a shareholder is deemed a \"controller,\" a designation that blocked Musk from receiving a compensation plan of up to $55.8 billion from Tesla last year.",
      "Musk lost his compensation package -- reportedly the largest CEO compensation plan in public corporation history -- after being recognized as a \"controller\" of Tesla even though he held less than a third of the company's shares.",
      "Under the existing law, shareholders below the one-third threshold still receive the \"controller\" classification if they exert other avenues of control. In contrast, the proposed law would set a requirement that a shareholder hold at least a third of a company's shares in order to be deemed a \"controller.\"",
      "Legal experts are divided on whether the proposed legislation, if enacted, could impact Musk's Tesla compensation package currently on appeal to the state's Supreme Court -- a point of contention that has arisen from the fact the bill lacks an explicit mention forbidding its application to pending cases.",
      "The law firm representing Musk and Tesla, Richards, Layton & Finger, confirmed to ABC News its involvement in drafting the legislation. The firm claimed the legislation, if enacted, would not be retroactive.",
      "The firm also said that its role in the process \"was not on behalf of or otherwise influenced by any firm client,\" stressing that it was among a group of lawyers, professors and experts that helped draft the proposal and that the firm has played a major role in shaping Delaware's business statutes for more than 125 years.",
      "\"As many have recognized, statutory changes are necessary to restore the core principles that have been the hallmark of Delaware for over a century and ensure that Delaware remains the preeminent jurisdiction for incorporation,\" Richards, Layton & Finger President Lisa Schmidt wrote in a statement to ABC News.",
      "The bill's sponsor, Delaware Democratic state Sen. Bryan Townsend, echoed the claim, telling ABC News that the bill is \"not retroactive and would not affect the litigation regarding Elon Musk's compensation package at Tesla.\"",
      "Townsend also stressed that an attorney from Richards, Layton & Finger was invited to advise on the legislation as an industry expert and a member of the Delaware State Bar Association's Corporation Law Council, along with many other experts -- and that legislators were fully responsible for the bill's final draft.",
      "But other legal experts told ABC News that the proposed law could allow the Delaware court to reverse its decision and grant Musk the pay package.",
      "The bill lacks an explicit mention forbidding application to pending cases, making possible a court finding that alters the outcome of Musk's case, legal experts said.",
      "\"It's possible,\" Sarath Sanga, a professor of corporate law at Yale University, said of the potential use of the proposed law to revive Musk's pay package. \"There's nothing in the law requiring it and there's nothing preventing it.\"",
      "Ann Lipton, a law professor at Tulane University, said the absence of any stipulation preventing application to pending cases could function as a signal to the court to reverse its decision about Musk's pay.",
      "\"It sends a strong signal to the Delaware Supreme Court that we want you to interpret this to give Elon his pay package back,\" Lipton said.",
      "Boston College Law Professor Brian Quinn said that it's unclear if the legislation will be retroactive or not -- but added, \"It's entirely possible that the court reverses the trial opinion for reasons not related to this amendment, and the package is reinstated.\"",
      "Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who oversees the Delaware trial court that handles commercial litigation, rejected the 2018 compensation package that Tesla voted to provide to Musk.",
      "McCormick found that the negotiations surrounding the package had been inappropriate, due to a lack of independence among board members and Musk's influence over the negotiations.",
      "The proposed changes to the law could ease the scrutiny applied to Musk, resulting in a reversal of the court's judgment, some experts told ABC News.",
      "The proposed law bypassed a typical process of consideration before the Corporate Law Council, a section of the Delaware Bar Association, Sanga said. He said he could not recall an instance in which a proposed change to Delaware corporate law did not go through that process.",

      "Pressed on the fate of the agency\u2019s core initiatives, McMahon said Trump wants them to be more efficient but isn\u2019t out to defund them. She suggested certain roles could be moved to other agencies, saying the department\u2019s civil rights arm could go to the Justice Department.",
      "She pledged to preserve federal Title I money for low-income schools, Pell grants for low-income college students and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, all of which were created by Congress.",

      "On a recent hot summer day in Chile, the beaches of Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Conc\u00f3n and Re\u00f1aca are packed with holidaymakers sharing yerba mate teas and playing ball",
      "VI\u00d1A DEL MAR, Chile -- On a recent hot summer day in Chile, the beaches of Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Conc\u00f3n and Re\u00f1aca are packed with holidaymakers sharing yerba mate teas and playing ball. Others mill about in the shopping centers on the coast and in the capital, some wearing shirts with Lionel Messi\u2019s name on them, carrying bags full of clothes, video games and mobile phones.",
      "They are part of a wave of Argentines who have found Chile to be a budget-friendly paradise this southern summer.",
      "\u201cEverything here is so cheap for us,\u201d said Cristian V\u00e1zquez, who was enjoying the sea in Re\u00f1aca, on Chile\u2019s central coast.",
      "In December 2024, the start of the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s summer, more Argentines went on vacation abroad than in the previous year, with Chile, Brazil, and Uruguay as the top destinations.",
      "Despite a year of economic crisis, Argentines are flocking to beaches, mountains and shopping centers abroad, encouraged by a favorable economic outlook \u2014 and a strong peso.",
      "Between December 2023 and the same month in 2024 the Argentine peso appreciated by around 41% against the official U.S. dollar, thanks in part of a strong adjustment plan implemented by President Javier Milei, an ultra-liberal who came to power at the end of 2023 on vows to \u201cblow up\u201d the central bank, take an axe to the bloated government and kill sky-high inflation.",
      "The stampede of Argentines traveling abroad for their summer vacations is driven by several factors, including the recent devaluation of various foreign currencies, the convenience of nearby destinations accessible by car and the prohibitively high cost of domestic vacations, especially along the Argentine Atlantic coast.",
      "Argentine tourism abroad surged in December, with departures up 76.4% year-over-year to 1.3 million travelers compared to the same month the previous year, according to official figures. Of those, 80.7% visited neighboring countries, primarily Chile (28%), Brazil (22.6%) and Uruguay (15.6%).",
      "Chile has become a popular destination for Argentines, who made up 40% of the 5.2 million visitors to the country in 2024 and early 2025. Chile\u2019s strong economic position relative to Argentina has resulted in competitive prices, a major draw for Argentine tourists.",
      "Chile\u2019s tourism undersecretary, Ver\u00f3nica Pardo, noted that visitors are also spending more than in previous years, averaging about $63.3 per person per day.",
      "Argentine visitors aren\u2019t confined to the sun-drenched beaches of the Chilean coast. Messi jerseys and mate gourds are also a common sight in other neighboring countries.",
      "Nicol\u00e1s Lentini, 37, recently arrived in Brazil, drawn by the devalued real and lower prices. \u201cA week\u2019s rent for four people in Argentina costs $700,\" he said, noting that he paid the same amount for 14 days in B\u00fazios, a Brazilian resort east of Rio de Janeiro.",
      "\u201cBesides, the beaches here are incomparable to ours, where it\u2019s cold. Here, you can wear a T-shirt all day.\u201d",
      "Brazil experienced a surge in tourism after the real depreciated by around 27% in 2024, when it reached a record of 6.6 million foreign arrivals, with Argentines being the main visitors (1.9 million).",
      "Andr\u00e9s Dey\u00e1, from Argentina's federation of travel and tourism business associations, highlighted the challenges of competing with neighboring countries like Brazil.",
      "\u201cWe can provide good services, financing tools, tourism quality and everything else,\u201d he said, but ultimately \"macroeconomic issues define where Argentines decide to travel.\u201d",
      "After a four-year hiatus marked by the COVID-19 pandemic and a subsequent economic crisis, Luis S\u00e1nchez returned to the exclusive resort of Punta del Este, Uruguay.",
      "\u201cWe like it a lot... this year the prices aren\u2019t as high as they\u2019ve been,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez, one of 309,570 Argentines who visited Uruguay between December 20, 2024, and January 13, 2025, representing nearly half of all visitors to the country, where the U.S. dollar appreciated almost 13% against the Uruguayan peso in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "Tourism operators in Argentina note that the Argentine exodus was also fueled by recovering purchasing power due to falling inflation and the recent elimination of a tax on foreign credit card purchases.",
      "Sunbathing in a bikini on a Punta del Este beach, Esperanza Fagalde said she hadn\u2019t vacationed at the Uruguayan resort for the past two years. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t affordable,\u201d she said, citing the unfavorable exchange rate and high costs.",
      "\u201cBut now it is, so we\u2019re back,\u201d she said.",

      "Justice Department lawyers and New York City Mayor Eric Adams are set to face a federal judge who's signaling that he's unlikely to rubber stamp their request to drop corruption charges weeks before an April trial",
      "NEW YORK -- Justice Department lawyers and New York City Mayor Eric Adams are set to face a federal judge who is signaling that he\u2019s unlikely to rubber stamp their request to drop the mayor's corruption charges weeks before an April trial.",
      "Judge Dale E. Ho in Manhattan scheduled the Wednesday afternoon hearing after three government lawyers from Washington made the dismissal request on Friday. Manhattan\u2019s top federal prosecutor resigned after she refused an order to do so.",
      "Ho already indicated that the hearing was likely to be only an initial step when he wrote in an order Tuesday that one subject on the agenda will be a discussion of \u201cprocedure for resolution of the motion.\u201d",
      "Also set for discussion are the reasons for the request to dismiss the indictment against the Democrat that charges the first-term mayor with accepting over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy his influence while he was Brooklyn borough president. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Early last week, Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove told prosecutors in New York in a memo to drop the charges because the prosecution \u201chas unduly restricted Mayor Adams\u2019 ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.\u201d He said charges could be reinstated after November's mayoral election.",
      "Two days later, then-interim U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi, saying Bove's request to drop charges in return for assistance in enforcing federal immigration laws would betray Bondi's own words that she \"will not tolerate abuses of the criminal justice process, coercive behavior, or other forms of misconduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cDismissal of the indictment for no other reason than to influence Adams\u2019s mayoral decision-making would be all three,\u201d Sassoon, a Republican, said of what she called a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d deal as she offered to resign. She also said prosecutors were about to bring additional obstruction of justice charges against Adams.",
      "Bove responded to Sassoon with apparent anger, accepting her resignation and accusing her of \u201cpursuing a politically motivated prosecution despite an express instruction to dismiss the case.\u201d He then informed her that two prosecutors assigned to the case were suspended with pay and that an investigation would determine if they keep their jobs.",
      "If either of those prosecutors wished to comply with his directive to dismiss charges, he welcomed them to do so, but Hagan Scotten quit the following day, writing in a resignation letter that he supported Sassoon's actions.",
      "Scotten wrote to Bove that it would take a \u201cfool\u201d or a \u201ccoward\u201d to meet his demand to drop the charges, \u201cbut it was never going to be me.\u201d",
      "In all, seven prosecutors, including five high-ranking prosecutors at the Justice Department in Washington, had resigned by Friday.",
      "Since then, a small army of former prosecutors have gotten behind the defiant stand by Sassoon and other prosecutors.",
      "On Friday, seven former Manhattan U.S. attorneys, including James Comey, Geoffrey S. Berman and Mary Jo White, issued a statement lauding Sassoon\u2019s \u201ccommitment to integrity and the rule of law.\u201d",
      "On Monday, three former U.S. attorneys from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut submitted papers to Ho suggesting that he appoint a special prosecutor if he finds the Justice Department acted improperly or that he order all evidence be made available to state and local prosecutors.",
      "A former Watergate prosecutor filed papers separately, telling the judge to reject the government's request and consider assigning a special counsel to explore the legal issues and ultimately consider appointing an independent special prosecutor to try the case.",
      "Also Monday, Justice Connection, an organization advocating for Justice Department employees, released a letter signed by over 900 former federal prosecutors to career federal prosecutors that said they have \u201cwatched with alarm\u201d as values \u201cfoundational to a fair and justice legal system\u201d have been tested.",
      "In the letter, the former prosecutors said they \u201csalute and admire the courage many of you have already exhibited. You have responded to ethical challenges of a type no public servant should ever be forced to confront with principle and conviction, in the finest traditions of the Department of Justice.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Alex Spiro, a lawyer for the mayor, wrote to the judge, saying those who believed that Adams struck a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d with prosecutors were wrong.",
      "\u201cThere was no quid pro quo. Period,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "The new head of the Social Security Administration says deceased centenarians are \u201cnot necessarily receiving benefits.\"",
      "WASHINGTON -- The new head of the Social Security Administration said Wednesday that deceased centenarians are \u201cnot necessarily receiving benefits,\" contradicting claims that tens of millions of dead people over the age of 100 are getting payments from the agency.",
      "Lee Dudek, the new acting SSA commissioner who was placed in the role by President Donald Trump, gave the clarification after Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk falsely claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly and routinely getting benefits.",
      "While it is true that improper payments have been made, including some to dead people, the numbers thrown out by Trump and Musk are overstated and misrepresent Social Security data.",
      "Here are the facts:",
      "On Tuesday, Trump said at a press briefing in Florida that \u201cwe have millions and millions of people over 100 years old\u201d receiving Social Security benefits. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously fraudulent or incompetent,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cIf you take all of those millions of people off Social Security, all of a sudden we have a very powerful Social Security with people that are 80 and 70 and 90, but not 200 years old,\u201d he said. He also said that there\u2019s one person in the system listed as 360 years old.",
      "Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency is seeking to root out fraud, waste and abuse, issued a slew of posts on his social media platform X on Monday night, including: \u201cMaybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security\u201d and \u201cHaving tens of millions of people marked in Social Security as \u201cALIVE\u201d when they are definitely dead is a HUGE problem. Obviously. Some of these people would have been alive before America existed as a country. Think about that for a second \u2026\u201d",
      "No.",
      "Part of the confusion comes from Social Security\u2019s software system based on the COBOL programming language, which has a lack of date type. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birthdates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago. The news organization WIRED first reported on the use of COBOL programming language at the Social Security Administration.",
      "Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration\u2019s inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these individuals were receiving benefits.",
      "The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million.",
      "A July 2023 Social Security OIG report states that \"almost none of the numberholders discussed in the report currently receive SSA payments.\u201d And, as of September 2015, the agency automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old.",
      "Dudek, who was named acting chief of the Social Security Administration after the resignation of Michelle King, issued a news release Wednesday reiterating the agency's commitment to transparency. The last lines of the note acknowledged recent reporting about people older than 100 receiving benefits from the agency.",
      "He seemed to confirm that confusion had arisen because of the default settings on the database.",
      "\u201cThe reported data are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record. These individuals are not necessarily receiving benefits,\" he said.",
      "\u201cI am confident that with DOGE\u2019s help and the commitment of our executive team and workforce, that Social Security will continue to deliver for the American people,\u201d Dudek said.",
      "A July 2024 report from Social Security\u2019s inspector general states that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, including $71.8 billion \u2014 or less than 1% \u2014 in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people.",
      "In addition, in early January, the U.S. Treasury clawed back more than $31 million in a variety of federal payments\u2014 not just Social Security payments\u2014 that improperly went to dead people, a recovery that former Treasury official David Lebryk said was \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg.\u201d",
      "The money was reclaimed as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Department of Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration\u2019s \u201cFull Death Master File\u201d for three years as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in 2021. The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died, and the file contains more than 142 million records, which go back to 1899, according to the Treasury.",
      "Treasury estimated in January that it would recover more than $215 million during its three-year access period, which runs from December 2023 through 2026.",
      "Chuck Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said, \u201cTwo cheers for Elon Musk if he can root out and put a stop to improper payments.\u201d",
      "But to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, \u201cSocial Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,\u201d Blahous said. \"Medicaid improper payment rates are quite substantial, and soared after the Medicaid expansion of the ACA.\"",
      "\u201cBy all means \u2014 go after any improper payments that are found, but let\u2019s not pretend that\u2019s where the system\u2019s biggest financial problems are,\u201d he said.",
      "Sita Nataraj Slavov, a professor of public policy at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, said the claims by Musk and Trump will make people think the solutions to the government's financial problems are simpler than they appear.",
      "\u201cThe real concern is that this claim may mislead people into thinking there\u2019s an easy fix to Social Security\u2019s financial problems \u2014 that we can somehow restore solvency without making sacrifices through higher taxes or lower benefits,\u201d Slavov said. \u201cThis is simply not true.\u201d",
      "Karoline Leavitt, the White House spokesperson, referred back to the Social Security's inspector general report.",
      "\u201cA previous investigation revealed the SSA paid at least $71.8 billion in improper payments,\u201d she said. \"The Social Security Administration is now working to find even more waste, fraud, and abuse in the Administration\u2019s whole-of-government effort to protect American taxpayers.\u201d",

      "The presidents of the United Steelworkers, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers argue that China's efforts have hurt American workers and national security.",
      "In the letter obtained by The Associated Press, they urged Trump to \u201cimpose tough penalties against vessels built according to the plans, policies, and actions of the Chinese Communist Party and to adopt complementary policies that rebuild America's shipbuilding capacity and workforce.\u201d",
      "Last year under President Joe Biden, the unions filed a petition seeking to address China\u2019s shipbuilding under Section 301 of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act, hoping to start a process by which tariffs and other measures could be enacted.",
      "The letter notes China manufactured more than 1,000 ocean-going vessels in 2023, while the United States made fewer than 10 ships. It adds that the Chinese shipbuilding industry received more than $100 billion in government support from 2010 to 2018, such that Chinese shipyards accounted for the majority of worldwide orders last year.",
      "\u201cAs a shipyard worker myself, out of Bath Iron Works in Maine, I have seen firsthand the crippling impacts of China\u2019s predatory actions on our domestic shipbuilding industry,\u201d Brian Bryant, the machinists and aerospace workers union president, said in a separate statement. \u201cFor decades, we\u2019ve seen everything from layoffs to shipyard closures to atrophy of our domestic shipbuilding industrial base.",
      "Trump has made control of the Panama Canal and resetting the global terms of trade with tariffs a key priority. But many of his concerns have been directed at U.S. allies such as Canada, Mexico and the European Union, while he has imposed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China due to its role in making the opioid fentanyl.",
      "In January, Trump floated the possibility of more shipbuilding in an interview with Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio talk show host.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t build ships anymore,\" Trump said. \"We want to get that started. And maybe we\u2019ll use allies, also, in terms of building ships. We might have to.\u201d",
      "In a Fox News Channel interview that aired Tuesday night, Trump noted the decline in American shipbuilding and indicated he wanted that to change.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t build the way we used to build. Yeah, we used to build like a ship a day, and now to build a ship is like a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to get this country back on track.\u201d",

      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune has teed up a vote on a budget plan that sets the stage for a massive boost in defense and border security spending, and leaves a looming tax cut fight for later this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader John Thune teed up a vote this week on a budget plan that sets the stage for a massive boost in defense and border security spending, and leaves a looming tax cut fight for later this year.",
      "The move is designed to give President Donald Trump an early policy win and put pressure on House Republicans to join rather than pursue a separate, more comprehensive effort that also risks taking far longer to pass, if at all.",
      "Trump undercut the Senate GOP's efforts on Wednesday, calling on both chambers to pass the House budget resolution. \u201cThe House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it,\u201d Trump wrote on social media.",
      "Yet Thune is proceeding as planned, despite Trump's stated preference for the House effort.",
      "\u201cIf the House can produce one big beautiful bill, we're prepared to work with them to get that across the finish line, but we believe the president also likes optionality,\" Thune said.",
      "The resolution is not a bill and does not get signed into law by the president, but its passage unlocks a process that allows Republicans to enact their priorities later this year even if Democrats unanimously oppose it.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "The budget resolution, authored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, sets the stage for about $342 billion in increased spending on border security, defense and the Coast Guard.",
      "Graham said the spending would take place over four years and be paid for with reduced spending elsewhere in the federal government, though the resolution itself does not specify how those cuts would occur.",
      "The budget resolution advanced out of committee last week on a party-line vote. It directs the Senate Homeland Security Committee to increase spending by up to $175 billion, the Senate Armed Services Committee to spend up to $150 billion more and the Senate Commerce panel to increase spending by about $20 billion. This is on top of the annual spending that Congress provides through a separate legislative process.",
      "\u201cBuild the wall, deport illegal aliens, and create additional detention space so we don\u2019t have to release illegal immigrants into the community,\" Graham said. \u201cAnd God knows the military needs more money in these dangerous times.\u201d",
      "The Senate proceeded to Graham's budget plan on Tuesday evening, opening it up to 50 hours of debate. Once the debate time has expired \u2014 but before a vote on final passage \u2014 senators will hold what's known in Congress as a \u201cvote-arama.\u201d It's a whirlwind series of votes over several hours in which senators seek to amend the plan.",
      "The votes often last into the early morning hours before exhausted lawmakers decide they've had enough and move to a final vote.",
      "The amendments often are designed to force lawmakers from the other party to take difficult votes on hot-button issues that could prove difficult to explain in the next election cycle.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said Republicans should \"get ready for a late night and an early morning.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are going to make sure the people back home know that Elon Musk is firing VA doctors and food safety inspectors \u2014 for no cause whatsoever \u2014 and illegally defunding the programs that Americans care about,\" Murray said.",
      "Once a budget plan is approved, committees would draft legislation consistent with their instructions to find savings or increase spending in programs under their jurisdiction. But the formal work needed to advance those recommendations can't take place until both the House and Senate pass identical budget plans.",
      "At some point, Republicans in the House and Senate will have to resolve their differences for them to use the tool that will allow the package to pass with a simple majority in the Senate and sidestep a Democratic filibuster. For now, they are competing with each other to win Trump's favor.",
      "The House does have momentum for its efforts after a few weeks of delay. The chamber's Budget panel has advanced its more comprehensive budget plan to the floor on a party-line vote.

      "Their plan would allow committees to provide for up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $300 billion in new spending. It would also instruct committees to make at least $1.5 trillion in spending reductions elsewhere in the federal government over the next decade. And it would lift the debt ceiling so that the U.S. can borrow and continue paying its bills.",
      "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog, estimates that the House budget plan would allow for a nearly $4 trillion debt increase over the next decade.",
      "Johnson can spare only one defection if Democrats are unanimous in opposing the plan next week, creating a high-wire act for his leadership team.",
      "Some Republicans have raised concerns about the level of spending cuts that could occur with programs like Medicaid. But those lawmakers will also feel pressure to help Trump enact his priorities or face his wrath for not going along.",

      "Senate Republicans are pushing ahead with their $340 billion budget bill focused on funding the White House\u2019s mass deportations and border security agenda",
      "WASHINGTON -- Back on track, Senate Republicans pushed ahead Wednesday with their $340 billion budget bill focused on funding the White House's mass deportations and border security agenda after Vice President JD Vance gave a green light to proceed despite a morning dust-up caused by President Donald Trump.",
      "The package was in jeopardy after Trump publicly bashed the approach from the Senate Budget Committee chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Trump said he favored the \u201cbig beautiful bill\u201d from House Republicans, a more politically fraught package that includes $4.5 trillion in tax cuts but slashes government programs and services. Senators want to address those priorities later, in a second package.",
      "\u201cWe are moving forward,\u201d said Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the GOP whip, after a lunch meeting with Vance at the Capitol. \u201cFoot on the gas, moving forward.\u201d",
      "The start-stop process is complicating what's already a heavy legislative lift for Republicans, who have a rare sweep of power with majority control of Congress, but face big hurdles enacting Trump's agenda as Democrats prepare to counter with steep objections at every step.",
      "Ongoing GOP divisions over whether to do one package or two \u2014 the House thinks they can only muscle one package to passage, while the Senate believes two will be easier \u2014 has created a push-pull dynamic that Trump is leveraging as he goads the two chambers of Congress to compete with each other.",
      "Trump, in his own private talks with the senators, including last weekend at Mar-a-Lago, has essentially told them just to \u201cget the result.\u201d",
      "It all comes as Democrats, without the votes to stop Trump's plans, are warning Americans what's at stake \u2014 particularly as the administration's Department of Government Efficiency effort is slashing across government departments, leaving a trail of fired federal workers and dismantling programs on which many Americans depend.",
      "\u201cThese bills that they have have one purpose \u2014 and that is they\u2019re trying to give a tax break to their billionaire buddies and have you, the average American person, pay for it,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York told The Associated Press.",
      "Schumer convened a private call over the weekend with Democratic senators and agreed on a strategy to challenge Republicans for prioritizing tax cuts that primarily flow to the wealthy at the expense of program and service reductions in health care, scientific research, veterans services and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be a long, drawn-out fight,\u201d Schumer said later.",
      "With a party line vote, 50-47, the Senate launched the cumbersome budget process late Tuesday and by Wednesday was slogging through an initial 50 hours of debate. That all leads up to an expected all-night session Thursday with rapid-fire attempts to amend the package in what's typically called a \u201cvote-a-rama.\u201d",
      "The Republican package would allow $175 billion to be spent on border security, including money for mass deportation operations and building the U.S.-Mexico border wall, in addition to a $150 billion boost to the Pentagon and $20 billion for the Coast Guard.",
      "Trump border czar Tom Homan and top aide Stephen Miller told senators privately last week that they are running short of cash to accomplish the president's immigration and deportation priorities, spurring Republicans to move swiftly.",
      "Eyeing ways to pay for it, Republican senators are considering a rollback of the Biden administration\u2019s methane emissions fee, which was approved by Democrats as part of climate change strategies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and hoping to draw new revenue from energy leases as they aim to spur domestic energy production.",
      "But all that was in jeopardy when Trump said early Wednesday he wanted the House\u2019s version passed as a way to \u201ckickstart\u201d the process and \u201cmove all of our priorities to the concept of, \u2018ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL.\u2019\u201d",
      "Trump said, \u201cUnlike the Lindsey Graham version of the very important Legislation currently being discussed, the House Resolution implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of it!\u201d",
      "The Senate\u2019s Republican leadership was blindsided by the post.",
      "\u201cAs they say, I did not see that one coming,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.",
      "Thune had engineered the two-bill approach as a way to deliver an early victory for the White House and had pushed the Senate forward while the House is away on recess this week, saying it was time to act.",
      "By lunchtime, after Vance met with the senators, his message was for them to simply carry on.",
      "Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said afterward that Vance told them: \u201cThe president wants whatever you guys want. Just do whatever you want. He\u2019s going to support it.\"",
      "Cramer said Trump enjoys watching the House and Senate compete over his agenda.",
      "The House GOP bill is multiple times larger, with $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $1.5 trillion in spending reductions over the decade across Medicaid health care programs, food stamps and other services used by large swaths of the country. The cuts could ultimately grow to $2 trillion to appease hard-right conservatives.",
      "The budget plans are being considered under what's called the reconciliation process, which allows passage on a simple majority vote without many of the procedural hurdles that stall legislation. Once rare, reconciliation is increasingly being used in the House and Senate to pass big packages on party-line votes when one party controls the White House and Congress.",
      "During Trump's first term, Republicans used the reconciliation process to pass GOP tax cuts in 2017. Democrats used reconciliation during the Biden presidency era to approve COVID relief and the Inflation Reduction Act."

      "An Internal Revenue Service agent has been acquitted of involuntary manslaughter of a U.S. officer in the shooting death of a fellow agent after a training session at an Arizona gun range",
      "PHOENIX -- An Internal Revenue Service agent was acquitted Wednesday of involuntary manslaughter of a U.S. officer in the shooting death of a fellow agent after a training session at an Arizona gun range.",
      "Prosecutors said Larry Edward Brown Jr. handled his gun with reckless disregard for human life when he shot IRS Special Agent Patrick Bauer on Aug. 17, 2023.",
      "Brown, who cried when the verdict was announced, offered his \u201csincerest condolences to the Bauer family\u201d in a statement issued through his attorneys. \u201cPat was a great man,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHe was a mentor and like a brother to me. I miss him every day.\u201d",
      "Outside the courtroom, several of Bauer\u2019s loved ones sobbed and one woman threw her purse at the wall.",
      "The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Arizona, which prosecuted the case, said in a statement, \u201cWe remain supportive of Agent Bauer\u2019s family in this difficult time, proud of our team for seeking justice, and respectful of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Jurors deliberated for about an hour and 45 minutes before delivering the verdict.",
      "The shooting occurred in a one-room building at a gun range at the Federal Correctional Institution in Phoenix, where Bauer had just finished overseeing standard live-fire pistol qualification exercises. Sixteen IRS criminal investigators, who examine violations of tax, money laundering and other federal laws, had taken part in the pistol qualification and classroom exercises at the complex.",
      "After the session ended, another IRS agent left the building to get his phone and heard a gunshot seconds later. The indictment says the agent saw Brown, a defensive tactics instructor, running out and yelling that he had messed up and shot Bauer, who died during surgery. He had been shot in the upper torso. No one else was in the building at the time.",
      "After the shooting, Brown was taken to a different medical center, where he was diagnosed with an acute stress reaction. While at the hospital, the indictment alleged, Brown repeatedly said out loud, \u201cI am a use of force instructor. I should know better.\u201d FBI Agent Taylor Hannah has been identified in court records as the person who said she heard Brown make that comment, but Brown\u2019s lawyers said their client never said those words.",
      "Prosecutors said Bauer\u2019s death was preventable. They said Brown violated fundamental firearms safety rules, such as always treating a gun as if it\u2019s loaded, keeping its muzzle pointed in a safe direction and refraining from touching its trigger until ready to fire.",
      "Brown pleaded not guilty. His lawyers said Bauer\u2019s death was a terrible accident, that the agents were friends and that Brown came to Bauer\u2019s aid, including by calling 911, forming a chest seal to maintain the function of Bauer's lungs, and asking other federal officers at the complex for help.",
      "Dr. Kenji Inaba, a medical expert hired on behalf of Brown, said in a report that Bauer would have more likely than not survived his injuries had he been taken to the hospital sooner.",
      "The ambulance that transported Bauer to the hospital left the scene about 25 minutes after the shooting, and it took another 14 minutes to get to the hospital, Inaba said.",
      "Inaba suggested federal agents who had medical training could have transported Bauer to the hospital instead of waiting for an ambulance in a location that doesn\u2019t have a trauma center nearby.",
      "Prosecutors said Bauer may still have died, even with standard care and no delays. They said Bauer was killed by a bullet negligently fired from Brown\u2019s gun, not by medical negligence."

      "Chancery Judge Crystal Wise Martin issued the restraining order against the Clarksdale Press Register on Tuesday in connection with a Feb. 8 editorial titled \u201cSecrecy, Deception Erode Public Trust.\" The piece criticized the city for not sending the newspaper notice about a meeting the City Council held regarding a proposed tax on alcohol, marijuana and tobacco.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s dangerous that a judge would issue a temporary restraining order without a hearing,\u201d said Wyatt Emmerich, president of the paper's parent company, Emmerich Newspapers. \u201cWe\u2019ll fight it and see where it goes.\u201d",
      "The city's lawsuit called the editorial libelous and said it \u201cchilled and hindered\u201d the city's efforts to lobby for the tax with state legislators.",
      "The editorial was no longer available on the newspaper's website by Wednesday afternoon. Martin scheduled a Feb. 27 hearing in the case.",

In 2023, a Kansas police department raided a newspaper's office and the home of its owner and publisher after claiming the paper and a reporter potentially committed identity theft and other computer crimes in obtaining and verifying information about a local business owner\u2019s driving record. The raid was later investigated and the former police chief who led it was charged last year with obstruction of justice."

      "SAN DIEGO -- Children so young their feet can't touch the floor when they sit in courtroom chairs have been left without representation in immigration court because of Trump administration cuts, according to organizations that help these kids navigate the legal system when they arrive in the U.S. without a parent or guardian.",
      "The organizations say the children are at risk because the Trump administration suspended a key program late Tuesday, ordering that the Acacia Center for Justice and its subcontractors immediately stop work on a $200 million contract to provide representation for children entering the country alone.",
      "Daniela Hernandez, an immigration attorney who provides free legal services to about 60 children in Pasadena, California, said during a news conference Wednesday that some of her clients \u2014 who are as young as 2 \u2014 have court hearings as soon as Friday.",
      "\u201cWhat is this 2-year-old client supposed to do without her attorney?\" she said. \"Who will speak for her in court? Who will explain to her and all of our other clients in foster care who have not only nobody, no adult in the United States to care for them, that they will now have to navigate a very complex legal immigration system on their own?\u201d",
      "The Interior Department gave no explanation for the stop-work order, telling the group only that it was done for \u201ccauses outside of your control\u201d and should not be interpreted as a judgment of poor performance. The halt remains in effect until further notice.",

The Department of Health and Human Services Department, which oversees unaccompanied migrant children, did not respond to requests for comment.",

      "As the girl drew, the judge explained the case to her, her 13-year-old sister and her 15-year-old brother. All three children were arrested for crossing the border illegally, without their parents, in March 2024. Their mother attended the hearing -- she entered the U.S. at a different time than her children, who have their own immigration cases.",

      "Acacia has a network of 85 organizations nationwide that work with children under 18. About 26,000 migrant children get direct legal representation under the contract while roughly 100,000 get some kind of legal advice, often through presentations lawyers hold for children while they are in government-run shelters just after arriving in the U.S.",
      "People fighting deportation do not have the same right to representation as people going through criminal courts, although they can hire private attorneys.",
      "But there has been some recognition that children navigating the immigration court system without a parent or guardian are especially vulnerable.",
      "The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2008 created special protections for children who arrive in the U.S. without a parent or a legal guardian. It said the government should facilitate legal representation for the children put into deportation proceedings, though it did not mandate every child have a lawyer.",
      "Acacia and its subcontractors recruit and train lawyers and work with private attorneys who provide free legal representation for the children.",
      "Unaccompanied children can request asylum, juvenile immigration status, or visas for victims of sexual exploitation. Most of the children don\u2019t speak English and need interpreters.",

      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is planning to endorse a statewide ban on cellular devices in public schools",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is aiming to improve student achievement, social interaction and the mental health of public school students by proposing a statewide ban on cellphones in classrooms, an idea that is rapidly gaining traction nationally regardless of political persuasion.",
      "The Democrat's top education aide, Martin Torres, said Pritzker is expected to endorse \u201cscreen-free schools\u201d during his combined State of the State/Budget address at noon Wednesday.",
      "Legislation introduced in both houses of the General Assembly would require school districts to set policies that ban personal wireless devices during class time, with notable exceptions, create a means for secure but accessible storage of phones and tablets, and review those guidelines at least every three years.",
      "Eight states have policies that ban or limit schoolhouse cellphone use. Indiana, Minnesota, Ohio. Iowa, Kentucky and Michigan are among the 15 states where bans or other restrictions have been proposed.",
      "The Pew Research Center has found that seven in 10 high school teachers in the U.S. consider cellphone distraction a major classroom problem.",
      "Torres, Pritzker's deputy governor for education, told The Associated Press that at least 10 Illinois school districts have adopted screen-free policies, and they have had positive results.",
      "\u201cStudents are more engaged, they\u2019re more attentive in class. There\u2019s improved participation in classroom dynamics,\u201d Torres said. \u201cThis is a proposal that\u2019s going to help teachers with instruction. It\u2019s going to reduce screen time. It\u2019s going to reduce social media exposure. And there\u2019s research that suggests that social media is linked with anxiety, depression, body dissatisfaction.\u201d",
      "The legislation, which would require policies be in place by the 2026-2027 school year, has enough flexibility in the plan to allow school districts to develop a policy that best suits them.",
      "Pritzker's idea is to ban wireless devices during instructional periods unless there is an emergency or a need to respond to a threat. They would also be allowed when a teacher approves their use, when a physician deems it essential for a student, for an individual special education plan or to help English learners.",
      "This school year, Peoria schools adopted a plan in which each student is issued a neoprene pouch with a magnetized lock that only teachers or administrators can open. Midway through the school year, a survey of 8,000 students from grades 5 to 12 found they had more focus, more engagement and reduced distractions, Superintendent Sharon Desmoulin-Kherat said.",
      "She said that in an email, a teacher reported: \u201cI am looking into students' eyes who have never looked up from a screen before.\u201d",
      "Illinois was way ahead of the curve on the issue, but it then backpedaled. Legislation banned cellphones as early as the 1990s when cellular devices were new, expensive and thought to be the domain of drug dealers. As technology improved, they were seen as vital links to the outside, particularly family, and in 2002, the Legislature reversed itself and approved their presence in schools.",
      "Despite being turned off and locked up, Peoria students retain ready access when necessary, Desmoulin-Kherat said, noting one of the few concerns parents had was being able to reach their children in an emergency.",
      "\u201cJust like the old days, you can call the office,\u201d Desmoulin-Kherat said. \u201cYou can send an email. You don't need a cellphone to be able to communicate with your family.\u201d"

      "Pressed on the fate of the agency\u2019s core initiatives, McMahon said Trump wants them to be more efficient but isn\u2019t out to defund them. She suggested certain roles could be moved to other agencies, saying the department\u2019s civil rights arm could go to the Justice Department.",
      "She pledged to preserve federal Title I money for low-income schools, Pell grants for low-income college students and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, all of which were created by Congress.",

She was a member of the Connecticut board of education for about a year in 2009, and she\u2019s a longtime trustee at Sacred Heart University. She left the WWE in 2009 and led two unsuccessful bids for the U.S. Senate in Connecticut.",
      "Republicans were mostly unified behind McMahon at the hearing, though Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska raised concerns that Trump would ask McMahon to overstep her authority and interfere with local control of schools.",
      "The White House is considering an order that would direct the education secretary to dismantle the Education Department while urging Congress to fully abolish it.",

      "The move, carrying out a Jan. 20 executive order by President Donald Trump, names Tren de Aragua in Venezuela, MS-13 in El Salvador and others. The designation will be published in Thursday\u2019s edition of the Federal Register, according to a notice Wednesday.",

The notification is due for formal publication in the federal register Thursday.",

      "Federal Reserve officials at a meeting last month pointed to rising risks that inflation could worsen, a key reason they kept their benchmark interest rate unchanged",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials at a meeting last month pointed to rising risks that inflation could worsen, a key reason they kept their benchmark interest rate unchanged.",
      "According to minutes of the Jan. 28-29 meeting, which were released Wednesday, Fed officials said that President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs and mass deportations of migrants, as well as strong consumer spending, were factors that could push inflation higher this year.",
      "The Fed's 19 officials who participate in its interest-rate decisions indicated that \u201cthey would want to see further progress on inflation before making\u201d any further cuts. They kept the Fed's key rate at 4.3%, after cutting it from a two-decade high of 5.3% late last year. The Fed's pause makes it less likely that borrowing costs for consumers, including for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, will decline anytime soon.",
      "Just last week, the government released data that suggested inflation was actually getting worse, leading many economists to forecast just one \u2014 if any \u2014 rate cut this year. Consumer prices rose 3% in January from a year ago, the Labor Department said, up from a 3 1/2 year low of 2.4% last September. The Fed, however, more closely follows a separate inflation measure that is shows inflation is closer to 2.5%.",
      "The minutes also cited a \u201chigh degree of uncertainty\u201d surrounding the economy, which made it appropriate for the Fed to \u201ctake a careful approach\u201d in considering any further changes to its key interest rate.",
      "All of the Fed's policymakers supported keeping its key rate unchanged last month, the minutes said. The unanimity comes after signs of a growing disagreement in recent months between those officials who supported further rate reductions and those more worried about stubborn inflation.",
      "A key issue, particularly on Wall Street, is how long the Fed\u2019s pause on rate cuts will last. Wall Street investors expect the central bank won\u2019t cut again until July, according to futures prices. They don\u2019t forecast a second cut until 2026.",
      "Many Fed officials have also said they want to see how Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs and immigration crackdown affect the economy. Most economists forecast that the tariffs will push up inflation, though some also argue that Trump\u2019s promises to reduce regulation could lower consumer prices over time.",
      "On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said in a speech in Australia that he still expects rates to come down this year, but for now he supports a pause.",
      "Waller said that if the inflation uptick last month turns out to be a blip, as it did in January 2024, \u201crate cuts would be appropriate at some point this year.\u201d",
      "Waller also said that he didn't think new tariffs would significantly raise inflation, and added that any increase in prices would likely be temporary. As a result, he said the Fed shouldn't necessarily change its policies because of tariffs.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t altered my outlook based on what has been implemented to date,\u201d he said, referring to Trump's tariff announcements."

      "The two countries \u2014 the primary players in global development \u2014 are spending foreign assistance differently. Most Chinese money is issued as debt and typically spent on energy and infrastructure projects.",

      "In Peru, Chinese money helped build the $1.3 billion megaport in Chancay, which opened in November during a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping. U.S. foreign aid in Peru, by contrast, was used to finance coffee and cacao as alternatives to cocaine production.",
      "Elsewhere, American dollars helped fight HIV/AIDS in Africa, treated malnourished children in South Sudan and provided medical services at an immigrant shelter in Mexico.",
      "Acknowledging that the U.S. should fund tangible foreign projects like ports and factories, Congress in 2018 established an institution to combine government funding with private investments for projects such as the trans-Africa rail project in Angola.",
      "Overall, China spent $1.34 trillion on nearly 18,000 overseas development projects between 2000 and 2021, averaging about $61 billion a year, AidData said.",
      "The U.S. disbursed $1.24 trillion in foreign aid, including military assistance, between 2001 and 2023, the research lab said.",
      "USAID, created during the Cold War to counter Soviet influence, is the single largest U.S. government player in foreign aid. It paid out $43.8 billion in 2023, AidData said. That is equivalent to less than 1% of total annual government spending.",
      "Because of the differences in the types of projects funded, China is unlikely to step in as the U.S. retreats, but Beijing still wins because foreign aid is about building relationships and goodwill, said Samantha Custer, director of policy analysis at AidData.",
      "\u201cThese countries are watching the U.S. and how it engages with its partners and its workers, and they're making determinations as to whether the U.S. is a reliable economic and security partner, and increasingly there are concerns that we are not,\u201d Custer said.",

      "New York-based China Labor Watch, which monitors labor conditions and investigates practices such as the use of forced labor in China, relies on U.S. funding for about 90% of its budget, and the aid freeze has forced the group to lay off or put on unpaid leave most of its U.S. staff, group founder Li Qiang said.",

      "BELCOURT, N.D. -- Native American activist Leonard Peltier was defiant toward the government but grateful for his supporters as they welcomed him home to North Dakota on Wednesday, a day after his release from a Florida prison where he had been serving a life sentence in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents.",
      "Peltier, 80, grew emotional as he addressed about 500 people who gathered at the festive event that included food, a drum circle and dancers at a center in Belcourt. The small town is just south of the Canadian border on the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians' reservation.",

      "Then-President Joe Biden commuted Peltier's life sentence to home confinement, leading to his release Tuesday from the Coleman penitentiary. Peltier was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and given two consecutive life sentences stemming from a 1975 confrontation on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.",
      "FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were killed, and while Peltier acknowledged firing shots during the confrontation, he denied being the person whose shots killed the men. Native Americans widely believe he was a political prisoner who was wrongly convicted because he fought for Indigenous rights as a member of the American Indian Movement.",
      "For years, many in law enforcement argued against freeing Peltier. Current and former FBI agents disputed his claims of innocence. As Biden considered his options as his term ended, former FBI Director Christopher Wray sent the president a letter in which he called Peltier \u201ca remorseless killer\u201d who should remain in prison.",
      "In a statement about the commutation, Biden said numerous individuals and groups supported releasing Peltier due to the time he spent in prison, his age and his leadership role among Native Americans.",
      "For decades, Peltier has maintained he was innocent of the murder charges, and he said Wednesday: \u201cI spent 49 years straight in prison for something I didn't do.\u201d",
      "Peltier said he went into prison a young man and emerged far older at age 80. During all that time, Peltier said he tried to keep Native American issues in the forefront of his activism, and he thanked tribes across the nation for their decades of support.",
      "\u201cFrom day one, from the first hour I was arrested, Indian people came to my rescue, from all over the country,\u201d Peltier said.",
      "Tribal leaders presented Peltier with an eagle feather staff that supporters had carried to Washington, D.C., and other places as they campaigned for his release, and a traditional star quilt that Peltier draped over his shoulder.",
      "Nick Tilsen, an Oglala Lakota and founder of the NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led advocacy group, paid tribute to Peltier and his generation of American Indian Movement leaders for standing up \u201cagainst the most powerful government in the world. And they instilled that pride back into our people. They instilled that fight back into our people.\"",
      "\"All around the world, Leonard Peltier\u2019s name will be remembered as a warrior, as a warrior who outlasted one of the strongest governments in the world, and came out victorious.\"",
      "Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Tribal Chair Jamie Azure said the welcome shown by hundreds of people at the event was a testament to what he means to the tribe and other Native Americans.",
      "\u201cWhat I think you can see from the turnout here today, it means a lot to a lot of people on a lot of different levels to see Mr. Peltier come back to his homeland, to just be home,\u201d Azure said.",

    "story": [
      "American shoppers may face higher prices if US President Donald Trump goes ahead with some of his proposed tariffs, the US central bank has warned.",
      "Minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting released on Wednesday revealed members of its committee believe Trump's policies might \"hinder the disinflation process\".",
      "\"Business contacts in a number of districts had indicated that firms would attempt to pass on to consumers higher input costs arising from potential tariffs,\" the minutes said.",
      "The release of the comments comes as the Fed faces criticism from Trump for not cutting interest rates sooner after leaving rates unchanged in the January meeting.",
      "The Fed minutes also revealed \"elevated uncertainty regarding the scope, timing, and potential economic effects of possible changes to trade, immigration, fiscal, and regulatory policies\".",
      "\"A couple of participants remarked that, in the period ahead, it might be especially difficult to distinguish between relatively persistent changes in inflation and more temporary changes that might be associated with the introduction of new government policies,\" the minutes added.",
      "The Fed minutes also showed the central bank's readiness to hold rates steady amid stubborn inflation and economic-policy uncertainty.",
      "The central bank left the key interest rate unchanged in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% in the January meeting, hitting pause after a string of cuts late last year.",
      "The Fed's chair Jerome Powell has previously said the bank was not \"in a hurry\" to cut more, given significant uncertainty about where the economy might be headed",
      "Analysts predict the Fed will likely cut the benchmark interest rate only once in 2025, with a big possibility of no rate cuts at all.",
      "Trump attacks Fed after no change in interest rates",
      "Trump's campaign promises included calls for lower interest rates, which would bring relief to borrowers.",
      "It has sparked debate about whether he will respect the tradition of Fed independence, which is meant to keep it focused on the long term health of the US economy and away from politics.",
      "Mr Powell previously told reporters that he had had \"no contact\" with Trump and the bank was focused on the data in setting rates.",
      "But questions Powell faced about how the Fed is handling a new order from the White House to cancel diversity programmes - and why it had withdrawn from a global group of central banks focused on the risks of climate change to the financial system - underscored the challenges he will face keeping the bank above the political fray."

    "story": [
      "Last spring, when tens of thousands of Georgians were protesting against what they saw as a clear sign of Russian influence on the country's politics, Georgia's parliament rushed through amendments to the nation's tax code.",

      "He is the founder and honorary chairman of the country's ruling party, Georgian Dream.",
      "\"Now it is clear, those changes were made for him,\" says senior economics analyst at TI Georgia, Beso Namchavadze.",
      "With an estimated wealth of $4.9bn (\u00a33.9bn), Mr Ivanishvili made his money in 1990s Russia, in computing, metals and banking. Most of his wealth is believed to be tucked away in offshore companies.",
      "Georgia was plunged into political crisis and daily street protests last May when the country's MPs passed the contentious \"transparency on foreign influence bill\", often dubbed the \"foreign agents law\".",
      "Under this legislation, media and non-governmental organisations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad have to register as \"organisations acting in the interest of a foreign power\", submit themselves to stringent audits, or face punitive fines. It was widely seen as a move to prevent US and other Western influence on the country.",
      "Protests then continued when the Georgian Dream-led government won disputed parliamentary elections in October. Protests were spurred again at the start of December when it said it would be putting EU accession talks on hold.",
      "Hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested and severely beaten up by the police.",
      "In response to this crackdown, the US government announced sanctions against Mr Ivanishvili at the end of last year.",
      "There is also the possibility of sanctions from the UK. Last month James MacClearly, a Liberal Democrat MP, introduced an Early Day Motion in the UK parliament calling on the government to impose sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili.",
      "The motion expressed \"deep concern at the suspension of Georgia's EU accession process and the increasing use of excessive force against peaceful protesters\".",
      "TI Georgia estimates that if the UK imposed sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili his entire business empire would be affected, because he has holding companies registered in two British Overseas Territories - British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands.",

      "The US sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili call for his assets to be frozen, and place restrictions on US citizens and companies from doing business personally with him, but they do not affect his companies or family members.",
      "For more than a decade Mr Ivanishvili has been involved in legal battles with another Swiss bank, Credit Suisse, over fraud and mismanagement of his money.",

      "Salon owners are warning they might not be able to take on any new apprentices within two years due to financial pressures.",
      "The British Hair Consortium, which represents 50,000 hairdressing professionals, is calling on the government to make changes to how they are taxed, saying the current system poses an \"existential crisis\".",
      "Apprentices have told BBC Newsbeat the schemes are an important opportunity for people who don't want to pursue further education.",
      "The government has been approached for comment but did not respond.",
      "Salons pay VAT at 20% like most businesses but the British Hair Consortium say because the work they do is so labour intensive as opposed to selling products, they have less of a chance to make back those costs.",
      "So to keep costs low, it says an increasing number of salons are opting to rent chairs instead of employing stylists to avoid paying the tax.",
      "A report by CBI Economics found that is likely to have a knock-on effect on opportunities for apprentices.",
      "It estimates that by 2027 there \"may be no new apprenticeships offered and direct employment could plummet by 93% by 2030\".",
      "'Crippling a lot of salons'",
      "For 22-year-old apprentice Alex Ritchie, \"it's quite scary knowing that people won't get that opportunity that we get\".",
      "She's training in Darlington, County Durham, and dreams of having her own salon one day but worries that without apprentices, the industry will really struggle.",
      "\"You can't run a salon without having apprentices,\" she says.",
      "\"They are your main support when you're doing clients. It will have a massive impact on the amount of salons and how many clients they can take.\"",
      "Jezz Ellis is head of operations for Saks, a chain of salons, and says that unless things change, hairdressing apprenticeships will become less attractive.",
      "Salons are facing a \"perfect storm\" he says, which will impact how many apprentices they can afford to train.",
      "\"You've got the VAT issue which has always been difficult.\"",
      "But there is also the growing issue of insecure or \"disguised\" employment resulting from fewer staff jobs being offered.",
      "This means while they might work to a salon's rules and be treated like an employee, they're actually self-employed so miss out on benefits like sick pay, maternity pay and pensions.",
      "\"And with National Insurance going up and a national minimum wage increase, it's making it very difficult for those salons to increase their prices to meet the extra costs.",
      "\"All of those things added together is just crippling a lot of salons,\" Jezz says.",
      "For Adam Hussain, who's working towards his level two apprenticeship in hairdressing, the benefits are big for people like him.",
      "\"Without this apprenticeship, I wouldn't be where I am today,\" he says. \"I'd probably be doing God knows what.",

      "Thames Water has won a crucial High Court battle to secure a \u00a33bn rescue loan, staving off the prospect of the debt-laden company coming under government control.",
      "The UK's largest water and waste company was set to run out of cash by the end of March and would have likely been placed into temporary nationalisation to keep services running.",
      "The court decision on Tuesday has given Thames breathing space to undergo a major restructuring, but the future of the company remains uncertain as it struggles with \u00a319bn worth of debt and the ruling is set to be appealed.",
      "Thames has faced heavy criticism over its performance in recent years following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "The supplier serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people.",
      "Since the dire state of the company's finances first emerged about 18 months ago, the government has been on standby to put Thames into special administration.",
      "Regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies and waste services to households will continue as normal.",
      "The water regulator, Ofwat, said Thames Water remained \"subject to our turnaround oversight regime and safeguards are in place to ensure that services to customers are protected\".",
      "Thames has said the \u00a33bn in emergency funding will give it the space needed to complete a restructuring of its debts and attract a cash injection from prospective new investors.",
      "But the proposals had to be approved by the High Court after a group of Thames Water's creditors opposed it, arguing that the 9.75% interest rate on the loan was too costly.",
      "In approving the lifeline, Mr Justice Leech ruled that the \"relevant alternative\" to the company's plan being approved was temporary nationalisation, known as a Special Administration Regime.",
      "\"After taking into account the public interest in ensuring the uninterrupted provision of vital public services, I nevertheless exercise my discretion to sanction the plan,\" he said.",
      "He also added that Ofwat and the Environment Secretary had \"not opposed the plan\".",

      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "How much sewage is released into lakes, rivers and the sea?",
      "The Thames Water creditors in favour of the company's plan said the judgement was a \"positive step towards efforts to deliver a highly complex operational turnaround and restructuring\" and avoided \"billions in additional costs on UK taxpayers\".",
      "However, the group of creditors opposed to the deal confirmed they would appeal against the court's decision, after the judge granted them permission to do so.",
      "The group had argued an alternative \"B plan\" would provide the company with the same funding but on better terms and said it was \"disappointed\" by the ruling.",
      "\"Having this judgement reviewed by the Court of Appeal is essential against the backdrop of predatory lending to an essential utility with a clear public interest,\" a spokesperson said.",

      "Henry Swithinbank, policy and advocacy manager at environmental charity Surfers Against Sewage, said the cash lifeline was a \"sticking plaster that will allow Thames Water to limp along until it requires another bailout\".",
      "Thames Water's problems have been blamed on a combination of poor historical regulation, actions by shareholders, climate change and management failure.",
      "Some have argued Thames should have been allowed to collapse and be nationalised due to it being the architect of its own misfortune. Previous owners loaded the company with debt and took out big dividends.",
      "But others, including water companies, have argued that a growing population and the challenges of a changing climate mean bills need to be higher and were kept at lower levels for too long.",
      "The first \u00a31.5bn of the rescue loans to Thames Water will see the company through to the autumn.",
      "A second instalment will be used to fund the company as it appeals a decision by Ofwat over how much Thames can raise household bills by \u2013 a process which could take up to a year.",
      "The company was set to repay \u00a3200m worth of debt due in March, but following the court ruling, all its debt repayments have been extended by two years.",
      "Last week, Thames launched an appeal to allow it to increase bills by more than the regulator had granted.",
      "Ofwat has capped bill rises at 35% over the next five years, but Thames has argued they need to increase by 53%.",
      "Five other water companies - Anglian Water, Northumbrian Water, Southern Water, and Wessex Water along with water-only company South East Water - have also said they will appeal to allow them to increase bills beyond Ofwat's cap.",
      "In total, the six companies serve more than half of all households in England.",
      "David Henderson, chief executive of the trade association Water UK said the extra money is need for water infrastructure investment.",
      "Six firms have said they will not appeal: Severn Trent, United Utilities, Pennon plus Dwr Cymru Welsh Water, SES and Hafren."

    "story": [
      "Domestic energy prices are forecast to rise by 5% from April, adding \u00a385 a year to household bills, according to consultancy Cornwall Insight.",
      "The forecaster, which is widely regarded for its accurate predictions, said a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity would pay \u00a31,823 a year.",
      "The figures emerged as Energy Secretary Ed Miliband wrote an urgent letter to Ofgem, the regulator which sets the price cap, asking it to move quickly to protect consumers.",
      "The predicted higher prices will take effect at the same time as increases to water and council tax bills in April.",
      "However, minimum wage levels will also go up while benefits and the state pension will increase.",
      "Cornwall forecasts that the price cap will rise from its current level of \u00a31,738 per year for a typical household.",

      "Ofgem will announce the official new energy price cap level on 25 February, which will affect homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "The predicted rise will come as the days get lighter and warmer, when energy use tends to fall.",
      "Cornwall say the hike is due to a combination of colder weather and a fall in gas storage levels across Europe, which has led to a sharp rise in wholesale prices.",

      "The regulator illustrates the cap by showing the impact on the annual bill of a household with typical energy usage.",
      "In January, there was a 1.2% rise - which worked out as \u00a31.75 extra a month compared with the previous cap.",
      "A period of high prices means households have collectively built up debt of \u00a33.8bn to suppliers.",
      "The average household in arrears owes more than \u00a31,500 for electricity and \u00a31,300 for gas.",
      "A rise in the energy cap would mean a third successive increase in energy bills at a time of year when the weather starts to get warmer and households would usually hope to see a reprieve in costs.",

      "OpenAI's board of directors has officially rejected Elon Musk's nearly $100bn offer for the maker of what is the world's best-known artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT.",
      "But the unsolicited bid might not be a failure - at least as far as Musk is concerned, experts say.",
      "That's because the offer could still complicate CEO Sam Altman's plans to transform OpenAI from a non-profit controlled entity to a for-profit company.",
      "Musk is \"basically trying to stymie OpenAI's growth trajectory,\" said University of Cambridge associate teaching professor Johnnie Penn in an interview with the BBC.",
      "Profit & non-profit",
      "Last week, Musk and a consortium of investors including Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel tabled a $97.4bn (\u00a378.4bn) offer for all of OpenAI's assets.",
      "It was a huge sum - but less than the $157bn the firm was valued at in a funding round just four months ago, and much lower than the $300bn that some think it is worth now.",
      "Complicating all of this is OpenAI's unusual structure which involves a partnership between non-profit and for-profit arms.",
      "Mr Altman is understood to want to change that, stripping it of its non-profit board.",
      "That involves costs which Mr Musk is seemingly trying to inflate.",
      "\"What Musk is trying to do here is raise the perceived value of the non-profit arm of OpenAI, so that OpenAI has to pay more to get out of the obligations it has to its own non-profit,\" said Dr Penn.",

      "\"Musk has missed the AI train, somewhat. He's behind, and he has made several attempts to catch up,\" Mr Finger said.",
      "Now, Mr Finger says, Mr Musk is trying to kneecap his most formidable competitor.",
      "An already-tense relationship appeared to worsen further last week with Mr Altman taunting Mr Musk's offer on X, and Mr Musk retorting by calling his onetime partner a \"swindler\".",
      "Mr Altman then hit back in an interview with Bloomberg, opining that Mr Musk is not \"a happy person\" and saying his decisions are made from a \"position of insecurity\".",

      "The UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.",
      "Analysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.",
      "The latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.",

      "Both the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.",
      "The president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\".",
      "VAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.",
      "George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.",
      "\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.",
      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries.",
      "But he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".",
      "Fiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.",

      "She said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.",
      "But he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".",
      "Mr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.",
      "'Difficult to predict'",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "But in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.",
      "Caroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.",
      "She suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair.",
      "\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.",

      "But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors.",
      "However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves.",
      "Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather.",
      "But the spinning array on Prof Zhao's robot throws radio waves in all directions.",
      "An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information.",
      "\"What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision \u2013 to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot,\" explains Prof Zhao.",
      "He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building.",
      "Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms.",
      "Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light.",
      "Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections.",
      "The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles.",
      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 22:54:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump wants US vehicles to be more popular in Europe, but it's a difficult market for them to crack.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is threatening to introduce big tariffs on EU car imports, unhappy that Europeans don't buy more American vehicles. But why are US cars, with the notable exception of Tesla, not more popular in Europe?",
      "Italy's ancient towns and cities, with their narrow, cobbled streets, offer an obvious explanation why, in the words of US President Donald Trump, Europeans \"don't take our cars\".",
      "Or as car industry analyst Hampus Engellau puts it: \"Try to go around Italy in a big SUV. I've done it, and it's very difficult\".",
      "Add cost to the question, and it becomes obvious why you don't see too many American pick-up trucks on European roads, observes Mike Hawes, CEO of The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, which represents the industry in the UK.",
      "\"We tend to have higher fuel prices than the Americans, so we prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, while they generally prefer larger vehicles.\"",
      "Mr Engellau, who works for Swedish investment bank Handelsbanken Capital Markets, also highlights petrol prices being substantially cheaper in the US. \"They pay per gallon what we pay per litre,\" he says. There are 3.8 litres to one US gallon.",
      "Yet these differences have done little to deter European carmakers from gaining market share in the US. Again, in the words of Mr Trump, the US has \"millions of cars coming in - BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and many others\".",
      "In 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.",
      "This imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.",
      "\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.",
      "These disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.",
      "Trump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.",
      "Trump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.",
      "In fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.",
      "The automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".",
      "As such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.",
      "US carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.",
      "Meanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.",
      "After years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.",
      "Ford plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.",
      "Elon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.",
      "Europe is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"",
      "He also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.",
      "\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.",
      "He adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.",
      "Adding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.",
      "Mr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.",
      "Mr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.",
      "Not least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".",
      "\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

      "The closing credits of 2021's No Time To Die, the most recent film in the 007 series, ended with a familiar message: \"James Bond will return.\"",
      "But for the last few years, fans haven't been so sure.",
      "A year after the release of Daniel Craig's final film in the franchise, Amazon bought the series' parent company MGM. Since then, very little has happened.",
      "That finally changed on Thursday, when Amazon announced a new deal that would see long-term Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson step back, and Jeff Bezos's company take full creative control.",
      "In the intervening years, it's been widely reported that there was tension between Amazon, who understandably wanted a return on their investment, and Wilson and Broccoli, whose top priority remained protecting the Bond brand.",
      "The news of the deal has been met with mixed reaction from 007 fans.",
      "\"I'm in two minds,\" says David Zaritsky, creator of The Bond Experience fan channel on YouTube and Instagram.",
      "\"The nostalgic part of my mind feels a little bit of sadness. Broccoli and Wilson have been the custodians for all these years, so it feels like a bit of royal blood in lineage has been severed.",
      "\"That being said, nobody likes inactivity. And there's been a lot of inactivity around the James Bond franchise for many years, and I know that Amazon as a company will not have patience for inactivity.",
      "\"So I'm very hopeful, and dare I say even a little bit excited, that they're going to do something with the franchise that will be interesting nonetheless.\"",
      "Other franchises which have drastically expanded perhaps offer some clues about what we can expect from the forthcoming Amazon era of Bond.",
      "Lancelot Narayan, a James Bond historian, journalist and filmmaker, told BBC Radio 5 Live a good comparison is George Lucas selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, giving the company control of the Star Wars brand.",
      "\"They went off and made that sequel trilogy, and whether you like it or not, it got made rather quickly,\" he notes. \"There wasn't a three-year wait between films.\"",
      "However, despite the explosion in productivity, there is a feeling that both Marvel and Star Wars have overstretched themselves with their spin-off products.",
      "Narayan says he believes Star Wars has become \"creatively redundant\" since the explosion in productivity.",
      "\"The Star Wars TV series have been very hit and miss \u2013 Andor is fantastic, The Mandalorian is OK, I haven't seen Skeleton Crew... but there are very disparate creative voices going on there,\" he notes. \"So this is the worry, you need the correct creative people to run the show.\"",
      "Similarly, the Marvel Cinematic Universe built on the films by launching a string of Disney+ TV shows.",
      "The subsequent decline in Marvel's popularity arguably owes much to fan fatigue, something which won't have been helped by the huge number of story strands they had to keep up with.",
      "Both cases, Marvel and Star Wars, highlight the risks of brand expansion, which can cause long-term damage for short-term financial gain.",
      "Fans will be hoping any Bond extensions will be better than 2023's dubious game show 007: Road to a Million, hosted by Succession's Brian Cox, which was poorly received.",
      "The James Bond franchise, and particularly the subject of which actor will take over from Craig, is of such fascination to the public that it's the focus of a new show currently playing in Cirencester, called A Role To Die For.",
      "\"There are a lot of people who have grown up with it, for whom James Bond has been part of their culture their entire lives,\" says the appropriately named Derek Bond, who directs the show.",
      "\"As time has gone on, being able to reinvent that character and have him perhaps change with the times, has been the secret to his longevity.",
      "\"But I wonder if we're now in a situation where the times have changed so much, that James Bond now feels as if he belongs in a different era, and it needs something really radical to keep him relevant today.\"",
      "Character origin stories",
      "One area the company will almost certainly be looking at now they're in creative control is the potential for character origin stories, in a similar vein to other famous and beloved film characters who have received their own spin-off films.",
      "Cruella, an extension of the 101 Dalmatians villain, and Wonka, of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, have both been hugely successful film spin-offs in their own right in the last five years, with Emma Stone and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet respectively bringing the characters and worlds to a whole new audience.",
      "It's not hard to imagine the popularity of a similar film or show based on famous Bond villains such as Jaws, Oddjob, Blofeld, Goldfinger or May Day - all big brands in their own right.",
      "\"I mean, why has nobody made Moneypenny?!\" laughs Derek Bond. \"There's a great series to made about her and her journey.",
      "\"Also M, I'd love to know how Judi Dench's M ended up in that role. And the villains especially, it's a very rich universe, and it's easy to imagine the Marvelisation of it, where you have a kind of spin-off for every character that James Bond ever passed in a corridor.\"",
      "But Zaritsky notes: \"I think Amazon will stop short of doing it ad nauseum, to the point where they're having spin-offs about the MI6 janitor that sleeps in the corner. If they do have spin-offs, I think it's going to be prime characters.\"",
      "Not everyone is a fan of the idea. \"This is quite possibly the WORST thing to happen to this franchise,\" tweeted Griffin Schiller of Film Speak after Amazon's announcement.",
      "\"James Bond was more than your average franchise. It had class, prestige, they were indie films made as blockbusters... now? It'll be milked dry. It's truly the end.\"",
      "Broccoli has been seen as a steward of the brand throughout her tenure; a safe pair of hands who protected the traditions of the original character.",
      "That may not necessarily have been compatible with Amazon, who were presumably looking to buy a brand rather than only a film franchise, in an effort to maximise profit.",
      "\"It does tend to be a slightly older generation that it skews to, and there's a whole generation of people who have not experienced a James Bond film, and now, I wonder if they will,\" Bond says.",
      "In her own tenure, Broccoli has made efforts to keep attracting young audiences in other ways, however, such as selecting popular young artists such as Billie Eilish to sing the theme songs.",
      "A repositioning of of the brand could see Amazon try to take the franchise in a direction that appeals more to a younger audience as well as an American market, which is culturally slightly cooler on the Bond brand than the UK.",
      "\"I think it's quite bad news for the franchise, and British film as a whole,\" movie journalist Hannah Strong told Radio 4's PM following Amazon's announcement.",
      "\"It's the premier British film property, and I think the control reverting to an American company, not least one that hasn't shown that much commitment to great cinema, is probably quite a worrying sign.\"",
      "That said, Amazon will be aware that Bond makes a huge amount of money as it currently is - and that altering the core product itself in a way that appeals more to an American audience would be a huge risk.",
      "Strong added: \"When Amazon bought MGM, Barbara Broccoli was quite outspoken about the fact she was finding it difficult to come to a middle ground with Amazon. I suspect the middle ground involves an awful lot of money.\"",
      "The biggest decision remains who will replace Craig in the leading role.",
      "Broccoli previously said James Bond could be any race, but that he would remain male. That guarantee may no longer stand now she is has handed over the reins, although her approach was widely regarded as sensible and Amazon are unlikely to rock the boat too much.",
      "How long could it be until we see the first new Bond product? Zaritsky suggests Amazon won't wait around, although the first thing to launch may not be a film.",
      "\"It could be with merchandise, or in the form of fan outreach,\" he says. \"Whatever it is, I think we might see something extremely fast.\"",

      "The pair will now give creative control to Amazon MGM Studios, which was formed when Amazon bought Bond's parent studio in 2022.",

      "After Thursday's announcement, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos canvassed fans' opinion on social media, asking: \"Who'd you pick as the next Bond?\"",
      "A statement said Broccoli and Wilson will \"remain co-owners of the franchise\" as part of a new joint venture but Amazon MGM Studios \"will gain creative control\".",
      "Wilson, 83, said: \"With my 007 career spanning nearly 60 incredible years, I am stepping back from producing the James Bond films to focus on art and charitable projects.",
      "\"Therefore, Barbara and I agree, it is time for our trusted partner, Amazon MGM Studios, to lead James Bond into the future.\"",
      "Broccoli, 64, added: \"My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 04:02:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Five things we learned in the LA case - including the stoicism of Rocky's longtime partner and fellow artist.",
    "story": [
      "It was a trial that could have dismantled the future for one of hip-hop's hottest stars.",
      "The felony assault trial of A$AP Rocky - in which he was found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend - captured global headlines. There were outbursts during the proceedings and surprise visits in court by his longtime partner, singer Rihanna.",
      "Jurors in Los Angeles heard three weeks of testimony chronicling the bitter falling-out of childhood friends and the fight that led to the rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, being charged on accusations he opened fire in the middle of a Hollywood street.",
      "After the rapper was acquitted, he left freely with singer Rihanna, who was seated behind him as the verdict was read.",
      "Here are five big things we learned while inside the courtroom.",
      "1) Unwavering support from Rihanna",
      "As the not guilty verdict was read in court, the rapper immediately jumped from the defence table and leapt over a wooden barrier to hug Rihanna, who was seated behind him in between his mother and sister.",
      "The couple embraced tightly, both breaking into tears as the courtroom erupted in cheers.",
      "Rihanna, a Grammy award-winning artist, was in court multiple days during the trial, including on Valentine's Day.",
      "On one of the days in court, she brought the couple's two young children, who were both dressed in suits with pacifiers in their mouths. You could hear them cooing inside the courtroom as they flipped through children's books.",
      "Joe Tacopina, the rapper's defence attorney, said Mr Mayers tried to shield Rihanna and their family from the criminal proceedings, but said that \"wild horses couldn't keep her away\" from the trial.",
      "Though she was often stoic and staring straight ahead while in court, she never flinched or showed emotion when prosecutors made negative comments about her partner.",
      "Following his acquittal, Rihanna expressed her gratitude on social media, stating, \"The glory belongs to God and God alone! Thankful, humbled by his mercy!\"",
      "2) A$AP Mob falling apart?",
      "The A$AP Mob is a hip-hop collective founded in 2006 in Harlem by a group of high school friends in New York.",
      "They adopted the \"A$AP\" title, which means \"Always Strive and Prosper\".",
      "The group, which has had more than 20 members over the years, have presented themselves as a family, but they've been plagued by jealousy, rivalries and disagreements since the death of its founder, A$AP Yams.",
      "Though there have been fallouts and issues between some members, this trial is the most notable instance of a complete dismantling of a relationship between members.",
      "A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, was once a close friend and member of the Mob, accused Mr Mayers, known as A$AP Rocky, of shooting him during an altercation in 2021.",
      "During the trial, his defence team argued that Mr Ephron harboured resentment toward his former friend, feeling sidelined as A$AP Rocky's fame grew and saw mainstream musical success. They argued Mr Ephron was after money.",
      "Several members of the A$AP Mob testified during the trial in favour of Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy challenged Mr Ephron's account of the events and suggested that he was the aggressor during the altercation, not Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Lou also took the stand, telling jurors that a Glock 43 magazine found during a search of Mr Mayers's home belonged to him, not the rapper.",
      "None of the A$AP members publicly testified for Relli.",
      "3) 'AWGE' still a mystery?",
      "Do you know what AWGE stands for? If you know, I think both me and the jury would love to still know.",
      "During the trial, AWGE came up when A$AP Twelvyy was on the stand. He was asked by prosecutors about its meaning. But before he could answer, A$AP Rocky - who was seated with his attorneys - cut in and shouted, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvvy abided and responded, \"I just know it's AWGE\".",
      "It was an astonishing moment. Criminal defendants don't typically say much during trials - let alone halt a witness from answering a question during their criminal trial.",
      "A$AP Rocky not guilty of firearm assault on LA street",
      "When asked about this exchange after the trial, A$AP Rocky's attorney Joe Tacopina explained what happened.",
      "He said it was an \"acronym for his company that had to do with his family. I'm gonna leave it at that.\" Mr Tacopina went on to explain it was a private thing that the rapper didn't want revealed publicly to millions, especially in a criminal court case.",
      "But the answer really led to more questions. What does it mean and why is it so secretive?",
      "Here's what we do know: AWGE is the name of A$AP Rocky's mysterious creative collective and record label, and it's long been the subject of intrigue.",
      "Founded in 2014, the group operates across music, fashion and art, collaborating with brands like Mercedes-Benz and PacSun. Members include artists, designers and directors, and everyone remains loyal to one rule: no one publicly reveals what \"AWGE\" actually stands for.",
      "On the company's website there are two rules listed: \"#1 Never reveal what AWGE means. #2 When in doubt always refer to rule #1.\"",
      "A$AP Rocky's fans do have some guesses though:",
      "\"A$AP Worldwide Global Enterprises\" \u2013 A possible nod to the A$AP Mob's broader brand and business ambitions.\"Ain't Wanna Go Explicit\" \u2013 This suggests that AWGE represents an inside joke or personal mantra within Rocky's circle.\"All We Got is Everything\" \u2013 A phrase that aligns with Rocky's philosophy of creativity and collaboration.\"A$AP Worldwide Genius Elite\" \u2013 Another theory that frames AWGE as a highly curated group of artists and visionaries.",

      "\"A$AP Worldwide Genius Elite\" \u2013 Another theory that frames AWGE as a highly curated group of artists and visionaries.",
      "Despite the guesses, the rapper and his team have never officially confirmed any meaning.",
      "Instead, they've leaned into the secrecy, with members often responding to questions about AWGE with the phrase, \"If you know, you know.\"",
      "4) The height of A$AP Rocky's fame",
      "A$AP Rocky's trial unfolded at a pivotal moment in his career, with the rapper riding a wave of creative and commercial success.",
      "The rapper is set to release his first solo album in nearly a decade and is scheduled to co-headline Los Angeles' Rolling Loud festival in March 2025.",
      "Additionally, he is starring in a summer blockbuster alongside Denzel Washington. Director Spike Lee's upcoming film \"Highest 2 Lowest\" is slated for a summer release.",
      "But his influence extends beyond music\u2014his AWGE collective has been collaborating with brands like Mercedes-Benz and Puma. He's been celebrated for his fashion sense, too, and is known as being one of music's best-dressed men.",
      "In May, he is set to co-chair the 2025 Met Gala - one of fashion's biggest nights - alongside big names like Anna Wintour, British race car driver Lewis Hamilton, singer Pharrell Williams and basketball superstar LeBron James.",
      "His relationship with Rihanna, one of the most famous singers, has further cemented his cultural relevance.",
      "The couple welcomed their second child, Riot Rose, in August 2023, and their growing family had become a symbol of hip-hop royalty.",
      "5) Beef between the lawyers",
      "The trial wasn't just a battleground for the rapper's freedom\u2014it also saw intense clashes between legal teams.",
      "Celebrity defence attorney Joe Tacopina, known for his aggressive courtroom style, relentlessly challenged the credibility of the prosecution's key witness, A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron.",
      "He painted Mr Ephron as an opportunist seeking financial gain and called the prosecution's case flimsy due to a lack of physical evidence. Mr Ephron got so fed up with the rapper's attorney during questioning that he called Mr Tacopina \"annoying\".",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors pushed back, accusing Mr Tacopina of attempting to intimidate witnesses and dismiss key testimonies.",
      "Both sides were very liberal with their use of objections in court, and it sometimes felt as though both sides were trying to throw the other off their game, rather than being based on legal guidelines.",
      "It also got personal between the two sides.",
      "At one point during closing arguments, Mr Tacopina and prosecutor John Lewin traded misconduct allegations, with Mr Lewin accusing Mr Tacopina of using steroids and Mr Tacopina firing back by calling Lewin a \"hunchback\".",
      "After a short break, the judge attempted to lighten the mood by theatrically introducing the attorneys like boxers before resuming the trial.",

      "Both sides had been locked in a long-running legal battle to determine who should operate the venue, with the case heard at the The Business and Property Courts in Leeds in December.",
      "His Honour Justice Sir Alastair Norris ruled in favour of the Electric Group on Wednesday, meaning The Leadmill Ltd has three months and 21 days to leave the site. The Leadmill said it was seeking legal advice over its next steps.",
      "The venue opened in 1980 and has played host to the likes of Oasis, Coldplay and Sheffield's own Arctic Monkeys.",
      "A plaque on the building marks Pulp's first ever gig, which was at The Leadmill in August 1980.",
      "The Leadmill Ltd owns the trademark for the venue's name, meaning the site, on Leadmill Road, will likely be renamed under the Electric Group.",
      "In his ruling, Justice Norris said the \"present intention\" was to rebrand the famous venue as SK 35. The significance of the name was not clarified and the BBC has asked Electric Group for comment.",
      "An Electric Group spokesperson said the judge's decision \"paves the way for a bright future for this venue, ensuring it will receive the substantial investment it needs to thrive\".",

      "He also said there was \"no need\" to believe the work would take longer than the 35 weeks estimated by Electric Group.",
      "The judge rejected an argument that it would be a violation of the Human Rights Act - protecting a person's right to property - if Electric Group was to be allowed to \"exploit\" the \"good will\" built up by the current management by running the venue in \"precisely the same way\".",
      "\"There is nothing peculiar to music venues,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Individual members of The 1975 should not be held responsible for Malaysian authorities closing down a Kuala Lumpur festival after frontman Matty Healy kissed one of his male bandmates on-stage, the High Court has heard.",
      "During the band's performance at the Good Vibes Festival in July 2023, Healy addressed the audience in a profanity-laden speech before kissing bass player Ross MacDonald.",
      "Homosexuality remains a crime in Malaysia which is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning.",
      "The weekend festival was cancelled on its opening night as a result, with the Malaysian government criticising Healy's conduct while blacklisting the band from the country.",
      "'Challenge and provoke'",
      "Festival organisers Future Sound Asia (FSA) claim The 1975 Productions LLP breached their contract following the incident and that all four band members owed a duty of care.",
      "FSA is seeking damages of \u00a31.9 million in \"substantial losses\".",
      "In a hearing on Wednesday, the band's lawyer Edmund Cullen KC described the claim as an \"illegitimate, artificial and incoherent\" attempt \"to pin liability on individuals\", the PA news agency reported.",
      "He said it was \"really quite bizarre\" that the individual members should be held liable as FSA had a contract with the band's company only.",
      "\"The allegations of breaches of a duty of care are not breaches of a duty of care at all,\" he said.",
      "\"They are breaches of Malaysian statutes and guidelines. That is why this claim is completely artificial against my clients.\"",
      "He asked the court to strike out the claim against the band members as individuals and for it to proceed against the company only.",
      "In written submissions for FSA, Andrew Burns KC, said The 1975 - who were due to be paid 350,000 dollars (\u00a3274,000) for a one-hour performance - \"deliberately behaved in a way to challenge and provoke the Malaysian authorities\".",
      "The band first played the festival in 2016, agreeing at the time not to swear, smoke, drink, take off clothes or talk about religion and politics on stage, he noted.",
      "But they \"planned provocative conduct\" in 2023, which included a bottle of wine being \"smuggled\" on stage, a \"second-rate set of songs\" to \"punish and upset the Malaysian audience and authorities\" and an \"obscene speech\"; as well as the kiss which courted much publicity online, the submissions claimed.",
      "\"This is also a case where they could be argued to have been on a frolic of their own rather than simply acting within the course of their ordinary role as LLP members,\" he said in the document.",
      "\"It is therefore fair, just and reasonable for the duty of care to be imposed and for them to answer for their acts of procuring breaches of contract.\"",
      "The court heard that Malaysian authorities had initially refused to let the band perform amid reports about Healy's recent recovery from drug addiction.",
      "But they agreed to allow the performance to take place after the band promised Healy would adhere to all guidelines and regulations, Mr Burns added.",
      "\"The band should be held liable as the loss was caused by their intentional misbehaviour breaching the express assurances that were given which gave rise to their personal duties of care and their responsibility for their own personal behaviour.\"",

      "In footage shared online, Healy could be seen telling the crowd that the band's decision to appear in Malaysia had been a \"mistake\".",
      "\"When we were booking shows, I wasn't looking into it,\" Healy said. \"I do not see the point of inviting the 1975 to a country and then telling us who we can have sex with.",
      "\"Unfortunately you don't get a set of loads of uplifting songs because I'm [expletive] furious,\" the frontman continued. \"And that's not fair on you, because you're not representative of your government. Because you're young people, and I'm sure a lot of you are gay and progressive and cool.\"",
      "Healy and MacDonald then kissed as the band played the song I Like America & America Likes Me.",
      "Soon after - just 30 minutes into the set - Healy and the band walked off stage, with the singer telling the audience: \"Alright, we just got banned from Kuala Lumpur, see you later.\"",
      "Healy's protest stunt sparked a backlash from some LGBT activists and allies in the country, with many calling it an act of \"performative activism\" that would make their lives even harder. Some said it displayed a \"white saviour complex\".",
      "In a statement after the show, a source close to the band said Healy had wanted to stand up for the LGBT community.",
      "After their Malaysian festival appearance had been cut short, the band cancelled further concerts in Indonesia and Taiwan.",
      "Several months later, Healy defended the kiss in a 10-minute speech delivered at a 1975 concert in Dallas, Texas.",
      "Healy said it was \"not a stunt simply meant to provoke the government\" but an \"ongoing part of the 1975 stage show which had been performed many times prior\".",
      "He described online anger over the performance as \"liberal outrage\", and said criticism of the band for \"remaining consistent\" by performing its \"pro-LGBT stage show\" was puzzling."

      "He tells the BBC that his portrayal of the authoritarian king who ruled in the 1300s was inspired by HBO's Succession, which explores the power struggle between the children of media mogul Logan Roy.",
      "\"I channelled many Roys,\" Bailey explains, adding that Richard II \"explores inherited power in a very similar way to Succession but also expands on it and takes it to a new level\".",

      "The Guardian's three star review said his \"words glitter with feeling\" and added that he \"singularly shines, his luminosity putting the others slightly in the shade\".",
      "The Evening Standard's review added that Bailey \"commands the stage and even allows a little camp to seep into the character\" while the Independent said, in a four-star review, that Bailey has \"an infectious spirit of camp naughtiness, he hugs his crown like a teddy bear, aims wry put-downs at dull courtiers, and bosses his court around like they're actors in a play\".",
      "However, in a three-star review, Dominic Cavendish from the Telegraph suggestedthat Bailey \"doesn't attain the greatness of Ben Whishaw and David Tennant\".",
      "There was also praise for some of the other actors, notably Michael Simkins. The Times said his Duke of York is \"stateliness personified\", but also awarded three stars overall.",

      "Newer fans of Bailey may not realise that he is first and foremost a theatre actor.",
      "In 2013, he played Cassio in Hytner's Othello at the National Theatre and has also performed alongside Ian McKellen in King Lear.",
      "Productions of Shakespeare's plays rarely have a large audience of young women, but Bailey's appeal among that demographic seems to have inspired them to visit the theatre.",

      "\"I mean, did you tell the press that too, or does that not fit into the victim narrative you have going?\" he added.",
      "\"I apologise that I didn't get the message that you don't like spending time with me. Maybe there was another reason, I don't know, but that doesn't make any sense. That you would have just been leading me on, right? But here you are now on a mission, some 28 years later, after I've been through hell and back.\"",

      "Pearce earlier told the US publication he had raised Spacey's alleged behaviour with him years later, and had \"had a couple of confrontations with Kevin\" that \"got ugly\".",

      "South Korea's entertainment industry is enjoying massive popularity. Today, there are more than an estimated 220 million fans of Korean entertainment around the world \u2013 that's four times the population of South Korea.",
      "But there is also increasing spotlight on the less glamorous side of the entertainment industry.",
      "South Korea is known for its hyper-competitive culture in most spheres of life - from education to careers. It has one of the highest suicide rates among developed countries. While its overall suicide rate is falling, deaths of those in their 20s are rising.",
      "This pressure is heightened in the case of celebrities. They face immense pressure to be perfect, and are subjected to the demands of obsessive \"super fans\" who can make or break careers.",
      "That is why even the slightest perceived misstep can be career ending. Kim Sae-ron became so unpopular, scenes featuring her were edited out of shows such as Netflix's 2023 drama Bloodhounds.",
      "\"It is not enough that the celebrities be punished by the law. They become targets of relentless criticism,\" Korean culture critic Kim Hern-sik told the BBC.",
      "He referred to K-pop artists Sulli and Goo Hara, who died by suicide in 2019 after long battles with internet trolls, even though they did not have known brushes with the law.",
      "Sulli had offended fans for not conforming to the K-pop mould, while an internet mob had targeted Goo Hara over her relationship with an ex-boyfriend.",

      "Cyberbullying has also become a money-making gig for some,  Kim Hern-sik told the BBC.",

      "He contrasts this to entertainment industries in the West, where controversies and scandals sometimes even \"add a rockstar-like edge\" to celebrities' reputations.",
      "\"While no one cheers when a Hollywood celebrity is arrested for DUI [driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs] or sent to jail for significant crimes, it's not necessarily career-ending,\" he says.",
      "While the Korean entertainment industry has made moves to address performers' mental health concerns, it is unclear how effective these have been.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 01:43:21 GMT",
    "summary": "EastEnders stars and commentators reflect on times the soap tackled social taboos over 40 years.",
    "story": [
      "Over its 40-year run, EastEnders hasn't just been plot twists, emotions and gripping \"doof doof\" cliffhangers.",
      "It's also tackled social issues head-on, its stars say.",
      "The series has \"done more to create social awareness\" on these issues \"than probably any documentary\", says actor Ross Kemp, who plays leather-jacket-wearing Grant Mitchell.",
      "Kemp, who is hosting a BBC documentary on the history of the soap, says over the last four decades EastEnders has been able to take on subjects many feel are taboo - and it continues to do so with recent storylines including topics such as spiking.",
      "\"You can introduce those things through a continuing drama, a soap like EastEnders, and inform more people than you possibly would do with a government campaign,\" he says.",
      "First gay kiss",
      "On 17 November 1987, EastEnders aired a kiss between characters Colin Russell (played by Lord Michael Cashman) and his boyfriend Barry Clark (Gary Hailes) on the side of the head.",
      "There was a \"furore\" after the kiss was broadcast, Kemp recalls, adding \"it wasn't even a kiss on the lips\".",
      "Former actor Lord Cashman speaks to Kemp about the reaction during the new documentary EastEnders: 40 Years on the Square.",
      "\"The media went berserk,\" he says. \"There were calls for 'this kind of filth to be taken off our screens'.\"",
      "Lord Cashman says \"it was a weird and dark time,\" adding \"there was rampant homophobia\".",
      "In 1988, Section 28 of the Local Government Act was introduced, which banned places like schools and libraries from \"promoting homosexuality\".",
      "Lord Cashman's character Colin went on to share the first mouth-to-mouth kiss between two gay men on a British soap with character Guido Smith (Nicholas Donovan) in 1989.",
      "However, the former actor, later an activist and politician, recalls the reaction from fans: \"There was one guy and he said: 'I used to stand behind the sofa so that my mum and dad couldn't see me looking at you and I knew I wasn't alone.' It made a difference.\"",
      "Domestic violence",
      "According to Ofcom's first review of public service television broadcasting, audiences said early evening programmes, like soaps, had an important social role in airing complex and controversial issues.",
      "One example came in the early 2000s, when the soap featured a domestic violence and coercive control storyline featuring Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) and her brutal partner Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns).",
      "Actor Ainsworth says members of the public would often confuse her for her character and offer sympathy to her in the street. \"People would try and sit me down in places, they'd put their arms around me,\" she says. \"They'd want to look after me.\"",
      "The actor adds she received \"hundreds\" of letters a week from victims of similar violence.",
      "Though one watchdog at the time said the show went \"too far\" for pre-watershed TV, research for a national domestic violence helpline highlighted the storyline as the most significant TV portrayal of violence in the home in 30 years.",
      "Colourism",
      "Molly Rainford, who plays Anna Knight, was introduced to the Square in 2023. She is the daughter of George Knight and Cindy Beale and is part of the first black and dual heritage family to run a pub on any UK soap.",
      "In February 2024, the soap aired scenes of Molly and her on-screen sister, Gina Knight (Francesca Henry), discussing colourism and how differently they are treated because of their different skin tones.",
      "Colourism is prejudice against people who have a darker skin tone or the preferential treatment of those who are the same race but have lighter skin.",
      "Speaking about the storyline, Rainford says: \"These are conversations that happen in every mixed-raced family's life. All of these conversations are so important and so valid, especially right now.\"",
      "Rainford says parents told her their children had \"conversations on the playground that day after seeing that\".",
      "Transgender representation",
      "In 2015, Riley Carter Millington became the first transgender man to play a recurring trans character in a British soap, with his portrayal of Kyle Slater in EastEnders.",
      "Carter Millington says \"there wasn't a lot of on-screen representation\" for trans people and he was \"overwhelmed\" and grateful to have been cast in the role.",

She says the show feels more authentic than reality TV.",
      "\"I love it so much I've planned my week around the 40th anniversary and even cancelled plans to make sure I can watch it live.\"",
      "Despite none of her friends watching the show and thinking she's a \"loser for watching it\", she says she loves the escapism it provides. \"I'm quite an anxious person so being stressed about things that aren't real is really good for me.\"",
      "Data suggests the London-based drama has more than double the number of young viewers than Emmerdale.",
      "But, in contrast to Natalie, 25-year-old Ryan says EastEnders is a \"bit too doom-and-gloom\" and prefers the other two soaps.",
      "\"They feel more like real life where there are positive and negative storylines.\"",
      "He adds that he doesn't live in a big city so it's nice to watch shows such as Emmerdale that reflect rural life and aren't London-centric.",
      "By the end of the week, I found myself quite enjoying EastEnders more than the other two soaps - which could be partly because I grew up in London and therefore felt more of an inherent connection.",
      "But overall I struggled with the lack of cathartic ending for all of them.",
      "I don't mind a series having multiple episodes but I have to know that all the storylines will eventually be resolved.",
      "With soaps, there is no ending. Storylines carry on even when you think they're over. A character reappears years later or someone's brother's cousin's daughter from five years ago starts digging up the drama again.",
      "I'm unlikely to continue watching soaps after this week but I can see the appeal of them for the people who have been watching it for some time.",
      "There's something impressive about their longevity - will Love Island be celebrating its 40th anniversary in 2055 and will I be tuning in as a pensioner to watch a 21-year-old man tell someone their behaviour is muggy? Probably not.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "More young people are presenting to audiology teams in England with difficulty processing sound.",
    "story": [
      "Whether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day.",
      "But, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts.",
      "This is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\".",
      "\"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said.",
      "After a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words.",
      "Her audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones.",
      "'Words sound like gibberish'",
      "Having grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from.",
      "She rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles.",
      "\"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said.",
      "It affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".",
      "The cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play.",
      "Other audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use.",
      "Five NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling.",
      "APD is more common in neurodivergent people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.",
      "Hearing vs listening",
      "Renee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on.",
      "Her team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\"",
      "Noise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music.",
      "Lisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model.",
      "\"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.",
      "A false reality?",
      "But Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise.",
      "\"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said.",
      "\"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.",
      "For those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.",
      "A UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.",
      "And, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.",
      "Prof Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\"",
      "Particularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown.",
      "It is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on.",
      "Dr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children.",
      "\"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\"",
      "Dr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research.",
      "He said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".",

      "Study finds 18m people in the UK have hearing loss",
      "Treatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.",
      "So-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three.",
      "Microphones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS.",
      "\"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis.",
      "\"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\"",
      "To improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.",
      "Limited research",
      "Wayne Wilson, an associate professor in the school of health and rehabilitation sciences at The University of Queensland, says more research needs to be done on the possible link.",

      "It's a dilemma for the medical staff, with 15-30% of patients at the Royal Free medically fit to be discharged but unable to go home, for a myriad of reasons.",
      "The hospital has its own discharge team - whose job it is to safely get patients out of the door, to free up beds for new admissions. Just under 14,000 people who are medically fit are still in English hospitals and can't go home, through no fault of their own.",
      "At the Royal Free London Trust, there are 275 people occupying beds who don't need to, at three major sites. That makes up nearly 20% of all the beds the trust has.",

      "\"This is the kind of issue we have to deal with every day,\" she says.",
      "\"Sometimes a family member has the keys to a patient's house, and they've gone on holiday. Some patients forget the key code to their front door, so no one can get in. The problems are mundane and routine but make it difficult for people to be discharged and they're a regular occurrence.\"",
      "As night falls, corridors full of patients",

      "That leads to a spillover into the corridors, with patients in wheelchairs, on hospital beds and gurneys filling all the available space. The wards on either side are full too. It's cramped and depressing - but a familiar scene in hospitals right across England.",

      "His moans and groans grow louder, as he writhes on the gurney. Eventually a friend who is with him manages to find a nurse to get him some painkillers.",
      "For patients waiting in the corridor, there is no privacy. Some might argue no dignity either, with their pain and ailments, oxygen bottles and intravenous drips all on public display.",
      "Then suddenly, an emergency alarm goes off. A patient in one of the wards is having a seizure. The doctors and nurses on duty, professional as ever, head straight for her bed, at least six or seven people. They need to get her to the resuscitation area fast, to save her life. But they can barely make their way out of the ward, because of all the patients in the corridor.",
      "A little later an ambulance drops off a man with mental health problems, who has cut himself in the lower abdomen with a knife. Despite the self-harm and his mental state, the ambulance staff tell the on-duty nurse that the outside mental health assessment service CASS, had refused to intervene, saying the patient wasn't in crisis.",
      "The duty nurse shakes her head in disbelief, writing down the details. Once again the Royal Free's A&E is being left to carry the can for another agency.",
      "Resident doctor Charlie Hall, who's on duty, tells me he comes from a long line of doctors. \"It's not the health service I signed up for, at the age of 17,\" he says.",
      "\"The access to services, I feel, are creaking for patients and the ability to provide high-quality care is creaking. A lot of patients are very dissatisfied with what's going on, and I don't blame them. We're doing our level best in the hospital to give them the best treatment and the best options, but you can only apologise so much.\"",
      "When our filming is over, we learn that Raymond Dubbery has died on the ward.",
      "For just 24 hours, we saw the NHS up close, fighting uphill battles every day."

      "They criticise depictions of baby boomers - those born between 1946 and 1964 and now in their 60s and 70s - as either frail or enjoying a life of luxury at the expense of their children and grandchildren.",
      "The report also hits out at what the authors say was a failure by previous governments to address digital exclusion of older people as services, particularly around banking and health, increasingly move online.",

      "In its report, the committee said the portrayal of older people as \"wealth-hoarding 'boomers'\" was \"highly prevalent across all media in the UK\".",
      "An example might be the \"OK Boomer\" meme used to dismiss older people's opinions by suggesting they are out of touch.",
      "It also said discussion of intergenerational fairness tended to \"pit younger and older generations against each other in a perceived fight for limited resources\".",
      "The MPs pointed to a 2020 report from the Centre for Ageing Better, which looked at the portrayal of older people on television, in magazines and in advertising.",
      "They also said witnesses to their inquiry, on the rights of older people, said older people were \"frequently stereotyped as wealthy \"boomers\" living comfortable lives in homes they own while younger generations struggle on low incomes, unable to afford to enter the housing market and struggling with high rents\".",

      "However, the report pointed to evidence suggesting this ignores inequalities within generations.",
      "'Digital exclusion'",
      "Some older people are also still at high risk of \"digital exclusion\", MPs believe, because they do not have the skills to access online banking, council or GP services  - despite the government launching a digital inclusion strategy 10 years ago.",

      "\"Ultimately much more must be done to tackle ageist attitudes and discrimination across society, including in access to healthcare, local services, banking and transport.\"",
      "Owen is calling for the UK government to follow the Welsh example of establishing a commissioner for older people alongside community champions to deliver a national strategy.",

      "\"He spent Christmas and New Year on a cruise of the Iberian peninsula and recently held a 97th birthday party - he was born January 29 1928 - and insisted on dying at home, where he was looked after by carers.\"",

      "UK inflation jumped sharply in the year to January, driven by rising food prices, air fares and an increase in private school fees.",
      "The higher-than-expected jump to 3% from 2.5% in December, means prices rose at the fastest pace for 10 months.",
      "Food staples such as meat, eggs, butter and cereals were all more expensive than a year ago and comes as many households prepare for higher energy and water bills later this year.",
      "Following the latest figures, the government warned that the road back to low inflation would be \"bumpy\", but the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats argued Labour's tax rises and spending plans had caused the latest spike.",
      "Rising food prices last month mean, on average, the cost of buying groceries is 3.3% more expensive than it was a year ago.",
      "While many staples have edged up in price, some items such as olive oil and lamb have increased markedly, by 17% and 16% respectively.",
      "The rise in inflation, which is a measure used to give a general picture of how living costs have changed over a year, comes ahead of predicted increases to energy bills in April.",
      "Water and council tax bills are also slated to rise in two months' time, which will push up the cost of living for households.",

      "UK wages continue to outpace inflation",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",

      "But with the rate remaining above the Bank's 2% target, some economists suggest further cuts could be made at a slower pace.",
      "Professor Jonathan Haskel, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee, told the BBC that policymakers could \"take no signal\" from the inflation spike and carry on cutting rates gradually or view it as a \"harbinger of more to come\" and change course.",
      "Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said because the VAT charge on private schools came into effect last month, the impact on inflation was a \"one-off\".",

      "\"We are in a different world than we were a few years ago under the previous government, where inflation was routinely double digits,\"  he said.",

      "Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said January's figure would be \"uncomfortable\" for the Bank of England, but said she doubted it would prevent further rate cuts.",
      "\"The risk is that the rise in inflation proves more persistent and rates are cut more slowly than we expect, or not as far,\" she added."

      "But he said \"it's absolutely not\" something the UK could do on its own. \"I think the prime minister has been very clear that the UK would contribute to efforts, but absolutely not doing it on our own,\" says Brigadier Watson.",
      "Exercise Steadfast Dart is Nato's largest exercise this year and meant to demonstrate how quickly allies can come to the defence of an ally under attack. But while it's meant to demonstrate Nato's readiness, it also highlights its limitations too.",

      "Now it is at its smallest since the Napoleonic wars, at just over 70,000. Even before the cuts, the British Army was stretched sending a force of 9,000 troops.",
      "It required additional defence spending for urgent operational equipment, as well as a rolling deployment of fresh troops every six months. A regular Army of around 73,000 would now struggle to do something on a similar scale.",

      "Prior to the meeting, the European leaders had also expressed concern after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said it was \"unrealistic\" to expect Ukraine would return to its borders before 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea.",
      "Hegseth downplayed the prospect of Ukraine joining Nato - something Sir Keir had said it was on an \"irreversible\" path towards - and said Europe would have to be primarily responsible for guaranteeing its own security going forward.",

      "This has been the case in the House of Commons' equivalent committee since 2015, using people from outside the institution with relevant knowledge to bring an \"independent and external perspective\" to decision-making.",

      "It had heard evidence that it might overwhelm police and the criminal justice system - which is already facing severe backlogs - and that any allegations of deliberate deception would have to reach the criminal standard.",
      "The committee also wanted one standards system, and not have lying treated separately and seen as more serious than other breaches.",

      "Sir Keir said he agreed, adding: \"It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration\".",

      "A government spokesperson said Sir Keir had \"made clear that it is for Parliament to make the laws and for the government to decide policy.\"",
      "Speaking at her annual news conference, Baroness Carr also said that judges' concerns about their personal security were at an \"all-time high\" - thanks to attacks on social media driven by wider misreporting of their work.",
      "The exchange between Sir Keir and Badenoch came during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) last week.",
      "Badenoch was critical of how an immigration judge had handled the family's application, which she said was made under a scheme designed for Ukrainians fleeing the war. The case has been widely misreported and misunderstood.",
      "Badenoch said: \"A judge has now ruled in their favour. That is not what the scheme was designed to do.",
      "\"This decision is completely wrong, and cannot be allowed to stand. Are the government planning to appeal on any points of law, and, if so, which ones?\"",
      "The full reading of the judgement reveals that the family of six - a mother and father, and their four children - had sought permission to live with a British relative who proved he was able to house and financially support them.",
      "Part of their case had been that they were political opponents of Hamas, which is banned in the UK under terrorism laws.",

      "\"She has not quite done her homework, however, because the decision in question was taken under the last government, according to their legal framework.\"",

      "Meanwhile, the two Upper Tribunal judges, who granted the family permission to reunite in the UK, said that their decision was not creating a Palestinian settlement scheme, but dealing with a complex and exceptional case.",
      "They had not been presented with any evidence from the government that this family's unusual case would open \"floodgates\".",
      "The UK currently has schemes for some Afghans, Ukrainians and people from Hong Kong to come to the UK, but no route for Palestinians.",
      "Reflecting on the PMQs clash, Baroness Carr said on Monday that \"both the question and the answer were unacceptable\".",
      "\"It is for the government visibly to respect and protect the independence of the judiciary,\" she said. \"Where parties, including the government, disagree with their findings, they should do so through the appellate process.\"",

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves' attempt to intervene in a landmark case over controversial car loans has been blocked by the UK's highest court.",
      "The Supreme Court case, which is set for April, will hear an appeal by finance firms after the Court of Appeal ruled that it was unlawful for lenders to pay a commission to a dealer without a customer's consent.",
      "Furthermore, it said that when customers were not informed of the arrangement they should be compensated, leading to estimates that the industry could be forced to pay out as much as \u00a330bn.",
      "The Treasury, which stepped in amid concerns about the possible impact on the wider car financing sector, said it respected the Supreme Court's decision.",
      "The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements.",
      "In 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer.",
      "It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people who had these deals before 2021.",
      "That has created the prospect of banks and other lenders having to make payouts totalling millions of pounds.",
      "Last month, a decision at the Court of Appeal broadened the net of those who could receive compensation.",
      "Some analysts estimate the bill could end up being the largest compensation scheme linked to financial products since the payment protection insurance (PPI) saga.",
      "Car loan scandal payouts row - what's it about?",
      "The government said last month that, while it wanted to make sure customers get redress, it also wanted the motor sector to be able to continue \"supporting millions of motorists to own vehicles\".",
      "It expressed concerns at the time that the size of the compensation bill for lenders could undermine the competitiveness of UK banks.",
      "A spokesperson for the Treasury said on Monday: \"We respect the Court's decision to not grant our application to intervene... and will monitor it closely\".",
      "The court also rejected applications to intervene in the case from Consumer Voice, a compensation advisor, and the Finance & Leasing Association trade body.",
      "It approved applications from the FCA and trade body the National Franchised Dealers Association.",
      "The court's time is limited, so it sometimes rejects interventions from parties who it believes may give similar evidence.",
      "\"It is very unusual for the government to intervene in court decisions in which it is not directly concerned, especially to pursue policy issues,\" said Wayne Gibbard, who leads the automotive finance practice at law firm Shoosmiths.",
      "He said that the Supreme Court case in April marked the final step in the legal process around  \"secrecy and payments\", and added that after the court's conclusion, the FCA would consider whether, and what type of redress is paid, if at all.",
      "\"Most likely we will see that around May time, and that's likely to involve some sort of consultation,\" he said. The FCA has set itself the end of 2025 as a deadline to resolve all of the cases.",

    "summary": "The independent review says successive governments made \"knee jerk\" decisions to issue longer prison sentences.",
    "story": [
      "Successive governments trying to look \"tough on crime\" have driven the rising prison population which forced the early release of thousands of inmates last year, a review suggests.",
      "The report by the Independent Sentencing Review found governments over the past 25 years jailed more criminals, despite evidence it does not prevent re-offending.",
      "The review, led by former lord chancellor David Gauke, also found there were \"knee-jerk\" decisions to issue longer sentences in an effort to show government action.",
      "Mr Gauke warned that unless radical changes are made this year, prisons in England and Wales could run out of cells again by spring 2026.",
      "More prisoners freed early to ease overcrowding",
      "More prisoners freed early to ease overcrowding",
      "\"It's only a matter of time before, once again, prison numbers will exceed capacity,\" Mr Gauke told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme.",
      "England and Wales has one of the highest prison population rates in western Europe, according to the report.",
      "Despite an overall decline in crime since the mid-1990s, England and Wales' prison population has almost doubled between 1993 and 2012, the review found, while reoffending has stayed stubbornly high.",
      "The government launched an early prisoner release scheme in September last year as part of an emergency plan to tackle overcrowding.",
      "It saw eligible prisoners serving more than five years automatically released after only 40% of their fixed-term sentence, rather than the usual 50%.",
      "The government then commissioned the report to examine how prisons became so full, and to consider ways to ease overcrowding by giving tougher punishments outside of prison. The panel's recommendations are due in spring.",
      "The review found that the early release scheme freed up enough spare cells for newly-remanded or convicted criminals, but that headroom will disappear by next year, even with more prison places being built.",
      "Mr Gauke said: \"Last year we were confronted with the consequences of decades of haphazard policy making and underinvestment in the criminal justice system - bringing it to the brink of collapse.",
      "\"For too long politicians have operated in a vacuum, increasing sentencing for individual crimes without considering the knock-on impact on the wider system.\"",
      "He said the system had failed victims, and that while punishment would always be a central aim of the criminal justice system, \"prison is not the only form of punishment\".",
      "Probation: 'Too few staff, with too little experience, managing too many offenders'",
      "Early release of hundreds of prisoners in Scotland begins",
      "Figures show that almost six out of 10 offenders jailed for less than a year go on to break the law again - a cycle of criminality that had been feeding more and more people into the prison population.",
      "In contrast, fewer community sentences have been handed out by courts and there has been decades of under-investment in probation teams, who are charged with offenders in the community, and proven rehabilitation programmes.",
      "As a consequence, more money has been spent on emergency overcrowding measures, including building more jails, rather than on punishment in the community and cheaper programmes aimed at stopping offending in the first place.",
      "Mr Gauke's review found that the prison population began to balloon as Labour and Conservative administrations competed to introduce tougher and tougher measures aimed at jailing people.",
      "\"Over the last 25 years, the political landscape has been increasingly dominated by a 'tough on crime' narrative that has focused on longer imprisonment. In tandem, politicians have implemented legislative and policy changes which have inflated sentencing,\" it reads.",
      "Mr Gauke told the BBC that the last 30 years have seen \"something of a bidding war between political parties as to who is prepared to lengthen sentences the most\".",
      "\"As a consequence, we've seen our prison population essentially double over that time,\" he added.",

    "title": "Fog harvesting could provide water for arid cities",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 05:13:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Research in Chile could help to provide drinking water for some of the world's most arid places.",
    "story": [
      "Capturing water from fog - on a large scale - could provide some of the driest cities in the world with drinking water.",
      "This is what researchers in Chile have concluded after studying the potential of fog harvesting in the desert city of Alto Hospicio in the north of the country.",
      "Average rainfall in the region is less than 0.19in (5mm) per year.",
      "\"Like a lot of cities, Alto Hospicio has its social problems,\" said lead researcher Dr Virginia Carter Gamberini, from Universidad Mayor. \"There is a lot of poverty\", she explained, and many people there have no direct access to the networks that supply clean water.",
      "Many who live in the city's poorest communities rely on drinking water that is delivered by truck.",
      "However, clouds of fog that regularly gather over the mountain city are an untapped source, researchers say.",
      "How do you harvest fog?",
      "Capturing fog water is remarkably simple - a mesh is hung between poles, and when the moisture-laden clouds pass through that fine mesh, droplets form. The water is then channelled into pipes and storage tanks.",
      "It has been used at a small scale for several decades, mainly in rural South and Central America - in places with the right foggy conditions. One of the biggest fog water harvesting systems is in Morocco, on the edge of the Sahara Desert.",
      "However, Dr Carter says a \"new era\" of much larger-scale fog harvesting could provide a more  secure and sustainable supply of water in urban environments where it is most needed.",
      "She and her colleagues carried out assessments of how much water can be produced by fog harvesting, and combined that information with studies of cloud formation in satellite images and with weather forecasts.",
      "From this, they concluded that the clouds that regularly form over the Pacific - and are blown across the coastal mountain city - could provide the people of Alto Hospicio's slums with a sustainable source of drinking water. They published their findings in a paper in the journal Frontiers of Environmental Science.",

      "World's glaciers melting faster than ever recorded",
      "Concerns UK's AI ambitions could lead to water shortages",
      "Alto Hospicio's fog forms over the Pacific Ocean - when warm, moist air flows over cold water - and is then blown over the mountains. The reliably foggy conditions here allowed Dr Carter and her colleagues to pinpoint areas where the largest volumes of water could be harvested regularly from the clouds.",
      "Based on an annual average water collection rate of 2.5 litres per square metre of mesh per day, the researchers worked out:",
      "17,000 sq m of mesh could produce enough water to meet the weekly water demand  of 300,000 litres that is currently delivered by truck to urban slums110 sq m could meet the annual demand for the irrigation of the city's green spacesFog water could be used for soil-free (hydroponic) agriculture, with yields of 33 to 44lb (15 to 20kg) of green vegetables in a month",

      "Alto Hospicio is on the edge of the Atacama Desert - one of the driest places on Earth. With little to no precipitation, the main water source of cities in the region are underground aquifers - rock layers that contain water-filled spaces - that were last refilled thousands of years ago.",
      "With urban populations growing, and demand on those water supplies from mining and industry, the scientists say there is an urgent need for other sustainable sources of clean water.",
      "Dr Gamberini explained that Chile is \"very special\" for its sea fog, \"because we have the ocean along the whole country and we have the mountains\".",
      "Her team is currently working on a \"fog harvesting map\" of the whole country.",
      "\"Water from the clouds\", as Dr Carter describes it, could, she said, \"enhance our cities' resilience to climate change, while improving access to clean water\".",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:23:37 GMT",
    "summary": "The planet's glaciers have lost 5% of their ice in little over 20 years, according to a major study.",
    "story": [
      "The world's glaciers are melting faster than ever recorded under the impact of climate change, according to the most comprehensive scientific analysis to date.",
      "Mountain glaciers - frozen rivers of ice \u2013 act as a freshwater resource for millions of people worldwide and lock up enough water to raise global sea-levels by 32cm (13in) if they melted entirely.",
      "But since the turn of the century, they have lost more than 6,500 billion tonnes \u2013 or 5% \u2013 of their ice.",
      "And the pace of melting is increasing. Over the past decade or so, glacier losses were more than a third higher than during the period 2000-2011.",
      "The study combined more than 230 regional estimates from 35 research teams around the world, making scientists even more confident about exactly how fast glaciers are melting, and how they will evolve in the future.",
      "Glaciers are excellent indicators of climate change.",
      "In a stable climate, they remain roughly the same size, gaining about as much ice through snowfall as they lose through melting.",
      "But glaciers have been shrinking pretty much everywhere over the past 20 years as temperatures have risen due to human activities, principally burning fossil fuels.",
      "Between 2000 and 2023, glaciers outside the major ice-sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost around 270 billion tonnes of ice a year on average.",
      "These numbers aren't easy to get your head around. So Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service and lead author of the study, uses an analogy.",
      "The 270 billion tonnes of ice lost in a single year \"corresponds to the [water] consumption of the entire global population in 30 years, assuming 3 litres per person and day\", he told BBC News.",
      "The rate of change in some regions has been particularly extreme. Central Europe, for example, has lost 39% of its glacier ice in little over 20 years.",
      "The novelty of this study, published in the journal Nature, is not so much finding that glaciers are melting faster and faster \u2013 we already knew that. Instead, its strength lies in drawing together evidence from across the research community.",
      "There are various ways of estimating how glaciers are changing, from field measurements to different types of satellite data. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Direct measurements on glaciers, for example, give very detailed information, but are only available for a tiny fraction of the more than 200,000 glaciers worldwide.",
      "By systematically combining these different approaches, scientists can be much more certain about what's going on.",
      "These community estimates \"are vital as they give people confidence to make use of their findings\", said Andy Shepherd, head of the Department of Geography and Environment at Northumbria University, who was not an author of the recent study.",
      "\"That includes other climate scientists, governments, and industry, plus of course anyone who is concerned about the impacts of global warming.\"",
      "Glaciers take time to fully respond to a changing climate \u2013 depending on their size, anywhere between a few years and many decades.",
      "That means they will continue to melt in the years ahead.",
      "But, crucially, the amount of ice lost by the end of the century will strongly depend on how much humanity continues to warm the planet by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.",
      "This could be the difference between losing a quarter of the world's glacier ice, if global climate targets are met, and nearly half if warming continues uncontrolled, the study warns.",
      "\"Every tenth of a degree of warming that we can avoid will save some glaciers, and will save us from a lot of damage,\" Prof Zemp explained.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is the Paris climate agreement?",
      "These consequences go beyond local changes to landscapes and ecosystems \u2013 or \"what happens on the glacier doesn't stay there\", as Prof Zemp puts it.",
      "Hundreds of millions of people worldwide rely to some extent on seasonal meltwater from glaciers, which act like giant reservoirs to help buffer populations from drought. When the glaciers disappear, so does their supply of water.",
      "And there are global consequences too. Even seemingly small increases to global sea-level \u2013 from mountain glaciers, the major Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets, and warmer ocean waters taking up more space - can significantly increase the frequency of coastal flooding.",
      "\"Every centimetre of sea-level rise exposes another 2 million people to annual flooding somewhere on our planet,\" said Prof Shepherd.",
      "Global sea-levels have already risen by more than 20cm (8in) since 1900, with around half of that coming since the early 1990s, and faster increases are expected in the decades ahead.",

    "title": "What is a sinkhole and how are they formed?",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 19:45:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Two sinkholes have appeared in the Surrey village of Godstone, but how have they formed and are they dangerous?",
    "story": [
      "Residents in the Surrey village of Godstone have been evacuated after two sinkholes opened up this week along large parts of the high street.",
      "The original hole first appeared late on Monday night, growing to at least 65ft (20m) long by Tuesday lunchtime.",
      "Sinkholes are not uncommon in the UK but can sometimes appear suddenly. What might be the causes and should we be more worried about them?",
      "What is a sinkhole?",
      "A sinkhole is a depression in the surface because the underlying rock has collapsed.",
      "They can be saucer-shaped or appear deeper more like shafts. If they occur in built-up areas they can appear more irregular as a road or another structure above can distort the shape.",
      "In Godstone, the collapsed ground is under a road which is partially concealing the size of the depression.",
      "How are they formed?",
      "Sinkholes can appear for many different reasons - it is often due to the geology but human factors can also be a cause.",
      "One of the most common reasons for a sinkhole is when rocks like limestone or chalk break down. This happens because carbon dioxide from the air dissolves in rainwater to form carbonic acid - this then percolates through the rock and reacts with it, causing it to dissolve.",
      "Sometimes this process can happen gradually, where the depression becomes larger over time.",
      "In other instances, the limestone sits below another layer of rock, which means that as it gets dissolved there are no immediate signs at the surface.",
      "The overlying rock, sometimes clay or sandstone, will then suddenly collapse into the depression beneath - called a 'collapse sinkhole'.",
      "These are most common in South Wales where sandstone rocks lie above caves in the limestone.",
      "But human activities can also accelerate the formation of sinkholes or cause the ground to collapse in a similar way.",
      "Andrew Farrant, British Geological Survey regional geologist for south-east England, suspects that is what has happened in Godstone and it is not a true sinkhole.",
      "He said that one theory is that a burst water main has caused a sudden influx of water into the sandstone bed \"flushing\" the rock out the way.",
      "Pete Burgess, of the Wealden Cave and Mines Society, said a quarry marked \"sand pit\" can be seen on 19th century maps of land directly under the sinkhole.",
      "He added that sand from the pit was dug out and used for building and gardening purposes.",
      "Mr Farrant said that sand pit had been filled in but he added that there had been a significant amount of historic mining in the area and it cannot be ruled out that there were some unmapped pits and quarries that have been built on.",
      "How common are sinkholes in the UK?",
      "They are common in the UK because of the abundance of limestone and chalk rock and historic mining activities.",
      "Limestone and chalk are formed from the deposit and compression of micro-organisms found in shallow warm seas. Millions of years ago the UK was located further south towards the equator and was much warmer with parts of the country submerged - creating the ideal conditions for these rock types to form.",
      "Vanessa Banks, expert in shallow geohazards and risks at the British Geological Survey, told the BBC's Radio 4 PM programme: \"Sinkholes occur in spates but many are not recorded as they occur in remote areas.\"",
      "She added that meteorological conditions play a role as extreme downpours can flush water through the rocks or put pressure on infrastructure like water mains.",
      "Last December, about 30 homes were evacuated in Merthyr Tydfil after the ground collapsed, and in 2014 sinkholes occurred at five to ten times the normal rate across south-east England after intense storm conditions.",
      "Are they dangerous?",
      "\"Collapse sinkholes\" which can appear suddenly and without any warnings at the surface, like cracks or subsidence, can be dangerous.",
      "In 2010, a sinkhole measuring 20m in diameter and 90m deep, appeared in Guatemala City which resulted in the death of one person. In this case heavy rains and poor drainage are thought to have weakened the underlying rock.",
      "And in January a truck cabin was swallowed by a sinkhole in the Japanese city of Yashio, apparently as the result of a sewer rupture. The truck's 74-year-old driver was reported missing.",
      "In the case of dissolution sinkholes geologists can indicate which areas are more at risk if the underlying rock is made up of chalk or limestone. For any new development in the UK the local planning authority does review the geology and any potential risks.",
      "But Dr Collins, reader in geology and geotechnical engineering at Brunel University, said that in this case where water infrastructure plays a role it is harder to predict potential ground collapses.",
      "\"The pipe rupture does highlight the challenge that comes with having buried infrastructure as they are often buried at depths in excess of a metre. The depth is to reduce the impact of deep freeze during a very cold winter.",
      "\"Unfortunately, this makes them hard to monitor and repairs can be difficult, including the replacement of soil in the excavated hole once the repair is complete,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Australian authorities are euthanising about 90 false killer whales which survived a mass stranding on a remote beach in Tasmania.",
      "A team of experts at the site said complex conditions have made it impossible to save them.",
      "They are part of a pod of 157 whales that had beached near Arthur River, in the island's north west. The rest had died shortly after the stranding.",
      "Tasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years.",
      "False killer whales are technically one of world's largest dolphin species, like their orca namesakes. They can grow up to 6m (19ft) and weigh 1.5 tonnes.",
      "Authorities on Wednesday said the pod had been stranded at the site for 24 to 48 hours, and the surviving animals were already under extreme stress.",
      "Local resident Jocelyn Flint told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she had travelled to the site on Wednesday morning after her son noticed the pod while out shark fishing overnight.",
      "\"There are babies... There's just families of them. Their eyes are open, they're looking at me, like 'help'.\"",
      "\"It's just absolutely horrific.\"",
      "The site - about 300km (186 miles) from the city of Launceston - is extremely difficult to access and transport any rescue equipment to, marine biologist Kris Carlyon told media.",
      "\"This is possibly the trickiest location I've seen in 16 years of doing this role in Tasmania,\" he said.",
      "\"We're talking a very rough, steep, single lane road into the site. We can get four-wheel drives in there, but not a lot else.\"",
      "Rough conditions meant returning the animals to the sea at the location they stranded was impossible, so an expert team tried to relocate two and refloat them, but were unsuccessful.",
      "\"The animals just can't get past the break to get out. They just keep turning around and coming back towards the beach,\" said Shelley Graham, from Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service.",
      "With conditions for the next two days forecast to be similar, expert wildlife veterinarians made the \"tough\" and \"confronting\" decision to euthanise the remaining whales.",
      "\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanasia is always a last resort,\" Dr Carlyon said.",
      "That grim task - which involves shooting the animals -  is expected to begin on Wednesday but continue on Thursday.",
      "Authorities are still working out how to dispose of the carcasses. The site has important cultural heritage for Aboriginal people so a department spokesperson earlier suggested \"it may be a case of... letting nature run its course\".",
      "Authorities have asked members of the public to avoid the site, with bushfires burning nearby and limited road access.",
      "More than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania - often on its west coast.",
      "Around 470 pilot whales were stranded further south at Macquarie Harbour in 2020 and about 350 of them died despite rescue efforts. Another 200 become stranded in the same harbour in 2022.",
      "Whales are highly social mammals and are well known for stranding in groups because they travel in large, close-knit communities which rely on constant communication.",
      "There are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disorientated after following fish they hunt to the shore.",
      "Others believe that one individual can mistakenly lead whole groups to shore.",

    "summary": "The world's frozen oceans keep the planet cool, but they currently have less ice than ever recorded before.",
    "story": [
      "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.",
      "Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.",
      "This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.",
      "Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).",
      "This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.",
      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",
      "But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.",
      "Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.",
      "\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.",
      "\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"",
      "Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.",
      "But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.",
      "The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.",
      "\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"",
      "Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.",
      "At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.",
      "But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.",
      "This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.",
      "As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.",
      "\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.",
      "In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.",
      "This \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.",
      "This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.",
      "But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.",
      "The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.",
      "Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.",
      "Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.",
      "\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.",
      "Sea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:23:37 GMT",
    "summary": "The planet's glaciers have lost 5% of their ice in little over 20 years, according to a major study.",
    "story": [
      "The world's glaciers are melting faster than ever recorded under the impact of climate change, according to the most comprehensive scientific analysis to date.",
      "Mountain glaciers - frozen rivers of ice \u2013 act as a freshwater resource for millions of people worldwide and lock up enough water to raise global sea-levels by 32cm (13in) if they melted entirely.",
      "But since the turn of the century, they have lost more than 6,500 billion tonnes \u2013 or 5% \u2013 of their ice.",
      "And the pace of melting is increasing. Over the past decade or so, glacier losses were more than a third higher than during the period 2000-2011.",
      "The study combined more than 230 regional estimates from 35 research teams around the world, making scientists even more confident about exactly how fast glaciers are melting, and how they will evolve in the future.",
      "Glaciers are excellent indicators of climate change.",
      "In a stable climate, they remain roughly the same size, gaining about as much ice through snowfall as they lose through melting.",
      "But glaciers have been shrinking pretty much everywhere over the past 20 years as temperatures have risen due to human activities, principally burning fossil fuels.",
      "Between 2000 and 2023, glaciers outside the major ice-sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost around 270 billion tonnes of ice a year on average.",
      "These numbers aren't easy to get your head around. So Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service and lead author of the study, uses an analogy.",
      "The 270 billion tonnes of ice lost in a single year \"corresponds to the [water] consumption of the entire global population in 30 years, assuming 3 litres per person and day\", he told BBC News.",
      "The rate of change in some regions has been particularly extreme. Central Europe, for example, has lost 39% of its glacier ice in little over 20 years.",
      "The novelty of this study, published in the journal Nature, is not so much finding that glaciers are melting faster and faster \u2013 we already knew that. Instead, its strength lies in drawing together evidence from across the research community.",
      "There are various ways of estimating how glaciers are changing, from field measurements to different types of satellite data. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.",
      "Direct measurements on glaciers, for example, give very detailed information, but are only available for a tiny fraction of the more than 200,000 glaciers worldwide.",
      "By systematically combining these different approaches, scientists can be much more certain about what's going on.",
      "These community estimates \"are vital as they give people confidence to make use of their findings\", said Andy Shepherd, head of the Department of Geography and Environment at Northumbria University, who was not an author of the recent study.",
      "\"That includes other climate scientists, governments, and industry, plus of course anyone who is concerned about the impacts of global warming.\"",
      "Glaciers take time to fully respond to a changing climate \u2013 depending on their size, anywhere between a few years and many decades.",
      "That means they will continue to melt in the years ahead.",
      "But, crucially, the amount of ice lost by the end of the century will strongly depend on how much humanity continues to warm the planet by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.",
      "This could be the difference between losing a quarter of the world's glacier ice, if global climate targets are met, and nearly half if warming continues uncontrolled, the study warns.",
      "\"Every tenth of a degree of warming that we can avoid will save some glaciers, and will save us from a lot of damage,\" Prof Zemp explained.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is the Paris climate agreement?",
      "These consequences go beyond local changes to landscapes and ecosystems \u2013 or \"what happens on the glacier doesn't stay there\", as Prof Zemp puts it.",
      "Hundreds of millions of people worldwide rely to some extent on seasonal meltwater from glaciers, which act like giant reservoirs to help buffer populations from drought. When the glaciers disappear, so does their supply of water.",
      "And there are global consequences too. Even seemingly small increases to global sea-level \u2013 from mountain glaciers, the major Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets, and warmer ocean waters taking up more space - can significantly increase the frequency of coastal flooding.",
      "\"Every centimetre of sea-level rise exposes another 2 million people to annual flooding somewhere on our planet,\" said Prof Shepherd.",
      "Global sea-levels have already risen by more than 20cm (8in) since 1900, with around half of that coming since the early 1990s, and faster increases are expected in the decades ahead.",

      "'If US is not doing it, why should we?'",
      "\"If the United States does not want to comply with the international agreement, why should a country like Indonesia comply with it?\" asked Hashim Djojohadikusumo, special envoy for climate change and energy of Indonesia, as reported by the country's government-run news agency Antara.",

      "Nithi Nesadurai, director with Climate Action Network Southeast Asia, said the signals from her region were concerning.",

      "At the end of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit on 14 February, the two countries issued a joint statement that \"reaffirmed\" the US would be \"a leading supplier of crude oil and petroleum products and liquified natural gas to India\".",
      "A few days after Trump's inauguration, South Korea, the world's third largest liquified natural gas importer, has hinted its intention to buy more American oil and gas aimed at reducing a trade surplus with the US and improving energy security, international media have reported from Seoul.",
      "Officials with Japan's largest power generator, JERA, have told Reuters they too want to increase purchases of liquified natural gas from the US to diversify supply, as it currently imports half of it from the Asia-Pacific region.",
      "\"There is certainly a threat that if the US seeks to either flood markets with cheap fossil fuels, or bully countries into buying more of its fossil fuels, or both, the global energy transition might be slowed,\" said Lorne Stockman, research director with Oil Change International, a research and advocacy organisation for transition to clean energy.",
      "Scientists have said there can be no new fossil fuel extraction and there needs to be a rapid reduction of carbon emissions (around 45% by 2030 from the 2019 level) if the world is to limit warming to 1.5 Celsius compared to the pre-industrial period.",
      "\"The economics of energy supply are a key driver of decarbonisation,\" said David Brown, director of energy transition practice at Wood Mackenzie, a global energy think-tank.",
      "\"The resource base of US energy supports the role of natural gas and liquids production. By contrast, import-dependent economies such as China, India, and those in Southeast Asia have a dramatic economic incentive to decarbonise sources of energy.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:45:06 GMT",
    "summary": "The world's frozen oceans keep the planet cool, but they currently have less ice than ever recorded before.",
    "story": [
      "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.",
      "Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.",
      "This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.",
      "Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).",
      "This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.",
      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",
      "But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.",
      "Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.",
      "\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.",
      "\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"",
      "Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.",
      "But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.",
      "The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.",
      "\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"",
      "Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.",
      "At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.",
      "But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.",
      "This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.",
      "As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.",
      "\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.",
      "In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.",
      "This \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.",
      "This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.",
      "But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.",
      "The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.",
      "Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.",
      "Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.",
      "\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.",
      "Sea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.",
      "\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.",

      "Staying with that age bracket, a third of the children who had used social media or messaging services had their own account, and 80% of them had help setting up their account/accounts from a parent or carer.",
      "The study also found only 13% of children who had an account had them shut down by the social media companies or messaging services for being under the age of 13.",

    "summary": "It says a new chip it has created could end up being as important a breakthrough as the semiconductor.",
    "story": [
      "Microsoft has unveiled a new chip called Majorana 1 that it says will enable the creation of quantum computers able to solve \"meaningful, industrial-scale problems in years, not decades\".",
      "It is the latest development in quantum computing - tech which uses principles of particle physics to create a new type of computer able to solve problems ordinary computers cannot.",
      "Creating quantum computers powerful enough to solve important real-world problems is very challenging - and some experts believe them to be decades away.",
      "Microsoft says this timetable can now be sped up because of the \"transformative\" progress it has made in developing the new chip involving a \"topological conductor\", based on a new material it has produced.",
      "The firm believes its topoconductor has the potential to be as revolutionary as the semiconductor was in the history of computing.",
      "But experts have told the BBC more data is needed before the significance of the new research - and its effect on quantum computing - can be fully assessed.",
      "Jensen Huang - boss of the leading chip firm, Nvidia - said in January he believed \"very useful\" quantum computing would come in 20 years.",
      "Chetan Nayak, a technical fellow of quantum hardware at Microsoft, said he believed the developments would shake up conventional thinking about the future of quantum computers.",
      "\"Many people have said that quantum computing, that is to say useful quantum computers, are decades away,\" he said. \"I think that this brings us into years rather than decades.\"",
      "Travis Humble, director of the Quantum Science Center of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US, said he agreed Microsoft would now be able to deliver prototypes faster - but warned there remained work to do.",
      "\"The long term goals for solving industrial applications on quantum computers will require scaling up these prototypes even further,\" he said.",
      "What is quantum computing?",
      "Quantum computing holds the promise of carrying out calculations that would take today's systems millions of years and could unlock discoveries in medicine, chemistry and many other fields.",
      "There are numerous important problems that \"classical\" computers, of the sort we use every day in our phones, and laptops and power most modern applications, cannot solve.",
      "But these are problems quantum machines might be able to rapidly crack, promising new discoveries by creating new medicines or designing better batteries.",
      "A host of technology firms, including the silicon valley giants, are currently engaged in a multi-billion dollar race to develop a quantum computer powerful enough to solve these problems.",
      "Microsoft is approaching the problem differently to most of its rivals.",
      "Its path to building a quantum computer relied upon being able to create a \"topoconductor\" or topological conductor.",
      "It uses the newly developed material to create a new state of matter- a so-called \"topological state\" which isn't a gas, liquid or solid and, until relatively recently, had existed only in theory.",
      "Specifically, it relies on so-called Majorana particles, which themselves were previously considered theoretical - work claiming that they had been discovered in 2018 had to be retracted.",
      "High risk, high reward?",
      "While rivals produced a steady stream of announcements - notably Google's \"Willow\" at the end of 2024 - Microsoft seemed to be taking longer.",
      "Pursuing this approach was, in the company's own words, a \"high-risk, high-rewards\" strategy, but one it now believes is going to pay off.",
      "\"In the same way that the invention of semiconductors made today's smartphones, computers and electronics possible, topoconductors and the new type of chip they enable offer a path to developing quantum system,\" Microsoft said.",
      "The biggest challenge of quantum computers relates to their fundamental building block, called a qubit, which is incredibly fast but also extremely difficult to control and prone to errors.",
      "The more qubits a chip has the more capable it is.",
      "Microsoft says it has put eight of its new topological qubits on its new chip - considerably less than the chips created by some of its rivals.",
      "However, it claims to have a path to scaling it up to a million qubits - which would create immense computing power.",
      "Professor Paul Stevenson of Surrey University said the research published by Microsoft was a \"significant step\", but he felt it had tough challenges ahead.",
      "\"Until the next steps have been achieved, it is too soon to be anything more than cautiously optimistic,\" he said.",
      "Chris Heunen, Professor of Quantum Programming at the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC he felt Microsoft's plans were \"credible\".",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 03:50:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's goal might be hindering the growth potential of the AI firm of his rival Sam Altman, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI's board of directors has officially rejected Elon Musk's nearly $100bn offer for the maker of what is the world's best-known artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT.",
      "But the unsolicited bid might not be a failure - at least as far as Musk is concerned, experts say.",
      "That's because the offer could still complicate CEO Sam Altman's plans to transform OpenAI from a non-profit controlled entity to a for-profit company.",
      "Musk is \"basically trying to stymie OpenAI's growth trajectory,\" said University of Cambridge associate teaching professor Johnnie Penn in an interview with the BBC.",
      "Profit & non-profit",
      "Last week, Musk and a consortium of investors including Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel tabled a $97.4bn (\u00a378.4bn) offer for all of OpenAI's assets.",
      "It was a huge sum - but less than the $157bn the firm was valued at in a funding round just four months ago, and much lower than the $300bn that some think it is worth now.",
      "Complicating all of this is OpenAI's unusual structure which involves a partnership between non-profit and for-profit arms.",
      "Mr Altman is understood to want to change that, stripping it of its non-profit board.",
      "That involves costs which Mr Musk is seemingly trying to inflate.",
      "\"What Musk is trying to do here is raise the perceived value of the non-profit arm of OpenAI, so that OpenAI has to pay more to get out of the obligations it has to its own non-profit,\" said Dr Penn.",
      "The value of its non-profit assets isn't clear. With his bid, Musk was floating a price, according to Cornell University senior lecturer Lutz Finger, who is also the founder and CEO of AI startup R2Decide.",
      "\"By Musk putting a price tag on the non-profit part, he makes the split way more expensive for Altman to do,\" Mr Finger told the BBC. \"It's very simple.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "'Missed the AI train'",
      "Mr Musk justified his actions by saying he wants to return OpenAI - which he co-founded - to its non-profit roots and original mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity.",
      "Others, though, suggest he has somewhat less noble motives linked to his own AI company xAI and chatbot Grok, which have received a lacklustre response from the public.",
      "\"Musk has missed the AI train, somewhat. He's behind, and he has made several attempts to catch up,\" Mr Finger said.",
      "Now, Mr Finger says, Mr Musk is trying to kneecap his most formidable competitor.",
      "An already-tense relationship appeared to worsen further last week with Mr Altman taunting Mr Musk's offer on X, and Mr Musk retorting by calling his onetime partner a \"swindler\".",
      "Mr Altman then hit back in an interview with Bloomberg, opining that Mr Musk is not \"a happy person\" and saying his decisions are made from a \"position of insecurity\".",
      "The tit-for-tat is also playing out in court, where US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is considering Mr Musk's request for an injunction that would block OpenAI from its planned conversion.",
      "He claims that he will be irreparably harmed without her intervention.",
      "\"It is plausible that what Mr Musk is saying is true. We'll find out. He'll sit on the stand,\" Gonzalez Rogers said during a hearing in Musk v Altman earlier this month in Oakland, California.",
      "According to OpenAI's lawyers, Mr Musk's recent bid contradicts his earlier claims that OpenAI's assets cannot be transferred away for \"private gain.\"",
      "\"[O]ut of court, those constraints evidently do not apply, so long as Musk and his allies are the buyers,\" their reply brief states.",
      "Some observers say making a deal never appeared to be his goal.",
      "\"I think he's just trying to create noise and news and consternation,\" says Karl Freund, founder and principal analyst at Cambrian-AI.",
      "But in addition to causing problems for his old rival, that strategy could inflict lasting damage on Mr Musk's own reputation.",
      "\"He's brilliant. He creates incredible companies that are doing incredible things. But his personal agenda is causing people to question his motives,\" Mr Freund said."

    "title": "Critics say new Google rules put profits over privacy",
    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Google is allowing advertisers to collect more personal information, which is harder for users to control.",
    "story": [
      "Privacy campaigners have called Google's new rules on tracking people online \"a blatant disregard for user privacy.\"",
      "Changes which come in on Sunday permit so-called \"fingerprinting\", which allows online advertisers to collect more data about users including their IP addresses and information about their devices.",
      "Google says this data is already widely used by other companies, and it continues to encourage responsible data use.",
      "However the company had previously come out strongly against this kind of data collection, saying in a 2019 blog that fingerprinting \"subverts user choice and is wrong.\"",
      "But in a post announcing the new rule changes, Google said the way people used the internet - such as devices like smart TVs and consoles - meant it was harder to target ads to users using conventional data collection, which users control with cookie consent.",
      "It also says more privacy options provide safety to users.",
      "Google told the BBC in a statement: \"Privacy-enhancing technologies offer new ways for our partners to succeed on emerging platforms... without compromising on user privacy.\"",
      "But opponents to the change say fingerprinting and IP address collection are a blow to privacy because it is harder for users to control what data is collected about them.",
      "\"By allowing fingerprinting, Google has given itself - and the advertising industry it dominates - permission to use a form of tracking that people can't do much to stop,\" said Martin Thomson, distinguished engineer at Mozilla, a rival to Google.",
      "What is fingerprinting?",
      "Fingerprinting collects information about a person's device and browser and puts it together to create a profile of that person.",
      "The information is not explicitly collected in order to advertise to people, but it can be used to target specific ads based on that user's data.",
      "For example, a person's screen size or language settings are legitimately needed in order to display a website properly.",
      "But when that is combined with their time zone, browser type, battery level - and many other data points - it can create a unique combination of settings which makes it easier to work out who is using a web service.",
      "These details along with someone's IP address - the unique identifier used by internet devices - were previously prohibited by Google for ad targeting.",
      "Privacy campaigners say that unlike cookies, which are small files stored on a local device, users have little control over whether they send fingerprinting information to advertisers.",
      "\"By explicitly allowing a tracking technique that they previously described as incompatible with user control, Google highlights its ongoing prioritisation of profits over privacy,\" said Lena Cohen, staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "\"The same tracking techniques that Google claims are essential for online advertising also expose individuals' sensitive information to data brokers, surveillance companies, and law enforcement,\" she added.",
      "'Irresponsible' change",
      "\"My argument would be that fingerprinting sits in a little bit of a grey area,\" says Pete Wallace, from advertising technology company GumGum.",
      "\"Should people feel comfortable staying in a grey area of privacy? I'd say no,\" he adds.",
      "GumGum, which has worked with the BBC on ad campaigns before, relies on something called contextual advertising, which uses other data points to target adverts to online users, such as keywords on the website they are on - rather than their personal data.",
      "Mr Wallace says allowing fingerprinting represents a shift in the industry.",
      "\"Fingerprinting feels like it's taking a much more business-centric approach to the use of consumer data rather than a consumer-centric approach,\" he says.",
      "\"This sort of flip-flopping is, in my opinion, detrimental to that route that the industry seemed to be taking towards this idea of really putting consumer privacy at the forefront.\"",
      "He adds that he hopes ad tech companies conclude \"that it isn't the appropriate way to use consumer data,\" but expects them to look at fingerprinting as an option in order to better target adverts.",
      "Advertising is the lifeblood of the internet business model, and allow many websites to be freely available to users without them having to directly pay to access them.",
      "But in return, users often have to give up private information about themselves so that advertisers can show them relevant adverts.",
      "The UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), says \"fingerprinting is not a fair means of tracking users online because it is likely to reduce people's choice and control over how their information is collected.\"",
      "In a blog post in December, the ICO's Executive Director of Regulatory Risk Stephen Almond wrote: \"We think this change is irresponsible.\"",
      "He added that advertisers and businesses which decide to use this technology will have to demonstrate how they are staying within data and privacy laws in the UK.",
      "\"Based on our understanding of how fingerprinting techniques are currently used for advertising this is a high bar to meet,\" he wrote.",
      "Google said in a statement: \"We look forward to further discussions with the ICO about this policy change.",
      "\"We know that data signals like IP addresses are already commonly used by others in the industry today, and Google has been using IP responsibly to fight fraud for years.\"",
      "A spokesperson added: \"We continue to give users choice whether to receive personalised ads, and will work across the industry to encourage responsible data use.\"",
      "Should you have to pay for online privacy?",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 11:23:07 GMT",
    "summary": "They say the US should re-evaluate its cyber-security partnership with the UK unless the \"dangerous\" request is withdrawn.",
    "story": [
      "Two US lawmakers have strongly condemned what they call the UK's \"dangerous\"  and \"shortsighted\" request to be able to access encrypted data stored by Apple users worldwide in its cloud service.",
      "Senator Ron Wyden and Congressman Andy Biggs have written to national intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard saying the demand threatens the privacy and security of the US.",
      "They urge her to give the UK an ultimatum: \"Back down from this dangerous attack on US cybersecurity, or face serious consequences.\"",
      "The BBC has contacted the UK government for comment.",
      "\"While the UK has been a trusted ally, the US government must not permit what is effectively a foreign cyberattack waged through political means\", the US politicians wrote.",
      "If the UK does not back down Ms Gabbard should \"reevaluate US-UK cybersecurity arrangements and programs as well as US intelligence sharing\", they suggest.",
      "What is the UK seeking?",
      "The request for the data emerged last week.",
      "It applies to all content stored using what Apple calls \"Advanced Data Protection\" (ADP).",
      "This uses end-to-end encryption, where only the account holder can access the data stored. Apple itself cannot see it.",
      "It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it.",
      "The demand was first reported by the Washington Post, quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.",
      "The Home Office said then: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\"",
      "Apple declined to comment, but says on its website that it views privacy as a \"fundamental human right\".",
      "The order has been served by the Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act, which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "Under the law, the demand by the Home Office cannot be made public.",
      "Senator Wyden and Congressman Biggs say agreeing to the request would \"undermine Americans' privacy rights and expose them to espionage by China, Russia and other adversaries\".",
      "They state that Apple does not make different versions of its encryption software for each country it operates in and, therefore, Apple customers in the UK will use the same software as Americans.",
      "\"If Apple is forced to build a backdoor in its products, that backdoor will end up in Americans' phones, tablets, and computers, undermining the security of Americans' data, as well as of the countless federal, state and local government agencies that entrust sensitive data to Apple products.\"",
      "The move by the UK government has stunned experts and worried privacy campaigners, with Privacy International calling it  an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals.",
      "However the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption as part of criminal investigations.",
      "In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device.",
      "That same year, the US dropped a similar case after it was able to gain access by discovering the passcode of an alleged drug dealer.",
      "Similar cases have followed, including in 2020, when Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a man who carried out a mass shooting at a US air base. The FBI later said it had been able to \"gain access\" to the phones.",
      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",
      "Rather it would want to access it if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.",
      "Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.",
      "Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would \"never build a back door\" in its products.",
      "WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has also previously said it would choose being blocked over weakening message security.",
      "But even withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based there."

They pointed out that the link used to buy the coins referenced a phrase the president uses in his speeches.",
      "But Argentina's presidential office said on Saturday that the decision to remove the post was to avoid \"speculation\" following public reaction to the launch of the cryptocurrency.",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky needs to return to the negotiating table and strike a deal on US access to Ukraine's critical minerals, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz has said.",
      "On Wednesday, Zelensky rejected US demands for a share of its rare earth minerals - a \"deal\" Trump said would reflect the amount of aid the US had provided to Ukraine during its war with Russia.",
      "The comments, made at a White House briefing on Thursday, overshadowed a meeting in Kyiv between Zelensky and Keith Kellogg, the US chief envoy to Ukraine.",
      "Waltz said the White House was \"frustrated\" with Zelensky after he levelled \"unacceptable\" insults at US President Donald Trump earlier this week.",
      "Ukraine holds huge deposits of critical elements and minerals, including lithium and titanium, as well as sizeable coal, gas, oil and uranium deposits - a supply worth billions of dollars.",
      "Earlier on Thursday, Waltz suggested US access to rare minerals in Ukraine could be exchanged in return for aid - or even as compensation for the support the US has already provided.",
      "\"We presented the Ukrainians really an incredible, and a historic opportunity,\" the adviser said, adding that it would be \"sustainable\" and \"the best\" security guarantee Ukraine could hope for.",
      "But Zelensky had refused the offer, saying: \"I can't sell our state.\"",
      "Waltz's comments in the White House news briefing came shortly after the conclusion of Zelensky's meeting with Kellogg in Kyiv, after which the Ukrainian leader announced he was ready to make an \"investment and security agreement\" with the US to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "The meeting was hailed as \"productive\" by Zelensky - but it more closely resembled an awkward political date.",
      "As the senior members of Donald Trump's team continued to engage directly with Moscow, the retired general had said he was in Kyiv to \"listen\".",
      "But it soon became apparent he wouldn't speak, publicly that is, after a news conference was cancelled at the last minute.",
      "The BBC understands it was a US decision, with Ukrainian sources claiming they believed Kellogg had been \"sidelined\" by the White House.",
      "The meeting with Kellogg had been of huge importance to Kyiv, given that officials are relying on the special envoy to relay its needs to Washington.",
      "In a post shared on X, the Ukrainian president said he and the US special envoy had \"a detailed conversation about the battlefield situation, how to return our prisoners of war, and effective security guarantees\".",
      "He added: \"Ukraine is ready for a strong, effective investment and security agreement with the president of the United States.\"",
      "However, the possible reasons for Mr Kellogg not wanting to face questions are mounting.",
      "Kellogg's meeting comes in the context of a war of words between his boss Donald Trump and Ukraine's leader, which culminated in the US president referring to Zelensky as a \"dictator without elections\".",
      "Trump also blamed him for starting Russia's invasion.",
      "Now there are reports that the US is refusing to recognise a UN resolution which labels Moscow as the aggressor while recognising Ukraine's territorial integrity.",

      "The war began when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, following its earlier annexation of Ukrainian territory.",
      "Trump, who has been in office for one month, believes US involvement in the war is not in America's interest - and in a radical reversal of previous US foreign policy, he has chosen to negotiate directly with Russia to secure a quick end to the conflict.",

      "US Senator Mitch McConnell has announced that he will not seek re-election in 2026 following a 40-year career in Congress.",
      "McConnell, 83, was the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, but stepped down from Republican leadership while facing health issues.",
      "Despite supporting much of Donald Trump's agenda during his first administration, McConnell has become a more vocal critic of the president as he faces retirement at the end of his term.",
      "\"I have some unfinished business to attend to,\" he said in a speech on the Senate floor that announced that his \"current term in the Senate will be my last\".",
      "In his speech, McConnell encouraged his fellow Senators to use their constitutional powers at a time when Trump has sought to greatly expand the reach of the presidency.",
      "McConnell has voted against Trump's appointments the most of all Senate Republicans by opposing Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence and Robert F Kennedy Jr for health secretary.",
      "He stressed that Congress is a co-equal branch of government to the president's, and it was a fundemental responsibility to confirm federal officials who \"possess authentic devotion to the rule of law above all else\".",
      "\"The weight of our power to advise and consent has never been lost on me,\" said McConnell, who had himself thwarted many a Democratic president's agenda in the legislative branch.",
      "At the end of his speech, senators and staff applauded and gave him a standing ovation.",
      "The Kentucky politician developed a reputation as a wily tactitian and perpetual thorn in the side of Democrats. Even when his party was in the minority, McConnell used arcane procedures and blunt political force to achieve sometimes seismic results.",
      "In one of his most stunning manoeuvres, he held up President Barack Obama's US Supreme Court nomination at the end of his second term.",
      "The blockade allowed an incoming president Trump to appoint a conservative judge instead, paving the way for a sweeping transformation of the nation's highest court. That, in turn, has led to the overturning of national abortion rights and a broad expansion of presidential immunity and power.",
      "McConnell also oversaw Trump's remaking of the federal judiciary, helping the president appoint a new slate of conservative judges across the US.",
      "But McConnell cooled significantly on the former president after the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol, where McConnell and other lawmakers were swept into hiding from a violent mob.",
      "\"There's no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,\" McConnell said in a speech following the attack.",

    "story": [
      "More than 80% of Australian children aged eight to 12 use social media or messaging services that are only meant to be for over-13s, according to new research.",
      "It comes as Australia plans to implement a total social media ban for under-16s that is expected by the end of this year.",
      "The country's internet regulator, eSafety, found YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat were the most popular platforms used by young children.",

      "The companies in question - Discord, Google (YouTube), Meta (Facebook and Instagram), Reddit, Snap and Twitch -  did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Users of all of these platforms must be 13 and over to have an account, though there are some exceptions.",
      "For example, YouTube has Family Link - when an account is accessible for children under the age of 13 under the supervision of a guardian - and the separate app YouTube Kids, which is specifically made for children.",
      "In the report, usage of YouTube Kids was not included for this reason.",
      "It has been reported that YouTube is likely to be spared from the social media ban when it comes into force.",

      "In its response to the study, TikTok took the opportunity to criticise the Australian authorities over its stance on YouTube. \"This report again shines a spotlight on the government's decision to give an exclusive carve out to the most popular social media platform for young Australians from the under 16 ban,\" said a spokesperson.",
      "\"Australian parents and guardians have a right to know what evidence, if any, supports the government's decision.\"",

      "Researchers questioned over 1,500 children across Australia aged between eight and 15 about their usage of social media and messaging platforms.",
      "They found 84% of the children aged between eight and 12 who were surveyed had used at least one social media or messaging service since the beginning of last year. Over half of them used it via the account of a parent or carer.",
      "Staying with that age bracket, a third of the children who had used social media or messaging services had their own account, and 80% of them had help setting up their account/accounts from a parent or carer.",
      "The study also found only 13% of children who had an account had them shut down by the social media companies or messaging services for being under the age of 13.",
      "If you take YouTube out of the findings entirely, the report found 44% of children aged eight to 12 who were surveyed had used at least one other social media platform last year.",
      "'Inconsistency'",
      "\"These findings indicate there is inconsistency across industry regarding the steps taken to assess the age of end-users at various points in the user experience,\" the report's authors said.",
      "\"However, there is one thing they have in common: a lack of robust interventions at the point of account sign-up to a service to prevent someone under 13 from providing a false age or birthdate to set up an account.\"",
      "The regulator's report also surveyed the platforms themselves, which were asked how they verify the ages of younger users.",
      "Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube told the authors they deployed tools and technology to detect whether a user may be under the age of 13 once they were using the service.",
      "\"Proactive tools and technologies may rely on a user actively engaging with a service (such as connecting with others, communicating with others, sharing and creating content) to detect relevant signals,\" the report said.",
      "\"This may require time and engagement to detect a child under 13, and in that time the child may be exposed to risks and harms.\""

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 05:13:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Research in Chile could help to provide drinking water for some of the world's most arid places.",
    "story": [
      "Capturing water from fog - on a large scale - could provide some of the driest cities in the world with drinking water.",
      "This is what researchers in Chile have concluded after studying the potential of fog harvesting in the desert city of Alto Hospicio in the north of the country.",
      "Average rainfall in the region is less than 0.19in (5mm) per year.",
      "\"Like a lot of cities, Alto Hospicio has its social problems,\" said lead researcher Dr Virginia Carter Gamberini, from Universidad Mayor. \"There is a lot of poverty\", she explained, and many people there have no direct access to the networks that supply clean water.",
      "Many who live in the city's poorest communities rely on drinking water that is delivered by truck.",
      "However, clouds of fog that regularly gather over the mountain city are an untapped source, researchers say.",
      "How do you harvest fog?",
      "Capturing fog water is remarkably simple - a mesh is hung between poles, and when the moisture-laden clouds pass through that fine mesh, droplets form. The water is then channelled into pipes and storage tanks.",
      "It has been used at a small scale for several decades, mainly in rural South and Central America - in places with the right foggy conditions. One of the biggest fog water harvesting systems is in Morocco, on the edge of the Sahara Desert.",
      "However, Dr Carter says a \"new era\" of much larger-scale fog harvesting could provide a more  secure and sustainable supply of water in urban environments where it is most needed.",
      "She and her colleagues carried out assessments of how much water can be produced by fog harvesting, and combined that information with studies of cloud formation in satellite images and with weather forecasts.",
      "From this, they concluded that the clouds that regularly form over the Pacific - and are blown across the coastal mountain city - could provide the people of Alto Hospicio's slums with a sustainable source of drinking water. They published their findings in a paper in the journal Frontiers of Environmental Science.",

      "World's glaciers melting faster than ever recorded",
      "Concerns UK's AI ambitions could lead to water shortages",
      "Alto Hospicio's fog forms over the Pacific Ocean - when warm, moist air flows over cold water - and is then blown over the mountains. The reliably foggy conditions here allowed Dr Carter and her colleagues to pinpoint areas where the largest volumes of water could be harvested regularly from the clouds.",
      "Based on an annual average water collection rate of 2.5 litres per square metre of mesh per day, the researchers worked out:",
      "17,000 sq m of mesh could produce enough water to meet the weekly water demand  of 300,000 litres that is currently delivered by truck to urban slums110 sq m could meet the annual demand for the irrigation of the city's green spacesFog water could be used for soil-free (hydroponic) agriculture, with yields of 33 to 44lb (15 to 20kg) of green vegetables in a month",

      "Alto Hospicio is on the edge of the Atacama Desert - one of the driest places on Earth. With little to no precipitation, the main water source of cities in the region are underground aquifers - rock layers that contain water-filled spaces - that were last refilled thousands of years ago.",
      "With urban populations growing, and demand on those water supplies from mining and industry, the scientists say there is an urgent need for other sustainable sources of clean water.",

      "Her team is currently working on a \"fog harvesting map\" of the whole country.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 23:08:57 GMT",
    "summary": "Yoon Suk Yeol's most fanatic followers believe the opposition wants to turn South Korea into a communist country.",
    "story": [
      "On a cold January afternoon, a young pharmacy student, Shin Jeong-min, waited restlessly outside South Korea's Constitutional Court, as the country's suspended president arrived to fight his impeachment.",
      "While Yoon Suk Yeol testified, she chanted along with hundreds of his incensed and worried supporters, who have rallied around him ever since his failed attempt to impose martial law. \"Release him now. Cancel his impeachment,\" they shouted.",
      "\"If the president is impeached and the opposition leader is elected, our country will become one with North Korea and Kim Jong Un,\" Jeong-min said, citing a theory popular among President Yoon's most fanatical followers: that the left-leaning opposition party wants to unify with the North and turn South Korea into a communist country.",
      "At 22 years old, Jeong-min stands out from the legion of elderly Koreans who have always feared and despised the North, and make up the bulk of those who hold these far-right conspiratorial beliefs.",
      "That generation of Koreans, now in its 60s and 70s, lived through the Cold War and remembers bitterly the devastating aftermath of North Korea's invasion in the 1950s.",
      "When Yoon declared martial law in early December, he played on these fears to justify his power grab.",
      "Without citing evidence, he claimed that \"North Korean communist forces\" had infiltrated the opposition party and were trying to overthrow the country. They needed to be \"eradicated\", he said, as he moved swiftly to ban political activity and put the army in charge.",
      "Two months on from his failed coup, an anti-communist frenzy is gripping Yoon's supporters, young and old.",
      "Even some who had never given North Korea or communism much thought are now convinced their dynamic democracy is on the brink of being turned into a leftist dictatorship \u2013 and that their leader had no choice but to remove people's democratic rights in order to protect them from both Pyongyang and Beijing.",
      "Who is Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's impeached president?",
      "'My country is in crisis': A divided South Korea grapples with Yoon's arrest",
      "\"This a war between communism and democracy,\" said one office worker in his 40s, who had slipped out of work to join the protest at the court.",
      "Another man, in his 30s, adamantly argued the president had to be returned to office as soon as possible. \"He's going to arrest all the North Korean spies,\" he said.",
      "Such threats were once very real. During the 1960s and 70s, spies would regularly attempt to infiltrate the government.",
      "In 1968, a group of North Korean commandos crawled across the border and tried to assassinate then President Park Chung-hee. A tree atop Seoul's Bugak mountain still bears the bullet marks from the intense gun battles that raged for nearly two weeks.",
      "In the 1980s, during the final years of South Korea's violent military dictatorship, a radical far-left student movement began to praise Pyongyang for its \"superior\" political system. They were labelled regime \"sympathisers\".",
      "It was also common for authoritarian leaders to accuse their political adversaries of being North Korean conspirators.",
      "\"Anti-communism became the dominant ideology of South Korea's military dictators, who used it to control society and justify restricting people's freedom,\" said Shin Jin-wook, a sociology professor at Chungang University.",
      "Today, these threats have dissipated. Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and advanced cyber-hacking abilities pose the greater risk, and you would struggle to find anyone in South Korea who wants to emulate life in the North. The political left and right are merely divided over how to deal with their troublesome neighbour.",
      "While the approach of Yoon's conservative People Power Party has been to try to threaten the North into submission with military superiority, the left-leaning Democratic Party prefers to engage with Pyongyang, believing the two countries can peacefully co-exist.",
      "The president has been accused of exploiting people's historic fears. \"Yoon's rhetoric almost completely matches that of past dictators, and he is the first president to use this anti-communist ideology so blatantly since Korea became a democracy in 1987,\" said Mr Shin.",
      "Not only has Yoon accused the parliament, led by the opposition Democratic Party, of being riddled with Pyongyang sympathisers, but he has dangled the idea that North Korea, with help from China, rigged last year's parliamentary election.",
      "\"This is fake news cooked up by Yoon to demonise the opposition and justify his completely undemocratic move,\" one Democratic Party lawmaker, Wi Sung-lac, told the BBC.",
      "\"We have a long history of fighting for democracy and freedom in Korea. We are the ones who managed to thwart Yoon's attempt to destroy Korea's democracy,\" he said, referring to the opposition politicians who pushed past troops and climbed over the parliament's walls during martial law to vote down the motion.",
      "Such ideas were previously pedalled by extreme conservative groups, said Lee Sangsin, a polling expert at the Korea Institute for National Unification.",
      "\"These groups were isolated. People didn't take much notice,\" he explained. \"But because Yoon is the president, his words carry weight, and many people have accepted what he said.\"",
      "This was evident at one of the pro-Yoon weekend rallies we attended last month. Far from being die-hard conspiracy theorists, nearly everyone we spoke to said Yoon had changed their thinking.",
      "\"At first I didn't support Yoon, but martial law opened my eyes,\" said Oh Jung-hyuk, a 57-year-old musician, there with his wife. \"We can see how deeply embedded leftist forces are in our society.\" One woman in her 40s told us she previously had doubts about Chinese vote rigging but had researched the issue after martial law and \"realised it was true\".",
      "Yoon's supporters often point to real events \u2013 how the previous Democratic Party President, Moon Jae-in, met Kim Jong Un to try to orchestrate a peace deal; that the current Democratic leader, Lee Jae-myung, is being investigated for helping to send millions of dollars to North Korea - then use these as evidence of a greater plot.",
      "\"This far-fetched conspiracy theory that China rigged the election is becoming more and more accepted,\" said the sociology professor Mr Shin. \"One of the most basic consensuses in a democracy is the premise of fair and free elections, and now we have people distrusting that. This is very extreme.\"",
      "As Yoon's unsubstantiated claims have taken root, his support seems to have grown. Although the majority of people in South Korea still want him permanently removed from office, the number has fallen. Last week it stood at 57%, compared to 75% in the week after the martial law declaration.",
      "Through his anti-communist rhetoric, Yoon has also effectively tapped into a simmering distrust of China. To fear North Korea now means to be wary of China too.",
      "At a recent weekend rally in Seoul, many supporters had swapped their trademark \"Stop the Steal\" election fraud placards for ones that read \"Chinese Communist Party OUT\".",
      "\"I believe China is interfering in all South Korea's political affairs. It's pulling the strings behind the scenes,\" said 66-year-old Jo Yeon-deok, who was holding one of the signs.",
      "According to the polling expert, Mr Lee, \"a growing portion of the public now believes China wants to turn South Korea into some kind of vassal state\".",
      "For those in their 20s and 30s who have never experienced real danger from North Korea, China is a more believable threat. Last year the Pew Research Centre found that South Korea and Hungary were the only two countries where the young had a more negative view of China than the old.",
      "But contrary to the information they are being fed, young people's fears have nothing to do with communism, said Cho Jin-man, a political scientist at Duksung Women's University.",
      "Until recently South Koreans felt their country was superior to China, Mr Cho explained - but as Beijing has become stronger and more assertive they have started to see it as a threat, especially since the US started treating it as such.",
      "On top of that, young people have a lot of grievances: they're struggling to find work or afford a home, and feel resentful when they see their universities catering to Chinese students.",
      "Communism, Mr Cho believes, is being used as a convenient catch-all bogeyman to stir up fear and hate. This message is amplified by far-right YouTube channels, particularly popular with young men.",
      "\"North Korea and China are my biggest concerns,\" said Kim Gyung-joo, a 30-year-old IT developer, who came alone to one of the rallies. He used to be left-wing like his friends, he said, and was initially very critical of the president's martial law order. But after researching the issue on YouTube he realised martial law was \"unavoidable\".",
      "\"If I'd been in the president's position, I'd have declared it too,\" he said.",
      "Nonetheless, Wi Sung-lac the opposition politician is not concerned about his party losing support. \"Even though these extreme views are spreading, they will be limited,\" he said. \"Most people understand who we really are, and they are yearning for a return to normality.\"",
      "Polling expert Lee Sang-sin is less sanguine, likening Yoon's supporters to \"a fast-growing cult\". The president's move was \"very divisive\", he said.",
      "\"It is going to have a lasting effect on Korean society\".",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 04:02:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Five things we learned in the LA case - including the stoicism of Rocky's longtime partner and fellow artist.",
    "story": [
      "It was a trial that could have dismantled the future for one of hip-hop's hottest stars.",
      "The felony assault trial of A$AP Rocky - in which he was found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend - captured global headlines. There were outbursts during the proceedings and surprise visits in court by his longtime partner, singer Rihanna.",
      "Jurors in Los Angeles heard three weeks of testimony chronicling the bitter falling-out of childhood friends and the fight that led to the rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, being charged on accusations he opened fire in the middle of a Hollywood street.",
      "After the rapper was acquitted, he left freely with singer Rihanna, who was seated behind him as the verdict was read.",
      "Here are five big things we learned while inside the courtroom.",
      "1) Unwavering support from Rihanna",
      "As the not guilty verdict was read in court, the rapper immediately jumped from the defence table and leapt over a wooden barrier to hug Rihanna, who was seated behind him in between his mother and sister.",
      "The couple embraced tightly, both breaking into tears as the courtroom erupted in cheers.",
      "Rihanna, a Grammy award-winning artist, was in court multiple days during the trial, including on Valentine's Day.",
      "On one of the days in court, she brought the couple's two young children, who were both dressed in suits with pacifiers in their mouths. You could hear them cooing inside the courtroom as they flipped through children's books.",
      "Joe Tacopina, the rapper's defence attorney, said Mr Mayers tried to shield Rihanna and their family from the criminal proceedings, but said that \"wild horses couldn't keep her away\" from the trial.",
      "Though she was often stoic and staring straight ahead while in court, she never flinched or showed emotion when prosecutors made negative comments about her partner.",
      "Following his acquittal, Rihanna expressed her gratitude on social media, stating, \"The glory belongs to God and God alone! Thankful, humbled by his mercy!\"",
      "2) A$AP Mob falling apart?",
      "The A$AP Mob is a hip-hop collective founded in 2006 in Harlem by a group of high school friends in New York.",
      "They adopted the \"A$AP\" title, which means \"Always Strive and Prosper\".",
      "The group, which has had more than 20 members over the years, have presented themselves as a family, but they've been plagued by jealousy, rivalries and disagreements since the death of its founder, A$AP Yams.",
      "Though there have been fallouts and issues between some members, this trial is the most notable instance of a complete dismantling of a relationship between members.",
      "A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, was once a close friend and member of the Mob, accused Mr Mayers, known as A$AP Rocky, of shooting him during an altercation in 2021.",
      "During the trial, his defence team argued that Mr Ephron harboured resentment toward his former friend, feeling sidelined as A$AP Rocky's fame grew and saw mainstream musical success. They argued Mr Ephron was after money.",
      "Several members of the A$AP Mob testified during the trial in favour of Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy challenged Mr Ephron's account of the events and suggested that he was the aggressor during the altercation, not Mr Mayers.",
      "A$AP Lou also took the stand, telling jurors that a Glock 43 magazine found during a search of Mr Mayers's home belonged to him, not the rapper.",
      "None of the A$AP members publicly testified for Relli.",
      "3) 'AWGE' still a mystery?",
      "Do you know what AWGE stands for? If you know, I think both me and the jury would love to still know.",
      "During the trial, AWGE came up when A$AP Twelvyy was on the stand. He was asked by prosecutors about its meaning. But before he could answer, A$AP Rocky - who was seated with his attorneys - cut in and shouted, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvvy abided and responded, \"I just know it's AWGE\".",
      "It was an astonishing moment. Criminal defendants don't typically say much during trials - let alone halt a witness from answering a question during their criminal trial.",
      "A$AP Rocky not guilty of firearm assault on LA street",
      "When asked about this exchange after the trial, A$AP Rocky's attorney Joe Tacopina explained what happened.",
      "He said it was an \"acronym for his company that had to do with his family. I'm gonna leave it at that.\" Mr Tacopina went on to explain it was a private thing that the rapper didn't want revealed publicly to millions, especially in a criminal court case.",
      "But the answer really led to more questions. What does it mean and why is it so secretive?",
      "Here's what we do know: AWGE is the name of A$AP Rocky's mysterious creative collective and record label, and it's long been the subject of intrigue.",
      "Founded in 2014, the group operates across music, fashion and art, collaborating with brands like Mercedes-Benz and PacSun. Members include artists, designers and directors, and everyone remains loyal to one rule: no one publicly reveals what \"AWGE\" actually stands for.",
      "On the company's website there are two rules listed: \"#1 Never reveal what AWGE means. #2 When in doubt always refer to rule #1.\"",
      "A$AP Rocky's fans do have some guesses though:",
      "\"A$AP Worldwide Global Enterprises\" \u2013 A possible nod to the A$AP Mob's broader brand and business ambitions.\"Ain't Wanna Go Explicit\" \u2013 This suggests that AWGE represents an inside joke or personal mantra within Rocky's circle.\"All We Got is Everything\" \u2013 A phrase that aligns with Rocky's philosophy of creativity and collaboration.\"A$AP Worldwide Genius Elite\" \u2013 Another theory that frames AWGE as a highly curated group of artists and visionaries.",

      "\"Ain't Wanna Go Explicit\" \u2013 This suggests that AWGE represents an inside joke or personal mantra within Rocky's circle.",
      "\"All We Got is Everything\" \u2013 A phrase that aligns with Rocky's philosophy of creativity and collaboration.",
      "\"A$AP Worldwide Genius Elite\" \u2013 Another theory that frames AWGE as a highly curated group of artists and visionaries.",
      "Despite the guesses, the rapper and his team have never officially confirmed any meaning.",
      "Instead, they've leaned into the secrecy, with members often responding to questions about AWGE with the phrase, \"If you know, you know.\"",
      "4) The height of A$AP Rocky's fame",
      "A$AP Rocky's trial unfolded at a pivotal moment in his career, with the rapper riding a wave of creative and commercial success.",
      "The rapper is set to release his first solo album in nearly a decade and is scheduled to co-headline Los Angeles' Rolling Loud festival in March 2025.",
      "Additionally, he is starring in a summer blockbuster alongside Denzel Washington. Director Spike Lee's upcoming film \"Highest 2 Lowest\" is slated for a summer release.",
      "But his influence extends beyond music\u2014his AWGE collective has been collaborating with brands like Mercedes-Benz and Puma. He's been celebrated for his fashion sense, too, and is known as being one of music's best-dressed men.",
      "In May, he is set to co-chair the 2025 Met Gala - one of fashion's biggest nights - alongside big names like Anna Wintour, British race car driver Lewis Hamilton, singer Pharrell Williams and basketball superstar LeBron James.",
      "His relationship with Rihanna, one of the most famous singers, has further cemented his cultural relevance.",
      "The couple welcomed their second child, Riot Rose, in August 2023, and their growing family had become a symbol of hip-hop royalty.",
      "5) Beef between the lawyers",
      "The trial wasn't just a battleground for the rapper's freedom\u2014it also saw intense clashes between legal teams.",
      "Celebrity defence attorney Joe Tacopina, known for his aggressive courtroom style, relentlessly challenged the credibility of the prosecution's key witness, A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron.",
      "He painted Mr Ephron as an opportunist seeking financial gain and called the prosecution's case flimsy due to a lack of physical evidence. Mr Ephron got so fed up with the rapper's attorney during questioning that he called Mr Tacopina \"annoying\".",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors pushed back, accusing Mr Tacopina of attempting to intimidate witnesses and dismiss key testimonies.",
      "Both sides were very liberal with their use of objections in court, and it sometimes felt as though both sides were trying to throw the other off their game, rather than being based on legal guidelines.",
      "It also got personal between the two sides.",
      "At one point during closing arguments, Mr Tacopina and prosecutor John Lewin traded misconduct allegations, with Mr Lewin accusing Mr Tacopina of using steroids and Mr Tacopina firing back by calling Lewin a \"hunchback\".",
      "After a short break, the judge attempted to lighten the mood by theatrically introducing the attorneys like boxers before resuming the trial.",

    "title": "YouTuber's 'dirty' comments spark massive row in India",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 22:50:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Remarks made by popular YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia on a talent show have led to a huge controversy.",
    "story": [
      "\"Dirty.\" \"Perverted mind.\" \"Disgusting.\"",
      "These were the words India's Supreme Court used on Tuesday while granting interim protection from arrest to a popular YouTuber who has been in the eye of a storm in the country over the past week.",
      "The furore began after Ranveer Allahbadia - whose YouTube channel BeerBiceps has eight million followers - asked a contestant the question: \"Would you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?\"",
      "The comments, made on the show India's Got Latent on 9 February, sparked  massive outrage, police cases and even death threats. YouTube quickly removed the episode, but that didn't stall the tide of anger directed at Allahbadia and the show.",
      "In fact, the amount of attention the incident has received is mind-boggling: it has made national headlines, been covered on primetime TV and some of India's most prominent news sites have even run live pages.",
      "Not surprising, considering the star status of Allahbadia. He has interviewed federal ministers, top Bollywood celebrities, cricketers and Hollywood actors. And last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi handed him a \"National Creators Awards\" trophy.",
      "Since the controversy erupted, Allahbadia and the show's creator, Samay Raina, have apologised for the comments and Raina has taken down all previous episodes of the show. The Supreme Court in its recent order has even banned Allahbadia from posting content on social media.",
      "But the incident continues to make news.",
      "\"It feels like the state is trying to make an example out of Allahbadia,\" says Apar Gupta, founder of the Internet Freedom Foundation. Saket Gokhale, an opposition lawmaker, also condemned the targeting of Allahbadia and the show.",
      "\"Crass content can be criticised if it offends you. However, you cannot have the state  persecute and lock up people for offending your 'moral sentiments',\" he wrote in a post on X.",
      "Popular comedian Vir Das also weighed in on the controversy and criticised news channels for their one-dimensional coverage of the incident and for taking a disparaging view of all digital content.",
      "Allahbadia's remarks and the subsequent backlash have triggered debates around free speech and India's obscenity laws; it has also sparked conversations around the thirst for viral content and the consequences its makers face when their content crosses lines upheld by the very people who watch it.",
      "Raina's show, which debuted in June, has been popular from the start, with each episode being viewed tens of millions of times on YouTube. And it hasn't shied away from kickstarting controversies either.",
      "The show has platformed some bizarre performances and judges and contestants have been seen making crass and crude comments more than a few times. Critics have accused the show of spewing misogynistic views and for body-shaming guests.",
      "A popular fashion influencer once walked out of the show after a male contestant compared her to a former adult film actress while another asked her about her \"body count\" (a slang term for the number of sexual partners a person has had).",
      "But that seems to have been the appeal of the show too.",
      "Fans of the show have hailed it for championing \"raw talent and unfiltered jokes\". Some have said that they liked the roasts - a form of insult comedy - which was popular on the show.",
      "Experts have underscored how, with the entertainment landscape exploding, digital content creators often feel compelled to push the envelope - even if it means resorting to the risqu\u00e9 and lewd - just to gain views and virality.",
      "It's safe to say the show pushed the envelope and the buttons of many. But then, it backfired.",
      "\"A lot of comedy, especially of a certain masculine kind, is cruel and punches down on people. It has a violent undercurrent. So if you contribute to that culture, it's not a shock if it comes back to bite you some day,\" filmmaker Paromita Vohra says.",
      "She adds that successful comedy calls for a fine-tuned awareness of the audience it is being performed for and what boundaries it can push.",
      "Interestingly, Allahbadia's question, which sparked the furore, was almost identical to the question asked by the host of an Australian comedy show called OG Crew's Truth or Drink. While the question didn't spark outrage in Australia, it has in India.",
      "\"The internet has made it possible for content to reach spaces and people it was not organically playing to. Unthinkingly appropriating content can have unexpected consequences,\" she says.",
      "But she also says that there's a need to guard against making such issues a question of morality.",
      "\"When such controversies erupt, there is always the risk of morality being weaponised to punish people who have gone against what's accepted by society,\" she says and adds that morality is increasingly being beaten into the legal framework of the country, which can have a divisive effect.",
      "Some critics have also accused the authorities of using the controversy as a smoke screen to divert attention from other pressing problems - like unemployment and pollution. Some fear that it will be used by the federal government as a reason to justify further regulating content creation.",
      "After the controversy, a report by NDTV news channel stated that a parliamentary panel was considering making laws around digital content stricter. The Supreme Court too has pushed for more regulations around online content.",
      "Mr Gupta says the state already has a \"tremendous amount of power\" to prosecute people accused of flouting various data and content laws and that while the state exercises its powers without restraint, content creators don't have as many legal safeguards to protect them.",
      "\"Instead of tighter laws, we need more reform; existing legal standards need to be more tolerant of free expression,\" he says.",
      "\"Other systems, like education and digital learning should be strengthened so that young people know to get their education from the classroom, and turn to the internet only for entertainment.\""

    "story": [
      "Blake Lively was not alone in her feelings about Justin Baldoni's alleged conduct while making the film \"It Ends with Us,\"\u00a0according to the amended complaint filed Tuesday in New York. The actor alleged that her costar and the film's director made other women uncomfortable on set and their concerns were documented, the complaint said.",
      "The amended complaint from Lively's legal team included new allegations against Baldoni and his business partner, Wayfarer Studios CEO Jamey Health. It described an alleged incident in 2023 \u2014 after Lively said she reported experiencing \"unwelcome and uncomfortable behavior\" to various leads on the movie \u2014 where another woman in the cast \"reported her own concerns regarding Mr. Baldoni's unwelcome behavior\" and the ways in which she saw it hurting the film.",
      "Baldoni apparently responded to the cast member, whose name doesn't appear in the lawsuit, soon afterward, according to the document. He apparently acknowledged in writing his awareness of the cast member's concerns and indicated things would change, but according to the amended lawsuit they didn't. The complaint referenced another woman in the cast who later told Lively she felt uncomfortable on set, too.",
      "\"Ms. Lively was not alone in raising allegations of on-set misconduct more than a year before the Film was edited,\" said Lively's attorneys, Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb, in a statement. The attorneys said their amended complaint contains evidence to support that accusation \"as well as evidence detailing the threats, harassment, and intimidation of not just Ms. Lively, but numerous innocent bystanders that have followed defendants' retaliatory campaign.\"",
      "Lively and Baldoni have been embroiled in a widely publicized legal battle\u00a0since December, when the New York Times published her sexual harassment allegations against Baldoni. She also alleged that Baldoni retaliated after she spoke up about what happened on set. Baldoni has since sued the newspaper and Lively for defamation, seeking $400 million from her and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, alleging extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "Lively's accusations against Baldoni have partly centered on his alleged use of retaliation tactics to discourage the actor from speaking up by turning public opinion against her. The amended complaint suggested the retaliatory efforts have devolved into \"dangerously extreme\" acts of cyberbullying, harassment and intimidation, allegedly directed not only toward just Lively, but also toward her family, others in the cast of \"It Ends with Us\" and some witnesses.",
      "\"The culture of fear, intimidation, harassment and threats is the predictable result of an incessant digital campaign to turn social media sentiment as dark and negative as is humanly possible,\" a spokesperson for Lively said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Jed Wallace, the owner of crisis public relations firm Street Relations, was also introduced as a defendant in Lively's lawsuit in the amended version. Wallace, who was named in an initial civil rights complaint Lively filed in California prior to suing Baldoni, has been accused of helping orchestrate an alleged smear campaign to damage Lively's reputation and disincentivize her from speaking out. He has denied Lively's allegations and recently filed a defamation suit of his own against her.",
      "Baldoni's attorney, Bryan Freedman, characterized the amended complaint from Lively as \"unsubstantial hearsay of unnamed persons.\"",
      "\"Since documents do not lie and people do, the upcoming depositions of those who initially supported Ms. Lively's false claims and those who are witnesses to her own behavior will be enlightening. What is truly uncomfortable here is Ms. Lively's lack of actual evidence,\" Freedman told CBS News in a statement.",

      "A jury found rapper A$AP Rocky not guilty of two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm Tuesday following a nearly month-long trial in Los Angeles.",
      "Screams were heard inside the courtroom upon the reading of the verdict as Rocky ran toward the back of the room to hug his longtime partner, Rihanna, who appeared inside the court on multiple occasions throughout the trial. Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, had faced up to 24 years in prison if convicted of all charges.",
      "At the start of the trial last month, he rejected a plea deal which carried a sentence of 180 days in jail.",
      "\"We said from day one, he was innocent. He turned down a plea for almost no jail time because he was innocent,\" Joe Tacopina, his defense attorney, told reporters outside the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center in downtown LA, where photographers swarmed Rocky and Rihanna following the verdict. \"We're honored to have represented this amazing family.\"",
      "Jurors had deliberated for just about three hours before reaching the verdict.",
      "Prosecutors had alleged Rocky shot twice in the direction of his former friend, Terell Ephron, near a Hollywood hotel in 2021. Ephron, another former member of the hip hop collective A$AP Mob who previously went by A$AP Relli, has said he was left with bullet-graze wounds above his knuckles. He testified that Rocky had allegedly threatened to kill him the same night.",
      "The defense accused Ephron of fabricating evidence, committing perjury and attempting to extort Rocky, saying the rapper had a prop gun that only fired blanks which he carried around for security.",
      "Rocky pleaded not guilty to both counts and maintained his innocence through statements by his attorneys.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman released a statement on behalf of the prosecution after Tuesday's verdict.",

Fame does not place anyone above the law, and we will not waver in our pursuit of justice for victims and the community.\"",
      "As closing arguments got underway late last week, Rihanna appeared inside the downtown LA courtroom with the couple's 2-year-old and 1-year-old sons with her for the first time, the\u00a0Associated Press reported.",
      "A$AP Rocky stands trial in Los Angeles",
      "Prosecutors alleged Rocky pointed a semiautomatic firearm at Ephron before opening fire during another later confrontation on the evening of Nov. 6, 2021. During the first few days of the trial, Ephron testified that Rocky said, \"I'll kill you right now,\" as he pointed the gun at him, saying it was pointed \"like towards my stomach, like towards like my head and shoulder.\"",
      "While he said he couldn't remember certain details, he told jurors Rocky had moved the gun as he pointed it, saying \"He was looking for a spot to shoot me.\" The prosecution had claimed Rocky then opened fire twice in Ephron's direction later that night, during another alleged confrontation which Ephron described during his testimony.",
      "\"So I see Rocky turn around, and when he turned around, he's like,\" Ephron said as he mimicked the gesture he says Rocky made with the gun, raising his arm into the air while pointing his fingers downward. \"Kinda looked like a movie. The whole thing looked like a movie.\"",
      "The former friends were near the intersection of Argyle and Selma avenues, an area of Hollywood just around the corner from the Walk of Fame, when prosecutors say Rocky opened fire.",
      "Ephron testified he was left with bullet-graze wounds just above his knuckles which he later sought medical treatment for.",
      "\"When he shot the first shot, I felt my hand hot,\" he told jurors from the witness stand last month, saying he grabbed another person there that night and \"used him as a shield\" to try dodging the gunfire. \"I'm just trying to like not get hit at this point,\" Ephron said.",
      "He testified he went back to the area later that night, after Los Angeles Police Department officers had responded to the scene, and collected shell casings he claims were fired by the gun. \"But I ended up going back and getting the actual bullets myself,\" he said, saying he brought a paper bag to collect them and took photos of them.",
      "\"It wasn't hard for me to find the bullets because I knew exactly where I got shot at,\" he said.",
      "Tacopina, Rocky's defense attorney, told jurors that Ephron fabricated that evidence and committed perjury during his testimony, describing him as a \"pathological liar\" during the trial. Tacopina said several police officers had responded to the scene before Ephron returned, saying they carried out a thorough search and never came across shell casings.",
      "\"What you'll learn is that Relli returned to that scene an hour later,\" Tacopina said of Ephron, referring to him by his former artist name of A$AP Relli. \"And he attempted to fabricate evidence... This is some offensive stuff.\"",
      "One of the defense witnesses testified to seeing Rocky with a starter pistol, which only fired blanks, on three occasions. A$AP Twelvyy, another former member of the A$AP Mob collective and longtime friend of Rocky, said the rapper carried around the fake gun as a means of security. The felony charges Rocky had faced do not apply if there was no real firearm involved.",
      "The defense argued the rapper could also be found not guilty on the basis of self defense. Both the prosecution and defense has agreed that Rocky and two other men who were with him that night walked away after the first of two confrontations in Hollywood on the night of Nov. 6, 2021, and that Relli followed them afterwards. However, prosecutors argued Rocky was the aggressor when he first allegedly pulled out the gun and then allegedly opened fire during the second incident.",
      "While arguing that Ephron attempted to extort Rocky, the defense presented recordings which a witness for the defense, Wally Sajimi, testified he made in 2022. On the recording, a voice resembling Ephron's says he will accept being paid to stop taking part in the case against Rocky. \"Once I walk away, when I get my cash, the case will get way weaker,\" the voice on the recording says.",
      "But prosecutors have said Ephron's testimony in court was consistent with what he told Sajimi during a recorded conversation \u2014 that the Grammy-nominated rapper had opened fire with a real gun.",
      "\"Mr. Ephron wants to be paid because he was the victim of a real crime by a real gun,\" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec told jurors last week. \"In that couple minutes, he tells the exact same details that he told you when he testified in this case.\"",
      "\"That's evidence they created. That's their person trying to trick Mr. Ephron, trying to get Mr. Ephron to say something damaging, say something that's gonna undermine this case,\" Przelomiec said of the recording submitted as evidence by the defense.",
      "During closing arguments, Przelomiec told jurors that witnesses who testified for the defense never told law enforcement that Rocky had a fake gun that night when the investigation first got underway. He said the prop gun was only brought up more than two years after the alleged shooting, when those witnesses spoke with Rocky's defense attorneys.",
      "\"The idea that they would not be running into the police station to tell their story is absurd,\" Przelomiec said of the defense witnesses.",
      "Meanwhile, the defense has honed in on what they allege is a lack of credibility in the prosecution's key witness.",
      "Tacopina told jurors during closing arguments last week that aside from Ephron's testimony, the prosecution's evidence \"consists of video, shell casings and knuckle scrapes,\" saying the videos alone do not prove the defendant's guilt and the shell casings were fabricated evidence.",
      "\"They mean nothing without believing his story,\" Tacopina said.",

    "story": [
      "A painting by street artist Banksy with an environmental message and an estimate of up to 5 million pounds ($6.3 million) is going up for auction, with some of the proceeds helping victims of the Los Angeles wildfires.",
      "Sotheby's auction house said Tuesday that \"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is being sold by Sotheby's in London on March 4 from the collection of Mark Hoppus, bassist with California skate-punk band Blink-182, who sees Banksy as a kindred spirit.",
      "Hoppus said he was drawn to the subversion, humor and intelligence of Banksy's work and the similarities between \"skateboarding, punk rock and art.\"",
      "\"I feel like street art and punk rock have the same core,\" Hoppus said. \"The left-out and overlooked making their own reality. \u2026 Just go make art. It's the same spirit. And I've loved art and especially street art ever since realizing that.\"",
      "\"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is part of a 2005 series of works in which Banksy put a satirical spin on famous paintings \u2014 withering Vincent van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" and smashing the diner window in Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks.\" The artist said his aim was to show that \"the real damage done to our environment is not done by graffiti writers and drunken teenagers, but by big business.\"",
      "The work going under the hammer is based on \"The Singing Butler,\" a painting by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano showing a couple in evening dress dancing on a beach as servants proffer sheltering umbrellas. Banksy has added a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste.",
      "\"We loved this painting since the moment we saw it,\" said Hoppus, who bought the artwork with his wife Skye in 2011. He said the painting \u2013 \"unmistakably Banksy, but different\" \u2013 has hung in the family's homes in London and LA ever since.",
      "Hoppus said he would use the proceeds of the sale to buy work by upcoming artists. Some will go to the California Fire Foundation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Cedars Sinai Hematology Oncology Research,",
      "Banksy, who has never confirmed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world's best-known artists. His mischievous and often satirical images include two male police officers kissing, armed riot police with yellow smiley faces and a chimpanzee with a sign bearing the words, \"Laugh now, but one day I'll be in charge.\"",
      "Several of his works have sold for multiple millions at auction. The record is almost 18.6 million pounds ($25.4 million at the time) paid at Sotheby's in October 2021 for \"Love is in the Bin\" \u2013 an image of a girl with a balloon that partially self-destructed during an auction three years earlier thanks to a shredder hidden in the frame.",

      "\"We've removed these images for violating our policies and will continue monitoring for other violating posts.

      "How to spot deepfake images online",
      "An analysis of over a dozen of these images by Reality Defender, a platform that works to detect AI-generated media, showed that many of the photos were deepfake images \u2014 with AI-generated, underwear-clad bodies replacing the bodies of celebrities in otherwise real photographs. A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",

      "Under Meta's Bullying and Harassment policy, the company prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company also bans adult nudity, sexual activity and adult sexual exploitation, and its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share non-consensual intimate imagery. Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",
      "But questions remain over the effectiveness of the tech company's policing of such content. CBS News found dozens of AI-generated, sexualized images of Cosgrove and McCurdy still publicly available on Facebook even after the widespread sharing of such content, in violation of the company's terms, was flagged to Meta.",
      "One such deepfake image of Cosgrove that was still up over the weekend had been shared by an account with 2.8 million followers.",
      "The two actors \u2014 both former child stars on the Nickelodeon show \"iCarly,\" which is owned by CBS News' parent company Paramount Global \u2014 are the most prolifically targeted for deepfake content, based on the images of public figures that CBS News has analyzed.",
      "Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body that consists of experts in the field of human rights and freedom of speech, and makes recommendations for content moderation on Meta's platforms, told CBS News in an emailed statement that the company's current regulations around sexualized deepfake content are insufficient.",
      "The Oversight Board cited recommendations it has made to Meta over the past year,\u00a0 including urging the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" to specifically include the word \"non-consensual\" and to encompass other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.",
      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",
      "\"The Oversight Board has made clear that non-consensual deepfake intimate images are a serious violation of privacy and personal dignity, disproportionately harming women and girls. These images are not just a misuse of technology \u2014 they are a form of abuse that can have lasting consequences,\" Michael McConnell, an Oversight Board co-chair, told CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"The Board is actively monitoring Meta's response and will continue to push for stronger safeguards, faster enforcement, and greater accountability,\" McConnell said.",

      "\"I see some of the most difficult people I have ever met in my entire life,\" Mulaney said. \"Over the course of 50 years, 894 people have hosted 'Saturday Night Live,' and it amazes me that only two of them have committed murder.\"",
      "Later, on the night's \"Weekend Update,\" anchor Colin Jost said there are so many former hosts and musical guests that wanted to see the show that many had to be seated in a neighboring studio and some had to watch \"from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn\" as a photo of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs appeared.",
      "Martin took a jab at the always-difficult-to-wrangle Bill Murray in his monologue.",
      "\"We wanted to make sure that Bill would be here tonight,\" Martin said, \"so we didn't invite him.\"",
      "Murray appeared on \"Weekend Update\" to rank the show's anchors since they began with Chevy Chase. He poked at the whiteness of the group by first ranking its Black anchors, a list of just one, current co-anchor Michael Che.",
      "The extravaganza came after months of celebrations of \"Saturday Night Live,\" which premiered Oct. 11, 1975, with an original cast that included John Belushi, Chase and Gilda Radner.",
      "It's become appointment television over the years as the show has skewered presidents, politics and pop culture.",
      "\"It is a honor and a thrill to be hosting weekend update for the 50th and if it was up to our president final season of SNL,\" Jost said.",
      "The show had its typical ending, with all involved looking exhilarated and exhausted on the studio stage. This night it was so crowded with luminaries it looked like it might break. Led by Short, they all applauded in tribute to Michaels, who created the show and has run it for 45 of its 50 years.",
      "Alec Baldwin, the show's most frequent host with 17 stints, appeared to introduce an evening of commercial parodies, seven months after his trial was halted and an involuntary manslaughter charge was dropped in the shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.",

He introduced his \"Anger Management\" co-star Adam Sandler, who sang in his signature style about the show's history. He gave a roll-call of cast members, giving special attention to several who have died, including his friends Chris Farley and MacDonald along with Radner, Jan Hooks and Phil Hartman.",
      "It ended with, \"six years of our boy Farley, five of our buddy Norm.\"",
      "The show didn't have a formal \"in memoriam\" section, though it pretended to when 10-time host Tom Hanks came out somberly to mourn \"SNL characters and sketches that have aged horribly.\"",
      "A montage began with the late Belushi's \"Samurai\" character. The word \"Yikes\" appeared on screen in a sketch that included Mike Myers and a young Macaulay Culkin in a bathtub. A \"body shaming\" label appeared over the beloved sketch of Farley and the late Patrick Swayze as Chippendale's dancers, and \"slut shaming\" appeared over one of the show's earliest, catchphrases, Dan Aykroyd saying \"Jane, you ignorant slut\" to Jane Curtin. The current-day Aykroyd was a notable absence.",
      "The oldest former cast member, 88-year-old Garrett Morris, appeared to introduce a film that showed the whole original cast.",
      "\"I had no idea y'all that I would be required to do so many reunion shows,\" he said.",
      "The first sketch featured a mash-up of former cast members and hosts. Fred Armisen hosted a \"Lawrence Welk Show\" that featured Ferrell as Robert Goulet.",
      "Former hosts Kim Kardashian and Scarlett Johansson - Jost's wife - gave an updated version of the elegant singing Maharelle Sisters with former cast members Ana Gasteyer and Wiig, who provided the traditional punchline \"And I'm Dooneese\" with a balding head and creepy, tiny doll arms.",
      "It was followed by \"Black Jeopardy,\" hosted by the show's longest running (and still current) cast member, Kenan Thompson, who called the game show the only one \"where every single viewer fully understood Kendrick's halftime performance.\"",
      "It showcased many of the show's most prominent Black cast members through the years including Tracy Morgan and Murphy, doing a Morgan impression.",
      "\"Big Dog gonna make some big money!\" Murphy-as-Morgan shouted.",
      "Streep walked on as the mother of McKinnon's constant alien abductee Miss Rafferty, with the same spread legs and vulgar manner.",
      "Streep's fellow all-time-great actor Robert De Niro paired with Rachel Dratch in a \"Debbie Downer\" sketch with its traditional trombone accompaniment.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 11:37:22 -0500",
    "summary": "The actor, who received his fourth Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the legendary folk singer, talks about cultivating authenticity in his performances.",
    "story": [
      "The fires that ravaged Southern California last month turned too many of Malibu's most treasured places to ash. But some, like the legendary Shangri-La Studios, still stand. Over the years, Shangri-La has been used by some of the biggest names in the music business, like Eric Clapton and Adele. But it's also known as the house that Bob Dylan built. Even the old bus out back, legend has it, was used by Dylan on tour.",
      "Dylan even camped out on the lawn. \"I actually think it's in Clapton's biography that there was a period where Dylan had a tent in the rose garden here,\" said actor Edward Norton.",
      "For him, this is hallowed ground \u2013 and in a way, so is his latest movie role. In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Norton is folk music legend Pete Seeger, playing opposite Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as the young Bob Dylan.",
      "Norton says playing a music legend like Seeger was both sublime, and terrifying. \"I think every actor, some part of 'em wants to be a rock star, you know?\" he said. \"I think every actor holds the dream in some sense. I mean, I almost started crying at the idea of it, because, well, I was nervous about it. I was nervous about the whole enterprise. Because I thought the idea of a biopic about Dylan \u2013 if you just said it that way, I was, like, Oooh, like, I'm not sure. 'Cause to me, it has a mythical kind of place in me, and I thought, this could be really, really a bad idea.\"",
      "And here's just one of the challenges: Pete Seeger was an accomplished banjo player, so Norton had to become one as well, and the banjo's a tough one to learn.",
      "I said, \"We did an interview with Steve Martin, and he played the banjo for us, and watching him play the banjo, I mean, it's so complex and it's so fast.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I made the joke that I googled, you know, 'Is there an AI that can replace my hands with Steve Martin's?'\" Norton laughed. \"Or, you know, that thing where you put your arms behind your back and Steve Martin puts his hands under my armpits and does the playing for me? Which I'm not saying is not what happened, you know? It might have. Who knows?\"",
      "In the finished film, his playing looks and sounds authentic, because it is:",
      "That authenticity is something that Norton has always worked for, starting with his very first movie role, as a calculating killer in the 1996 thriller \"Primal Fear.\" Norton, who was raised in Maryland, cultivated an Appalachian accent so real that people thought he was actually from Kentucky, and he wound up with his first Oscar nomination. Three years later he was fighting it out with Brad Pitt in \"Fight Club,\" a film that has now become embedded in our culture.",
      "And although it has a huge following now, it was not successful when it was released. \"No, not at all,\" Norton said. \"And it was polarizing. I would say, there were those who absolutely, like, it hit them right in the center of their sense of their own selves. And then there were people who just absolutely thought it was garbage \u2013 panned it.\"",
      "In fact, it was roundly booed at the Venice Film Festival. But that didn't bother Norton, or his co-star Pitt. \"As the credits rolled, Brad looked at me in the dark crying, and he said, 'That's the best film we'll ever be in.' And I said, 'Me, too, and I think so, too.' And we were hugging each other and crying because we were so happy with, like, boos rising around us, you know what I mean? I think sometimes you just gotta, you know, let your own freak flag fly, and people will figure it out, or not.\"",
      "Norton has let his own freak flag fly in more than 40 films, like a mild-mannered police captain in \"The Grand Budapest Hotel.\" He was an ego-driven Broadway actor in \"Birdman\"; and he nailed the eccentric billionaire part in \"Glass Onion.\"",
      "Watching him on-screen, it's hard to believe Norton was once told he didn't have what it takes to make it as an actor. There was once a casting director who told him, \"Find another profession.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I had one of those, like, someone sits you down and says, 'You should do something else,'\" he said. \"Very, very, very well-known casting director in New York. One of the ones you hoped to get in front of. But look, if you don't run into moments where people lay some fundamental uncertainty around you [about] the path you've chosen, and you can't push through it, then you probably don't belong.\"",
      "There's little doubt he belongs in all of this: Norton has an Oscar nomination for every decade of his career, and he's in the running now for his work in \"A Complete Unknown.\" But he says that, for him, it's not about the awards or the money, but the chance to channel greatness.",
      "He said, \"If channeling their frequency gets people refocused on what it looked like when people were using the talents they had to further ideas and values that were bigger than themselves, then that is what makes it worth doing. Can we get people to re-engage with and be moved by and inspired by the idea of artists as agents of change?\"",
      "And whether Edward Norton is a pure artist, or just a really great actor, it's easy to believe him.",

      "\"Lorne: The Man Who Invented Saturday Night Live,\"\u00a0by New Yorker articles editor Susan Morrison (to be published February 18 by Random House), is a biography of late-night comedy producer Lorne Michaels, who has guided \"Saturday Night Live\" for most of its 50 years. But it is also the history of a pop culture institution that has introduced phenomenal comic talents, rewritten the rules of live television, and captured or challenged the zeitgeist for a half-century.",

      "Prologue",
      "Every week at Saturday Night Live is just like every other week. Every week is the same because it's always intense, fueled by insanely hard work, full of triumphs and failures and backstage explosions, and because it's built around a guest host\u2014Jennifer Lopez or Lizzo or Elon Musk\u2014who often has no idea what they are doing. It has been Lorne Michaels's job for the last fifty years to make it seem as if they do, and to corral the egos and the talents on his staff into getting the show on the air, live. Since he created the show, in 1975, he has periodically tweaked and fine-tuned it, paying attention to how the cultural winds are drifting. But the formula has essentially remained the same. Michaels compares it to a Snickers bar: viewers expect a certain amount of peanuts, a certain amount of caramel, and a certain amount of chocolate. (\"There's a comfort level,\" he says.) The show has good years and bad years, like the New York Yankees, or the Dow, and the audience has come to feel something like ownership of it. Just about every person who has ever watched SNL believes that its funniest years were the ones when they were in high school. Michaels likes to say that everyone in the entertainment business has two jobs: their actual job and figuring out how to fix SNL. (When J. D. Salinger died, in 2010, letters surfaced in which even he griped about what was wrong with the show.)",
      "The show's cast members and writers have speculated for years about the secret behind Michaels's extraordinary tenure. \"It's him and Hitchcock,\" John Mulaney says. \"No one else has had this kind of longevity.\" Half of them believe that Michaels has repeatedly been able to remake the show for a new audience because he's a once-in-a-lifetime talent, a producer nonpareil. The other half wonders whether Michaels, gnomic and almost comically elusive, is a blank screen onto which they've all projected a lifetime of hopes and fears and dark jokes; whether he, like the cramped stages in SNL's Studio 8H, is just a backdrop for the ever-shifting brilliance of the country's best comic minds.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 10:14:56 -0500",
    "summary": "On October 11, 1975, people tuning into the debut of a late-night comedy show saw something unlike any TV variety extravaganza they'd ever seen. Today, \"Saturday Night Live,\" produced by Lorne Michaels, is now an entrenched part of pop culture.",
    "story": [
      "On Saturday night, October 11, 1975, television viewers tuned in for a comedy variety show that looked nothing like they were used to. \"It's a sketch, a very unusual sketch, kind of in a minor key, [with] John Belushi as a kind of rumpled guy with a grocery sack,\" said writer Susan Morrison. \"He's supposed to be an immigrant trying to learn English.\"",
      "Instructor (Michael O'Donoghue): \"I would like\u2026\"Belushi: \"I would like\u2026\"Instructor: \"\u2026to feed your fingertips\u2026\"Belushi: \"\u2026to feed your fingertips\u2026\"Instructor: \"\u2026to the wolverines.\"Belushi: \"\u2026to the wolverines.\"",
      "When the instructor succumbs to a heart attack and falls to the floor, Belushi mimics him. \"It's about death,\" Morrison laughed. \"And that was something that variety shows did not traffic in in 1975!\"",
      "Morrison is the author of \"Lorne\" (that would be Lorne Michaels, the man behind \"Saturday Night Live\"). For 50 years now, \"Saturday Night Live\" has been putting on a 90-minute mix of live comedy sketches, beloved commercial parodies, and musical acts, each episode headlined by a celebrity host.",
      "So, what did variety shows look like before SNL? \"They took place on a big, wide stage; it was very shiny, very blank,\" said Morrison. \"And the content of these variety shows also was kind of a throwback \u2013 very hammy, almost vaudevillian, kind of Catskill comics doing seltzer-in-the-pants bits.\"",
      "Michaels worked on several of those shows, including \"Laugh-In.\" Morrison said, \"'Laugh-In' was really the first variety show that seemed to care about youth culture and being hip. But politically, that show was relatively toothless. What passed for political humor on 'Laugh-In' was Goldie Hawn doing kind of a dumb blonde bit.\"",
      "Michaels learned a different lesson working on a cornball comedy show hosted by Phyllis Diller.\u00a0 Its premiere episode in 1968 went up against a Barbra Streisand special. \"Streisand was the hottest thing out there,\" said Morrison. \"'Funny Girl' was about to come out. And Lorne thought, 'Oh my God, we're dead. Everybody's gonna watch Streisand.' But as it turned out, the Diller show beat Streisand in the ratings by a mile.",
      "\"And Lorne recognized, I think he said, 'You know, I realized there are two audiences. You know, there's the people I know, and then there's the wider American audience.' And to this day, he's always telling his young writers and performers, 'We have audience in all 50 states. We have to remember this is broadcast. It takes in the whole country.'\"",
      "Keeping all this in mind, Michaels set about creating a show for his own generation. As it happened, NBC's then-president was thinking along the same lines. And while it's fun to knock network executives, one of the revelations in \"Lorne\" is the role that Herb Schlosser played.",
      "\"He was a visionary president of NBC who was looking to fill a hole on Saturday night, when the network had been running Johnny Carson reruns,\" said Morrison. \"And he dictated a memo that pretty much hit all the points of what SNL was to be. He wanted to do a show out of Studio 8H at 30 Rock, which had basically been dormant, you know, since the '50s. He wanted it to be live. He wanted it to be on at 11:30 Saturday night. He wanted it to have rotating hosts.\"",
      "Before Michaels even hired his cast, he hired the writers, among them, Alan Zweibel. \"If you look at those early days of SNL, the logo for the show was 'Saturday Night Live' spray-painted on the outside wall of what was then called the RCA Building,\" he said. \"It was like graffiti. And I thought it spoke volumes. Here these kids came along besmirching whatever the standard was, whatever the establishment was.\"",
      "Zweibel had been working in a deli when he got the gig: \"I gave him a book with my jokes in it. The first joke that I put, saying that the post office is about to issue a stamp commemorating prostitution in the United States. 'It's a 10-cent stamp. But if you want to lick it, it's a quarter.' And they laughed, and it was great. I was now a professional comedy writer.\"",
      "The writers were young, and the cast were unknowns. Morrison said, \"He really wanted the show to feel like it was speaking in the voice of everybody's funny, sarcastic friend, you know, grousing, wisecracking, just the way people are when they're trying to make their friends laugh.\"",
      "And over the past five decades, America has become friends with more than a hundred different cast members and the characters they've created, not to mention all those catchphrases that have seeped into our conversation, like \"Well, isn't that special,\" or \"I gotta have more cowbell.\"",
      "The writers and actors know that the best way to make the audience laugh is to make each other laugh.",
      "Rachel Dratch was on the show from 1999 to 2006. She and longtime writer Paula Pell created Debbie Downer \u2013 that friend we all have who always manages to bring the party down.",
      "Dratch recalled, \"I think it was Paula said, like, 'Let's set it somewhere really happy. So, let's put it at Disney World.' And then it started to flow. And then as we were writing we were making each other laugh a lot, but then we started going, like, wah-wah. Like, just to each other. I think it was Paula who said, like, 'What if we just put the trombone in the scene?'\"",
      "Pell said, \"And then we did it for that first time, and it was where everyone lost their minds laughing on \u2013 they were wiping their eyes with waffles. And I remember being in a dressing room watching it on the thing, and just tears coming down my d\u00e9colletage and laughing so ungodly hard. It was such a lightning-in-a-bottle moment at that show where you're, like, I will never forget this five minutes ever in my life!\"",
      "For material, the staff is encouraged to draw from their own lives. \"I was always, always wanting to be a cheerleader,\" said Pell. \"And every year, every summer, I worked on my back handsprings. I was a little chubby girl. I was very strong. I was nice and loud. I was really good at cheerleading. And every year, I didn't get it.\"",
      "So, Pell collaborated with Cheri Oteri and Will Ferrell on their Spartan cheerleaders sketch:",
      "\"So, the Spartan cheerleaders, that comes from a real place?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it comes from the place of, like, joyful loser existence,\" said Pell. \"You go, 'Oh, I didn't make it. Let's go cheer anyway. We're gonna get costumes. Let's go cheer for things nobody is gonna kick us out on,' and they still get to be dramatic cheerleaders.\"",
      "Over the run of the show, the tone of SNL has shifted away from gritty and dark, towards colorful and more, well, cheerful. Morrison writes that Lorne Michaels began directing his staff to \"do it in sunshine.\" She explained: \"Do it in sunshine means first of all, everyone should look pretty good, you know? You want the costumes to be flattering, the colors to be bright. You don't want anger. He very often counsels writers to avoid writing anger. People don't put on a television to see people yelling at each other. Fred Armisen told me that Lorne said once, 'There's enough misery in the world. People huddle around the television as if they're huddling around a fire.'\"",
      "Armisen played Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi. \"I try to keep it, you know, even with the dictators I've played, I've even approached them with \u2013 I can't believe I'm saying this \u2013 like, love and kindness. So, for Qaddafi I'm like, 'I'm gonna love this character. Whoever this guy is, I'm gonna love him and just imagine him as an eccentric at his very worst.'\"",
      "Armisen spent 12 seasons on \"Saturday Night Live.\" To hear him tell it, it wasn't nearly enough. \"I loved it. It was just the best existence,\" he said. \"If you're sitting out three sketches in a row and you're like, 'Oh, I'm not in these,' it is awesome to watch your castmates put something together and see that magic happen. It's fantastic.\"",

    "title": "David Macaulay, America's \"Explainer-in-chief\"",
    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 09:26:15 -0500",
    "summary": "The author has spent more than 50 years finding ways to explain things, via his humorous and intricately illustrated books featuring wooly mammoth guides \u2013 his attempt to hook young readers on the wonders right before their eyes.",
    "story": [
      "Confession: I'm just mad about the mammoth, the one that wandered out of the Ice Age into one of author-illustrator David Macaulay's books \u2013 where he found his purpose in life (if that's a mammoth thing) helping Macaulay explain the way things work to kids.",
      "\"I was desperate to find a humorous way of explaining levers,\" said Macaulay, who realized levers have probably been around for a long time. \"So, I put the mammoth on the end of the log, and put the log on the rock to have a fulcrum, and the villagers on this end of the lever. The problem that had to be solved was, what does the mammoth weigh? So, it's as simple as that!\"",
      "Since it came out in 1988, \"The Way Things Work\" has sold more than a million copies around the world. Mammoth (and a whole herd of his friends) have made their way into other Macaulay books as well.",
      "Asked how many mammoths he thinks he's drawn, Macaulay replied, \"It's like 43,272, I believe. That's just a guess.\"",
      "With or without the help of mammoths, but always with a sense of humor, Macaulay has come to be known as \"America's Explainer-in-chief.\" He is a multi-award-winning star in the children's picture book world and a Macarthur \"genius grant\" recipient, having explained all kinds of things in more than two dozen books over the course of his 50+ year career: the human body \u2026 cathedrals \u2026 castles \u2026 toilets \u2026 the pyramids \u2026 ships \u2026 the city of Rome.",
      "\"I miss Rome,\" he said. \"I think about it often, and I think about particular streets and places in Rome.\"",
      "As an architecture student at the Rhode Island School of Design, Macaulay spent a year there. Born in England, he moved to the United States at the age of ten with his family.",
      "An ongoing exhibit at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., explores the messiness of creating a book. It is toplined, literally, as chaos: \"Chaos, that's where this process started, and in fact it's where all my books start,\" he said. \"This whole thing [depicts] the inside of my brain, and those clouds floating overhead were an attempt to sort of suggest some of that, you know, the things that go through your mind when you think, This is not going to work.\"",
      "\"Some of these look like procrastination,\" I said.",
      "\"Oh, procrastination is my gift,\" said Macaulay. \"I always find that in the end, if I'm using my imagination, if I'm asking the right questions, then the procrastination is working in my favor. I just have to keep drawing.\"",
      "And drawing \u2026 and drawing. The exhibits features just some of the drawings he produced while he was figuring out who would be the ideal tour guide of Rome with the perfect point of view. \"Why not a pigeon carrying a message from somebody who lives outside the city to someone who lives inside the city? And it took the scenic route, which was ideal.\"",
      "Early one fall morning, Macaulay brought us to the Ledyard Bridge. On one aside, Vermont; over there, New Hampshire, the Connecticut River in-between. He began sketching the bridge: \"The weight of all of this is supported on this arch, and transferred into these piers,\" he said.",
      "He wanted us to realize that, for him, sketching is seeing. Sketching is a language for understanding. \"We look at things, but do we actually see them?\" he said. \"What better way to spend time with a structure like this than with a sketchbook in your hand, looking at specific details? I think that's my goal in a way, is to have people open their eyes to the ordinary, to the everyday, to the things they take for granted.\"",
      "Like the sorts of things, both man-made and natural, that Macaulay sees when he walks his dogs, Maya and Minnow, in Norwich, Vt., where he lives.",
      "His storyboard details the objects that hold his fascination: \"Once she's stopped and I'm holding the leash, I think, 'I wonder how many pieces of wood are in that fence? Wonder how it's fastened together?'\"",
      "Walks with Stella, his beloved previous dog, are the basis for the book he's working on now. What's starting to take shape on his wall is David Macaulay's stealth attempt to hook kids on the wonder right before their eyes.\u00a0 \"I thought maybe I can create a book that will help them connect,\" he said. \"What better way to do that than to maybe use myself as an example?\"",
      "It's the first time his work has ever been this personal and introspective. At 78, this time, the point of view is his own.",
      "But why? And why now? \"My sort of conscience, perhaps a little bit, a little payback here after all these years of being able to do what I want, really, and be successful at it, be rewarded for it,\" he said. \"It's time to maybe pay that off.\"",

    "summary": "The new Frosty flavor will be available at Wendy's locations beginning in late February.",
    "story": [
      "Wendy's Frosty's is a beloved treat \u2014 and a new addition to the lineup will combine the familiar frozen dairy dessert with a beloved Girl Scout cookie.",
      "Frosty's have been a staple of the Wendy's menu since the late 1960s when founder Dave Thomas decided to add a frozen treat to it. The drink has only grown in popularity. Last year, the chain served 500 per minute in the United States. The Frosty falls somewhere between soft serve and hard-packed ice cream, creating a frozen creamy treat that's stood the test of time.",
      "For decades, just one flavor \u2014 chocolate \u2014 was available. In 2006, vanilla joined the lineup. In 2022, the fast-food chain started trying new limited-edition flavors.",
      "On Feb. 21, the fast food chain will start selling Thin Mint-flavored Frostys. Fans are excited about the idea, which will combine the smooth Frosty with the mint-chocolate-chip flavors of a Thin Mint, but designing the treat was harder than people may think.",
      "The cookie didn't lend itself to a frozen treat, so the recipe had to be tweaked, according to John Li, Wendy's Vice President of Research and Development. Instead of frozen pieces or chunks of cookie, Li and his team wound up developing a fudge-like cookie butter that can be swirled into a Frosty.",
      "The cookie butter adds the flavor of a Thin Mint but makes it possible for customers to still get their Frosty quickly. The way it's swirled into the frozen treat ensures that customers get a taste of Thin Mint in every sip or bite. The swirl can be added to either chocolate or vanilla Frosty's. Li said they initially thought about only offering one flavor, but decided that the swirl worked well in both.",
      "\"You can't get more nostalgic than a Wendy Frosty and the Girls Scouts,\" said Li. \"The fact that they're coming together really pulls at the heartstrings of food lovers in this country.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"Morgiane\" is believed to be the oldest existing opera written by a Black American -- but despite its historic significance, the show was only performed for audiences for the first time in 2025.",
      "\"Morgiane\" was the magnum opus of New Orleans-born composer Edmond Dede. The opera, based on themes from \"Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves,\" tells the story of a mother, Morgaine, and her daughter, Amine, who fight a tyrannical ruling sultan. Behind the curtain is Dede's remarkable story.",
      "Dede was born a free Black man in New Orleans in 1827. He was educated and moved to France in 1855, leaving just before the Civil War. In France, he studied music at the Paris Conservatoire and performed at Bordeaux's Grand Theatre. He also traveled to Algeria, then a French colony, and was inspired by the struggle of the people there.",
      "Dede returned to the U.S. once, during the height of the Jim Crow era. He was not permitted to perform in theaters, and went back to Europe, vowing that he would never return to his home country.",
      "Dede went on to write 250 songs, ballets and orchestral pieces. The 545-page \"Morgaine\" was his magnum opus, but it was never performed during his lifetime.",
      "In 2014, New Orleans Opera Creole founders Givonna Joseph and Aria Mason found a digital copy of \"Morgaine.\" Opera Creole shares music by composers of African descent, and when they found the piece, they knew they needed to bring it to an audience.",
      "\"I had, you know how you get, a gut feeling that this was important,\" Joseph said. \"I didn't know exactly how.\"",
      "Patrick Quigley, the artistic director designate of Washington, D.C.'s Opera Lafayette, was eager to join the mission. He and Joseph connected in 2023, and they began working with musicians and historians from across the country to bring the never-performed opera to life. First, they transcribed almost 6,000 measures of music into modern notation. When the process was done, they heard music that hadn't been played in over a century.",
      "\"It's this fabulous combination of so many different styles of music, both European and American all together in one place,\" Quigley said.",
      "Excerpts from \"Morgaine\" were played at New Orleans' St. Louis Cathedral on January 24. The church was likely the site of Dede's baptism. The entire opera was performed at Opera Lafayette for the first time on Feb. 3.",
      "\"It was an incredible moment for Washington, D.C., and it was an incredible moment for American music,\" said Quigley, who conducted the performance.",
      "There were also two other performances, one in New York City and one in College Park, Maryland. The brief tour served as a kind of homecoming for Dede, said Joseph.",

      "The first U.S. bird flu hospitalization was reported last year in Missouri, though health officials think the patient tested positive while hospitalized for other reasons, not bird flu. A second hospitalization was later reported in Louisiana, in a patient who died from the virus.",

    "summary": "President Trump said his administration is considering dividend checks based on savings found by DOGE. Economists are skeptical.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he's considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. But economists and policy experts across the political spectrum expressed skepticism about the feasibility of such a \"DOGE dividend.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,\" Mr. Trump said at the FII Priority summit, an investment conference in Miami sponsored by Saudi government entities. Mr. Trump didn't provide further details.",
      "The idea of the so-called DOGE dividend surfaced on social media this week when a four-page proposal was posted by an X user, James Fishback. The post caught the eye of Musk, the owner of X, who is spearheading DOGE, and who on Tuesday said he would pitch the idea to Mr. Trump.",
      "According to Fishback's calculation, 20% of the supposed $2 trillion in eventual DOGE savings would be provided to some taxpayers in the form of a direct tax rebate, which he estimated at $5,000 per household. Only households with a tax liability would receive the payment, which means lower-income households that generally don't owe income taxes wouldn't be included.",
      "But economists and policy experts said the plan isn't likely to materialize, citing the implausibility of finding anywhere near $2 trillion in federal cuts, as well as the legislative hurdles in approving such a direct tax payment.",
      "\"It is completely impossible for DOGE to save $2 trillion,\"Jessica Reidl, an economist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Two-thirds of the $7 trillion federal budget goes to Social Security, Medicare, defense, veterans and interest on the debt \u2014 all of which has been taken off the table by President Trump.\"",
      "She added, \"Saving $2 trillion would require eliminating nearly every remaining federal program. DOGE has no legal or constitutional authority to cut this spending; Congress must pass a law and that will not happen.\"",
      "Two-thirds of the nation's $6.7 trillion in annual spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0commitments through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense. In a Feb. 18 interview on Fox News' \"The Sean Hannity Show,\" Mr. Trump reiterated his earlier vow that Social Security and Medicare cuts are off the table.",
      "\"Social Security won't be touched, other than fraud or something,\" Mr. Trump said during the interview. \"We're going to find it's going to be strengthened, but won't be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.\"",
      "On Feb. 19, Mr. Trump backed the House Republicans' budget proposal, which, if enacted, would include deep cuts to Medicaid, the nearly $900-billion-a-year government health insurance program that serves about 79 million mostly low-income or disabled Americans.",

      "As of Wednesday, DOGE claims it has made cuts that add up to\u00a0about $8.4 billion, according to the task force's own\u00a0documentation.",
      "While DOGE has only been operating since Mr. Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, its cuts are far from reaching Musk's stated goal of shaving $500 billion in annual government spending, let alone reaching near $2 trillion, experts noted.",
      "The plan \"is very unrealistic,\" Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, who describes himself as a libertarian, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I'd love to see it, but I think that is unrealistic, especially in the first year, and certainly unrealistic without Congress getting involved.\"",
      "Any new tax refund check would need the approval of Congress, which controls government spending and is in charge of crafting tax laws. But House Republicans are currently\u00a0negotiating a budget proposal\u00a0that would enact trillions of dollars in spending cuts to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as other tax provisions the president promised on the campaign trail.",
      "A DOGE dividend \"will make their numbers even harder to work in the budget reconciliation,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a Washington, D.C.-based left-leaning economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's hard to see how to make the math work.\"",
      "While a plan for some kind of DOGE dividend could materialize, it would doubtless be a much smaller amount than envisioned, given the practical impossibility of finding $2 trillion in federal cuts.",
      "Experts noted that rebate checks are typically issued in times of economic stress, such as during the pandemic, when Congress authorized several rounds of stimulus checks. But the U.S. economy today is viewed as strong, given growing GDP and low unemployment, they added.",
      "At the same time, the federal government's annual outlays are outpacing revenue by about $2 trillion, creating budget deficits and sending the nation's debt to a record $36.2 trillion.",
      "Reidl noted, \"Washington is facing annual budget deficits that will likely surpass $3 trillion within the next few years. Sending taxpayers dividend checks would be completely irresponsible.\"",
      "DOGE facing legal issues",
      "Experts also raised the issue of whether DOGE's cuts could be reversed by the courts, given that the group is facing multiple lawsuits over its access to sensitive data across various agencies as well as over the legality of its creation.",
      "\"I'm happy to see [DOGE] identify things that can be cut, but I do have concerns about the legality of it,\" Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute said. \"Congress appropriates money, and having the presidential quasi-commission go around and cut things seems like it would run afoul of a lot of laws.\"",
      "DOGE's savings so far could \"be reversed by the courts for bypassing Congress,\" Reidl noted.",
      "Given the challenges of trying to find anything close to $2 trillion in savings, as well as the legislative issues in passing a tax rebate check, experts said their advice to taxpayers is not to bank on getting a DOGE dividend.",
      "\"I wouldn't be budgeting a $5,000 expense in the near term,\" Jacquez said.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:58:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits, but executives expressed caution about an uncertain economic landscape.",
    "story": [
      "Walmart shares tumbled on Thursday after the retailing giant provided a 2025 sales and profit forecast that was lower than analysts had expected, with executives warning about new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "Walmart slipped $6.93, or 6.7%, to $97.07 in early afternoon trading on Thursday. The outlook from the nation's largest retailer for 2025 is as much as 27 cents below analyst projections for per-share earnings and for the quarter, Walmart's expectations are as much as 7 cents below Wall Street projections.",
      "Its sales outlook is also disappointing, potentially a reflection of rising challenges ahead as consumers pull back on spending and President Donald Trump's tariffs on China and other countries threaten the low-price model that is the core of Walmart's success.",
      "\"[W]e have to acknowledge that we are in an uncertain time, and we don't want to get out over our skis here,\" said Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey on a conference call with investors on Feb. 20.",
      "Walmart executives said the company has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Groceries account for roughly 60%, of its U.S. business, according to the company's most recent annual report, meaning a huge chunk of sales are not reliant on goods made in China or elsewhere.",
      "Walmart expects first quarter earnings per share of between 57 cents and 58 cents, well below the 64 cents Wall Street was expecting, and for the year. Walmart expects earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. That's also off the $2.77 that analysts are predicting, according to FactSet.",
      "It forecast a 3% to 4% increase in quarterly sales or between $166.35 billion and $167.97 billion. That could be a letdown for industry analysts, who had expected sales of $167.05 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Walmart expects sales to be up anywhere between 3% to 4% for the current year, or between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That too falls short of the $708.72 billion that analysts predicted, according to FactSet.",
      "Inflation-weary consumers",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly financial results and numbers could provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper, particularly amid new trade barriers that according to most economists threaten to reignite inflation.",
      "Consumers over the past year have increasingly focused more on necessities rather than TVs, furniture or appliances. They've become much more discerning about big-ticket purchases because of higher costs for credit as well as for groceries.",
      "Walmart has flourished in that environment, using its clout to keep prices down. It's gained market share, notably among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart's online offerings and paid membership, Walmart +, have also drawn wealthier customers",
      "\"We have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an eCommerce business driven by faster delivery times,\" said CEO Doug McMillon. \"We're gaining market share, our top line is healthy, and we're in great shape with inventory.\"",
      "Tariff risks",
      "Still, Walmart could be faced with challenges with the new tariffs carrying more economic risks than during Trump's first term. If Americans are hit by a new wave of price increases, economists say, and with 70% of the U.S. economy driven by consumers a broad pullback in spending would have ramifications beyond Walmart's sales.",
      "Government data last week revealed a sharp drop in January retail sales as cold weather kept more Americans indoors. But it was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest in a year. Sales were revised higher for December, possibly indicating a pullback by consumers after a holiday season splurge.",
      "\"[T]here are a lot of potential headwinds from sticky inflation, high debt levels, and a suppressed housing market. The uncertainty of tariffs and their impact on prices adds another changeable dimension,\" noted Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a Feb. 14 research note about the retail data.",
      "Yet grocery prices, a sore point for American households, continued to rise.",
      "Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, reported earnings of $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31. That compares with $5.49 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share for the most recent quarter was 66 cents.",
      "Sales rose 4.1% to $180.55 billion in the quarter.",

The tools can summarize text and audio, create new emojis and has made Apple's virtual assistant, Siri, more capable. Apple also touted the new phone's more powerful battery and camera, compared with the now discontinued SE.",

    "story": [
      "Online searches for gambling addiction-related terms have surged in recent years across the U.S., especially in states that have legalized online sports betting, according to a study published on Monday in the American Medical Association's peer-reviewed journal.",
      "Since the Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association Supreme Court decision allowed states to legalize sports betting in 2018, there were 23% more searches nationwide (approximately 6.5 to 7.3 million queries) related to seeking help for gambling addiction, the study found. The researchers analyzed search queries mentioning gambling, addiction, addict, anonymous or hotline, such as gambling addiction hotline, from January 2016 through June 2024.",
      "The increases in Illinois (35%), Massachusetts (47%), Michigan (37%), New Jersey (34%), New York (37%), Ohio (67%), Pennsylvania (50%) and Virginia (30%) were all higher than expected after the opening of sportsbooks in those states, the study found. The researchers also found that online sportsbooks had a significantly greater impact than retail sportsbooks.",
      "\"The significantly higher search volumes observed in all eight states make it virtually impossible that our findings occurred by chance,\" the study's main author, Atharva Yeola, a student researcher in the UC San Diego Qualcomm Institute, said in the accompanying opinion article.",
      "In Pennsylvania, the introduction of retail sportsbooks led to 33% more searches than expected for gambling addiction-related terms during the five months before online sportsbooks launched, the study found. After online sportsbooks became available, searches spiked to 61% over expectations and persisted for year.",

      "\"The National Council of Problem Gambling puts the rate of problem gaming at 1-2%, and the group testified before Congress that problem gaming rates have stabilized since the pandemic.

      "People who are listed as over 100 years old in the Social Security system are \"not necessarily receiving benefits,\" the new head of the agency said Wednesday, contradicting claims that tens of millions of dead people over that age are receiving checks.",

      "The clarification comes after Mr. Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly and routinely getting benefits.",
      "Because Social Security records are not public, it's not possible to independently verify Musk's claim. However, the Social Security Administration automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency is seeking to root out fraud, waste and abuse, issued a slew of posts on his social media platform X on Monday night, including: \"Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security.\"",
      "To be sure, there are instances of overpayments and fraud within the Social Security system. A\u00a0July 2024 report\u00a0from Social Security's inspector general stated that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, including $71.8 billion \u2014 or less than 1% \u2014 in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people.",
      "Social Security and COBOL",
      "Part of the confusion comes from Social Security's software system based on the COBOL programming language, which has a lack of date type. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birth dates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago.",
      "The news organization WIRED first reported on the agency's use of COBOL, a programming language which is more than 60 years old.",
      "Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration's inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as deceased. This does not mean, however, that these individuals were receiving benefits.",
      "The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million.",

      "Treasury clawbacks",
      "In early January, the U.S. Treasury clawed back more than $31 million in a variety of federal payments\u2014 not just Social Security payments\u2014 that improperly went to dead people, a recovery that former Treasury official David Lebryk said was \"just the tip of the iceberg.\"",
      "The money was reclaimed as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Department of Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration's \"Full Death Master File\" for three years as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in 2021. The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died, and the file contains more than 142 million records, which go back to 1899, according to the Treasury.",
      "Treasury estimated in January that it would recover more than $215 million during its three-year access period, which runs from December 2023 through 2026.",
      "Chuck Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said, \"Two cheers for Elon Musk if he can root out and put a stop to improper payments.\"",
      "But to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, \"Social Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,\" Blahous said. \"Medicaid improper payment rates are quite substantial, and soared after the Medicaid expansion of the ACA.\"",
      "\"By all means \u2014 go after any improper payments that are found, but let's not pretend that's where the system's biggest financial problems are,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:48:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has an uncommon style of giving that has brought meaningful change to charities, a new report finds.",
    "story": [
      "Mackenzie Scott, the philanthropist and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has pioneered a new kind of giving that has proved transformative for nonprofit organizations.",
      "Since 2019, Scott, who is estimated by Forbes to be worth more than $32 billion, has given away $19 billion in no-strings-attached gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits, meaning the recipients of the donations were permitted to spend the funds however they saw fit. The median gift size was roughly $5 million. She identified organizations she deemed worthy of support through \"quiet research,\" or a discreet vetting process, and didn't accept solicitations for donations.",
      "That's according to new\u00a0research\u00a0from the Center for Effective Philanthropy (CEP) which found that the uncommon size and lack of restrictions of Scott's charitable gifts have not only helped those nonprofits become more financially stable but has enabled them to increase the scope of their impact.",
      "\"There is much to learn from the experiences of nonprofits who received grants using Scott's approach,\" CEP vice president of research Elisha Smith Arrillaga said in a statement. \"These organizations have managed large gifts in strategic ways that have impacted thousands of lives \u2014 whether doubling or tripling the number of individuals receiving food from food banks, or increasing the number of houses being built in towns across the country, or countless other examples.\"",
      "For the report, which is the culmination of a three-year study, CEP surveyed roughly 800 organizations that received gifts from Scott on how the donations affected their efforts.",
      "Organization leaders surveyed said they managed the grants with an eye toward long-term sustainability, and most \u2014 90% \u2014 said the gifts from Scott strengthened their financial positions, compared with organizations that did not receive such grants. Half of nonprofit heads also said that Scott's gift made fundraising easier, and many said they the gift attracted new contributions. Only a few \u2014 7% \u2014 said they lost funders because of the grant.",
      "Some funders expressed concerns that such large grants would make it hard for their groups to continue fundraising, a fear that never materialized and a notion the study dispels.",
      "Community impact",
      "Grant recipients also said they put part of the money they received toward programming efforts, and that they've observed meaningful change in communities as a result.",
      "\"We received the grant December 2022, during which we served migrants from 29 countries, and were able to expand that to 71 countries in 2023,\" one grantee said in a statement. \"In 2023, our staff provided legal orientation to over 12,000 refugees, helped reunify over 200 unaccompanied children with their family members in the United States, and coordinated life-saving shelter and medical treatment to over 1,600 migrants.\"",
      "One group that received funding from Scott said the grant allowed their charity to grow from serving meals to approximately 2.5 million people a day, to 10 million. The grants also had an effect within community organizations, notably by boosting leaders' confidence in the work they do, according to the report.",
      "\"Receiving this grant has helped to rewrite my own narrative of who is capable of being a leader,\" one nonprofit leader said in the report, adding that the confidence boost led the group to expand its programming, take more risks, raise its profile and feel more secure in asking for larger grants from other funding sources.",
      "\"We need more unrestricted gifts like the one we received to help really make a difference in the work we do! We are extremely grateful to MacKenzie Scott for graciously gifting us this funding, which will go a long way to helping us achieve our programmatic and scale goals,\" another gift recipient said in a statement.",
      "For her part, Scott is quoted in the report as saying that the motive behind not issuing restrictions around how groups could allocate the funds was rooted in her belief that those who are closest to the work are best positioned to identify the organization's needs.",
      "\"I needn't ask those I care about what to say to them, or what to do for them. I can share what I have with them to stand behind them as they speak and act for themselves,\" she said.",

      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who sits on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, has said he will oppose her because of her previous support for pro-labor policies. Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, in the last Congress. The bill would have strengthened labor protections for workers to collectively bargain and expanded penalties for employers that violate workers' rights.",

      "If you get a text claiming you're due a $1,400 stimulus check from what looks to be the IRS, don't click on any links. The text is most certainly a scam, as the federal agency doesn't send such messages. Yet criminals are impersonating the IRS to trick taxpayers into sharing personal information by texting them fake alerts of their eligibility for extra money, warns the Better Business Bureau.",
      "The devious texts have a truthful air, as they are connected to recent news. The IRS in late December said it was sending $2.4 million in total to 1 million people to cover those who didn't get all of their federal stimulus checks during the pandemic.",
      "But the payments \u2014 a maximum of $1,400 per recipient \u2014 are automatic and those getting them were sent a letter by the IRS, with most of the payments expected to have arrived by late January. The money involves taxpayers who did not claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2021 tax returns, with no action required from them.",
      "How the scam works:",
      "You get a text from what looks to be the IRS claiming you're eligible for a $1,400 Economic Impact Payment and that you should provide your personal information to have the money deposited into your bank account or mailed by check within 1 to 2 business days.",
      "The phishing scam contains a fake link that mimics an official IRS website. Clicking on it could lead to malware or a fraudulent form asking for personal or financial information.

      "At the Commerce Department, Lutnick, who was CEO at the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald, will oversee 50,000 employees who do everything from collecting economic statistics to running the census to issuing weather reports. But he's likely to spend a lot of time \u2014 along with Jamieson Greer, Mr. Trump's nominee to be the top U.S. trade negotiator \u2014 managing the president's aggressive plans to impose import taxes on U.S. trading partners, including allies and adversaries alike.",
      "The Senate vote to confirm Lutnick was 51-45.",
      "Mr. Trump views the tariffs as a versatile economic tool. They can raise money to finance his tax cuts elsewhere, protect U.S. industries and pressure other countries into making concessions on such issues as their own trade barriers, immigration and drug trafficking. Mainstream economists mostly view tariffs as counterproductive: They are paid by import companies in the United States, which try to pass along the higher costs to consumers and can thereby add to inflationary pressures throughout the economy.",
      "At his confirmation hearing last month, Lutnick dismissed as \"nonsense'' the idea that tariffs contribute to inflation. He expressed support for deploying across-the-board tariffs \"country by country'' to strong-arm other countries into lowering barriers to American exports.",
      "Mr. Trump last week announced plans for \"reciprocal'' tariffs \u2014 raising U.S. import tax rates to match the higher taxes that other countries impose on goods from the U.S. The move would shatter the rules that have governed world trade for decades. Since the 1960s, tariff rates have mostly emerged from negotiations between dozens of countries. Mr. Trump is commandeering the process.",
      "The president has also imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese imports and effectively raised U.S. taxes on foreign steel and aluminum. He has threatened \u2014 and delayed until March 4 \u2014 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico.",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Feb 2025 19:09:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The White House said in a legal filing that Tesla CEO Elon Musk isn't an employee of its Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration is to find ways to cut costs through the newly created\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. But a new court\u00a0filing\u00a0from the White House states that the Tesla CEO isn't an employee of DOGE, adding that Musk \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "The filing raises questions about Musk's role in the Trump administration and at DOGE, a cost-cutting task force created by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20 that is working at a number of agencies, including the\u00a0Treasury Department\u00a0and the\u00a0IRS, in an effort to find fraud and waste. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Musk's role at DOGE.",
      "Musk, along with fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, was\u00a0originally tasked\u00a0by Mr. Trump with providing \"advice and guidance from outside of Government\" and partnering with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to drive large scale structural reform.\" Ramaswamy\u00a0left DOGE\u00a0in January and is planning a run for Ohio governor.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, DOGE has driven massive federal employee cuts and paused tranches of congressionally approved spending. Many of those federal workers, their unions and Democratic officials have argued that this is a result of Musk's unchecked authority. Mr. Trump has suggested that Musk largely answers to him.",
      "Last week, Musk \u2014 the world's richest person, with a net worth of\u00a0$398 billion\u00a0\u2014 stood behind President Trump at the Oval Office, describing DOGE's work as taking \"very simple and basic\" steps to cut federal spending. During a lengthy Q&A that followed, Mr. Trump was asked if there was anything Musk was told that he can't touch.",
      "\"Well, we haven't discussed that much,\" Mr. Trump replied. \"I'll tell him to go here, go there, he does it. He's got a very capable group of people.\"",
      "Asked by reporters if he was working closely with agency heads, Musk replied that he was working \"in partnership\" with them. \"I check with the president to make sure that this is what the president wants to happen,\" Musk added. \"We talk almost every day, and I double check things to make sure. 'Is this something, Mr. President, you want us to do this?' Then we'll do it.\"",
      "Multiple lawsuits, alarm bells",
      "At the same time, DOGE's efforts have sparked multiple lawsuits and\u00a0raised alarms\u00a0from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates over its reported access to personal data of millions of Americans and businesses.",
      "The White House's Feb. 17 filing came at the request of U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is hearing a case about the\u00a0constitutionality\u00a0of Musk's actions since the start of Mr. Trump's presidency. Fourteen states ranging from Arizona to Washington are suing Musk, DOGE and Mr. Trump, alleging that Musk is exceeding his authority and taking \"actions that can only be taken by a nominated and principal officer of the United States.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that Musk \"does not occupy an office created by law and has no authority to exercise the powers of a principal officer, or any other officer.\"",
      "\"There is no greater threat to democracy than the accumulation of state power in the hands of a single, unelected individual,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"In recent weeks, defendant Elon Musk, with President Donald J. Trump's approval, has roamed through the federal government unraveling agencies, accessing sensitive data and causing mass chaos and confusion for state and local governments, federal employees and the American people,\" the lawsuit further claims.",
      "At a Feb. 17 hearing, Justice Department attorney Harry Graver told Chutkan, \"There is not a single instance of Musk or USDS commanding these actions,\" referring to\u00a0widespread firings of government employees\u00a0across various agencies last week. Instead, the government workers were fired by officials within their own agencies, he said.",
      "When asked at a press briefing at Mar-a-lago on Tuesday about the administration's contention that Musk isn't in charge of DOGE, Mr. Trump said, \"Elon is to me a patriot. So, you could call him an employee, you could call him a consultant, you could call him whatever you want.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Judge Chutkan ruled against the states' request for a temporary restraining order to stop Musk and DOGE from accessing data systems at seven federal agencies and firing or putting their employees on leave. She found that the states failed to show that they would suffer imminent, irreparable harm without relief, writing in her ruling that \"the 'possibility' that defendants may take actions that irreparably harm plaintiffs 'is not enough.'\"",
      "Nonetheless, in a hearing Monday, Chutkan warned that the alleged actions by Musk and DOGE are \"concerning\" and \"troubling.\" She said the mass firings of thousands of federal workers is \"not a small or common thing\" and noted that Musk has not been nominated to a position by the president or confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\"No actual or formal authority\"",
      "The Feb. 17 filing states that Musk is working as a \"senior adviser to the president,\" comparing his role to that of Anita Dunn under the Biden administration. Dunn served as a special government employee when she advised former President Biden, the filing noted.",
      "\"Like other senior White House advisers, Mr. Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,\" the filing said. \"Mr. Musk can only advise the president and communicate the president's directives.\"",
      "Musk's role as a\u00a0special government employee, or SGE, confirmed by the White House earlier this month, indicates that he'll work for the Trump administration for 130 days or less during a one-year period. The SGE role was created in 1962 as a way of enabling the government to tap outside expertise,\u00a0according\u00a0to the publication Government Executive.",
      "Because Musk isn't paid for his work at the White House, his financial disclosure report\u00a0will remain confidential, a White House official has told CBS News on condition of anonymity",
      "Asked at the Oval Office last week whether there are issues with conflicts of interest between his businesses, including Tesla and Space X \u2014 which receive billions in federal contracts \u2014 and DOGE, Musk said that the task force's work is transparent. He added, \"So you can see everything that's going on, and then you can see, am I doing something that benefits one of my companies or not? It's totally obvious.\"",

      "\"I feel like street art and punk rock have the same core,\" Hoppus said. \"The left-out and overlooked making their own reality. \u2026 Just go make art. It's the same spirit. And I've loved art and especially street art ever since realizing that.\"",
      "\"Crude Oil (Vettriano)\" is part of a 2005 series of works in which Banksy put a satirical spin on famous paintings \u2014 withering Vincent van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" and smashing the diner window in Edward Hopper's \"Nighthawks.\" The artist said his aim was to show that \"the real damage done to our environment is not done by graffiti writers and drunken teenagers, but by big business.\"",
      "The work going under the hammer is based on \"The Singing Butler,\" a painting by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano showing a couple in evening dress dancing on a beach as servants proffer sheltering umbrellas. Banksy has added a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste.",
      "\"We loved this painting since the moment we saw it,\" said Hoppus, who bought the artwork with his wife Skye in 2011. He said the painting \u2013 \"unmistakably Banksy, but different\" \u2013 has hung in the family's homes in London and LA ever since.",
      "Hoppus said he would use the proceeds of the sale to buy work by upcoming artists. Some will go to the California Fire Foundation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Cedars Sinai Hematology Oncology Research,",
      "Banksy, who has never confirmed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world's best-known artists. His mischievous and often satirical images include two male police officers kissing, armed riot police with yellow smiley faces and a chimpanzee with a sign bearing the words, \"Laugh now, but one day I'll be in charge.\"",
      "Several of his works have sold for multiple millions at auction. The record is almost 18.6 million pounds ($25.4 million at the time) paid at Sotheby's in October 2021 for \"Love is in the Bin\" \u2013 an image of a girl with a balloon that partially self-destructed during an auction three years earlier thanks to a shredder hidden in the frame.",
      "The painting is on display at Sotheby's in New York until Thursday and in London Feb. 26-March 4.",

In the meantime, the agency will be led by a career Social Security anti-fraud expert as the acting commissioner.\"",
      "The White House did not provide a specific reason for King's departure. CBS News has reached out to the SSA for comment.",
      "Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS News they heard from SSA employees that officials from the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, had been trying to get access to the Enterprise Data Warehouse \u2014 a centralized database that serves as the main hub for personal, sensitive information related to social security benefits such as beneficiary records and earnings data. Altman was told King had been resistant to giving DOGE officials access to the database.",
      "\"She was standing in the way and they moved her out of the way. They put someone in who presumably they thought would cooperate with them and give them the keys to all our personal data,\" Altman said.",
      "The Washington Post first reported King's departure.",
      "King's exit from the administration is one of several departures of high-ranking officials concerned about DOGE staffers' potential unlawful access to private taxpayer information.",

      "Since Mr. Trump has retaken the White House, his billionaire adviser Elon Musk and DOGE have rapidly burrowed deep into federal agencies.",
      "Altman told The Associated Press, \"There is no way to overstate how serious a breach this is. And my understanding is that it has already occurred.\"",
      "\"The information collected and securely held by the Social Security Administration is highly sensitive,\" she said. \"SSA has data on everyone who has a Social Security number, which is virtually all Americans, everyone who has Medicare, and every low-income American who has applied for Social Security's means-tested companion program, Supplemental Security Income.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 22:53:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Some Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns about the security of taxpayer data as Musk's cost-cutting task force moves to the IRS.",
    "story": [
      "The presence of Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, at the IRS is sparking fresh concerns from Democratic lawmakers about the safety of taxpayer information, and whether the group's work could cause delays in taxpayers receiving their refunds.",
      "An IRS employee associated with DOGE is requesting access to the IRS' Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS, which would provide the group with access to tax data for individuals and businesses, according to a Trump administration official.",
      "\"Waste, fraud, and abuse have been deeply entrenched in our broken system for far too long,\" said White House spokesman Harrison Fields. \"DOGE will continue to shine a light on the fraud they uncover as the American people deserve to know what their government has been spending their hard-earned tax dollars on.\"",
      "News of the request was first reported by\u00a0the Washington Post. The IRS didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "In a Feb. 17 letter to the IRS, Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren, both Democrats, cited reports that DOGE is \"pressuring the IRS to agree to a memorandum of understanding (\"the MOU\") which would give software engineers working for Elon Musk at DOGE broad access to IRS systems, property and datasets which include the private tax return information of hundreds of millions of American citizens and businesses.\"",
      "Supporters of DOGE view its efforts as a way to cut what they see as bloated federal spending at a time when the nation's outlays are outstripping its tax revenue, pushing the federal debt to an all-time high of\u00a0$36 trillion. But the group's efforts have also sparked several lawsuits, with consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers raising alarms earlier this month after DOGE gained access to the Treasury Department's\u00a0payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.",
      "IRS data is particularly sensitive, given that it reflects financial details for millions of Americans and businesses, ranging from their income, employers, losses, investments, dependents and other items. Under the IRS taxpayers' bill of rights, \"information [taxpayers] provide to the IRS will not be disclosed unless authorized by the taxpayer or by law.\"",
      "\"Software engineers working for Musk seeking to gain access to tax return information have no right to hoover up taxpayer data and send that data back to any other part of the federal government and may be breaking the law if they are doing so,\" Wyden and Warren wrote in the Feb. 17 letter.",
      "The senators pointed to privacy regulations in the tax code that they said provide \"strong legal protections\" for taxpayer data, noting that violation of those laws can result in incarceration or other criminal penalties. They added that even if the DOGE employees are employed at the Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS, they may still be violating the law by accessing taxpayer data.",
      "\"There are serious statutory and regulatory restrictions on when employees outside the Treasury Department may gain access to tax return information,\" the letter said.",
      "It added, \"To date, no information on DOGE employees or any others executing orders on Musk's behalf have revealed any clear, stated purpose as to why they need access to return information, whether they have followed all required laws to gain access to IRS systems, and what steps the IRS has taken to ensure that inspection of tax return is contained to authorized personnel and not disclosed to any unauthorized parties.\"",
      "Protections for taxpayer data were increased in the 1970s after former President Nixon sought to use the IRS against his political opponents, according to New York University's Tax Law blog.",
      "\"Congress acted to put in place ironclad guarantees against such abuses and a bipartisan consensus emerged to ensure the privacy of every American's tax information,\" Robert Weissman, the co-president of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Musk and DOGE's attempt to gain access to IRS data raises profound questions about whether those protections are now being shredded.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News, Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, said DOGE was seeking to find signs of tax fraud.",
      "\"We are talking about performing a basic anti-fraud review to ensure that people are not engaging in large scale theft of federal taxpayer benefits,\" he said. \"I mean, for example, we pay billions of dollars a year in child tax credit payments to illegal aliens, billions with a B. So these are systematic, programmatic reforms that we're talking about here.\"",
      "Delays to IRS tax refunds?",
      "Wyden and Warren also raised concerns about DOGE's impact on tax refunds this year.",
      "DOGE's work at the IRS comes as the tax agency is in the middle of the current tax season, when about 140 million individual tax returns are expected to be filed before the April 15 deadline. For many households, their tax refund check \u2014 which last year averaged more than $3,100 \u2014 is often their biggest cash influx of the year.",
      "\"We are also extremely concerned that DOGE personnel meddling with IRS systems in the middle of tax filing season could, inadvertently or otherwise, cause breakdowns that may delay the issuance of tax refunds indefinitely,\" the Feb. 17 letter said. \"Any delay in refunds could be financially devastating to millions of Americans who plan their budgets around timely refunds every spring.\"",
      "In the meantime, the IRS is preparing to fire thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, the Associated Press reported, citing two sources familiar with the agency's plans. It's unclear how many IRS workers could be impacted, however, the AP noted. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "The cuts would come even as IRS employees were told they would not be able to participate in the Trump administration's earlier \"deferred resignation\" offer until after the tax filing deadline had passed.",
      "A letter sent earlier this month to IRS workers said that \"critical filing season positions in Taxpayer Services, Information Technology and the Taxpayer Advocate Service are exempt\" from the administration's buyout plan until May 15.",
      "Taxpayers have until April 15 to file their taxes unless they are granted an extension.",

A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",

      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",

    "summary": "The Senate confirmed Kash Patel to serve as director of the FBI, approving a key ally of President Trump to lead the bureau.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Thursday confirmed Kash Patel to serve as director of the FBI, approving a key ally of President Trump to lead the bureau amid warnings from Democrats that he could target the president's perceived political enemies.",
      "Patel's nomination was approved in a party-line vote, 51 to 49. Two Republicans \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 joined Democrats in voting to oppose Patel.",
      "FBI directors are appointed to 10-year terms but can be removed by the president. Chris Wray, whom the president appointed in 2017, resigned at the end of the Biden administration after Mr. Trump pledged to fire him.",
      "Collins and Murkowski both issued statements explaining their decision to oppose Patel's nomination.",
      "Collins cited the recent resignations at the Justice Department and a questionnaire sent to FBI employees about their involvement in cases about the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. His statements and actions \"cast doubt on Mr. Patel's ability to advance the FBI's law enforcement mission in a way that is free from the appearance of political motivation,\" Collins said.",
      "Murkowski said her opposition \"stem[med] from his own prior political activities and how they may influence his leadership.\" She said the FBI \"must be trusted as the federal agency that roots out crime and corruption, not focused on settling political scores,\" and she was \"disappointed that when [Patel] had the opportunity to push back on the administration's decision to force the FBI to provide a list of agents involved in the January 6 investigations and prosecutions, he failed to do so.\"",
      "Turmoil at the FBI",
      "Patel will take the helm of the FBI at a time of turmoil for the nation's premier law enforcement agency and as it weathers allegations of weaponization from Mr. Trump.",
      "Eight senior bureau officials were asked to step down from their posts or face termination last month as part of broader scrutiny of FBI leadership by the Trump administration. The ousted officials oversaw the bureau's national security, criminal and cyber divisions, three sources told CBS News.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove also ordered Brian Driscoll, who was serving as acting director of the FBI until Patel was installed, to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned to the investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol for review to \"determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.\"",
      "A survey was also sent to certain FBI employees about their activities related to the Jan. 6 probes, including the extent of their roles.",
      "The FBI turned over the list of more than 5,000 personnel who worked on Jan. 6 cases last week. While it initially contained employee identification numbers instead of names and other information, Driscoll was later ordered to identify employees by name.",
      "Concerns that the list of names could be made public prompted a group of unnamed FBI agents who worked on the Capitol riot investigations to file lawsuits against the Justice Department seeking to prevent disclosure of the information.",
      "The Justice Department and lawyers for the agents reached an agreement last week in which the government would not make public the list of names unless it provided two days' notice to the agents. Legal proceedings are ongoing in the case.",
      "Patel vowed during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee late last month that \"all FBI employees will be protected from political retribution.\"",
      "\"Every FBI employee will be held to the absolute same standard and no one will be terminated for case assignments,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has vowed to fire \"some\" FBI employees who worked on the Jan. 6 investigations and alleged without evidence they are \"corrupt.\"",
      "Days before the Senate took up his nomination, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, asked the Justice Department's internal watchdog to investigate whether Patel was directing the firing of senior FBI officials as a private citizen.",
      "\"It is unacceptable for a nominee with no current role in government, much less at the FBI, to personally direct unjustified and potentially illegal adverse employment actions against senior career FBI leadership and other dedicated, nonpartisan law enforcement officers,\" Durbin wrote in a letter to Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general.",
      "He also alleged that Patel may have perjured himself during his confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee. During an exchange with Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, Patel said he was not aware of any plans or discussions to punish FBI agents or personnel associated with investigations into Mr. Trump before he was elected to a second term.",
      "Born on Long Island, New York, Patel began his career as a public defender in South Florida and worked as a trial attorney in the Justice Department's National Security Division. He also served as a legal liaison to Joint Special Operations Command.",
      "In 2017, Patel was special counsel on counterterrorism at the House Intelligence Committee, and then worked as a senior committee aide to its then-chairman, former Rep. Devin Nunes, and as senior counsel at the House Reform and Oversight Committee.",
      "During the first Trump administration, Patel worked for the National Security Council, as principal deputy at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and as chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller.",
      "Patel joined the board of directors for the Trump Media and Technology Group, which owns the social media platform Truth Social, in April 2022 and served as a national security adviser to the president during the campaign.",

    "summary": "Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, long a powerful Republican leader in the Senate, won't be running for reelection in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "Former Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell says he won't run for reelection in 2026, announcing his impending departure from the Senate on Thursday, his 83rd birthday.",
      "Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor that he made the decision not to run again last year. McConnell said he's never much liked calling attention to Feb. 20, but he figured his birthday is as good a day as any to make the announcement.",
      "\"Seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate,\" McConnell said. \"Every day in between, I've been humbled by the trust they've placed in me to do their business right here. Representing our commonwealth has been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time. My current term in the Senate will be my last.\"",
      "McConnell has been a U.S. senator from Kentucky since 1985, and he announced one year ago that he would relinquish his leadership role in the Senate. He was the Senate Republican leader from 2007-2025 and is the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history. McConnell served as majority leader from 2015-2021.",
      "The Kentucky Republican's retirement from the Senate was widely expected.",
      "McConnell, a polio survivor, has experienced health issues in recent years, including freezing episodes and falls. Those who have spent time around him recently said he's experiencing some reemergence of polio symptoms that are known to afflict older survivors of the disease. He's been in a wheelchair since a recent fall in the U.S. Capitol.",
      "\"I've never lost sight of the fact that without my mother's devoted care, a childhood encounter with polio could have turned out a lot worse,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor. \"And unless my father had taken a job in the Bluegrass State, my interest in politics might have run a course somewhere else. And if it weren't for an 11th-hour outside-the-box idea on the campaign trail, my Senate career would have been over before it began. Or that if not for the people of Kentucky, time and again agreeing that leadership delivers, and elected me to send back here, it would have been someone else from somewhere taking that seat at the table where I've had a chance to work, strategize, fight and win.\"",
      "As Senate majority leader, McConnell wielded immense power, and was singularly responsible for the fast rate at which President Trump's judicial nominees were confirmed during his first term. He was also famous for blocking the confirmation process after Merrick Garland was nominated to the Supreme Court under President Barack Obama, holding the seat open for a Trump nomination instead.",
      "Still, McConnell diverged with Mr. Trump sometimes, drawing the president's ire. He voted against several of Mr. Trump's more divisive Cabinet nominees \u2014 Health & Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u2014 and was the sole Republican holdout against Gabbard and RFK Jr.",

But the strength of the Senate is not one of them. ... The Senate is still equipped for work of great consequence. And to the disappointment of my critics, I'm still here on the job. I yield the floor.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:59:59 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said his administration is considering dividend checks based on savings found by DOGE. Economists are skeptical.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he's considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. But economists and policy experts across the political spectrum expressed skepticism about the feasibility of such a \"DOGE dividend.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,\" Mr. Trump said at the FII Priority summit, an investment conference in Miami sponsored by Saudi government entities. Mr. Trump didn't provide further details.",
      "The idea of the so-called DOGE dividend surfaced on social media this week when a four-page proposal was posted by an X user, James Fishback. The post caught the eye of Musk, the owner of X, who is spearheading DOGE, and who on Tuesday said he would pitch the idea to Mr. Trump.",
      "According to Fishback's calculation, 20% of the supposed $2 trillion in eventual DOGE savings would be provided to some taxpayers in the form of a direct tax rebate, which he estimated at $5,000 per household. Only households with a tax liability would receive the payment, which means lower-income households that generally don't owe income taxes wouldn't be included.",
      "But economists and policy experts said the plan isn't likely to materialize, citing the implausibility of finding anywhere near $2 trillion in federal cuts, as well as the legislative hurdles in approving such a direct tax payment.",
      "\"It is completely impossible for DOGE to save $2 trillion,\"Jessica Reidl, an economist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Two-thirds of the $7 trillion federal budget goes to Social Security, Medicare, defense, veterans and interest on the debt \u2014 all of which has been taken off the table by President Trump.\"",
      "She added, \"Saving $2 trillion would require eliminating nearly every remaining federal program. DOGE has no legal or constitutional authority to cut this spending; Congress must pass a law and that will not happen.\"",
      "Two-thirds of the nation's $6.7 trillion in annual spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0commitments through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense. In a Feb. 18 interview on Fox News' \"The Sean Hannity Show,\" Mr. Trump reiterated his earlier vow that Social Security and Medicare cuts are off the table.",
      "\"Social Security won't be touched, other than fraud or something,\" Mr. Trump said during the interview. \"We're going to find it's going to be strengthened, but won't be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.\"",
      "On Feb. 19, Mr. Trump backed the House Republicans' budget proposal, which, if enacted, would include deep cuts to Medicaid, the nearly $900-billion-a-year government health insurance program that serves about 79 million mostly low-income or disabled Americans.",
      "The White House didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE cuts",
      "As of Wednesday, DOGE claims it has made cuts that add up to\u00a0about $8.4 billion, according to the task force's own\u00a0documentation.",
      "While DOGE has only been operating since Mr. Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, its cuts are far from reaching Musk's stated goal of shaving $500 billion in annual government spending, let alone reaching near $2 trillion, experts noted.",
      "The plan \"is very unrealistic,\" Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, who describes himself as a libertarian, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I'd love to see it, but I think that is unrealistic, especially in the first year, and certainly unrealistic without Congress getting involved.\"",
      "Any new tax refund check would need the approval of Congress, which controls government spending and is in charge of crafting tax laws. But House Republicans are currently\u00a0negotiating a budget proposal\u00a0that would enact trillions of dollars in spending cuts to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as other tax provisions the president promised on the campaign trail.",
      "A DOGE dividend \"will make their numbers even harder to work in the budget reconciliation,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a Washington, D.C.-based left-leaning economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's hard to see how to make the math work.\"",
      "While a plan for some kind of DOGE dividend could materialize, it would doubtless be a much smaller amount than envisioned, given the practical impossibility of finding $2 trillion in federal cuts.",
      "Experts noted that rebate checks are typically issued in times of economic stress, such as during the pandemic, when Congress authorized several rounds of stimulus checks. But the U.S. economy today is viewed as strong, given growing GDP and low unemployment, they added.",
      "At the same time, the federal government's annual outlays are outpacing revenue by about $2 trillion, creating budget deficits and sending the nation's debt to a record $36.2 trillion.",
      "Reidl noted, \"Washington is facing annual budget deficits that will likely surpass $3 trillion within the next few years. Sending taxpayers dividend checks would be completely irresponsible.\"",
      "DOGE facing legal issues",
      "Experts also raised the issue of whether DOGE's cuts could be reversed by the courts, given that the group is facing multiple lawsuits over its access to sensitive data across various agencies as well as over the legality of its creation.",
      "\"I'm happy to see [DOGE] identify things that can be cut, but I do have concerns about the legality of it,\" Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute said. \"Congress appropriates money, and having the presidential quasi-commission go around and cut things seems like it would run afoul of a lot of laws.\"",
      "DOGE's savings so far could \"be reversed by the courts for bypassing Congress,\" Reidl noted.",
      "Given the challenges of trying to find anything close to $2 trillion in savings, as well as the legislative issues in passing a tax rebate check, experts said their advice to taxpayers is not to bank on getting a DOGE dividend.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:51:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"reinventing government\" program cut over 480,000 federal jobs and thousands of regulations. The woman who ran the program says any similarities to DOGE end there.",
    "story": [
      "As President Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency push to slash spending, Republican allies have likened their efforts to a White House program from more than 30 years ago.",
      "After entering the White House in 1993, Democratic President Bill Clinton tasked Vice President Al Gore with looking for ways to cut waste and red tape and streamline the federal bureaucracy to \"create a government that works better and costs less.\"",
      "The \"reinventing government\" program cut nearly half a million federal jobs and dispensed with a massive number of regulations. But according to the woman who ran the program under the Clinton administration, any similarities between that program and DOGE end there.",
      "\"We cut fat and they cut muscle. It's as simple as that,\" Elaine Kamarck, now a senior fellow in Governance Studies at Brookings, told CBS News. \"We didn't have any meltdowns of agencies, we didn't have any dysfunction going on, and we obeyed the law. When we thought something was wrong, we sent it to Congress and asked them to change it.\"",
      "The National Partnership for Reinventing Government followed through on Clinton's campaign promise to make the government more efficient and effective. The project was spearheaded by Gore and officially\u00a0created in March 1993, kicking off a review of government agencies that would go on to become the longest-running reform effort in the nation's history. It wrapped up its work in 1998.",
      "Kamarck was hired by Gore to direct the program, and the two put together a team of about 400 civil servants who worked across a number of teams. They conducted reviews of Cabinet-level agencies with a partner team within the agency and returned recommendations for review. Six months later, the project had yielded hundreds of recommendations bound in a report titled\u00a0 \"Creating a Government that Works Better & Costs Less.\"",
      "The effort, which would ultimately trim the federal workforce by around 426,000 in less than eight years while cutting thousands of pages of regulations, was focused on saving the government money. But Kamarck said it also focused on \"making the government work better,\" with attention toward performance and customer service standards that remain today.",
      "\"Basically, we worked with people in the government to identify where we could make it work better, and where we could make it cost less,\" Kamarck said.",
      "The program went on well beyond the six-month review period to focus on implementation, acting upon around two-thirds of the recommendations, and yielding an estimated $136 billion in savings for taxpayers.",
      "Now, more than three decades later, a new cost-cutting effort is underway. Mr. Trump\u00a0announced in December that Musk, who played a major role in his reelection effort, would lead DOGE in the new administration, and signed an\u00a0executive order on his first day in office to officially create the Department of Government Efficiency. Its\u00a0website says it's found $55 billion in savings so far, but a CBS News review of those savings shows some discrepancies.",
      "Unlike the Clinton-era program, which took six months to make its recommendations, DOGE has worked with Cabinet department and agency heads to shrink the government workforce immediately and pause swaths of government spending. DOGE first turned its focus to excising federal contracts and spending on issues like diversity, equity and inclusion provisions and\u00a0foreign aid and has moved on to other federal agencies.",
      "The Trump administration offered a\u00a0deferred resignation plan to more than 2 million civilian federal employees and convinced 75,000 to accept it before shutting it down and ordered agencies to\u00a0lay off nearly all probationary employees.",
      "DOGE has also gained\u00a0access to the Treasury Department's payment system. And an IRS employee associated with DOGE\u00a0requested access to the IRS' data system that includes individual taxpayer information in recent days.",
      "The moves have sparked controversy \u2014 and lawsuits \u2014 over the administration's authority to carry out its dramatic reshaping of the federal government in a compressed period of time.",
      "Facing scrutiny, Musk and allies have held up the example of the Clinton administration's government overhaul seemingly as a kind of model for their own. During a hearing held by the House's newly created DOGE subcommittee last week, one Republican lawmaker showed a video featuring Clinton and Gore's announcement after the six-month review to remind Democrats of what their \"party believed in.\" Musk himself has highlighted the comparison between his work and the effort three decades prior in recent days, sharing an AI-generated\u00a0post on reductions to the federal workforce under the Clinton administration and concurring with a\u00a0post that called Clinton and Gore \"the original Doges.\"",
      "Kamarck, though she has\u00a0advocated for new government cuts, said the \"big difference\" between the Clinton administration program and DOGE is that the earlier program sought to understand what was going on in the agency and what was important, using a fine-toothed comb to make cuts.",
      "\"If they were doing it the same way we did it, they could do a hell of a lot of good for the government,\" Kamarck said. \"But instead, they're just, they're throwing out the baby with the bath water.\"",
      "Still, Clinton's government cutting received its share of criticism, sparking frustrations when the program chose to close many regional offices deemed to be obsolete and incompatible with advancements in electronic communications. Kamarck conceded that they didn't win every fight. Though they succeeded on procurement reform, pioneered electronic filing of tax returns and generally helped usher the federal government into the internet age, they fell short on civil service reform without an advocate in Congress.",
      "And although their effort to reduce the size of the government workforce took place over years instead of weeks, there were some who felt that the buyout strategy they used was not as effective as it could have been. \"Many with special skills left, and people who stayed might have been those we'd have wanted to leave,\" Donald Kettl, the former dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland,\u00a0told Government Executive in 2013.",
      "Kamarck said the process the Clinton administration followed is the \"harder way to do it\" \u2014 and not how DOGE is proceeding.",
      "\"They are pretending that there is no law governing the bureaucracy,\" she said.",

Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on Wednesday urged her colleagues in Congress to reassert their constitutional authority and stand up to President Trump if he withholds funding approved by lawmakers through his\u00a0mass firings of federal workers or severe cuts to federal agencies.",
      "\"If the president, for instance, should seek to withhold federal funding that has already been authorized and appropriated, that violates the Budget Act, it violates the Impoundment Act and it cannot be allowed to stand. And so, if we in Congress allow that, we effectively cede some of our authority, and so, your question as to, what do we do about it? We have to stand up,\" she said in a virtual town hall with constituents.",
      "\"Now, the 'we' has to be more than just me. And this is where it becomes more of a challenge, but it requires speaking out. It requires saying, 'That violates the law. That violates the authorities of the executive,'\" she said.",
      "The Alaska Republican said Congress has an \"obligation to the Constitution\" that requires \"speaking out and standing up, and that requires, again, more than just one or two Republicans \u2014 it requires us as a Congress to do so.\"",
      "The president's moves to essentially shutter several agencies and fire thousands of workers have already run into legal challenges, with federal courts across the country weighing whether his actions were lawful. The administration has been temporarily blocked from ousting workers and freezing funding in a handful of cases so far.",
      "Murkowski is a moderate Republican who has been in the Senate since 2002 and won reelection in 2022 despite longstanding differences with Mr. Trump. She said more than 1,000 people dialed into the call on Wednesday, and that many of her constituents were concerned about the Trump administration's cuts, which are being spearheaded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Alaska has one of the highest concentrations of federal government workers per capita outside the Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia region.",
      "Most Republican lawmakers have so far shown little interest in objecting as the Trump administration tries to whittle down agencies established and funded by Congress.",
      "On the war in Ukraine, Murkowski said \"we were all more than a little bit stunned\" by what she called a \"radical switch\" in the president's rhetoric about the war and Russia. Mr. Trump this week referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a \"dictator\" and wrongly blamed Ukraine for Russia's invasion, while his top aides met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia about the war without inviting Ukrainian officials.",
      "Murkowski said she thought Mr. Trump's comments about Zelenskyy were \"uncalled for and unfortunate.\"",
      "\"It is wrong to suggest that somehow or other Ukraine started this war, asked for this war. It is clear for all the world to see and to know that Putin invaded Ukraine and started the war,\" Murkowski said.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said Russia wants to end the war, without mentioning that Russia started the conflict and could end it at any point by withdrawing troops from Ukraine. Asked if he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith on ending the war, the president said he does.",
      "\"I do, I think the Russians want to see the war end,\" the president said. \"And I do, I really do. But I think they have the cards a little bit because, you know, they've taken a lot of territory, so they have the cards.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the Trump Organization and Trump golf courses have business connections to the Saudis.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump spoke at an investment conference in Miami sponsored by Saudi government entities on Wednesday, an address that transpired as the Trump Organization seeks to expand its real estate empire in Saudi Arabia and as the president looks to strengthen ties with the Middle East partner.",
      "The president's speech came a day after the U.S. and Russia held talks in the Saudi capital of Riyadh on how to end the war in Ukraine, and the administration is seeking Saudi Arabia's cooperation on a range of issues, including the war in Gaza. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowed to invest $600 billion in the U.S. over the next four years in a phone call with Mr. Trump shortly after he took office in January.",
      "The\u00a0FII PRIORITY Summit\u00a0in Miami Beach is billed as an opportunity for \"thought leaders, investors and policymakers\" to come together and \"unleash extraordinary value creation.\" The Saudi Public Investment Fund is a key backer of the Miami conference, along with other Saudi government entities, including the Saudi Ministry of Investment and Riyad Bank, which the Saudi government controls.",
      "Led by the crown prince, the Saudi Public Investment Fund reportedly invested $2 billion in Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner's private equity firm after Mr. Trump left the White House in 2021. The fund is also a major backer of LIV Golf, which has held several tournaments at Trump golf courses.",
      "The Trump family businesses' ties with the Saudis raise questions about why he's delivering the speech, and whether the president's business interests might influence how he manages the relationship with the nation's authoritarian leadership.",
      "\"You kind of have to question when you see something like this, is this being done to advance Trump's business interests, or is there a reason America wants a president there?\" Jordan Libowitz, vice president of communications for the Citizens for Responsible Ethics in Government or CREW, said of Mr. Trump's speech.",
      "\"The president's involved in business deals in a foreign country and you've got to wonder, what's he putting first, his business or Americans'?\" Libowitz asked.",
      "The president began his speech by touting his properties in the Miami area, before mentioning Middle Eastern leaders, but he only acknowledged Saudi Arabia and its leaders by name. The president nodded \"in particular the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a special place with special leaders\" and mentioned Saudi finance minister Mohammad Al-Jadaan.",
      "Mr. Trump pointed out that the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., Princess Reema Bandar Al-Saud, was seated next to his right-hand man, billionaire Elon Musk in the audience. He also gave a nod to his son-in-law and former Middle East point person, Jared Kushner, \"a very special guy.\"",
      "He thanked Saudi Arabia for doing a \"great job\" in hosting the talks on Russia and Ukraine and the crown prince, and he again bashed Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a\u00a0\"dictator.\"\u00a0The White House also said bin Salman played a role in the recent release of an American detained in Russia, Marc Fogel.",
      "The president reiterated his plan to give businesses that manufacture their products in the U.S. lower tax corporate tax rates.",
      "\"I come today with a simple message for business leaders from all across the nation and all around the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If you want to build the future, push boundaries, unleash breakthroughs, transform industries or make a fortune. Do you want to make a fortune? Most of you have already made a fortune, I don't want to say. There's no better place on earth than the current and future United States of America under a certain president named Donald J. Trump,\" he said.",
      "The president also lauded his administration's work to deport illegal immigrants, and Musk's work to slash the size of government \u2014 his goal is to cut up to $2 trillion in spending. The president floated the idea of giving 20% of the savings achieved by the Department of Government Efficiency back to Americans.",
      "\"We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,\" Mr. Trump said, although 20% of those savings would only put a small dent in the federal debt, which is currently over $36 trillion. It's unclear where the other 60% would go.",
      "The Saudi embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News.",
      "The Future Investment Initiative Institute, which hosted the speech, said the president did not receive any type of compensation for his appearance.",
      "\"President of Trump's appearance at the Priority Summit in Miami proved the institute's credibility, relevance and impact,\" the institute said in a statement. \"We are proud of the work we do to identify issues of concern to global citizens, such as cost of living, access to healthcare, climate, and impact of technology, and to lead conversations about how investment can serve as a force for good.\"",
      "Asked why the president chose to speak at the event, a White House official told CBS News ahead of the speech that the president would be \"encouraging investment in the United States.\"",
      "Business ties to the Saudis",
      "The president handed over day-to-day operations of the Trump Organization to his children and placed his assets in a trust before taking office in January, similar to an arrangement he made before his first term. But he has declined to fully divest from his business interests, raising questions about the potential for conflicts of interest in his dealings with foreign entities.",
      "Last year, the Trump Organization announced plans for the development of a Trump Tower in Jeddah, a major Saudi city along the Red Sea.",
      "Eric Trump, the president's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, announced the Jeddah deal in December. He told Reuters that the Trump Organization also has plans for a Trump-branded property in Riyadh.",
      "\"What I'll tell you is one of them will definitely be a tower,\" Eric Trump told the news agency, declining to offer other details.",
      "Kushner, who handled Middle East affairs for Mr. Trump in the White House during the first Trump term, grew close with the Saudi crown prince, despite the CIA assessing as far back as 2018 that bin Salman, known as MBS, approved the murder of Washington Post columnist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi.",
      "Kushner recently dismissed any conflict of interest concerns about the Saudi investment fund's stake in his private equity firm, Affinity Partners. He also scoffed when asked if he believed a declassified U.S. intelligence report released in 2021 that found the crown prince approved the killing of Khashoggi. Kushner said he has not seen the report.",
      "\"Are we really still doing this?\" Kushner first replied last week when asked if he believed the U.S. intelligence report pointing to MBS.",
      "The Saudi-funded LIV Golf league, which has held talks to merge with the PGA Tour, is scheduled to hold a tournament at the Trump National Doral in April, after hosting multiple events at Trump properties in recent years. Mr. Trump has deflected criticism of his involvement with the Saudi-backed tournament by casting doubt on the Saudis' involvement in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying, \"Well, nobody's gotten to the bottom of 9/11, unfortunately, and they should have.\"",
      "Human Rights Watch specifically names the Saudis' involvement with LIV as a serious concern, saying the country is trying to \"'sportswash' its egregious human rights record.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump met with the PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan at the White House, with a potential deal between the PGA Tour and LIV subject to scrutiny by federal regulators.",
      "\"We are grateful that his leadership has brought us closer to a final deal, paving the way for reunification of men's professional golf,\" Monahan and players Tiger Woods and Adam Scott said in a statement after the meeting.",
      "Ethical and national security questions",
      "Libowitz suggested that a sitting U.S. president with business interests that involve a foreign government complicates the relationship.",
      "\"Look, you're not going to be able to do major business deals in a country, particularly an authoritarian country, if that country doesn't want you to,\" Libowitz said.",
      "Presidents aren't subject to the federal statute prohibiting federal employees from participating in government matters that could affect their financial interests or those of their families, said Jessica Tillipman, associate dean for government procurement law studies at the George Washington University Law School.",
      "\"The president just doesn't have any of those limitations that you would traditionally see of an executive branch federal employee,\" Tillipman said.",
      "Still, it's traditionally been a norm that a president would divest himself from his business interests, or place some interests in a blind trust.",
      "\"We've seen no indication that the president intends to separate himself from his existing financial interests,\" Tillipman said. \"Again, he's not legally required to do any of this.\"",
      "Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, said Mr. Trump's failure to properly divest from his business holdings raise not only ethical concerns, but national security ones.",
      "\"Trump has not properly divested from his business holdings and recently announced a new hotel in Saudi Arabia,\" Amey said. \"The Trump Organization's website sells tickets to the Saudi-owned golf league event at Trump's Miami golf course. Every meeting that involves current or potential business partners or investors is a conflict. These entanglements raise numerous ethics concerns as well as national security concerns because we are talking about Saudi interests where there is even less of a distinction between the ruling family and their businesses.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says it is pulling the plug on New York City's controversial congestion pricing toll, just weeks after it started, but Gov. Kathy Hochul and the MTA are fighting to keep it in place.",
      "In a letter to Hochul on Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Transportation said it was terminating its Nov. 2024 agreement with the state. This after President Trump\u00a0spoke with Hochul at least twice about ending the program, according to a highly placed source familiar with the matter.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called congestion pricing \"backwards and unfair,\" saying it is harmful to small businesses.",
      "\"New York State's congestion pricing plan is a slap in the face to working class Americans and small business owners,\" Duffy wrote. \"Commuters using the highway system to enter New York City have already financed the construction and improvement of these highways through the payment of gas taxes and other taxes. But now the toll program leaves drivers without any free highway alternative, and instead, takes more money from working people to pay for a transit system and not highways. It's backwards and unfair. The program also hurts small businesses in New York that rely on customers from New Jersey and Connecticut. Finally, it impedes the flow of commerce into New York by increasing costs for trucks, which in turn could make goods more expensive for consumer. Every American should be able to access New York City regardless of their economic means. It shouldn't be reserved for an elite few.\"",
      "Not long after the move to end the program, Mr. Trump posted on social media \"CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!\"",
      "The president addressed congestion pricing late Wednesday on Air Force 1.",
      "\"Congestion pricing is not a good situation. They're treating the people of New York very badly,\" he said. \"Supposing you worked at a shoe shop or you worked in a restaurant as a waiter, and you have to come into Manhattan and they're taking, you know, many, many dollars out of your pocket. You can't afford to do it.\"",
      "Hochul, MTA and Riders Alliance push back",
      "Hochul was clearly not happy with what transpired Wednesday and vowed in a statement to fight the Trump administration in court.",
      "\"Public transit is the lifeblood of New York City and critical to our economic future -- as a New Yorker, like President Trump, knows very well,\" Hochul said. \"Since this first-in-the-nation program took effect last month, congestion has dropped dramatically and commuters are getting to work faster than ever. Broadway shows are selling out and foot traffic to local businesses is spiking. School buses are getting kids to class on time, and yellow cab trips increased by 10%. Transit ridership is up, drivers are having a better experience, and support for this program is growing every day.\"",
      "Hochul then took aim at Mr. Trump's remarks on social media.",
      "\"We are a nation of laws, not ruled by a king. The MTA has initiated legal proceedings in the Southern District of New York to preserve this critical program. We'll see you in court,\" Hochul said.",
      "The MTA said Wednesday it was filing papers in court to make sure the program stays in place. MTA Chairman and CEO Janno Lieber called the move by the Trump administration to rescind approval \"mystifying,\" saying the program has been a success.",
      "\"Today, the MTA filed papers in federal court to ensure that the highly successful program -- which has already dramatically reduced congestion, bringing reduced traffic and faster travel times, while increasing speeds for buses and emergency vehicles -- will continue notwithstanding this baseless effort to snatch those benefits away from the millions of mass transit users, pedestrians and, especially, the drivers who come to the Manhattan Central Business District,\" Lieber said in a statement. \"It's mystifying that after four years and 4,000 pages of federally-supervised environmental review -- and barely three months after giving final approval to the Congestion Relief Program -- USDOT would seek to totally reverse course.\"",
      "The Riders Alliance also said\u00a0it will fight to keep congestion pricing.",
      "\"Public transit riders won congestion relief and are now enjoying faster and more reliable bus service from throughout New York and New Jersey. We organized for a decade, held two governors accountable, and prevailed in court in three states after years of exhaustive environmental studies. We are committed to maintaining and expanding on our victory and will defend it with everything we have,\" Riders Alliance Director Betsy Plum said.",
      "\"It is raising money to create construction jobs, fixing the subway. It is backwards and unfair to go back into the past to a gridlocked New York,\" Riders Alliance Director of Policy and Communications Danny Pearlstein added. \"We've won in court in New York, New Jersey, in Pennsylvania already defending congestion pricing. We are no stranger to litigation. We'll be back, and we expect to have the governor of New York and the MTA right alongside us.\"",
      "Hochul takes aim at Trump's \"long live the king\" comment",
      "At a press conference with MTA leadership Wednesday afternoon, the governor responded to Mr. Trump's \"long live the king\" comment posted on social media.",
      "\"I'm here to say, New York hasn't labored under a king in over 250 years, and we are not, we sure as hell are not gonna start now. The streets of the city where battles were fought, we stood up to a king and we won then. In case you don't know New Yorkers, we're in a fight, we do not back down - not now, not ever,\" Hochul said.",
      "She went on to say she and the MTA were fighting for all New Yorkers -- from commuters and drivers to emergency personnel and residents with asthma.",
      "\"I don't care if you love congestion pricing or hate it, this is an attack on our sovereign identity, our independence from Washington. We are a nation of states. This is what we fought for. This is what people like Alexander Hamilton and others fought for, to set up a system where you're not subservient to a king or anyone else out of Washington,\" Hochul said.",
      "Hochul also said the license plate reader cameras will be staying on, and Lieber added the MTA's legal filing states it will not be turning off the tolls until there is a court order.",
      "\"New York ain't going back. We tried gridlock for 60 years, it didn't work. It cost our economy billions. But you know what's helping our economy, what's making New York a better place? Congestion pricing,\" Lieber said.",
      "While Hochul and Lieber both say they are confident they will be able to beat the Trump administration in court, Hochul said commuters should now think of the president whenever they are stuck in traffic.",
      "\"If in some world that they are successful, the next time you're stuck in traffic, the next time your train is delayed, the next time you're in a flooded station because infrastructure repairs were not made, I want you to think of this,\" Hochul said, holding up an image posted on the official White House social media pages depicting Mr. Trump wearing a crown with the caption \"LONG LIVE THE KING.\"",
      "Opponents thrilled with Trump administration's decision",
      "Some New York City and suburban leaders hailed the decision to pull the plug on the program.",
      "\"We've said this was a loser from Day 1,\" Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella said. \"This is good news for the people who have basically been, I think, hijacked by many of those who said this was going to help them, when, in fact, it hurt them.\"",
      "Fossella acknowledged traffic had improved in parts of the area, but said that's no reason for Staten Island residents to have to pay a third toll.",
      "\"Staten Island residents who have to commute by car to work already pay two tolls. This would be a third to travel in and around the city. And yeah, sure, there may have been pockets where traffic was reduced, but it was amplified in other parts of the city, outside the Central Business District, which is what we all predicted from Day 1,\" Fossella said.",
      "\"There is no no-toll option to enter into our city center using these federal funded highways. And so they're within their right to reverse this decision. And I'm glad that the president did,\" Rep. Nicole Malliotakis said. \"It is a bad policy that hurts our economy, hurts small businesses, hurts residents.\"",
      "Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman lauded the Trump administration for doing away with what he calls a \"very oppressive tax on the hard-working families of the Metropolitan Area.\"",
      "\"It didn't make any sense and my commissioner to the MTA, David Mack, was the sole commissioner to vote against it, and he was right, and President Trump was right. This is an oppressive tax. It's a burden on the taxpayers. It's a burden on the students. It's a burden on the people who work in that area. And it was the right thing to do to terminate it,\" Blakeman added.",
      "Blakeman said Nassau County residents were \"mad as hell\" about the tolling plan.",
      "\"Spending $9 just for the privilege of driving on a public thoroughfare is not something that goes over well for people who have to work in downtown Manhattan, people who are students in downtown Manhattan, people who just want to take their kids there for the day. So they were very angry about this and I think they are going to be very happy this tax is terminated,\" Blakeman said.",
      "Hempstead, the nation's largest township, sued the MTA, charging congestion pricing exceeded its congressional authority as a pilot program. Supervisor Don Clavin said he was gratified legal challenges like his were cited in the decision to pull the plug.",
      "\"I've never seen the Tri-State Area so galvanized, so against something as congestion pricing,\" Clavin said. \"They overreached. They had to go back to Congress seeking authority.\"",
      "Among those also applauding was Charlton D'Souza, president of Passengers United, which represents Long Island Rail Road riders. The group opposed congestion pricing.",
      "\"I've been going to the MTA meetings for years. This agency is accountable to no one. It's a mess,\" D'Souza said. \"The MTA didn't provide any additional service, so the trains have been crowded on the Long Island Rail Road. The buses have been crowded.\"",
      "Congressman Mike Lawler, who has been mentioned as a possible gubernatorial candidate in 2026, also released a statement thanking Mr. Trump and blasting Hochul.",
      "\"This is a huge win for New York families, commuters, and small businesses ruthlessly targeted by this unjust tax,\" Lawler said, in part. \"Make no mistake: this entire program is nothing more than a scam -- a money grab -- and is the symptom of a far deeper, systemic issue in our state -- government overreach and rampant mismanagement at the hands of Kathy Hochul and her cronies in Albany.",
      "\"Instead of imposing new, crippling taxes on struggling families, we should be auditing the MTA, the worst-run authority in America, to find savings, address its outrageous waste, and make sure that commuters are kept safe and served as well as they deserve,\" he added.",
      "New Jersey lawmakers take a victory lap",
      "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy,\u00a0who earlier had said congestion pricing was the one area where he and Mr. Trump could find common ground, released the following statement:",
      "\"I want to thank President Trump and Secretary Duffy for their efforts to halt the current congestion pricing program in Manhattan's Central Business District. While I have consistently expressed openness to a form of congestion pricing that meaningfully protects the environment and does not unfairly burden hardworking New Jersey commuters, the current program lines the MTA's pockets at the expense of New Jerseyans.",
      "\"Although we have had a difference of opinion with our colleagues in New York on congestion pricing, we have always had a productive relationship with our neighbors across the Hudson. I look forward to continuing that spirit of partnership for the benefit of the entire Tri-State Area.\"",

From Day 1, when we first started this fight, we knew that the Congestion Tax was just a giant cash grab for New York and the MTA -- all on the backs of hardworking Jersey families,\" Gotthaimer said in a statement. \"They never cared about how the tax would hurt Jersey families. They just needed the cash to pay for the MTA's woeful mismanagement. That was just confirmed today, and now, we can all breathe a sigh of relief. I'll never stop fighting to protect Jersey families. As I always say, don't mess with Jersey. Screw with us, and you'll find out why.\"",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed the Pentagon to come up with plans to cut 8% from the defense budget in each of the next five years, according to sources familiar with his plans. The Defense Departmen expects to redirect those fund to other programs in the department that would be prioritized by President Trump.",
      "Robert Salesses, who is performing the duties of deputy secretary of defense, said in a statement Wednesday evening that the department intends to produce budgets \"that revive the warrior ethos, rebuild our military, and reestablish deterrence.\"",
      "Some of the Trump priorities Salesses mentioned include border security, building an Iron Dome defense system for the U.S. and ending government diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "Iron Dome is envisioned as an extensive, multilayered air defense system for the U.S. that Trump has said should include the ability to shoot down incoming missiles from space.",
      "He said that the secretary has ordered a review of spending plans in the Biden administration's budget budget to offset the costs of Trump priorities for the 2026 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1. Salesses confirmed in the statement that the department seeks cuts of 8% from the Biden defense budget that would add up to about $50 billion. He mentioned \"so-called 'climate change' and other woke programs, as well as excessive bureaucracy,\" as line items that would be excised.",
      "It was not clear which parts of the Pentagon's spending on diversity and equity programs or its spending to address climate change \u2014 such as buying alternate fuels for aircraft, or making bases more resistant to the effects of extreme weather, such as the 2018 hurricane that caused significant damage to Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida \u2014 would be targeted or could add up to $50 billion in savings.",
      "The spending cuts mandate comes as the military is quickly trying to write its fiscal year 2026 request, a congressional process that often starts late during transitions between new presidential administrations.",
      "The cuts would be as drastic as the single-year savings ordered across the military in the 2013 sequestration, a law passed by Congress that was intended to force the legislative branch to reach agreement on budget deficit reductions and instead forced the services to cut $56 billion in a matter of months.",
      "Because of the way the military budget is structured, long-term, high-dollar procurement programs at the time were protected, as were most entitlements such as military retirement and health care.",
      "At the time, the accounts that were easier to cut were found in operations, maintenance and personnel. The services lost noncommissioned officers \u2014 highly trained mid-level enlisted personnel \u2014 and cut training such as flight hours. Military training accidents quickly climbed.",
      "In the years since the sequester, Congress and the services have directed additional protections to operations and maintenance spending.",

      "Mr. Trump inflated the amount of assistance the U.S. has sent to Ukraine since Russia's invasion in 2022. The U.S. has provided $66 billion in security assistance. In total, Congress has appropriated $175 billion in economic, humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine.",

      "The clarification comes after Mr. Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are 100, 200 and even 300 years old are improperly and routinely getting benefits.",
      "Because Social Security records are not public, it's not possible to independently verify Musk's claim. However, the Social Security Administration automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency is seeking to root out fraud, waste and abuse, issued a slew of posts on his social media platform X on Monday night, including: \"Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security.\"",
      "To be sure, there are instances of overpayments and fraud within the Social Security system. A\u00a0July 2024 report\u00a0from Social Security's inspector general stated that from fiscal years 2015 through 2022, the agency paid out almost $8.6 trillion in benefits, including $71.8 billion \u2014 or less than 1% \u2014 in improper payments. Most of the erroneous payments were overpayments to living people.",

This does not mean, however, that these individuals were receiving benefits.",
      "The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million.",

      "Treasury clawbacks",
      "In early January, the U.S. Treasury clawed back more than $31 million in a variety of federal payments\u2014 not just Social Security payments\u2014 that improperly went to dead people, a recovery that former Treasury official David Lebryk said was \"just the tip of the iceberg.\"",
      "The money was reclaimed as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave the Department of Treasury temporary access to the Social Security Administration's \"Full Death Master File\" for three years as part of the omnibus appropriations bill in 2021. The SSA maintains the most complete federal database of individuals who have died, and the file contains more than 142 million records, which go back to 1899, according to the Treasury.",
      "Treasury estimated in January that it would recover more than $215 million during its three-year access period, which runs from December 2023 through 2026.",
      "Chuck Blahous, a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said, \"Two cheers for Elon Musk if he can root out and put a stop to improper payments.\"",
      "But to pick the places in the federal government where error rates are high, \"Social Security would be near the bottom of the list, not near the top,\" Blahous said. \"Medicaid improper payment rates are quite substantial, and soared after the Medicaid expansion of the ACA.\"",
      "\"By all means \u2014 go after any improper payments that are found, but let's not pretend that's where the system's biggest financial problems are,\" he said.",

      "The email was sent to managers of the IRS Small Business/Self-Employed Division Wednesday, and it says that the affected SBSE employees will be notified Thursday by the IRS Human Capital Office.",
      "The email, signed by SBSE commissioner Lia Colbert and SBSE deputy commissioner Maha Williams, says that \"while details are still developing, we understand that over 3,500 SB/SE probationary hires will be terminated by the end of this week.\"",
      "According to the email, the probationary workers who are expected to be fired \"were not deemed as critical to filing season.\" The layoffs are expected to take place a couple of weeks before the tax filing season reaches peak activity, in mid-March through mid-April. The New York Times was first to report that 6,000 IRS employees are expected to be cut.",
      "The IRS will be carrying out some of the highest numbers of mass terminations known so far at a department or agency \u2014 and these figures represent only a single department within the IRS. Managers in the IRS Large Business & International Division also received an email that asked them to come into the office Thursday and Friday \"to support offboarding activities.\" It did not specify a number of employees that could be terminated.",
      "CBS News has also reached out to the IRS and White House for comment.",
      "The IRS has tens of thousands of employees \u2014 it used 82,990 full-time equivalent positions to carry out its work in 2023. Under former President Joe Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act boosted IRS funding over the next decade by $80 billion. A fraction of this, $1.4 billion, was rescinded in a bill passed by Congress in 2023.",
      "The anticipated layoffs are taking place after the Trump administration and the Office of Personnel Management issued a directive to cut probationary workers across federal agencies. The federal government's probationary workers are those who are still in a trial period that typically extends for one to two years of employment in their position.",
      "This past weekend, an IRS employee affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency requested access to an internal data system within the IRS that houses Americans' individual personal tax information. An executive order signed by Trump in early February instructed agency heads to work with DOGE and initiate \"large scale reductions in force.\"",
      "The Wednesday email to SBSE managers goes on to say that later Wednesday, they would receive a list of the employees who are to be terminated. After telling managers to instruct employees to be in the office at the end of the week, the email also asked SBSE managers to be in the office for the rest of the week.",
      "The SBSE division makes sure small business owners comply with their tax obligations, like filing their taxes, and it offers help with debt resolution. It serves more than 57 million small business owners and entrepreneurs with less than $10 million in assets, according to the IRS website.",
      "\"IT will be available to help secure equipment. If IT is not available, managers will secure equipment,\" the email to SBSE managers reads. It adds that there will be a guide and FAQ guide \"to help guide managers through this difficult process.\"",
      "Some LB&I employees were also called and emailed Wednesday to be summoned to the office later this week and were told to bring any government-issued equipment with them, like access cards and paper case files.",
      "\"Under an executive order, IRS has been directed to terminate probationary employees who were not deemed as critical to filing season. We don't have many details that we are permitted to share, but this is all tied to compliance with the executive order,\" according to the text of the email shared with CBS News.",
      "Before cuts of the probationary workers at several agencies began last week, federal employees were offered a \"deferred resignation\" buyout program by the Trump administration. The program offered employees the option to resign and go on administrative leave while retaining their pay and benefits until Sept. 30. Over 75,000 employees opted in before the program's deadline, according to the White House. The program is facing legal challenges, but a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled in early February that the program could continue. Within an hour of the ruling, the Office of Personal Management announced the deadline to participate had passed.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:57:40 -0500",
    "summary": "The move threatens to cast a cloud of uncertainty over many migrants who applying for immigration benefits that would allow them to stay in the U.S. legally and, in some cases, permanently.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has enacted a pause on all immigration applications filed by migrants from Latin America and Ukraine allowed into the U.S. under certain Biden-era programs, citing fraud and security concerns, according to two U.S. officials and an internal memo obtained by CBS News.",
      "The application freeze will remain in place indefinitely while government officials work to identify potential cases of fraud and enhance vetting procedures to mitigate concerns related to national security and public safety, according to the directive.",
      "The move, which had not been previously reported, threatens to cast a cloud of uncertainty over many migrants who were in the process of applying for various immigration benefits that would allow them to stay in the U.S. legally and, in some cases, permanently.",
      "While the exact number of affected migrants is unclear, the hold on applications applies to several Biden administration programs that allowed hundreds of thousands of foreigners to come to the U.S. legally through an immigration law known as parole. That law empowers the U.S. government to welcome foreigners quickly on humanitarian or public benefit grounds.",
      "The Biden administration used parole at an unprecedented scale, partially to encourage migrants to sign up for legal migration channels instead of crossing the southern border unlawfully. The Trump administration moved swiftly to suspend those efforts, arguing that they abused the parole authority.",
      "The Trump administration had previously halted new entries under Biden-era parole policies. But in a memo dated Feb. 14, Andrew Davidson, a top U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services official, ordered an agency-wide \"administrative pause\" on all \"pending benefit requests\" filed by migrants already allowed into the U.S. under three Biden administration programs.",
      "They include a policy, called Uniting for Ukraine, set up to offer a safe haven to those fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Roughly 240,000 Ukrainians with American sponsors arrived in the U.S. under that process before President Trump took office. Another affected program, known as CHNV, allowed 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans sponsored by American citizens to enter the U.S.",
      "The third impacted program consists of processes that permitted some Colombians, Ecuadorians, Central Americans, Haitians and Cubans with American relatives to come to the U.S. to wait for a family-based green card to become available.",
      "Because those allowed into the U.S. under these programs were only given temporary work permits and deportation protections that typically last for two years, many of them applied for other immigration benefits, lawyers and experts said.",
      "Those benefits include a program known as Temporary Protected Status for migrants from crisis-stricken countries like Haiti, Ukraine and Venezuela; asylum, which allows those fleeing persecution to gain a permanent safe haven in the U.S.; and green cards, or permanent American residency. Because of a Cold War-era law, Cubans paroled into the U.S. are eligible to apply for green cards.",
      "But under the internal USCIS directive, officials will no longer be able to process any applications for these programs or any other benefit if the requests were filed by migrants who arrived in the U.S. under the targeted Biden administration policies.",
      "\"This effectively freezes their ability to move into another legal status,\" said Lynden Melmed, who served as the top lawyer at USCIS during the administration of former President George W. Bush and now works as a partner at Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP. \"In the interim, they would remain susceptible to removal from the country if the government terminates their parole status.\"",
      "The USCIS memo said the move is justified because \"[c]urrently, fraud information and public safety or national security concerns are not being properly flagged in USCIS' adjudicative systems.\" The directive cites the Biden administration's move last year to temporarily pause the parole initiative for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans due to fraud concerns.",
      "In his memo, Davidson referenced investigations that he said found thousands of CHNV applications with \"serial sponsors,\" information of deceased individuals or identical addresses. He said some of those cases were proven to be fraud. Davidson also said some migrants allowed into the U.S. under CHNV \"were not fully vetted.\"",
      "The pause, Davidson said in his memo, could potentially be lifted, but only once officials complete a \"comprehensive review and evaluation of the in-country population of aliens who are or were paroled into the United States under these categorical parole programs.\"",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed CBS News' reporting, saying the \"administrative hold\" on applications would be in effect \"pending the completion of additional vetting to identity any fraud, public safety, or national security concerns.\"",
      "The Trump administration has targeted those who've come to the U.S. under the Biden-era immigration parole programs in other ways, too.",
      "Last month, officials authorized federal immigration agents to seek the deportation \u2014 including in an expedited fashion in some cases \u2014 of those permitted to enter the U.S. under the CHNV program and other Biden administration parole policies. The administration has also drafted plans to revoke the parole status of many of those who've come to the U.S. under CHNV.",

    "summary": "President Trump endorsed the House Republicans' budget proposal to begin enacting his agenda as the Senate pursues a competing plan.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump endorsed House Republicans' budget proposal that would enact trillions of dollars in spending reductions and tax cuts in a single bill, saying on Wednesday that he prefers that approach over the Senate's competing two-bill plan.",
      "\"We need both Chambers to pass the House Budget to 'kickstart' the Reconciliation process, and move all of our priorities to the concept of, 'ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL,'\" Mr. Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \"It will, without question, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The president praised House and Senate Republicans, saying they're doing a \"SPECTACULAR job of working together as one unified, and unbeatable.\" But he said the Senate proposal would address just part of his agenda to begin, while the House's proposal would address it in its entirety. Both approaches would rely on a process known as budget reconciliation that allows legislation to pass the Senate with a simple majority.",
      "Senate Republicans, led by Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, have been pursuing a two-bill plan, which leaves the extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts for a later date in order to quickly increase funding for border security and defense. But House Republicans have argued that passing two pieces of legislation carries a wider margin for error, given the narrow GOP majority in the lower chamber.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement came after Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the Senate would move forward this week with its proposal on the Senate floor, after both the House and Senate advanced their resolutions out of committee last week. The Senate had deferred to the House for weeks to kickstart the process, but began pushing ahead earlier this month.",
      "Thune told reporters after Mr. Trump's announcement that the Senate is still \"planning to proceed\" with its resolution this week, but he noted that they hoped to hear more from Vice President JD Vance during a lunch meeting on Wednesday. Thune said he didn't speak with the president ahead of the endorsement, and that he \"did not see that one coming,\" referring to the president's post.",
      "After the lunch meeting, Thune said the Senate would begin voting on the budget resolution Thursday night, saying Mr. Trump \"likes optionality.\"",
      "\"If the House can produce one big beautiful bill, we're prepared to work with them to get that across the finish line,\" Thune said, adding that the question before them is a \"tactical one\" and that the \"strategic objectives\" of approaches are the same.",
      "Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso told reporters following the meeting that Senate Republicans \"want to move ahead with speed,\" adding that if the House, which is away on recess, had been in town this week, it would be a \"different discussion.\"",
      "\"We have a shared agenda focused on rebuilding the economy, getting the country back to work and securing the border and making sure that America is strong and safe,\" Barrasso said.",
      "The president's endorsement follows months of back and forth over the path forward. Though Mr. Trump initially indicated support for a single-bill approach, he had appeared to step back from weighing in on the process in recent weeks, making clear his support for approving his agenda \u2014 no matter the approach.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:05:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The initial accounting by DOGE of its estimated savings was overstated by billions of dollars, a review by CBS News found.",
    "story": [
      "After repeated delays, the Department of Government Efficiency on Monday released a \"wall of receipts\" \u2014 what it characterized as documentation of the money saved by the slashing cuts to jobs and contracts pushed by Elon Musk's team at DOGE over the past several weeks.",
      "The initial accounting was overstated by billions of dollars, a review by CBS News found.",
      "Among the errors were contracts that DOGE identified for cuts, saying the move could save billions for taxpayers. But they were actually standard government funding vehicles called \"indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity\" contracts. The DOGE team misread these specialized contracts, experts told CBS News, and as a result overstated their push for savings by as much as $1.96 billion.",
      "A closer inspection of another big so-called savings: the cancellation of a contract DOGE identified as worth $8 billion was in fact worth only $8 million. This single mistake slashed the receipts of savings DOGE said it had identified in half \u2014 to $8.4 billion.",
      "That error involved an award for Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement Equal Opportunity Employment Office, and the contract described the project as \"Program and Technical Support Services for Office of Diversity and Civil Rights.\" In his first days in office, President Trump signed executive orders to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government.",
      "The DOGE team led by Musk has become a hallmark of Mr. Trump's early days in office, as members of the efficiency team set up shop in federal agencies to identify cuts of employees, grants and contracts. The president has praised the effort, which he says is a long overdue move to eliminate waste.",
      "\"They're doing a hell of a job, it's an amazing job they're doing,\" he said during remarks in the Oval Office on Feb. 11. \"You know that force is building, I call it 'the force of super geniuses.'\"",
      "DOGE's accounting error involving indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts, known in government-speak as IDIQ, occurred because the team likely misunderstood how government contracting works, experts told CBS News. These contracts are designed to set a ceiling for the funding of a larger project.",
      "Multiple contractors bid on tasks within that IDIQ. The ceiling for the project identified by DOGE was $655 million. But DOGE claimed savings of $654,990,000 three times. In actuality, the government spent less on the contract \u2014 around $400 million over the course of the past four years for 44 different sub-contracts\u00a0\u2014 and the IDIQ is likely to have only minimal additional spending.",
      "That specific contract was called USAID EVAL-ME II IDIQ and it provided \"monitoring, evaluation and learning services to promote evidence-based decision making for adaptive management across USAID.\" One of the contractors involved told CBS News that this program was directly responsible for ensuring that U.S. taxpayer money was spent in accordance with U.S. goals and interests.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the discrepancy, and DOGE also did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE \"may be more interested in inflating savings than in accurately reporting them,\" said Scott Amey, general counsel for the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight.",
      "The New York Times, which first reported DOGE's $8 billion accounting error, pointed out that a 2022 version of this contract was listed at $8 billion, and on Jan. 22 of this year, the figure was changed to $8 million. The contracting company, D&G Solutions, confirmed to CBS News that this was originally the result of an accounting error and that $3.8 million of the contract had already been expended.",
      "On Wednesday morning, DOGE fixed the error, and the website now shows $8 million in savings for that contract, but the link they provide for the \"receipt\" is to the earlier $8 billion figure.",
      "Musk recently admitted he knows DOGE isn't perfect. Defending DOGE during an Oval Office appearance on Feb. 11, he said that \"some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected.\"",
      "\"Nobody's going to bat a thousand. We will make mistakes, but we'll act quickly to correct any mistakes,\" he added.",
      "Beyond the ICE contract blunder, Amey described the numbers as underwhelming. Excluding the impact of USAID's elimination, receipts of contract savings from other agencies appear to total $2 billion \u2014 a fraction of the federal budget, which stands at $6.75 trillion.",
      "\"If DOGE's goal is to trim a trillion or two, it has a long way to go, and Congress has to do its job to cut spending, too,\" Amey said. Musk has said he'd like to trim $2 trillion, putting DOGE at 0.1% of his goal.",
      "Many of these contract cancellations, outside of the USAID cuts, appear to have been selected based on language in the agreements referencing diversity, equity, or inclusion, CBS News' review found.",
      "And at what cost? Among the receipts on the DOGE wall was funding for a\u00a0 Department of Education project that's now been scrapped. The contractor described the real-world consequences in an interview: \"Thirteen school districts across 11 states were set to receive more than $13 million to support over 1,070 youth with disabilities participating in the program.\"",
      "At USAID, savings touted by DOGE\u00a0 on X on Saturday included $10 million for \"Mozambique voluntary medical male circumcision\" and $9.7M for UC Berkeley to develop \"a cohort of Cambodian youth with enterprise driven skills\" amongst other cuts. Circumcision has been proved to reduce the spread of HIV by as much as 60%. Programs like that have the potential to significantly lower costs for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, which provides antiretroviral treatment for people living with HIV and AIDS and had been given a limited waiver to continue to operate at the end of January. It has been credited with helping to save 26 million lives. One 2017 estimate suggested that widespread circumcision efforts could avert 3.6 million new HIV infections and save $16.5 billion.",
      "DOGE has for weeks been promising an accounting of the unprecedented sweep through federal agencies that appears to have left hundreds of workers suddenly jobless.",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE's abrupt firings have set government agencies on edge. The government is now trying to rehire hundreds of workers in the U.S. nuclear weapons program after last week's layoffs. Farmers across the U.S. remain in limbo after promised federal funds for healthy soil initiatives \u2014 amounting to thousands of dollars per farm \u2014 failed to materialize. Life-saving efforts across Africa have also been put on hold while service providers wait for clarity on whether court-ordered funds will resume.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump, speaking Tuesday afternoon from his home in Florida, appeared to shift three years \u2014 if not many decades \u2014 of U.S. foreign policy almost 180 degrees, issuing remarks that made his administration sound aligned more with Russian President Vladimir Putin than America's European allies of the last eight decades.",
      "In rhetoric similar to claims Putin has used himself to justify his three-year\u00a0war on Ukraine, Mr. Trump seemed to blame President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for Russia's full-scale invasion after the Ukrainian leader took issue with being left out of initial conversations between the White House and Moscow, which began Tuesday in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"I think I have the power to end this war, and I think it's going very well. Today I heard, 'Oh, well, we weren't invited.' Well, you've been there for three years. You should have ended it three years \u2014 you should have never started it,\" Mr. Trump chided Zelenskyy. \"You could have made a deal. I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land. Everything, almost all of the land. And no people would have been killed and no city would have been demolished, and not one dome would have been knocked down. But they chose not to do it that way.\"",
      "\"This is, frankly, what Vladimir Putin would have said \u2014 that none of this needed to happen, when in fact, it happened because he wanted it to happen,\" Ravi Agrawal, the editor in chief of Foreign Policy magazine, told CBS News' Major Garrett after hearing Mr. Trump's remarks.",
      "Zelenskyy reacted Wednesday, saying Mr. Trump appeared to be operating in a \"disinformation space\" fostered by Russia.",
      "Putin, who first sent forces into Ukraine in 2014 and seized control of its Crimean Peninsula in a unilateral annexation never recognized by the U.S. or most of the world, has claimed he was forced to launch his full-scale attack on the neighboring nation due to a threat posed by the U.S.-led NATO alliance spreading its influence eastward toward Russia's border.",
      "The U.S. and its European NATO allies have always dismissed that excuse, insisting that Putin's real intention ahead of the February 2022 full-scale invasion was always to seize more of Ukraine's sovereign territory and delegitimize Zelenskyy's pro-Western government.",
      "\"NATO consists of 32 countries and NATO's position is that it [war in Ukraine] was unprovoked,\" U.S. Navy Adm. Stuart B. Munsch, commander of JFC Naples, one of NATO's three Joint Force Commands, said Wednesday in Romania when asked about Mr. Trump's remarks. Munsch \u2014 one of the U.S. Navy's longest-serving active duty officers \u2014 is in Romania this week for a NATO military exercise aimed at preparing the alliance for any further Russian aggression on Europe's far eastern flank.",
      "Mr. Trump has made fiery rhetoric, and sometimes a loose adherence to fact, a hallmark of his negotiating tactics with foreign powers \u2014 including a baseless claim from his Mar-a-Lago mansion on Tuesday that Zelenskyy's approval rating had dipped to 4%, when domestic polling in Ukraine shows it over 50%. That lines up with Kremlin propaganda, along with a call for Ukraine to hold new elections and a suggestion it should have done so already, despite the country's constitution making a vote impossible under the current state of emergency sparked by Russia's invasion.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarkable espousal of Russian rhetoric has fueled rising concern in Europe that the U.S. could be shifting the enormous weight of its geopolitical and security influence away from the deep-rooted democracies of the West, toward the autocratic rulers of the ideologically conservative east, and especially Putin.",
      "The Russian leader's longtime confidant, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, acknowledged the shift Wednesday, lauding Mr. Trump and saying his \"remarks on NATO being the main reason for the conflict in Ukraine are a signal that he understands our position.\"",
      "\"I assume the United States, as discussed yesterday, intends to remove obstacles that are in the path of promising projects. We have begun to move away from the edge of the abyss where Biden's administration led our relationship,\" the veteran Russian diplomat said.",
      "Zelenskyy has softened his stance in recent months, seemingly accepting that he may have to cede some of his country's Russian-occupied territory in an eventual peace deal, but he's made it clear that Ukraine must be involved in the negotiations for a ceasefire agreement, and that his country will need security guarantees from the U.S. and the West to protect it from any future Russian attack.",
      "\"We are seeing a lot of disinformation and that is coming from Russia,\" Zelenskyy said Wednesday. \"Unfortunately, President Trump, with all due respect\u2026 is living in this disinformation space.\"",
      "The Ukrainian leader said he wanted to end the war \"this year,\" but he admonished the Trump administration for helping Russia's autocratic regime to \"break out\" of the isolation it brought upon itself \u2014 in the form of sanctions and cut-off diplomacy \u2014 by launching the unprovoked attack on his country.",
      "In a post on his own Truth Social media platform, Mr. Trump doubled down on his criticism of Zelenskyy later Wednesday, accusing him doing \"a terrible job\" and \u00a0of \"playing\" the Biden administration to convince the U.S. to spend hundreds of billions of dollars \"to go into a War that couldn't be won.\"",
      "Repeating the Kremlin's misleading refrain that Zelenskyy \"refuses to have Elections,\" Mr. Trump went as far as calling Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" warning the Ukrainian leader that he, \"better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.\"",
      "\"In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only 'TRUMP,' and the Trump Administration, can do,\" argued Mr. Trump.",
      "It was unclear how hard Mr. Trump's special envoy Keith Kellogg, who arrived in Kyiv Wednesday to \"sit and listen\" to Zelenskyy's administration after the Ukrainians were left out of the initial dialogue with the Kremlin, would push the American president's viewpoint that Ukraine could or should have prevented or stopped the war foisted upon it by its far larger, far better armed, autocratically-ruled neighbor.",
      "Upon arriving, Kellogg, a retired three-star general, said it was nice to be visiting Kyiv \"just a few days before the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\" seemingly acknowledging which side had initiated the war.",
      "Zelenskyy says Putin will push war \"very quickly\" onto NATO soil if not stopped",
      "Zelenskyy says Putin will push war \"very quickly\" onto NATO soil if not stopped",
      "Kellogg called his visit \"a chance to have some good, substantial talks,\" but what Ukraine will want is a clear indication that the world's biggest military power will somehow protect it from future Russian aggression. Zelenskyy has long said that could come in the form of either NATO membership for his country or NATO forces deployed to enforce a ceasefire.",
      "After U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio led the White House delegation's bilateral talks with Lavrov in Saudia Arabia on Tuesday, the Russian foreign minister said point-blank that the Kremlin wouldn't accept either of those things. Russia has already ruled out any exchange of occupied territory with Ukraine, and it's unclear what concessions the Trump administration could try to win from Russia for a peace deal.",
      "\"We understand the need for security guarantees,\" Kellogg told Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne Novyny after arriving in Kyiv on Wednesday. \"It's very clear to us the importance of the sovereignty of this nation and the independence of this nation as well... Part of my mission is to sit and listen.\"",
      "He said he would share what he learned on his trip to Kyiv with Mr. Trump and Rubio to \"ensure that we get this one right.\"",

Lori Chavez-DeRemer, President Trump's nominee to run the Labor Department, appeared before a Senate committee for her confirmation hearing on Wednesday, where she has faced questions about her support for a pro-union bill when she was in Congress and other labor issues.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who sits on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, has said he will oppose her because of her previous support for pro-labor policies. Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, in the last Congress. The bill would have strengthened labor protections for workers to collectively bargain and expanded penalties for employers that violate workers' rights.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer addressed her support for the bill in her opening statement, saying she recognized the legislation was \"imperfect\" and would implement President Trump's labor policies if confirmed as secretary.",
      "\"If confirmed, my job will be to implement President Trump's policy vision. And my guiding principle will be President Trump's guiding principal \u2014 ensuring a level playing field for businesses, unions and, most importantly, the American worker,\" she said.",
      "In January, Paul predicted that Chavez-DeRemer could lose more than a dozen Republican votes. But so far, he's been the only GOP senator to publicly pull his support.",
      "\"I'm the national spokesman and lead author of the right-to-work bill. Her support for the PRO Act, which would not only oppose national right-to-work but would preempt state law on right-to-work \u2014 I think it's not a good thing,\" Paul told NBC News last month. \"And it'd be sort of hard for me, since it's a big issue for me, to support her.\"",
      "Paul questioned Chavez-DeRemer about right-to-work policies during the hearing, asking whether she is still supportive of the PRO Act, which he said would have overturned right-to-work laws in half the country. When Chavez-DeRemer said she \"fully\" supports states that \"want to protect their right to work,\" Paul doubled down, asking if she no longer supports the aspects of the PRO Act that would have overturned state right-to-work laws. She said she did not.",
      "Without Paul, Chavez-DeRemer will need at least one Democrat on the Senate HELP Committee to vote to advance her nomination. Republicans have a 12-11 vote majority on the panel.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer could pick up support from Democrats for her pro-union stances, but many are fuming over the president's ongoing overhaul of the executive branch and firings of federal workers. Democrats expressed appreciation for Chavez-DeRemer's record during the hearing, but none emerged as clear backers of her nomination.",
      "So far, Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees have been confirmed with minimal GOP defections. Three Republicans voted against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was confirmed after Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. Republicans have otherwise united behind Mr. Trump's picks, with the exception of Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who voted against three nominees as of last week.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Chavez-DeRemer, an Oregon Republican, as labor secretary after she lost her reelection bid in November. She served one two-year term in Congress, becoming the first Republican woman elected to Congress in Oregon.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 07:41:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Affected organizations said the move would prevent them from offering critical legal services to migrant children who crossed the U.S. southern border without their parents or legal guardians.",
    "story": [
      "Legal services groups that offer representation and guidance to thousands of migrant children facing deportation said on Tuesday that they were abruptly directed by the Trump administration to halt their government-funded work.",
      "Affected organizations across the U.S. said the move would prevent them from offering critical legal services, including \"know your rights\" sessions, to migrant children who crossed the U.S. southern border without their parents or legal guardians.",
      "Under U.S. law, the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for housing unaccompanied migrant minors who enter the U.S. without legal authorization, until they turn 18 or can be placed with a sponsor, who is typically a relative in the U.S. The government has long funded efforts by nonprofits to provide these children legal counsel \u2014 both in custody and after they are released from government care \u2014 while immigration judges decide whether they can remain in the U.S.",
      "The Acacia Center for Justice, an organization that oversees the main federal contract funding legal services for migrant children, received an order on Friday that directed the group to immediately\u00a0 \"stop all work\" under that contract, according to a copy of the notice obtained by CBS News.",
      "Shaina Aber, the executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice, said her organization has nearly 100 subcontractors providing legal services to roughly 26,000 migrant children across the country who are or were at some point in the custody of HHS, which oversees a network of child shelters.",
      "Aber said the stop work order would immediately halt funding for know your rights presentations and legal screenings that lawyers conduct soon after migrant children arrive in the U.S. to determine whether they qualify for a benefit that would allow them to stay in the country legally. Those benefits could include asylum, for those fleeing persecution, and visas for abused, neglected or abandoned youth.",
      "But Aber said the contract pause would also force non-profits to use their own funds to continue representing migrant children in immigration court, noting that attorneys have ethical obligations to their clients and can't simply abandon their cases. She said it's unclear how long organizations could do this without federal support, since migrant youth typically don't have the financial means to pay for lawyers.",
      "\"I think the due process rights of children will reach a new low,\" Aber said in an interview.",
      "The stop work order to Aber's group was issued by the Department of Interior, who she said administers the federal contract for her organization, even though the funding comes from HHS. Both departments did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Various immigration non-profit groups that received funds under the federal contract that was suspended protested the government's decision, including the California-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center, the Texas-based Estrella del Paso and the Illinois-based National Immigrant Justice Center.",
      "\"The Trump administration is abandoning children for the sake of politics and leaving kids to fend for themselves against our complex immigration system,\" said Lindsay Toczylowski, the president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center.",
      "It's unclear what exactly prompted the stop work order, but the Trump administration has been moving aggressively to dramatically cut federal spending that it sees as wasteful and misaligned with its policy views, including on immigration. The administration, for example, has also issued stop work orders to the non-profit groups that resettle newcomers under the U.S. refugee program, which President Trump has suspended.",
      "The Trump administration has made other policy changes affecting unaccompanied migrant children.",
      "Last week, officials at the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the HHS branch that cares for unaccompanied children, significantly tightened the vetting process for those seeking to sponsor minors out of its custody. Under the policy change, all adults in households applying to sponsor migrant children will need to submit fingerprints for background checks, not just the prospective sponsors themselves.",
      "The Trump administration has also been working on expanding collaboration between the refugee agency and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a prospect that has alarmed advocates who say it will discourage some family members from sponsoring migrant children, if they are in the U.S. illegally. The administration installed a former ICE official to run the refugee office.",
      "Trump administration officials have said drastic changes are necessary to protect migrant children from exploitation and trafficking. They have accused the Biden administration, which faced a historic influx in unaccompanied children crossing the southern border, of not sufficiently tracking and protecting these minors.",
      "Neha Desai, an attorney at National Center for Youth Law, a group that represents migrant children in a federal court case, said the move to halt funding for lawyers undermined the Trump administration's stated goals, calling it \"reckless.\"",
      "\"Unaccompanied children who are unrepresented are far more likely to end up in exploitative situations, including child labor and trafficking,\" Desai said.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 05:00:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities, touches millions of Americans and has become deeply woven into the U.S. health care system.",
    "story": [
      "In January, during\u00a0a congressional hearing on his way to becoming secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. got basic details wrong about Medicaid \u2014 a program he now oversees.",
      "He said that Medicaid is fully funded by the federal government (it's not) and that many enrollees are unsatisfied with high out-of-pocket costs (enrollees pay limited, if any, out-of-pocket costs).",
      "Medicaid\u00a0is complex. The\u00a0$880 billion-a-year\u00a0state-federal program offers health coverage to millions of disabled and low-income Americans. The program covers different services for different people in different parts of the country \u2014 and enrollees may interact with private insurance companies without \"Medicaid\" in their names, leaving some unaware that they're on the program at all.",
      "Although President Donald Trump\u00a0promised to \"love and cherish\" Medicaid, Republicans in Congress last week announced federal budget proposals that could dramatically curtail the program. As that debate begins, here is what you need to know about Medicaid.",
      "What is Medicaid, and how is it different from Medicare?",
      "Medicaid and Medicare were created by the same legislation \u2014 an addition to the Social Security Act \u2014 that was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965.",
      "Medicaid is a government health insurance program for people with low incomes and adults and children with disabilities.",
      "Medicare, by contrast, generally covers those\u00a065 or older.",
      "For older Americans with low incomes, Medicaid covers out-of-pocket costs for Medicare. Such people are commonly called \"dual eligibles,\" because they qualify for both programs.",
      "Who is on Medicaid?",
      "More than 79 million people receive services from Medicaid or the closely related Children's Health Insurance Program. That represents about 20% of the total population of the United States. Most enrollees qualify because of low incomes.",
      "About 40% of all children in the country are covered by Medicaid or CHIP, created in 1997. Both pay for services such as routine checkups, vaccinations, and hospital stays. Medicaid also covers pregnant people before and after they give birth and pays for more than 40% of all births.",
      "Medicaid also covers people with disabilities or complex medical needs and helps them afford services that allow them to live independently in community settings, outside of institutions such as nursing homes and state-run hospitals.",
      "The program serves a diverse cross section of the country. About 40% of people under 65 who use Medicaid are white, 30% are Hispanic, 19% are Black, and 1% are Indigenous people.",
      "Federal Medicaid dollars cannot be used to cover immigrants who are in the U.S. without legal permission, though some states, as well as Washington, D.C.,\u00a0have used their own funds\u00a0to extend Medicaid coverage to such individuals. California was the first state to do so.",
      "What are the income qualifications?",
      "Eligibility generally depends on whether a person is low income, and states have different ways of defining that. For a four-adult household without dependent children, the current national median coverage level is $44,367.",
      "The Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, which passed in 2010, allowed more people to qualify for Medicaid on the basis of income. This is what is known as \"Medicaid expansion.\"",
      "The law offered states a sizable incentive to add more people to their programs: The federal government would pitch in more money per enrollee to help cover them.",
      "The intention behind the expansion was to close gaps in health insurance programs for the millions of Americans who don't get coverage through an employer. Medicaid would cover people with extremely low incomes, and as their incomes rose, they could move to subsidized health plans sold through the Affordable Care Act's exchanges.",
      "In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court said the decision of whether to expand the program would be\u00a0left up to individual states. Today, 40 states and the District of Columbia \u2014 led by Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 have opted in.",
      "In the\u00a010 states that haven't expanded\u00a0Medicaid to more low-income adults, the median earnings qualification level is $5,947 a year for a single-person household in 2025. Those who make more are not eligible.",
      "Adults in those states who make too much for Medicaid can also make too little to qualify for help buying plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, leaving some unable to afford coverage. An estimated 1.5 million fall into this coverage gap.",
      "Where does the money to pay for it come from?",
      "The federal government pays most of the cost of Medicaid by matching a portion of what states spend.",
      "Currently, the federal government matches at least 50% of state spending and offers states more money for some services and enrollees \u2014 for instance, for children and pregnant women.",
      "Less wealthy states \u2014 determined by considering residents' per capita incomes \u2014 receive a higher match, translating to a higher percentage of federal dollars. In Mississippi, for instance, the federal government picks up\u00a077% of the cost\u00a0of Medicaid.",
      "States also receive a 90% match from the federal government for enrollees eligible for Medicaid under the ACA's expansion.",
      "There is no limit on how much states can spend on the program, and hundreds of billions of federal dollars flow into states each year. In 2023, states\u00a0spent about 15%\u00a0of their own budgets on Medicaid.",
      "What does that money pay for?",
      "Federal law requires all state Medicaid programs to cover certain services, including emergency medical transportation, X-rays and lab work, family planning, and medication-assisted treatment for people with opioid use disorder. The program also covers many nursing and home health services, though federal law allows those benefits\u00a0to be clawed back\u00a0after an enrollee's death.",
      "Beyond that, states have the flexibility to choose the services their Medicaid programs cover. All states cover prescription drugs, and most cover eyeglasses, some dental care, and physical therapy.",
      "Medicaid covers more mental health and long-term care services than any other type of insurance, public or private.",
      "What is Medicaid called in my state?",
      "Medicaid programs can go by\u00a0many different names, even within the same state, in part because most states use private insurance companies to run them. This can be confusing for consumers who may not realize they are actually enrolled in Medicaid.",
      "In\u00a0New York, for instance, Medicaid plans are offered by major companies, such as Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield and UnitedHealthcare \u2014 and some you may not have heard of, such as Amida Care and MetroPlusHealth. In Wisconsin, enrollees may be in BadgerCare Plus; in Connecticut, Husky Health; in Texas, STAR; and in California, Medi-Cal.",
      "How does Medicaid affect hospitals and doctors in my state?",
      "Medicaid generally pays health care providers such as doctors and hospitals less money for services than Medicare or private insurance does. But it can be more money than they'd get caring for people who are uninsured \u2014 and without Medicaid, many more Americans would be uninsured.",
      "Like states, providers and hospitals have come to rely on this money and express concerns that even phasing it out over time would require major adjustments.",
      "What's going to happen to Medicaid?",
      "It's not clear. Republicans in Washington are again pushing for major changes, which could take the form of cuts to federal funding. That could reduce the number of people who qualify, the services available, or both. A similar push focused on repealing and replacing Obamacare in 2017, during Trump's first term, was unsuccessful.",
      "Perhaps one of the biggest obstacles to changing Medicaid is\u00a0its popularity: 77% of Americans \u2014 and majorities of Democrats, independents, and Republicans \u2014 view the program favorably.",
      "At the heart of it all are key questions about the role of government in people's health: How big should the U.S. medical insurance safety net be? Who deserves government assistance? And how will enrollees, states, providers, and the health care system at large absorb major changes to Medicaid, even if a rollout were staggered?",
      "KFF Health News\u00a0is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at\u00a0KFF\u00a0\u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate confirmed wealthy financier Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary Tuesday, putting in place a staunch supporter of President Trump's hardline trade policies.",
      "At the Commerce Department, Lutnick, who was CEO at the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald, will oversee 50,000 employees who do everything from collecting economic statistics to running the census to issuing weather reports. But he's likely to spend a lot of time \u2014 along with Jamieson Greer, Mr. Trump's nominee to be the top U.S. trade negotiator \u2014 managing the president's aggressive plans to impose import taxes on U.S. trading partners, including allies and adversaries alike.",
      "The Senate vote to confirm Lutnick was 51-45.",
      "Mr. Trump views the tariffs as a versatile economic tool. They can raise money to finance his tax cuts elsewhere, protect U.S. industries and pressure other countries into making concessions on such issues as their own trade barriers, immigration and drug trafficking. Mainstream economists mostly view tariffs as counterproductive: They are paid by import companies in the United States, which try to pass along the higher costs to consumers and can thereby add to inflationary pressures throughout the economy.",
      "At his confirmation hearing last month, Lutnick dismissed as \"nonsense'' the idea that tariffs contribute to inflation. He expressed support for deploying across-the-board tariffs \"country by country'' to strong-arm other countries into lowering barriers to American exports.",
      "Mr. Trump last week announced plans for \"reciprocal'' tariffs \u2014 raising U.S. import tax rates to match the higher taxes that other countries impose on goods from the U.S. The move would shatter the rules that have governed world trade for decades. Since the 1960s, tariff rates have mostly emerged from negotiations between dozens of countries. Mr. Trump is commandeering the process.",
      "The president has also imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese imports and effectively raised U.S. taxes on foreign steel and aluminum. He has threatened \u2014 and delayed until March 4 \u2014 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "Lutnick was CEO at Cantor Fitzgerald when its offices were hit in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center. The firm lost two-thirds of its employees \u2014 658 people \u2014 that day, including Lutnick's brother. Howard Lutnick led the firm's recovery and is a member of the Board of Directors of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.",
      "Lutnick has promised to sell off his business holdings. They're complicated. His financial disclosure statement showed that he had positions in more than 800 businesses and other private organizations.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 20:54:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The asteroid 2024 YR4 has a very small chance of striking Earth when its orbit briefly intersects our planet's in December 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Wednesday lowered the chances to about 1.5%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's latest probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

    "summary": "Archaeologists in Egypt have found the tomb of King Thutmose II \u2014 the first discovery of an ancient royal tomb since King Tutankhamun's in 1922.",
    "story": [
      "Egyptian officials announced Tuesday the discovery of the tomb of King Thutmose II, the last of the lost tombs of the kings of ancient Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty, which reigned for over two centuries between about 1550 BC and 1292 BC. It's the first royal Egyptian tomb to be discovered since King Tutankhamun's final resting place was found in 1922.",
      "A joint Egyptian-British archaeological mission discovered Thutmose II's tomb in the mount of Thebes area, west of Luxor and the renowned Valley of the Kings. The team and the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, which made the announcement, said evidence was discovered that clearly indicates it was King Thutmose II's tomb during excavations of what had previously been known only as tomb No. C4.",
      "The entrance and main passage into the structure were discovered in 2022, and internal excavations have continued meticulously since then.",
      "Dr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said when the mission first found the entrance to the tomb and its main passage almost three years ago, the team believed it could belong to one of the wives of the kings, given its proximity to the tomb of the wives of King Thutmose III and its proximity to the tomb of Queen Hatshepsut, which was prepared for her as a royal wife before she became ruler of the ancient kingdom. She ended up being buried in the Valley of the Kings, due to her ascent to the throne.",
      "As the excavation work and examination of artifacts continued, the mission found new evidence that identified the owner of the mysterious tomb as King Thutmose II, suggesting also that his burial rites were carried out by Queen Hatshepsut, who was his wife and half-sister.",
      "Khaled said parts of alabaster vessels found in the ruins have inscriptions bearing the name of King Thutmose II and identifying him as the \"deceased king,\" along with the name of his wife, Hatshepsut, all of which he said had helped to confirm Thutmose II as the owner of the tomb.",
      "He described the discovery as one of the most important archaeological finds in recent years. The artifacts discovered are important additions to the body of knowledge around the history of the area and the reign of King Thutmose II.",
      "The mummy of King Thutmose II was discovered during the 19th century, not far away at another archaeological site known as the Deir el-Bahari Cachette, to which it was likely moved centuries after being looted by tomb raiders, according to the\u00a0relatively new National Museum\u00a0of Egyptian Civilization. His mummy is now on display, among those of other ancient royals, at the museum.",
      "The tomb is in a poor state of preservation due largely to exposure to floods shortly after Thutmose II's death, according to Mohamed Abdel Badie, Head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Head of the Egyptian team that has worked on the dig. Abdel Badie said initial studies also indicate much of the original contents of the tomb were moved to another location after the ancient floods.",
      "He said the teams had discovered mortar in the tomb with remnants of blue inscriptions and yellow stars, and some paragraphs from the book of \"Imydwat,\" which is one of the most important funerary books found in ancient Egyptian tombs, written to help guide the late royals through their underworld journey.",

      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Scientists aren't panicking yet, but they are watching closely.",
      "\"At this point, it's 'Let's pay a lot of attention, let's get as many assets as we can observing it,'\" Bruce Betts, chief scientist of The Planetary Society, told the AFP news agency.",
      "What we know about 2024 YR4 and its chances of hitting Earth",
      "Dubbed 2024 YR4, the asteroid was first spotted on December 27, 2024, by the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Based on its brightness, astronomers estimate it is between 130 and 300 feet wide.",

      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on Jan. 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a\u00a01.5% chance\u00a0of the asteroid striking Earth on Dec. 22, 2032. NASA said it expects the probability \"to continue to evolve\" as scientists gather new observations of the asteroid in the days and weeks ahead.",

      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth, and its next close pass will not come until 2028. Scientists will be able to get another look at the asteroid then, Harwood said, and determine its orbit and trajectory.",
      "Betts said, \"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero.\"",

      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",

Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",

    "title": "Vaccine targeting pancreatic cancer shows promise in new study",
    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 11:00:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A clinical trial from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center looked at the effects of a targeted mRNA vaccine on early-stage pancreatic cancer patients.",
    "story": [
      "When a routine scan led to Barbara Brigham's pancreatic cancer\u00a0diagnosis in 2020, all she could think about was how she wanted more time. Her husband had just passed away. She loved her local library job. Her three children were still growing their own families.",
      "She turned to her care team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to learn about her options. Brigham had first come to the cancer center when she was diagnosed with a small, non-cancerous cyst on her pancreas. Every year, she had a scan to make sure there were no new cysts. It was that annual scan that found the early-stage pancreatic cancer.",
      "Brigham and her youngest son went to Sloan-Kettering the next day to meet with Dr. Vinod Balachandran, a surgical oncologist who specializes in pancreatic cancer. While laying out her options to fight the cancer, he mentioned that he was running a clinical trial that he believed she would be the \"perfect candidate\" for.",
      "The trial would combine standard surgery and chemotherapy treatments \u2014 which are the standard of care for pancreatic cancer \u2014 with a customized mRNA vaccine. Each vaccine would be designed based on the patient's individual tumor. The idea was that the vaccines could hopefully help the body's immune system attack the cancer, Balachandran told CBS News.",
      "\"I looked at my son, and my son said, 'Absolutely.' So we decided to do that,\" Brigham said. \"The prognosis was not good when I was diagnosed. You know you're going to have a limited amount of time. I just wanted to extend that time.\"",
      "Helping an immune system recognize cancer",
      "The inspiration for the clinical trial came from the small handful of long-term pancreatic survivors, Balachandran said. Only about 10% of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer survive for more than five years.",
      "About a decade ago, Balachandran and other researchers turned their attention to these \"long-term\" survivors. Multiple studies found that the long-term survivors' immune systems generated \"spontaneous immune response\" to the cancer, meaning the immune system could recognize that the cancer was a threat and react accordingly. Typically, it's \"challenging\" to teach the immune system to recognize cancer, said Balachandran, because \"the immune system is hardwired not to recognize our own body.\"",
      "\"This led to this question of, 'If this is what is happening in the best case scenario, could we then replicate the success in other pancreatic cancer patients?' Namely, could we teach other patients' immune systems to recognize their cancers in a very similar way as to what is happening naturally in the long-term survivors?\" Balachandran said.",
      "The phase 1 clinical trial looked at 16 patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer like Brigham's. To be eligible for the trial, a patient's cancer had to only be in the pancreas and be removable with surgery. Those conditions occur in just between 20% and 25% of pancreatic cancer patients, Balachandran said, and mirrored the conditions of most long-term survivors. During surgery, a patient's tumor was removed, then sent to Sloan-Kettering's research partners at the German biotechnology company BioNTech. From the tumor, BioNTech would make the vaccine, which would be given to the patient alongside several weeks of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.",
      "The vaccine targeted mutations created by pancreatic cancer. As cancer cells rapidly divide in the body, they accumulate genetic errors, Balachandran said. Those errors could serve as \"red flags to the immune system,\" he said, so it became a matter of alerting the immune system to those cells and teaching it to recognize them.",
      "Sparking \"strong immune responses\"",
      "Of the 16 patients included in the trial, eight had \"strong immune responses,\" Balachandran said. The difference seemed to hinge on what kind of surgery they had to remove their pancreatic cancer: People who had their spleen removed as part of their treatment did not generate a strong immune response, Balachandran said, likely because of the important role the organ plays in immune function.",
      "Earlier data published by Balachandran showed that of the eight people who had strong immune responses, none of them had their cancer recur 18 months after treatment. On average, people whose early-stage pancreatic cancer is treated with chemotherapy and surgery see their cancer recur in a year or less.",
      "Now, new research published in Nature looked at the same patients 3.2 years after their treatment. The follow-ups found that only two of the eight patients who had a strong immune response saw their cancer return.",
      "Meanwhile, seven of the eight non-responding patients had their cancers return within that 3.2-year window, Balachandran said.",
      "While the data seems promising, Balachandran cautioned that it's \"still hard to attribute causality\" to the vaccine, especially because of the trial's small size.",
      "Dr. Suneel Kamath, a gastrointestinal oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic who was not involved with the trial, pointed out that the survival rate of the patients in the trial is similar to the survival rate of people who have early-stage pancreatic cancer treated with surgery and chemotherapy.",
      "\"This was a nice kind of proof-of-concept study to show that we can make a vaccine for this disease, and it really does actually create an immune response, and an immune response that lasts,\" Kamath said. \"That's a very nice backbone to build off of.\"",
      "Another, larger clinical trial is now underway, Balachandran said. This randomized trial will only focus on early-stage pancreatic cancer patients with intact spleens, to confirm what role that organ plays in the process, he said. It will also help confirm if there is a link between the vaccines and better outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients.",
      "mRNA vaccines as cancer treatment",
      "Many other researchers are focusing on how mRNA vaccines could be used to treat cancer. Such research was underway well before the coronavirus pandemic thrust mRNA vaccination into the spotlight, said Kamath, who is working with the company Moderna on a different mRNA vaccine trial looking at pancreatic and gastric cancer.",
      "Part of what makes mRNA vaccines suitable for cancer treatment is how easily they can be customized, Kamath said. Balachandran said that it took about nine weeks for a vaccine to be made for each patient in the clinical trial. That included international shipping on both sides, he said.",
      "\"The beauty of mRNA vaccines, as we saw with COVID development, is they're very fast to make. It easy to generate. Once you found a new target, it's very quick to make a vaccine for that particular target,\" Kamath explained. \"It's really exciting, because when we talk about curing cancer, it's not really a single monolithic disease. There are probably hundreds of different targets for every cancer type. And so the ability to make vaccines against a lot of those different targets very quickly is really powerful.\"",
      "Part of that research is learning which cancers are better candidates for mRNA vaccines to be used as part of the treatment, Kamath said. Things like melanoma, which causes a lot of mutations in the body, are easier to direct the immune system against. Kidney and lung cancers are other promising options, he said.",
      "Something like pancreatic cancer, which has fewer mutations, is more difficult, but has been the\u00a0subject of previous research. Balachandran said part of his goal in looking at pancreatic cancer was to see if mRNA vaccines could make a difference \"among the most challenging cancers in oncology.\"",
      "\"Hopefully this can provide some important lessons and clues and how we can do this in other cancer types,\" Balachandran said.",
      "\"Such a wondrous thing\"",
      "For Brigham, participating in the clinical trial gave her what she wanted: More time with her family and loved ones \u2014 more than four years after she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. On average, for people whose pancreatic cancer is caught \"before the tumor grows much or spreads,\" survival time is about three to three and a half years, according to Johns Hopkins.",
      "In the past few months, Brigham celebrated several milestones. Her youngest son welcomed his first child \u2014 her eighth grandchild \u2014 in late 2024, and she recently joined her extended family for her brother's 60th wedding anniversary.",
      "Brigham has not had any recurrences since she took part in the trial. The removal of part of her pancreas did make her diabetic, because the organ produces insulin, but she says it's manageable.",
      "\"The trial was such a wondrous thing,\" Brigham said. \"It has just given me such a renewal in my life. Sometimes it's a little difficult, but it's worth it, absolutely worth it.\"",

    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 3.1%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

    "published": "Mon, 17 Feb 2025 10:42:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
    "story": [
      "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
      "In the study, published in early February in the journal\u00a0Nature Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers found microplastics in human brains have increased 50% over the past 8 years. They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",
      "The team also found high concentrations of plastic in meat bought at grocery stores.",
      "As for the higher levels found in the brains of dementia patients, the researchers noted the study was not designed to prove whether that was the cause of symptoms \u2014 it may be the reverse, that the disease process allows more accumulation to happen.",
      "\"Atrophy of brain tissue, impaired blood\u2013brain barrier integrity and poor clearance mechanisms are hallmarks of dementia and would be anticipated to increase [micro- and nanoplastic] concentrations,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the research on the health impact of microplastics is still in its infancy, but there are important questions being asked.",
      "\"There are concerns that this could be causing any number of conditions. Could it be increasing the risk of stroke or heart attack? Could it be increasing the risk of cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, infertility?\" she said\u00a0on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "For those looking to reduce exposure to microplastics, Gounder suggests switching from plastic bottles to stainless steel or glass and making some other changes in the kitchen.",
      "\"Do not reheat your food in contact with plastic \u2014 that is really important. So move it to a glass dish or your plate, not in plastic,\" she said \"And then finally switch out your cutting boards. Don't use plastic cutting boards, use either wood or stone.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 20:54:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The asteroid 2024 YR4 has a very small chance of striking Earth when its orbit briefly intersects our planet's in December 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid gaining notoriety for its potential to collide with Earth in 2032\u00a0was estimated Tuesday to have roughly a 3% chance of striking our planet \u2014 the highest probability ever assigned \u2014 before additional analysis Wednesday lowered the chances to about 1.5%, according to NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.",
      "Risks of the massive space rock \u2014 which falls into the \"city killer\" category \u2014 actually making impact have fluctuated\u00a0since it was first discovered last December. Called 2024 YR4, the near-Earth asteroid initially carried a 1% chance of hitting land when NASA and the European Space Agency first announced its existence last month.",
      "Protocols require the agencies to formally notify the public when the odds of an asteroid strike reach that 1% threshold, which in itself is an extremely rare occurrence.",
      "The highest estimate, by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested\u00a0a 3.1% chance the asteroid will hit Earth on Dec. 22, 2032, during a fleeting window of time in which the rock's orbit around the sun intersects the path of the planet. That would make the odds of a collision still quite small, about 1 in 32.",
      "The European Space Agency's latest probability estimate\u00a0was slightly lower, at 2.8%. Last week, NASA and the ESA agreed the probability of an asteroid strike was closer to 2%.",
      "\"However,\" NASA reported, \"on Wednesday, Feb. 19, new data collected overnight reduced the impact probability to 1.5%.\"",
      "It added, \"NASA expects the impact probability to continue to evolve as new observations of asteroid 2024 YR4 are made over the coming days and weeks.\"",
      "Astronomers and researchers have said the probability could drop to zero as they learn more about the asteroid, which will be closely observed by the James Webb Space Telescope before it disappears from view in April. Much of the risk is based on an area of \"uncertainty\" in outer space, where the asteroid may or may not end up, and rising odds reflect new insights into that area, according to Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office.",
      "\"The size of the Earth \u2014 which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014 is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness,\" Moissl\u00a0told CBS News last week, speaking about how the odds of a collision are determined.",
      "The size of the uncertainty region has shrunk since then, because more is known about it, so Earth, remaining the same size, occupies a greater portion of the region than it did originally. Scientifically, that drives up the probability even though nothing has truly changed, Moissl said. He emphasized that even a 3% chance of hitting Earth corresponds with a 97% chance of missing it, and in all likelihood 2024 YR4 will not pose threats to our world.",
      "\"What will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further,\" he said. \"And the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.\"",
      "Probability of a crash will most likely dip below 1% before April, experts say, as the asteroid's orbit carries it too far from Earth for humans to see it on the ground. After that, 2024 YR4 will not be visible again for four years.",
      "It is possible the probability of a collision continues to rise, moderately, if its route takes it on a \"close flyby\" of Earth. Moissl said \"this is still no cause for alarm,\" although international space organizations are taking the slim risk seriously. The asteroid, at 40 to 90 meters wide, could be capable of destroying a mid-sized city on Earth. If researchers find its actual size to be nearer the top end of that range, it could flatten some of the world's largest metropolitan areas.",

      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on Jan. 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a\u00a01.5% chance\u00a0of the asteroid striking Earth on Dec. 22, 2032.

      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",

      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",

    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers recently set the odds of a crash at 3.1%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's Planetary Defence Office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 3%, it's still around 97% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 3%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 3% is a 97% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 97% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

A few of the images were likely created using image stitching tools that do not involve AI, according to Reality Defender's analysis.",
      "\"Almost all deepfake pornography does not have the consent of the subject being deepfaked,\" Ben Colman, co-founder and CEO of Reality Defender told CBS News on Sunday. \"Such content is growing at a dizzying rate, especially as existing measures to stop such content are seldom implemented.\"",

Meta has also rolled out the use of \"AI info\" labels to clearly mark content that is AI manipulated.",

      "The board has also recommended that Meta fold its ban on \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" into the company's Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations, so moderation of such content would be more rigorously enforced.",
      "Asked Monday by CBS News about the board's recommendations, Meta pointed to the guidelines on its transparency website, which show the company is assessing the feasibility of three of four recommendations from the oversight board and is implementing one of its suggestions, though Meta noted in its statement on its site that it is currently ruling out changing the language of its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to include the phrase \"non consensual.\" Meta also says it is currently unlikely   to move its \"derogatory sexualized photoshop\" policy to within its Adult Sexual Exploitation regulations.",
      "Meta noted in its statement that it was still considering ways to signal a lack of consent in AI-generated images. Meta also said it was considering reforms to its Adult Sexual Exploitation policies, to \"capture the spirit\" of the board's recommendations.",

The 2024 rule made mishandling wheelchairs a violation of the federal Air Carrier Access Act.",
      "American, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest and United declined to comment, referring requests to Airlines for America, which issued a statement calling the new requirements unnecessary and an overreach.",
      "\"Progress has been made in four key areas aimed at improving the travel experience for passengers with mobility aids \u2014 reducing instances of wheelchair mishandling, advancing employee training and education programs, forming passenger accessibility advisory groups and supporting research for onboard accessibility solutions,\" it stated.",

      "Finalized in December, the rule requires that airlines offer annual training for workers who interact with disabled passengers, and that those with disabilities get prompt assistance during their travels. If a wheelchair is checked but is delayed, missing or damaged, the rule requires that passengers be told options including the right to file a claim or receive a loaner device.",
      "\"For wheelchair and scooter users, like myself, our mobility equipment is our freedom and independence, which is why an estimated 1 in 10 disabled people do not fly because of fear of damage to their equipment,\" Maria Town, president and CEO of the American Association of People with Disabilities, said in a statement at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Former Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell says he won't run for reelection in 2026, announcing his impending departure from the Senate on Thursday, his 83rd birthday.",
      "Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor that he made the decision not to run again last year. McConnell said he's never much liked calling attention to Feb. 20, but he figured his birthday is as good a day as any to make the announcement.",
      "\"Seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate,\" McConnell said. \"Every day in between, I've been humbled by the trust they've placed in me to do their business right here. Representing our commonwealth has been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time. My current term in the Senate will be my last.\"",
      "McConnell has been a U.S. senator from Kentucky since 1985, and he announced one year ago that he would relinquish his leadership role in the Senate. He was the Senate Republican leader from 2007-2025 and is the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history. McConnell served as majority leader from 2015-2021.",
      "The Kentucky Republican's retirement from the Senate was widely expected.",
      "McConnell, a polio survivor, has experienced health issues in recent years, including freezing episodes and falls. Those who have spent time around him recently said he's experiencing some reemergence of polio symptoms that are known to afflict older survivors of the disease. He's been in a wheelchair since a recent fall in the U.S. Capitol.",
      "\"I've never lost sight of the fact that without my mother's devoted care, a childhood encounter with polio could have turned out a lot worse,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor. \"And unless my father had taken a job in the Bluegrass State, my interest in politics might have run a course somewhere else. And if it weren't for an 11th-hour outside-the-box idea on the campaign trail, my Senate career would have been over before it began. Or that if not for the people of Kentucky, time and again agreeing that leadership delivers, and elected me to send back here, it would have been someone else from somewhere taking that seat at the table where I've had a chance to work, strategize, fight and win.\"",
      "As Senate majority leader, McConnell wielded immense power, and was singularly responsible for the fast rate at which President Trump's judicial nominees were confirmed during his first term. He was also famous for blocking the confirmation process after Merrick Garland was nominated to the Supreme Court under President Barack Obama, holding the seat open for a Trump nomination instead.",
      "Still, McConnell diverged with Mr. Trump sometimes, drawing the president's ire. He voted against several of Mr. Trump's more divisive Cabinet nominees \u2014 Health & Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u2014 and was the sole Republican holdout against Gabbard and RFK Jr.",
      "McConnell said some of his colleagues have left office with grave disappointment about the confines of the Senate, or the state of the institution. But McConnell offered a more optimistic outlook.",
      "\"Regardless of the political storms that may wash over this chamber, during the time I have remaining, I assure our colleagues that I will depart with great hope for the endurance, the endurance of the Senate as an institution,\" he said. \"There are any number of reasons for pessimism. But the strength of the Senate is not one of them. ... The Senate is still equipped for work of great consequence. And to the disappointment of my critics, I'm still here on the job.

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:59:59 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said his administration is considering dividend checks based on savings found by DOGE. Economists are skeptical.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he's considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. But economists and policy experts across the political spectrum expressed skepticism about the feasibility of such a \"DOGE dividend.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,\" Mr. Trump said at the FII Priority summit, an investment conference in Miami sponsored by Saudi government entities. Mr. Trump didn't provide further details.",
      "The idea of the so-called DOGE dividend surfaced on social media this week when a four-page proposal was posted by an X user, James Fishback. The post caught the eye of Musk, the owner of X, who is spearheading DOGE, and who on Tuesday said he would pitch the idea to Mr. Trump.",
      "According to Fishback's calculation, 20% of the supposed $2 trillion in eventual DOGE savings would be provided to some taxpayers in the form of a direct tax rebate, which he estimated at $5,000 per household. Only households with a tax liability would receive the payment, which means lower-income households that generally don't owe income taxes wouldn't be included.",
      "But economists and policy experts said the plan isn't likely to materialize, citing the implausibility of finding anywhere near $2 trillion in federal cuts, as well as the legislative hurdles in approving such a direct tax payment.",
      "\"It is completely impossible for DOGE to save $2 trillion,\"Jessica Reidl, an economist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Two-thirds of the $7 trillion federal budget goes to Social Security, Medicare, defense, veterans and interest on the debt \u2014 all of which has been taken off the table by President Trump.\"",
      "She added, \"Saving $2 trillion would require eliminating nearly every remaining federal program. DOGE has no legal or constitutional authority to cut this spending; Congress must pass a law and that will not happen.\"",
      "Two-thirds of the nation's $6.7 trillion in annual spending is\u00a0mandatory\u00a0commitments through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense. In a Feb. 18 interview on Fox News' \"The Sean Hannity Show,\" Mr. Trump reiterated his earlier vow that Social Security and Medicare cuts are off the table.",
      "\"Social Security won't be touched, other than fraud or something,\" Mr. Trump said during the interview. \"We're going to find it's going to be strengthened, but won't be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.\"",
      "On Feb. 19, Mr. Trump backed the House Republicans' budget proposal, which, if enacted, would include deep cuts to Medicaid, the nearly $900-billion-a-year government health insurance program that serves about 79 million mostly low-income or disabled Americans.",
      "The White House didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE cuts",
      "As of Wednesday, DOGE claims it has made cuts that add up to\u00a0about $8.4 billion, according to the task force's own\u00a0documentation.",
      "While DOGE has only been operating since Mr. Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, its cuts are far from reaching Musk's stated goal of shaving $500 billion in annual government spending, let alone reaching near $2 trillion, experts noted.",
      "The plan \"is very unrealistic,\" Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, who describes himself as a libertarian, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I'd love to see it, but I think that is unrealistic, especially in the first year, and certainly unrealistic without Congress getting involved.\"",
      "Any new tax refund check would need the approval of Congress, which controls government spending and is in charge of crafting tax laws. But House Republicans are currently\u00a0negotiating a budget proposal\u00a0that would enact trillions of dollars in spending cuts to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as other tax provisions the president promised on the campaign trail.",
      "A DOGE dividend \"will make their numbers even harder to work in the budget reconciliation,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a Washington, D.C.-based left-leaning economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's hard to see how to make the math work.\"",
      "While a plan for some kind of DOGE dividend could materialize, it would doubtless be a much smaller amount than envisioned, given the practical impossibility of finding $2 trillion in federal cuts.",
      "Experts noted that rebate checks are typically issued in times of economic stress, such as during the pandemic, when Congress authorized several rounds of stimulus checks. But the U.S. economy today is viewed as strong, given growing GDP and low unemployment, they added.",
      "At the same time, the federal government's annual outlays are outpacing revenue by about $2 trillion, creating budget deficits and sending the nation's debt to a record $36.2 trillion.",
      "Reidl noted, \"Washington is facing annual budget deficits that will likely surpass $3 trillion within the next few years. Sending taxpayers dividend checks would be completely irresponsible.\"",
      "DOGE facing legal issues",
      "Experts also raised the issue of whether DOGE's cuts could be reversed by the courts, given that the group is facing multiple lawsuits over its access to sensitive data across various agencies as well as over the legality of its creation.",
      "\"I'm happy to see [DOGE] identify things that can be cut, but I do have concerns about the legality of it,\" Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute said. \"Congress appropriates money, and having the presidential quasi-commission go around and cut things seems like it would run afoul of a lot of laws.\"",
      "DOGE's savings so far could \"be reversed by the courts for bypassing Congress,\" Reidl noted.",
      "Given the challenges of trying to find anything close to $2 trillion in savings, as well as the legislative issues in passing a tax rebate check, experts said their advice to taxpayers is not to bank on getting a DOGE dividend.",
      "\"I wouldn't be budgeting a $5,000 expense in the near term,\" Jacquez said.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:58:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Walmart delivered another year of strong sales and profits, but executives expressed caution about an uncertain economic landscape.",
    "story": [
      "Walmart shares tumbled on Thursday after the retailing giant provided a 2025 sales and profit forecast that was lower than analysts had expected, with executives warning about new challenges in an uncertain economic landscape.",
      "Walmart slipped $6.93, or 6.7%, to $97.07 in early afternoon trading on Thursday. The outlook from the nation's largest retailer for 2025 is as much as 27 cents below analyst projections for per-share earnings and for the quarter, Walmart's expectations are as much as 7 cents below Wall Street projections.",
      "Its sales outlook is also disappointing, potentially a reflection of rising challenges ahead as consumers pull back on spending and President Donald Trump's tariffs on China and other countries threaten the low-price model that is the core of Walmart's success.",
      "\"[W]e have to acknowledge that we are in an uncertain time, and we don't want to get out over our skis here,\" said Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey on a conference call with investors on Feb. 20.",
      "Walmart executives said the company has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Groceries account for roughly 60%, of its U.S. business, according to the company's most recent annual report, meaning a huge chunk of sales are not reliant on goods made in China or elsewhere.",
      "Walmart expects first quarter earnings per share of between 57 cents and 58 cents, well below the 64 cents Wall Street was expecting, and for the year. Walmart expects earnings per share in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. That's also off the $2.77 that analysts are predicting, according to FactSet.",
      "It forecast a 3% to 4% increase in quarterly sales or between $166.35 billion and $167.97 billion. That could be a letdown for industry analysts, who had expected sales of $167.05 billion, according to FactSet.",
      "Walmart expects sales to be up anywhere between 3% to 4% for the current year, or between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That too falls short of the $708.72 billion that analysts predicted, according to FactSet.",
      "Inflation-weary consumers",
      "Walmart is among the first major U.S. retailers to report quarterly financial results and numbers could provide a hint as to the mood of the American shopper, particularly amid new trade barriers that according to most economists threaten to reignite inflation.",
      "Consumers over the past year have increasingly focused more on necessities rather than TVs, furniture or appliances. They've become much more discerning about big-ticket purchases because of higher costs for credit as well as for groceries.",
      "Walmart has flourished in that environment, using its clout to keep prices down. It's gained market share, notably among households with incomes over $100,000. Walmart's online offerings and paid membership, Walmart +, have also drawn wealthier customers",
      "\"We have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an eCommerce business driven by faster delivery times,\" said CEO Doug McMillon. \"We're gaining market share, our top line is healthy, and we're in great shape with inventory.\"",
      "Tariff risks",
      "Still, Walmart could be faced with challenges with the new tariffs carrying more economic risks than during Trump's first term. If Americans are hit by a new wave of price increases, economists say, and with 70% of the U.S. economy driven by consumers a broad pullback in spending would have ramifications beyond Walmart's sales.",
      "Government data last week revealed a sharp drop in January retail sales as cold weather kept more Americans indoors. But it was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest in a year. Sales were revised higher for December, possibly indicating a pullback by consumers after a holiday season splurge.",
      "\"[T]here are a lot of potential headwinds from sticky inflation, high debt levels, and a suppressed housing market. The uncertainty of tariffs and their impact on prices adds another changeable dimension,\" noted Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a Feb. 14 research note about the retail data.",
      "Yet grocery prices, a sore point for American households, continued to rise.",
      "Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, reported earnings of $5.25 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31. That compares with $5.49 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share for the most recent quarter was 66 cents.",
      "Sales rose 4.1% to $180.55 billion in the quarter.",

    "summary": "The \"reinventing government\" program cut over 480,000 federal jobs and thousands of regulations. The woman who ran the program says any similarities to DOGE end there.",
    "story": [
      "As President Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency push to slash spending, Republican allies have likened their efforts to a White House program from more than 30 years ago.",
      "After entering the White House in 1993, Democratic President Bill Clinton tasked Vice President Al Gore with looking for ways to cut waste and red tape and streamline the federal bureaucracy to \"create a government that works better and costs less.\"",
      "The \"reinventing government\" program cut nearly half a million federal jobs and dispensed with a massive number of regulations. But according to the woman who ran the program under the Clinton administration, any similarities between that program and DOGE end there.",
      "\"We cut fat and they cut muscle. It's as simple as that,\" Elaine Kamarck, now a senior fellow in Governance Studies at Brookings, told CBS News. \"We didn't have any meltdowns of agencies, we didn't have any dysfunction going on, and we obeyed the law. When we thought something was wrong, we sent it to Congress and asked them to change it.\"",
      "The National Partnership for Reinventing Government followed through on Clinton's campaign promise to make the government more efficient and effective. The project was spearheaded by Gore and officially\u00a0created in March 1993, kicking off a review of government agencies that would go on to become the longest-running reform effort in the nation's history. It wrapped up its work in 1998.",
      "Kamarck was hired by Gore to direct the program, and the two put together a team of about 400 civil servants who worked across a number of teams. They conducted reviews of Cabinet-level agencies with a partner team within the agency and returned recommendations for review. Six months later, the project had yielded hundreds of recommendations bound in a report titled\u00a0 \"Creating a Government that Works Better & Costs Less.\"",
      "The effort, which would ultimately trim the federal workforce by around 426,000 in less than eight years while cutting thousands of pages of regulations, was focused on saving the government money. But Kamarck said it also focused on \"making the government work better,\" with attention toward performance and customer service standards that remain today.",
      "\"Basically, we worked with people in the government to identify where we could make it work better, and where we could make it cost less,\" Kamarck said.",
      "The program went on well beyond the six-month review period to focus on implementation, acting upon around two-thirds of the recommendations, and yielding an estimated $136 billion in savings for taxpayers.",
      "Now, more than three decades later, a new cost-cutting effort is underway. Mr. Trump\u00a0announced in December that Musk, who played a major role in his reelection effort, would lead DOGE in the new administration, and signed an\u00a0executive order on his first day in office to officially create the Department of Government Efficiency. Its\u00a0website says it's found $55 billion in savings so far, but a CBS News review of those savings shows some discrepancies.",
      "Unlike the Clinton-era program, which took six months to make its recommendations, DOGE has worked with Cabinet department and agency heads to shrink the government workforce immediately and pause swaths of government spending. DOGE first turned its focus to excising federal contracts and spending on issues like diversity, equity and inclusion provisions and\u00a0foreign aid and has moved on to other federal agencies.",
      "The Trump administration offered a\u00a0deferred resignation plan to more than 2 million civilian federal employees and convinced 75,000 to accept it before shutting it down and ordered agencies to\u00a0lay off nearly all probationary employees.",
      "DOGE has also gained\u00a0access to the Treasury Department's payment system. And an IRS employee associated with DOGE\u00a0requested access to the IRS' data system that includes individual taxpayer information in recent days.",
      "The moves have sparked controversy \u2014 and lawsuits \u2014 over the administration's authority to carry out its dramatic reshaping of the federal government in a compressed period of time.",
      "Facing scrutiny, Musk and allies have held up the example of the Clinton administration's government overhaul seemingly as a kind of model for their own. During a hearing held by the House's newly created DOGE subcommittee last week, one Republican lawmaker showed a video featuring Clinton and Gore's announcement after the six-month review to remind Democrats of what their \"party believed in.\" Musk himself has highlighted the comparison between his work and the effort three decades prior in recent days, sharing an AI-generated\u00a0post on reductions to the federal workforce under the Clinton administration and concurring with a\u00a0post that called Clinton and Gore \"the original Doges.\"",
      "Kamarck, though she has\u00a0advocated for new government cuts, said the \"big difference\" between the Clinton administration program and DOGE is that the earlier program sought to understand what was going on in the agency and what was important, using a fine-toothed comb to make cuts.",
      "\"If they were doing it the same way we did it, they could do a hell of a lot of good for the government,\" Kamarck said. \"But instead, they're just, they're throwing out the baby with the bath water.\"",
      "Still, Clinton's government cutting received its share of criticism, sparking frustrations when the program chose to close many regional offices deemed to be obsolete and incompatible with advancements in electronic communications. Kamarck conceded that they didn't win every fight. Though they succeeded on procurement reform, pioneered electronic filing of tax returns and generally helped usher the federal government into the internet age, they fell short on civil service reform without an advocate in Congress.",
      "And although their effort to reduce the size of the government workforce took place over years instead of weeks, there were some who felt that the buyout strategy they used was not as effective as it could have been. \"Many with special skills left, and people who stayed might have been those we'd have wanted to leave,\" Donald Kettl, the former dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland,\u00a0told Government Executive in 2013.",
      "Kamarck said the process the Clinton administration followed is the \"harder way to do it\" \u2014 and not how DOGE is proceeding.",

Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on Wednesday urged her colleagues in Congress to reassert their constitutional authority and stand up to President Trump if he withholds funding approved by lawmakers through his\u00a0mass firings of federal workers or severe cuts to federal agencies.",
      "\"If the president, for instance, should seek to withhold federal funding that has already been authorized and appropriated, that violates the Budget Act, it violates the Impoundment Act and it cannot be allowed to stand. And so, if we in Congress allow that, we effectively cede some of our authority, and so, your question as to, what do we do about it? We have to stand up,\" she said in a virtual town hall with constituents.",
      "\"Now, the 'we' has to be more than just me. And this is where it becomes more of a challenge, but it requires speaking out. It requires saying, 'That violates the law. That violates the authorities of the executive,'\" she said.",
      "The Alaska Republican said Congress has an \"obligation to the Constitution\" that requires \"speaking out and standing up, and that requires, again, more than just one or two Republicans \u2014 it requires us as a Congress to do so.\"",
      "The president's moves to essentially shutter several agencies and fire thousands of workers have already run into legal challenges, with federal courts across the country weighing whether his actions were lawful. The administration has been temporarily blocked from ousting workers and freezing funding in a handful of cases so far.",
      "Murkowski is a moderate Republican who has been in the Senate since 2002 and won reelection in 2022 despite longstanding differences with Mr. Trump. She said more than 1,000 people dialed into the call on Wednesday, and that many of her constituents were concerned about the Trump administration's cuts, which are being spearheaded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Alaska has one of the highest concentrations of federal government workers per capita outside the Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia region.",
      "Most Republican lawmakers have so far shown little interest in objecting as the Trump administration tries to whittle down agencies established and funded by Congress.",
      "On the war in Ukraine, Murkowski said \"we were all more than a little bit stunned\" by what she called a \"radical switch\" in the president's rhetoric about the war and Russia. Mr. Trump this week referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a \"dictator\" and wrongly blamed Ukraine for Russia's invasion, while his top aides met with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia about the war without inviting Ukrainian officials.",
      "Murkowski said she thought Mr. Trump's comments about Zelenskyy were \"uncalled for and unfortunate.\"",
      "\"It is wrong to suggest that somehow or other Ukraine started this war, asked for this war. It is clear for all the world to see and to know that Putin invaded Ukraine and started the war,\" Murkowski said.",

      "The agency's latest update also included other infected mammals in locations around the country, including a harbor seal in Massachusetts, a fox in North Dakota, a bobcat in Washington state and a domestic cat in Oregon.

      "Since the H5N1 strain of the bird flu began spreading in the U.S. in 2022, about\u00a0148 million birds\u00a0on poultry farms have been euthanized to prevent additional infections, which has caused\u00a0egg prices to spike.\u00a0In March 2024, the illness was found in dairy cows for the first time, while almost 70\u00a0human cases\u00a0have been identified, mostly in dairy and poultry workers.

      "An Idaho judge declined to throw out key evidence against the man charged with murder in connection with the killings of four University of Idaho students, saying Wednesday that the genetic investigation process that it hinges on was not unconstitutional.",
      "Judge Steven Hippler was not swayed by legal arguments made by Bryan Kohberger's defense team that law enforcement violated his constitutional rights when they used a process called Investigative Genetic Genealogy, or IGG, to identify possible suspects.",
      "The decision came nearly a month after a two-day hearing on the matter, removing what could have been a major wrench in the prosecution's case before trial starts in August. The judge said no one would be allowed into the\u00a0courtroom\u00a0but that the open portions of the trial would be livestreamed from the court's YouTube page.",
      "Kohberger is charged with four counts of murder in the deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, who were killed in the early morning of Nov. 13, 2022, at a rental home near campus in Moscow, Idaho. When asked to enter a plea last year, Kohberger stood silent, prompting a judge to enter a not-guilty plea on his behalf. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted.",
      "The IGG process often starts when DNA found at the scene of a crime doesn't yield any results through standard law enforcement databases. When that happens, investigators may look at all the variations, or single nucleotide polymorphisms, that are in the DNA sample. Those SNPs, or \"snips,\" are then uploaded to a genealogy database like GEDmatch or FamilyTreeDNA to look for possible relatives of the person whose DNA was found at the scene.",
      "In Kohberger's case, investigators said they found \"touch DNA,\" or trace DNA, on the sheath of a knife that was found in the home where the students were fatally stabbed. The FBI used the IGG process on that DNA and the information identified Kohberger as a possible suspect.",
      "Defense attorney Anne Taylor had argued that police never sought warrants to analyze the DNA found at the crime scene, nor did they get warrants to analyze the DNA of potential relatives that had been submitted to genealogy databases. She argued the court should suppress the IGG identification and everything that came from it.",
      "The judge said that in order to throw out evidence based on a warrantless search, Kohberger's defense would need to \"show that he had legitimate expectation of privacy in the item or place searched.\"",
      "\"Any privacy interest he can claim in this DNA was abandoned along with the sheath, to which he claims no ownership or knowledge,\" said Hippler. \"Even if no such abandonment occurred, defendant has not demonstrated it is reasonable to recognize a privacy interest in DNA left at a crime scene.\"",

      "The remains were said to be those of Shiri Bibas and her two children, Ariel and Kfir, as well as Oded Lifshitz, who was 83 when he was abducted. Kfir, who was 9 months old when he was taken, was the youngest of all the captives. Hamas has said all four were killed along with their guards in Israeli airstrikes.",
      "\"Every home in Israel bows its head today. We bow our heads for the heavy loss of our four hostages,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. \"The four coffins of our loved ones oblige us more than ever to promise, to swear, that what happened on October 7 will never happen again.\"",
      "The militants displayed four black caskets on a stage surrounded by banners, including a large one depicting Netanyahu as a vampire, as Red Cross vehicles arrived at the scene in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The fighters then carried the caskets over to Red Cross vehicles, where staffers in red vests covered them in white sheets before placing them inside. Each casket had a picture fixed to the front bearing the image of the slain hostage whose remains were purportedly inside.",
      "The Red Cross convoy headed back to Israel, where authorities were carrying out a formal identification process on the remains using DNA, which was expected to take up to two days. A statement from the Lifshitz family, however, shared by the Hostages Families Forum, said they had \"received with deep sorrow the official and bitter news confirming the identification of our beloved Oded's body.\"",

In Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, where Israelis have gathered to watch the release of living hostages, a large screen showed a compilation of photos and videos of Lifshitz and the Bibas family, including a chuckling baby Kfir and the family dressed up in Batman costumes. Yarden Bibas, the children's father, was not with his family on Oct. 7, but was taken separately. He was released earlier this month after 16 months in captivity.",

      "Israelis have celebrated the return of 24 living hostages in recent weeks under a tenuous ceasefire that paused over 15 months of war. But the handover on Thursday will provide a grim reminder of those who died in captivity as the talks leading up to the truce dragged on for over a year.",
      "It could also provide impetus for negotiations on the second stage of the ceasefire that have hardly begun. The first phase is set to end at the beginning of March.",
      "Kfir Bibas was just 9 months old, a red-headed infant with a toothless smile, when militants stormed into the family's home on Oct. 7, 2023. His brother Ariel was 4. Video shot that day showed a terrified Shiri swaddling the two boys as militants led them into Gaza.",
      "Relatives in Israel have clung to hope, marking Kfir's first and second birthdays and his brother's fifth. The Bibas family said in a statement Wednesday that it would wait for \"identification procedures\" before acknowledging that their loved ones were dead.",
      "Supporters throughout Israel have worn orange in solidarity with the family \u2014 a reference to two boys' red hair \u2014 and a popular children's song was written in their honor.",
      "Like the Bibas family, Oded Lifshitz was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, along with his wife Yocheved, who was freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Oded was a journalist who campaigned for the recognition of Palestinian rights and peace between Arabs and Jews.",
      "Hamas-led militants abducted 251 hostages, including some 30 children, in the Oct. 7 terrorist attack, in which they also killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians.",
      "More than half the hostages, and most of the women and children, have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight and have recovered dozens of bodies of people killed in the initial attack or who died in captivity.",
      "Hamas is set to free six living hostages on Saturday in exchange for hundreds more Palestinian prisoners, and says it will release four more bodies next week, completing the ceasefire's first phase. That will leave the militants with some 60 hostages, all men, around half of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Hamas has said it won't release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu, with the full backing of the Trump administration, says he is committed to destroying Hamas' military and governing capacities and returning all the hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive.",

      "Meeting earlier this month in Washington with Mr. Trump, Jordan's King Abdullah II, asked about the president's proposal, said Egypt was working on an alternative plan with other Arab countries.",
      "\"We will be in Saudi Arabia to discuss how we can work with the president and with the United States,\" Abdullah told reporters. \"Let's wait until the Egyptians can come and present it to the [U.S.] president, and not get ahead of ourselves.\"",
      "On Friday, a meeting to discuss that alternative proposal for Gaza's future will take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. While Mr. Trump has continued to insist that Egypt and Jordan will rehome the Palestinians from Gaza, his administration has also said it remains open to other suggestions.",
      "\"Right now, the only one who's stood up and said, 'I'm willing to help do it,' is Donald Trump,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview last week. \"All these other leaders, they're going to have to step up. If they've got a better idea, then now is the time.\"",
      "An Egyptian plan for Gaza takes shape",
      "\"Egypt is putting together a comprehensive, phased plan that seeks to rehabilitate Gaza,\" Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Tamim Khallaf told CBS News on Wednesday. \"The plan will span several years that would entail sequential phases of removing rubble and reconstruction.\"",
      "\"It will be conducted in a way to ensure that Palestinians in Gaza remain in their homeland,\" said Khallaf, adding that the plan \"will be operationally both realistic and workable.\"",
      "Funding for the herculean task of rebuilding Gaza will be a vital component of any plan for after the war. As of January, the U.N. and World Bank estimated that 72% of the territory's housing, 84% of its health facilities and 92% of its primary roads had been damaged or totally destroyed, and the bombing continued for another month from that point.",
      "Khallaf told CBS News that Egypt was \"in talks with the United Nations, through the U.N. Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza, to jointly organize an international conference in Egypt for early recovery and reconstruction in Gaza, which will be essential to provide emergency relief activities and secure necessary funds to see the plan come to fruition and restore life back to Gaza.\"",
      "The plan being discussed in Riyadh is expected to be officially endorsed at an Arab summit scheduled for March 4 in Cairo. The plan is also expected to garner backing from further afield. Many U.S. allies in Europe have firmly rejected Mr. Trump's call to relocate Gaza's population, but there has been no other offer of an alternative.",
      "Speaking Wednesday next to Spain's prime minister after they met in Madrid, el-Sissi said the leaders had \"emphasized the importance of the international community's support and adoption of the reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip, that does not involve the forcible displacement of the Palestinian people \u2014 again, without the displacement of the Palestinian people \u2014 from their land they so dearly cherish, and their ancestral homeland they will never abandon, and that ensures the immediate initiation of relief and early recovery operations.\"",
      "Egypt has grappled for a post-war solution for Gaza that would be acceptable to all parties since the conflict was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "It's unclear how much support a unified Arab stance, even with broader international support, might garner from Mr. Trump or his close ally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Without their backing, it's difficult to envision any proposal coming to fruition.",
      "\"Generational healing between Palestinians and Israelis is possible but can only transpire when Palestinians live in an independent state of their own,\" Khallaf told CBS News. \"We look forward to working with the U.S. administration in achieving the long-awaited peace in the region.\"",

      "Mexico will never tolerate an invasion of its national sovereignty by the United States, President Claudia Sheinbaum warned Thursday after Washington designated Mexican\u00a0drug cartels as terrorist organizations.",
      "\"This cannot be an opportunity for the U.S. to invade our sovereignty,\" she said. \"With Mexico it is collaboration and coordination, never subordination or interventionism, and even less invasion.\"",
      "On Wednesday, the Trump administration formally labeled eight cartels as terrorist groups. They include Mexico's two main drug trafficking organizations, the Jalisco New Generation and Sinaloa cartels.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order on his first day back in the White House saying that the cartels \"constitute a national-security threat beyond that posed by traditional organized crime.\"",
      "The move has raised speculation about possible military action.",

      "Experts, however, said that bombing Mexican cartels or sending troops over the border still appeared unlikely, although Mr. Trump's unpredictability makes it impossible to completely rule out.",
      "The idea \"used to be something that was found in a niche, very much on the fringes, and now it is at the center of the discussion,\" said Cecilia Farfan-Mendez, an analyst at the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation.",
      "In 2022, former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told \"60 Minutes\" that during his first term President Trump suggested firing missiles into Mexico to combat drug cartels there. Esper also said when he pushed back on the idea, Mr. Trump said, \"No one would know it was us.\"",
      "Mexico targets U.S. gun manufacturers",
      "Sheinbaum also said Thursday that Mexico would follow through on her promise to expand its legal action against U.S. gun manufacturers following Washington's decision to designate cartels as terrorist groups.",
      "The Mexican government accuses U.S. arms makers of negligence in the sale of weapons that end up in the hands of drug traffickers, and Sheinbaum said the lawsuit could lead to a new charge of alleged complicity with terrorist groups.",

The firearms are then shipped across the southwest border through a chain of brokers and couriers.",
      "Mexico has already\u00a0filed a lawsuit\u00a0in the United States against U.S. arms manufacturers and vendors, claiming $10 billion in damages for their alleged role in criminal violence in the country.",
      "Earlier this month, Sheinbaum angrily\u00a0rejected an accusation by the United States\u00a0that her government has an alliance with drug cartels.",
      "\"We categorically reject the slander made by the White House against the Mexican government about alliances with criminal organizations,\" the president\u00a0wrote on social media\u00a0at the time.",
      "\"If there is such an alliance anywhere, it is in the U.S. gun shops that sell high-powered weapons to these criminal groups,\" she added.",

      "Spain's High Court convicted Rubiales of assault for the forced kiss and fined him 10,800 euros ($11,300).",
      "Rubiales was also ordered to not come within 650 feet of Hermoso, and he cannot contact her for a year, under the court's order. His lawyer, Olga Tubau Martinez, announced shortly after the verdict that he would be appealing the court's decision.",

    "story": [
      "Egyptian officials announced Tuesday the discovery of the tomb of King Thutmose II, the last of the lost tombs of the kings of ancient Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty, which reigned for over two centuries between about 1550 BC and 1292 BC. It's the first royal Egyptian tomb to be discovered since King Tutankhamun's final resting place was found in 1922.",
      "A joint Egyptian-British archaeological mission discovered Thutmose II's tomb in the mount of Thebes area, west of Luxor and the renowned Valley of the Kings. The team and the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, which made the announcement, said evidence was discovered that clearly indicates it was King Thutmose II's tomb during excavations of what had previously been known only as tomb No. C4.",
      "The entrance and main passage into the structure were discovered in 2022, and internal excavations have continued meticulously since then.",
      "Dr. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said when the mission first found the entrance to the tomb and its main passage almost three years ago, the team believed it could belong to one of the wives of the kings, given its proximity to the tomb of the wives of King Thutmose III and its proximity to the tomb of Queen Hatshepsut, which was prepared for her as a royal wife before she became ruler of the ancient kingdom. She ended up being buried in the Valley of the Kings, due to her ascent to the throne.",
      "As the excavation work and examination of artifacts continued, the mission found new evidence that identified the owner of the mysterious tomb as King Thutmose II, suggesting also that his burial rites were carried out by Queen Hatshepsut, who was his wife and half-sister.",
      "Khaled said parts of alabaster vessels found in the ruins have inscriptions bearing the name of King Thutmose II and identifying him as the \"deceased king,\" along with the name of his wife, Hatshepsut, all of which he said had helped to confirm Thutmose II as the owner of the tomb.",
      "He described the discovery as one of the most important archaeological finds in recent years. The artifacts discovered are important additions to the body of knowledge around the history of the area and the reign of King Thutmose II.",
      "The mummy of King Thutmose II was discovered during the 19th century, not far away at another archaeological site known as the Deir el-Bahari Cachette, to which it was likely moved centuries after being looted by tomb raiders, according to the\u00a0relatively new National Museum\u00a0of Egyptian Civilization. His mummy is now on display, among those of other ancient royals, at the museum.",
      "The tomb is in a poor state of preservation due largely to exposure to floods shortly after Thutmose II's death, according to Mohamed Abdel Badie, Head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Head of the Egyptian team that has worked on the dig. Abdel Badie said initial studies also indicate much of the original contents of the tomb were moved to another location after the ancient floods.",
      "He said the teams had discovered mortar in the tomb with remnants of blue inscriptions and yellow stars, and some paragraphs from the book of \"Imydwat,\" which is one of the most important funerary books found in ancient Egyptian tombs, written to help guide the late royals through their underworld journey.",
      "Dr. Piers Litherland, head of the English team at the site, said the tomb is characterized by a simple architectural design typical of those chosen by the successive rulers of Egypt who came after Thutmose II.",
      "Litherland said the mission would continue its survey work and try to determine where the rest of the contents from Thutmose II's tomb were relocated to, and to uncover any further secrets that may have been locked beneath the earth for millennia.",

      "Mr. Trump inflated the amount of assistance the U.S. has sent to Ukraine since Russia's invasion in 2022. The U.S. has provided $66 billion in security assistance. In total, Congress has appropriated $175 billion in economic, humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine.",

      "People have been gathering outside Rome's Gemelli hospital to show their support, too, with many leaving messages and notes near a statue of former Pope John Paul II. The Vatican also shared a selection of photos Wednesday showing some of the drawings and notes of support that children being treated at Gemelli's pediatric oncology unit have sent to the pope.",
      "The pope has always kept a very busy schedule, and he appeared breathless at some of his public events earlier in the month, before being admitted to the hospital on Friday for what was first diagnosed as bronchitis.",
      "The new diagnosis confirmed on Tuesday, of pneumonia in both of his lungs, came a day after the Vatican said the pontiff had a polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract and that test results were \"indicative of a complex clinical picture that will require an adequate hospital stay.\"",
      "The Vatican said Tuesday that the pneumonia would require additional drug therapy. The illness was discovered after Francis underwent a CT scan of his chest on Tuesday afternoon, the Vatican said.",
      "The Vatican has said Francis is thankful for the \"closeness he feels at this moment\" from his supporters, and that he asked for people to pray for him.",
      "This is the pope's fourth hospitalization since he took over leadership of the Roman Catholic Church in 2013. He underwent significant\u00a0abdominal surgery in 2021 and then had another procedure in 2023 to repair scar tissue and an abdominal hernia. He had been hospitalized briefly for treatment for pneumonia earlier that year.",
      "As a young man in his home country of Argentina, Francis had part of one lung removed following a pulmonary infection, which left him vulnerable to respiratory illnesses.",
      "The Vatican has canceled an audience Francis was scheduled to have on Saturday and announced that he wouldn't celebrate Sunday Mass at St. Peter's Basilica, either.",
      "The pope's continuing hospitalization comes just over two weeks before the start of the annual Christian observance of Lent. The 40-day Lenten period begins on Ash Wednesday, which this year falls on March 5.",
      "Just before Easter last year, Francis declined to attend a Good Friday procession at Rome's Colosseum in a bid to conserve his health, but the pope later led tens of thousands of worshipers in Easter celebrations.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Feb 2025 12:49:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Moscow gloats, Ukraine's leader says Trump is operating in a Russian \"disinformation space\" as the U.S. president echoes Putin's own defense of his war.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, speaking Tuesday afternoon from his home in Florida, appeared to shift three years \u2014 if not many decades \u2014 of U.S. foreign policy almost 180 degrees, issuing remarks that made his administration sound aligned more with Russian President Vladimir Putin than America's European allies of the last eight decades.",
      "In rhetoric similar to claims Putin has used himself to justify his three-year\u00a0war on Ukraine, Mr. Trump seemed to blame President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for Russia's full-scale invasion after the Ukrainian leader took issue with being left out of initial conversations between the White House and Moscow, which began Tuesday in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"I think I have the power to end this war, and I think it's going very well. Today I heard, 'Oh, well, we weren't invited.' Well, you've been there for three years. You should have ended it three years \u2014 you should have never started it,\" Mr. Trump chided Zelenskyy. \"You could have made a deal. I could have made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the land. Everything, almost all of the land. And no people would have been killed and no city would have been demolished, and not one dome would have been knocked down. But they chose not to do it that way.\"",
      "\"This is, frankly, what Vladimir Putin would have said \u2014 that none of this needed to happen, when in fact, it happened because he wanted it to happen,\" Ravi Agrawal, the editor in chief of Foreign Policy magazine, told CBS News' Major Garrett after hearing Mr. Trump's remarks.",
      "Zelenskyy reacted Wednesday, saying Mr. Trump appeared to be operating in a \"disinformation space\" fostered by Russia.",
      "Putin, who first sent forces into Ukraine in 2014 and seized control of its Crimean Peninsula in a unilateral annexation never recognized by the U.S. or most of the world, has claimed he was forced to launch his full-scale attack on the neighboring nation due to a threat posed by the U.S.-led NATO alliance spreading its influence eastward toward Russia's border.",
      "The U.S. and its European NATO allies have always dismissed that excuse, insisting that Putin's real intention ahead of the February 2022 full-scale invasion was always to seize more of Ukraine's sovereign territory and delegitimize Zelenskyy's pro-Western government.",
      "\"NATO consists of 32 countries and NATO's position is that it [war in Ukraine] was unprovoked,\" U.S. Navy Adm. Stuart B. Munsch, commander of JFC Naples, one of NATO's three Joint Force Commands, said Wednesday in Romania when asked about Mr. Trump's remarks. Munsch \u2014 one of the U.S. Navy's longest-serving active duty officers \u2014 is in Romania this week for a NATO military exercise aimed at preparing the alliance for any further Russian aggression on Europe's far eastern flank.",
      "Mr. Trump has made fiery rhetoric, and sometimes a loose adherence to fact, a hallmark of his negotiating tactics with foreign powers \u2014 including a baseless claim from his Mar-a-Lago mansion on Tuesday that Zelenskyy's approval rating had dipped to 4%, when domestic polling in Ukraine shows it over 50%. That lines up with Kremlin propaganda, along with a call for Ukraine to hold new elections and a suggestion it should have done so already, despite the country's constitution making a vote impossible under the current state of emergency sparked by Russia's invasion.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarkable espousal of Russian rhetoric has fueled rising concern in Europe that the U.S. could be shifting the enormous weight of its geopolitical and security influence away from the deep-rooted democracies of the West, toward the autocratic rulers of the ideologically conservative east, and especially Putin.",
      "The Russian leader's longtime confidant, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, acknowledged the shift Wednesday, lauding Mr. Trump and saying his \"remarks on NATO being the main reason for the conflict in Ukraine are a signal that he understands our position.\"",
      "\"I assume the United States, as discussed yesterday, intends to remove obstacles that are in the path of promising projects. We have begun to move away from the edge of the abyss where Biden's administration led our relationship,\" the veteran Russian diplomat said.",
      "Zelenskyy has softened his stance in recent months, seemingly accepting that he may have to cede some of his country's Russian-occupied territory in an eventual peace deal, but he's made it clear that Ukraine must be involved in the negotiations for a ceasefire agreement, and that his country will need security guarantees from the U.S. and the West to protect it from any future Russian attack.",
      "\"We are seeing a lot of disinformation and that is coming from Russia,\" Zelenskyy said Wednesday. \"Unfortunately, President Trump, with all due respect\u2026 is living in this disinformation space.\"",
      "The Ukrainian leader said he wanted to end the war \"this year,\" but he admonished the Trump administration for helping Russia's autocratic regime to \"break out\" of the isolation it brought upon itself \u2014 in the form of sanctions and cut-off diplomacy \u2014 by launching the unprovoked attack on his country.",
      "In a post on his own Truth Social media platform, Mr. Trump doubled down on his criticism of Zelenskyy later Wednesday, accusing him doing \"a terrible job\" and \u00a0of \"playing\" the Biden administration to convince the U.S. to spend hundreds of billions of dollars \"to go into a War that couldn't be won.\"",
      "Repeating the Kremlin's misleading refrain that Zelenskyy \"refuses to have Elections,\" Mr. Trump went as far as calling Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" warning the Ukrainian leader that he, \"better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.\"",
      "\"In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only 'TRUMP,' and the Trump Administration, can do,\" argued Mr. Trump.",
      "It was unclear how hard Mr. Trump's special envoy Keith Kellogg, who arrived in Kyiv Wednesday to \"sit and listen\" to Zelenskyy's administration after the Ukrainians were left out of the initial dialogue with the Kremlin, would push the American president's viewpoint that Ukraine could or should have prevented or stopped the war foisted upon it by its far larger, far better armed, autocratically-ruled neighbor.",
      "Upon arriving, Kellogg, a retired three-star general, said it was nice to be visiting Kyiv \"just a few days before the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\" seemingly acknowledging which side had initiated the war.",
      "Zelenskyy says Putin will push war \"very quickly\" onto NATO soil if not stopped",
      "Zelenskyy says Putin will push war \"very quickly\" onto NATO soil if not stopped",
      "Kellogg called his visit \"a chance to have some good, substantial talks,\" but what Ukraine will want is a clear indication that the world's biggest military power will somehow protect it from future Russian aggression. Zelenskyy has long said that could come in the form of either NATO membership for his country or NATO forces deployed to enforce a ceasefire.",
      "After U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio led the White House delegation's bilateral talks with Lavrov in Saudia Arabia on Tuesday, the Russian foreign minister said point-blank that the Kremlin wouldn't accept either of those things. Russia has already ruled out any exchange of occupied territory with Ukraine, and it's unclear what concessions the Trump administration could try to win from Russia for a peace deal.",
      "\"We understand the need for security guarantees,\" Kellogg told Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne Novyny after arriving in Kyiv on Wednesday. \"It's very clear to us the importance of the sovereignty of this nation and the independence of this nation as well... Part of my mission is to sit and listen.\"",
      "He said he would share what he learned on his trip to Kyiv with Mr. Trump and Rubio to \"ensure that we get this one right.\"",
      "A Kremlin spokesperson has said Putin and President Trump could meet in-person as early as this month, even as the war in Ukraine rages on.",

    "summary": "Emma Raducanu was approached in a public space \"by a man who exhibited fixated behavior\" and the same man was spotted in the first few rows during her match, the WTA said.",
    "story": [
      "Concern over a man who'd exhibited \"fixated behavior\" caused Emma Raducanu to approach the chair umpire in tears and take an unscheduled break in her second-round match at the Dubai Championships, the Women's Tennis Association said Wednesday. The incident unfolded three years after a man in Britain was convicted of stalking the star player at her family home.",
      "There'd been no immediate explanation Tuesday when the 2021 U.S. Open champion walked to the umpire after the second game, said a few words and then stood in a small space between the back of the official's chair and barrier netting adjacent to Court 2.",
      "Raducanu returned to play after a brief delay at 2-0 down and eventually lost 7-6 (6), 6-4 to 14th-seeded Karolina Muchova.",
      "On Wednesday, the WTA issued a statement explaining that Raducanu was approached in a public space Monday \"by a man who exhibited fixated behavior\" and \"this same individual was identified in the first few rows during Emma's match on Tuesday ... and subsequently ejected.\"",
      "\"He will be banned from all WTA events pending a threat assessment.\"",
      "The chair umpire called tournament organizers immediately when Raducanu reported her concerns in the first set of the night match, and Muchova walked over to console the 22-year-old British player.",
      "Raducanu then picked up a towel, wiped her face, nodded and continued the match. She didn't immediately comment on the incident.",
      "The WTA said it was working with Raducanu and her team \"to ensure her well-being and provide any necessary support\" and the Dubai Tennis Championships said it was collaborating with the WTA, BBC News reported.",
      "\"The tournament security team worked in collaboration with the WTA security team to proactively identify and immediately eject the individual in question from the stadium,\" tournament organizers said. \"We support the WTA's decision to ban the individual in question from all WTA events, and share the tour's longstanding commitment to player welfare, safety and wellbeing.\"",
      "Raducanu rose to fame in 2021 by winning the U.S. Open as a qualifier, one of the most unlikely achievements in tennis. She hasn't advanced past the third round at a major since then and has spent long stints recovering from injuries.",
      "In 2022, a stalker who walked 23 miles to the London home of Raducanu was given a\u00a0five-year restraining order, BBC News reported. Amrit Magar told police he had been \"drawn\" to the tennis star \"because of her high-profile status after her victory in the U.S. Open\" and had taken her father's shoe, believing it belonged to her, as a \"souvenir,\" BBC News reported at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Marine experts have given up hope of rescuing more than 150 false killer whales that stranded on a remote beach on Australia's island state of Tasmania, officials said on Wednesday.",
      "Experts including veterinarians were at the scene near the Arthur River on Tasmania's northwestern coast where 157 whales were discovered on an exposed surf beach on Tuesday afternoon, the Department of Natural Resources and Environment said.",
      "Unfavorable ocean and weather conditions, which prevented the whales from being rescued on Wednesday, were forecast to persist for days, incident controller Shelley Graham said.",
      "\"We have been out in the water this morning and have relocated and attempted to refloat two whales but didn't have success as the ocean conditions weren't allowing the animals to get past the break. The animals are continuously restranding,\" Graham said in a statement.",
      "Marine biologist Kris Carlyon said the survivors would be euthanized.",
      "\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful,\" Carlyon said.",
      "The department said there were 136 survivors on Wednesday morning but that assessment was revised down to 90 within a few hours.",
      "The inaccessibility of the beach, ocean conditions and challenges to getting specialist equipment to the remote area complicated the response.",
      "The young whales weighed as little as 1,100 pounds, while the adults weighed over three tons each. Despite their name, false killer whales are one of the largest members of the dolphin family. The whales are large and slender, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and have prominent markings that can allow scientists to identify individuals. A subspecies in the United States is considered endangered. The animals also have strong social bonds and tend to travel in groups, NOAA said.",
      "The reasons for the beachings are unclear. Reasons could include disorientation caused by loud noises, illness, old age, injury, fleeing predators and severe weather.",
      "Clark declined to speculate on why the latest pod might have stranded. Carcasses of dead whales would be examined for clues, he said.",
      "A helicopter reconnaissance on Tuesday afternoon determined that there were no other whales within six miles of the stranded pod, he said.",
      "Some could have been stranded for as long as 48 hours by early Wednesday.",
      "Arthur River resident Jocelyn Flint said her son had discovered the stranded whales around midnight while fishing for shark.",
      "She said she had gone to the scene in the dark hours of the morning and returned after dawn but the whales were too big to be refloated.",
      "\"The water was surging right up and they were thrashing. They're just dying, they've sunk down in the sand,\" Flint said Wednesday morning. \"I think it's too late.",
      "\"There are little babies. Up one end, there's a lot of big ones. It's sad,\" she added.",
      "Department liaison officer Brendon Clark said the stranding was the first by false killer whales in Tasmania in since 1974. That was a pod of more than 160 whales that landed on a beach near Stanley on the northwest coast. Strandings in Tasmania are usually pilot whales.",
      "In early 2024, 29 long-finned pilot whales died and about 100 more were rescued after they were beached along the lower tip of Western Australia. In 2023, nearly 100 pilot whales were stranded on a beach in Western Australia. About half were rescued, but re-stranded only hours later. All of the whales wound up dead, CBS News previously reported. In 2022, 230 pilot whales stranded further south on the west coast at Macquarie Harbor. Only 35 survived.",
      "The largest mass stranding in Australian history occurred in the same harbor in 2020 when 470 long-finned pilot whales became stuck on sandbars. Most of the beached whales died on both occasions.",

    "story": [
      "A Delta Air Lines jet crashed Monday during a fiery landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport, skidding down the tarmac before coming to a stop while flipped upside down.",
      "The dramatic scene, captured on video by air traffic controllers and, later, the passengers on board, left 21 people injured \u2014 two critically. What caused it remains under investigation by the Canadian Transportation Safety Board, which said Tuesday that the aircraft's black boxes have been recovered, and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration. Here's what we know so far.",
      "The ceiling of the plane \"had become the floor\"",
      "Delta Air Lines Flight 4819 departed Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in Minnesota on Monday morning, carrying 76 passengers and four crew members.",
      "The plane, operated by Minneapolis-based Delta Air Lines subsidiary Endeavor Air, struck the landing strip as it arrived at Toronto Airport at about 1:15 p.m. CST, according to Delta. Images and video of the accident showed the CRJ-900 aircraft catch fire when it hit the pavement and proceeded to turn sideways while sliding across the airfield, losing its tail and both wings along the way.",
      "It eventually flipped over and came to a halt. Passengers on the plane have since described hanging upside down, suspended by their fastened seatbelts, with one person recalling how he \"crashed down onto the ceiling, which had become the floor\" after unbuckling.",
      "Emergency teams rushed to the site of the crash, extinguishing the blaze and then evacuating the passengers who were still inside. At a news conference Tuesday, Toronto International Airport president and CEO Deborah Flint praised the Delta flight crew and emergency workers at the airport for launching a \"textbook response\" to the accident \"within minutes.\"",
      "\"The crew of Delta Flight 4819 heroically led passengers to safety, evacuating a jet that had overturned on the runway on landing that was amidst smoke and fire,\" Flint said. \"Thank you for all that you do every day and every night in service of safe air travel.\"",
      "Delta CEO Ed Bastian also commended the flight crew and their swift evacuation, calling the circumstances \"horrifying\" in an interview Wednesday on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "\"You can imagine, when I received the text minutes after it happened, hearing that there was a regional jet upside down on an active runway with 80 people on board, how I felt without knowing yet what was transpiring,\" Bastian said. \"But the reality is, safety is embedded into our system. ... And yes, it's amazing the work that our team did up at Endeavor, but that's what we expect out of them because we are prepared for all types of circumstances.\"",
      "Two people were critically injured",
      "All 80 passengers and crew members on the Delta flight survived the crash. Emergency responders and the flight crew themselves ushered passengers down the aisle of the overturned jet and helped evacuate them through an emergency exit door. More footage from the crash showed passengers climbing out of the aircraft and stepping out onto a snowy tarmac, where powerful winds whipped past.",
      "Officials originally reported that 19 people suffered injuries in the accident, but the number was revised up to 21 between Monday and Tuesday. Flint said 19 people were taken to hospitals in the area for medical treatment immediately after the crash, and two more were admitted later on. Corey Tkatch, commander of operations for Peel Regional Paramedic Services, said some people suffered back sprains, head injuries, anxiety and \"nausea and vomiting due to the fuel exposure.\"",
      "Nineteen of the injured people had been released by Tuesday, according to Delta Air Lines, while two remained hospitalized and their conditions were listed as critical. The exact nature of their injuries has not been released, but Flint told reporters the people hurt on Flight 4819 had a range of injuries considered minor to critical, none of which are life-threatening.",
      "Peel Regional Paramedic Services at first classified a child as injured and in critical condition, but the Hospital for Sick Children later said the child was in good condition.",
      "Toronto was experiencing rough and frigid weather",
      "Evacuees from the plane crash were met with harsh wintry conditions when they exited onto the airfield, with one person likening the environment to tundra weather. Snow and ice coated the tarmac, and powerful, blustery winds could be seen on video.",
      "Meteorologists said Toronto was experiencing blowing snow when the accident occurred, and visibility had been reduced to 6 miles. Winds were gusting up to 37 miles per hour and temperatures dropped far below freezing to just 17 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "But Toronto International Airport Fire Chief Todd Aitken said Monday that the airport runway was dry at the time of the crash, and there were no crosswind conditions as the Delta flight arrived.",
      "Bastian told \"CBS Mornings\" that the flight crew was an experienced group familiar with Toronto's intense winter weather.",
      "\"All these pilots train for these conditions,\" Bastian said. \"We train for this continuously.\"",
      "Flint on Tuesday said the crash occurred on \"an operational day\" at the Toronto airport, which canceled hundreds of flights over the weekend as a result of heavy snowfall. By Monday, more than 1,000 flights were scheduled, and they resumed at the airport just about three hours after the accident.",
      "Almost two dozen members of Transportation Safety Board of Canada are leading an investigation into the crash and what may have caused it. The United States National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration will also send people from both U.S. agencies to assist in the probe.",
      "Survivors are waiting for answers",

      "Passengers are starting to share their stories of surviving\u00a0a chilling crash-landing Monday at Toronto Pearson International Airport, where a Delta plane on a flight from Minneapolis caught fire and flipped upside down on the runway.",
      "There were 80 people on board Flight 4819 \u2014 76 passengers and four crew members \u2014 all of whom survived. Authorities said 21 people were injured. Two of the injured passengers, a 40-year-old woman and 60-year-old man, were initially said to be critically hurt and were airlifted to a hospital, while the others' injuries were considered mild to moderate, according to a regional paramedics service that responded to the scene. Delta said two people remained hospitalized Tuesday, CBS News Minnesota reported.",
      "One of the passengers speaking out about his experience is Pete Carlson, who boarded the plane Monday morning at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to attend a paramedics conference in Canada.",
      "In an interview with Canadian broadcaster CBC News, Carlson recalled the sounds of \"cement and metal\" and the scent of gasoline as the plane skidded down the icy runway in Toronto, losing both wings and its tail and turning over completely so its wheels faced the sky.",
      "\"As we made our descent and made touchdown, it was just a very forceful event, where all of a sudden everything just kind of went sideways,\" Carlson told CBC News. \"And then, next thing I know, it was kind of a blink and I'm upside down, still strapped in.\"",
      "Carlson had fastened his seatbelt, as instructed, prior to landing. When he unlatched the belt to evacuate the plane, he said he \"crashed down onto the ceiling, which had become the floor.\"",
      "Emergency workers at the airport were able to reach the site of the crash \"within minutes,\" said Deborah Flint, president and CEO of Toronto Pearson International Airport, at a news conference Monday night. They quickly helped evacuate everyone on board. Flint said 22 of the passengers were Canadian and the rest were multinational, but did not provide details on how many were American or other nationalities.",
      "\"The most powerful part of today was, there was just people. No countries, no nothing,\" Carlson said. \"There was just people together helping each other.\"",
      "Matt Cunningham, a father who was also on the flight, told \"CBS Mornings\" he texted his family once the plane had stopped moving. The message read: \"Plane crash, please pray.\" About 15 minutes went by before Cunningham was able to send a second message, which included pictures of the overturned aircraft that he took from outside.",
      "\"Talking to my dad today, he said those 15 minutes from the time he got that text until he until he got the next one with some photos that I took away from the plane, were 15 tough minutes,\" Cunningham said. He recalled the flood of emotions that washed over him when he heard his 17-year-old daughter's voice on the phone.",
      "\"I lost it,\" he said.",
      "Cunningham told\u00a0CBS News Minnesota he was sitting in a window seat about eight rows behind the exit doors at the front end of the plane. He remembered the passenger seated beside him helping Cunningham unfasten his seatbelt while upside down, and subsequently falling into the overhead luggage compartments that were then beneath them.",
      "\"There was some shouting back and forth, 'Is somebody opening the doors?

We could see jet fuel going over the windows, pooling up. Seeing the videos today of the fireball we landed in, it just seems inconceivable that we weren't on fire.\"",
      "Another passenger, John Nelson, captured video of the plane, charred and overturned, as people climbed out of it into the freezing cold.",
      "Nelson described the plane making a hard landing before screeching over the pavement on its side and ultimately flipping onto its back,\u00a0CBS News Minnesota\u00a0reported.",
      "\"There was, like, a big fireball outside the left side of the plane and when we got finished we were upside down, everybody else was there as well,\" Nelson said. \"We tried to get out of there as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Several additional videos emerged online as passengers began to film the evacuation. In one video shared on Snapchat, passenger Ashley Zook appeared to dangle upside down from her seat inside the plane with her seatbelt fastened, AFP reported. The crash seemed to have knocked out the lights inside the plane, and it was dark.",
      "That same social media video showed harsh winds whipping past Zook after she exited the plane.",
      "\"I was just in a plane crash, oh my god,\" she said in the video.",
      "Another passenger, skier and sports influencer Pete Koukov, shared another video of the crash-landing on Instagram. A flight attendant wearing an Endeavor Air uniform is seen helping people evacuate the plane one by one through an emergency exit door, which Koukov climbed through himself. Endeavor Air is a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines headquartered in Minneapolis.",
      "The flight attendant can be heard directing passengers to \"drop everything\" and urging them to \"come on.\"",
      "\"Holy f***!\" Koukov repeatedly exclaims in the recording after getting of the plane. His Instagram post includes the message: \"Being alive feels pretty cool today.\"",
      "Koukov later told CNN that \"we were upside down hanging like bats\" inside the plane before evacuating. He said he \"didn't know anything was the matter\" until the plane hit the ground.",
      "The crash is under investigation by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, which is leading the probe. On Tuesday the agency confirmed the aircraft's black boxes had been recovered from the wreckage. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration said they would send investigators as well.",
      "Meteorologists said there was blowing snow in Toronto when the crash happened, and visibility was down to 6 miles. Winds were gusting up to 37 mph and temperatures were well below freezing, at 17 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "But Toronto Pearson International Airport Fire Chief Todd Aitken said Monday night that the runway was dry at the time of the crash, and there were no crosswind conditions. Flint said two runways at the Toronto airport would remain closed for at least part of Tuesday as the investigation continued.",

    "summary": "Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been formally charged for an alleged plot to stage a coup and try to poison his successor,\nLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\u200b .",
    "story": [
      "Rio de Janeiro \u2014 Brazil's prosecutor-general on Tuesday formally charged former President Jair Bolsonaro with attempting a coup to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat, in a plot that included a plan to poison his successor and current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and kill a Supreme Court judge.",
      "Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet alleges that Bolsonaro and 33 others participated in a plan to remain in power. The alleged plot, he wrote, included a plan to poison Lula and shoot dead Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a foe of the former president.",
      "\"The members of the criminal organization structured a plan at the presidential palace to attack institutions, aiming to bring down the system of the powers and the democratic order, which received the sinister name of 'Green and Yellow Dagger,'\" Gonet wrote in a 272-page indictment. \"The plan was conceived and taken to the knowledge of the president, and he agreed to it.\"",
      "Bolsonaro is often seen in Brazil's yellow-and-green national soccer jersey and the colors have become associated with his political movement.",
      "Bolsonaro's defense team said it met the accusations with \"dismay and indignation,\" adding in a statement that the former \"President has never agreed to any movement aimed at deconstructing the democratic rule of law or the institutions that underpin it.\"",
      "Bolsonaro's son, Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, who is a senator, said on the social platform X that the indictment was \"empty\" and there was no evidence of wrongdoing. He accused the Prosecutor-General's Office of serving \"the nefarious interests of Lula.\"",
      "In November, Brazil's Federal Police filed a 884-page report with Gonet detailing the scheme. They allege a systematic effort to sow distrust in the electoral system, drafting a decree to provide legal cover for the plot, pressuring top military brass to go along with the plan and inciting a riot in the capital.",
      "In the indictment, Gonet described the alleged crimes as part of a chain of events articulated with an overarching objective of stopping Bolsonaro from leaving office, \"contrary to the result of the popular will at the polls.\"",
      "The Supreme Court will analyze the charges and, if accepted, Bolsonaro will stand trial.",
      "The far-right leader denies wrongdoing. \"I have no concerns about the accusations, zero,\" Bolsonaro told journalists earlier on Tuesday during a visit to the Senate in Brasilia.",
      "\"Have you seen the coup decree, by any chance? You haven't. Neither have I,\" he added.",
      "As well as participating in a coup d'\u00e9tat, the 34 defendants are accused of participating in an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, damage qualified by violence and serious threat against the state's assets, and deterioration of listed heritage, according to a statement from the Prosecutor General's press office.",
      "Gonet said the criminal organization he charged \"had as leaders the (then) president himself and his running mate, Gen. Braga Netto.\"",
      "\"Both accepted, stimulated, and performed acts that are described in our criminal legislation as attacking the existence and the Independence of (the branches) of power and of the democratic rule,\" Gonet wrote in his report.",
      "The crimes have varying penalties. If Bolsonaro is convicted of attempting a coup and the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, he could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison, according to the country's criminal code.",
      "The indictments, based on manuscripts, digital files, spreadsheets, and message exchanges, expose a scheme to disrupt democratic order, according to the prosecutor-general's office.",
      "The charges are \"historic,\" said Luis Henrique Machado, a criminal attorney and professor at the IDP university in Brasilia, adding that he expects the Supreme Court to accept the charges and put Bolsonaro on trial sometime before the end of next year.",
      "\"The charges show Brazil's institutions are robust, independent and agile,\" Machado said. \"They are a role model for other countries where democracy is at risk.\"",
      "Bolsonaro is barred from running in the 2026 election after judges with the country's top electoral court ruled that he abused his power and cast unfounded doubts on the country's electronic voting system.",
      "Following Tuesday's charges, Bolsonaro will \"position himself as a victim,\" said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. Bolsonaro has previously said his legal woes are an attempt to stop him from returning to office.",
      "\"There are polls saying he would be competitive in the 2026 elections against Lula, one of them published today,\" said Melo. \"There's going to be political dust, but it will settle.\"",

      "\"The emotional impact on Ms. Lively has been extreme, not only affecting her, but her family, including her husband and four children. There are days when she has struggled to get out of bed, and she frequently chooses not to venture outside in public,\" the amended complaint, obtained by Fox News Digital, reads. \"While she has fought to maintain her personal life and business interests, behind closed doors she has suffered from grief, fear, trauma, and extreme anxiety. She also has been experiencing repeated and painful physical symptoms as a result of this experience.\"",
      "\"Mr. Reynolds, too, has been affected mentally, physically, and professionally by his wife\u2019s and children\u2019s pain,\" the complaint continues. \"Worst of all, however, has been the impact on their young children, who have been traumatized and emotionally uprooted in ways that have substantially impacted their well-being.\"",

      "The decision to highlight \"the emotional impact\" of the case on Lively days after the \"Gossip Girl\" star appeared at the star-studded celebration of \"Saturday Night Live's\" 50th anniversary was \"poorly timed,\" entertainment lawyer Camron Dowlatshahi told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"It seems a bit poorly timed to lodge this amended complaint just days after a very public appearance, especially when there is a focus on Ryan Reynolds\u2019 apparent emotional distress,\" Dowlatshahi, a partner at MSD Lawyers, added. \"He was the one joking around on \u2018SNL.\u2019\"",
      "Lively and Reynolds were given a deadline of Feb. 18 to file an amended complaint against Baldoni by Judge Lewis Liman.",
      "\"This makes even more clear that the public appearance was not a good idea,\" Dowlatshahi said. \"The attorneys included the phrase 'behind closed doors' in an attempt to explain the appearances, but typically, you don't want to be in a position to have to qualify and contextualize your client\u2019s actions \u2013 you simply advise them not to do certain things.\"",

      "\"One can say it's an attempt to maximize\u00a0public empathy but, at the same time, if these allegations are proven true, it's Lively just expressing how she really feels,\" the branding expert said. \"Sometimes we think that celebrities have a magical, wonderful life, but they're a lot like the average person \u2013 they have families to take care of. People like Reynolds and Lively are under scrutiny 24-7 and the emotional toll from legal situations like this can hit a lot harder because everything is public knowledge. Lively admitting how devastating this has been for her family and yet, upping the ante in the battle, indicates that it must be worth fighting for.\"",

One may have assumed it was due to bruised egos. However, now because Blake Lively has amended\u00a0her complaint to include other women who alleged wrongdoing by Justin Baldoni, I think it's an indication that the matter is more serious than originally perceived.\"",

      "Legal experts agreed that Reynolds' joke at \"SNL50\" was mostly harmless.",
      "\"Reynolds does not have an analogous emotional distress claim against Baldoni, so his public appearances are not as harmful,\" Dowlatshahi told Fox News Digital. \"Lively being out in public and accepting invites to various events shows that she\u2019s not as emotionally distressed and that the impact to her career in terms of earnings and job prospects isn\u2019t necessarily as severe, as warranting hundreds of millions of dollars. Although Lively didn't say anything publicly, her presence and participation at the \u2018SNL\u2019 event potentially mitigates her emotional distress damages for her sexual harassment claim.\"",

In other words, showing the personalities that got them favor from their fans in the first place. However, at the same time, they need to stay completely away from the lawsuit and never mock, demean, make fun of or comment on any of the facts. All references to the lawsuit should be made through their attorneys, and as far as they are concerned, they take the legal proceedings very seriously and intend on proving their case in court.

Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions.\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

With home addresses exposed in data leaks, criminals may send fraudulent letters or fake invoices to trick you into providing further personal information or making payments. If you receive suspicious mail, avoid responding and report it to the company it claims to be from.",
      "3) Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

    "summary": "Major IoT data breach: Mars Hydro database with 2.7 billion records exposed. Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson says the breach is a reminder of the risks that come with using IoT devices.",
    "story": [
      "Data breaches keep happening, and too often they come down to companies failing to take cybersecurity seriously. Some of the biggest breaches have been caused by negligence, and now there\u2019s another major one to add to the list. Mars Hydro, a Chinese company that makes Internet of Things (IoT) devices like LED lights and hydroponics equipment, left a massive database unprotected online. As a result, 2.7 billion records were exposed to anyone who knew where to look.",
      "Stay protected & informed! Get security alerts & expert tech tips\u2014sign up for Kurt\u2019s The CyberGuy Report now",
      "Illustration of IoT devices (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happened?",
      "Mars Hydro, a Chinese manufacturer of IoT devices, suffered a massive data breach after a publicly accessible, unprotected database containing nearly 2.7 billion records was discovered online. The 1.17-terabyte database was not password-protected or encrypted, exposing a massive amount of sensitive information related to the company\u2019s smart devices, including LED grow lights and hydroponic equipment.",
      "The database contained logging, monitoring and error records for IoT devices sold worldwide. Among the exposed data were Wi-Fi network names (SSIDs), Wi-Fi passwords, IP addresses, device ID numbers and other details linked to user devices and the Mars Pro IoT software application. Plus, internal records referenced LG-LED SOLUTIONS LIMITED, a California-registered company, as well as Spider Farmer, which produces agricultural equipment.",
      "Security researcher\u00a0Jeremiah Fowler identified the database and immediately sent a responsible disclosure notice to LG-LED SOLUTIONS and Mars Hydro. Within hours, public access to the database was restricted.",
      "It remains unclear how long the database was publicly accessible or whether any unauthorized parties accessed the data before its restriction. The only way to confirm potential access or misuse would be through an internal forensic audit, but no such investigation has been publicly disclosed.",
      "Illustration of using an app to access smart home devices (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Should you be worried?",
      "The unprotected database contained highly sensitive user and device information, including SSIDs and passwords stored in plain text, which could allow unauthorized users to access home networks. Although the researcher did not indicate that any personally identifiable information was exposed, the presence of network credentials, IP addresses, device ID numbers and data about smartphones running the IoT software raises serious security concerns.",
      "The exposed credentials could theoretically enable an attacker to connect to the network, compromise other devices, intercept data or even launch targeted cyberattacks. This risk is particularly troubling, given the broader vulnerabilities within the IoT industry.",
      "According to a threat report by Palo Alto Networks, 57% of IoT devices across all industries are considered highly vulnerable, and an alarming 98% of data transmitted by these devices is unencrypted. The report further found that 83% of connected devices operate on outdated or unsupported operating systems, leaving them susceptible to attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities.",
      "This incident underscores a recurring problem in the IoT sector: poor security practices, weak data protection and the absence of encryption. Without proactive security measures, such breaches will likely continue, exposing users to risks that extend beyond just their IoT devices, potentially compromising entire home or business networks.",
      "Illustration of a IoT device (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "FROM TIKTOK TO TROUBLE: HOW YOUR ONLINE DATA CAN BE WEAPONIZED AGAINST YOU",
      "6 ways you can protect yourself",
      "If you own a Mars Hydro device or use the Mars Pro app, take the following steps to protect your data and secure your network:",
      "1) Change your Wi-Fi password: Since Wi-Fi network names and passwords were stored in plain text, the first step is to update your router password immediately.\u00a0Even if you believe your credentials were not directly exposed, it\u2019s best to assume otherwise. A strong password should be complex, combining upper and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using simple or easily guessable passwords, such as your name, address or basic numerical sequences.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): If your router supports\u00a0two-factor authentication, enabling it adds an extra layer of security. This ensures that even if someone gains access to your login credentials, they would still need a secondary authentication code \u2013 typically sent via text message or an authentication app \u2013 to log in. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "3) Monitor your network for unusual activity: With Wi-Fi credentials and IP addresses exposed, attackers could attempt to access your network remotely. Checking your router\u2019s admin panel regularly to review connected devices is an important security measure. If you notice an unfamiliar device, remove it immediately and change your Wi-Fi password again.",
      "4) Keep your devices updated: IoT devices are notorious for running outdated or unsupported software, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Regularly\u00a0updating the firmware and software of your smart devices ensures that you receive the latest security patches. Check your device settings for available updates and install them as soon as they are released. Keeping your router\u2019s firmware updated is equally important, as routers are a primary target for hackers.",
      "5) Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: Hackers may try to exploit the data from this breach by launching phishing attacks. If you receive an email claiming to be from Mars Hydro or LG-LED SOLUTIONS, urging you to reset your password or provide personal details, be cautious. Cybercriminals often create fake login pages designed to steal credentials. Do not click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Remove your exposed data from data brokers:\u00a0With 2.7 billion records exposed, your personal and network information may already be circulating among data brokers \u2013 companies that collect and sell user data, often without consent. Hackers and scammers use these databases to launch phishing attacks, identity theft scams and targeted cyber intrusions.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Mars Hydro breach is yet another reminder of the security risks that come with IoT devices. Companies need to do a better job of protecting user data, but at the end of the day, it is up to you to secure your own network. Updating passwords, enabling two-factor authentication and keeping an eye on your connected devices can make a big difference in keeping your data safe and your smart home secure.",

      "Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to discuss bank scams and a self-driving car that trapped a rider inside.",
      "Tech support scams have been around for years, but a new variant called the Phantom Hacker scam is rapidly gaining traction. It has cost victims, primarily older Americans, over $500 million since 2023. This scam is particularly deceptive because it unfolds in three carefully orchestrated phases and uses AI-powered social engineering tactics to avoid detection. Attackers leverage caller ID spoofing and AI-generated voices to make their scheme more persuasive, but there are ways to protect yourself.",

      "How the phantom hacker scam works",
      "As\u00a0highlighted by the FBI, the scam begins with the tech support impostor phase. You might receive a call, email, text or even a pop-up on your computer warning you that your device has been compromised. The message urges you to call a customer support number for assistance. Once you do, a scammer posing as\u00a0tech support claims that hackers have targeted your accounts. To \"help,\" they instruct you to download remote access software, allowing them to take control of your computer. Under the guise of scanning for threats, they trick you into revealing your financial accounts, setting up the next phase of the scam.",
      "Next comes the financial institution impostor phase. Another scammer, pretending to be from your bank or investment firm, calls to warn that a foreign hacker has infiltrated your accounts. They advise moving your money to a \"safe\" government-protected account, often using wire transfers, cryptocurrency or cash deposits. They might also insist on keeping the transaction confidential, claiming it\u2019s necessary for security reasons.",
      "In the final U.S. government impostor phase, a third scammer impersonates a federal official \u2013 often from the Federal Reserve \u2013 who pressures you to act quickly. If you start doubting the scheme, they may send you an official-looking email or document to convince you that the transfer is legitimate. By the time victims realize they\u2019ve been tricked, their money is gone, often sent overseas beyond the reach of U.S. authorities.",

      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAMS",
      "How AI is making things worse",
      "AI is making scams like the Phantom Hacker scam more deceptive and harder to spot. Scammers are using AI-powered chatbots to automate their schemes. Instead of relying on human operators, they can now deploy AI-driven responses that sound natural and convincing.",
      "AI-generated\u00a0deepfake voices are also being used to impersonate bank officials and government representatives. With just a short audio sample, scammers can clone a voice to make their calls seem even more authentic. This means a victim might hear what sounds like their bank manager or an official from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Email scams are also becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can craft messages that mimic the tone and style of official communications. Scammers can even generate fake but realistic-looking documents with official letterheads to convince victims that the scam is legitimate.",

      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "7 ways to protect yourself",
      "The best way to defend yourself against the Phantom Hacker scam is to stay informed, be cautious and follow these steps:",
      "1) Ignore unsolicited messages: Scammers often send pop-ups, text messages or emails claiming that your computer is infected or that your bank account is at risk. These messages may look official, but they are designed to create panic and pressure you into taking immediate action. Never click on links or attachments from unknown senders, as they may contain malware or lead to phishing websites that steal your personal information.",
      "2)\u00a0Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Verify phone numbers before calling: If you receive an unexpected message urging you to call tech support, do not use the number provided in the message. Instead, visit the official website of the company in question and find their customer support contact information. Scammers often create fake websites or use\u00a0caller ID spoofing to make their phone numbers appear legitimate, so always double-check before making a call.",
      "4) Avoid downloading unknown software: No reputable company will ever ask you to install remote access tools unless you have specifically reached out for tech support. Scammers use these programs to take control of your computer, monitor your activity and access sensitive information. If someone unexpectedly asks you to download software to \"fix a problem\" or \"protect your account,\" it is likely a scam.",
      "5) Never give control of your device to a stranger: If you allow a scammer to remotely access your computer, they can view your personal files, log your keystrokes and manipulate your accounts without your knowledge. Legitimate customer support representatives will never request remote access unless you have initiated the support request through an official company channel. If someone insists on taking control of your device, hang up immediately.",
      "6) Be skeptical of urgent financial warnings: The U.S. government will never contact you unexpectedly and demand that you move your money to a \"safe account.\" They will also never ask you to wire funds, purchase gift cards or send cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Scammers create a false sense of urgency to trick victims into acting before they can think critically about the situation. If someone claims to be from a bank or government agency and pressures you to move money, stop and verify their identity through official channels.",
      "7) Invest in personal data removal services: Scammers often gather information from data broker websites to make their scams more convincing. Your name, phone number, home address and even financial history may be publicly available without your knowledge. Consider using a data removal service to regularly scan and request the removal of your personal information from these databases. This reduces the chances of scammers targeting you with highly personalized attacks. You can also manually opt out of major data broker sites, but using a service automates the process and keeps your information protected over time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Yurts founder and CEO Ben Van Roo breaks down concerns over DeepSeek on 'The Will Cain Show.'",
      "Apple devices are believed to be pretty secure, and that's what the company will tell you. You might have seen the tagline \"Privacy. That\u2019s Apple.\" in their promotions.",
      "However, the tech landscape is changing, and even Apple products aren\u2019t beyond cybercriminals\u2019 reach.",
      "A new report suggests Mac users will need to be more vigilant this year because AI advancements are helping hackers breach even the most secure systems. I have\u00a0consistently reported on how Mac malware is targeting users, and experts now believe this will only get worse.",

      "The rise of cyberattacks on Apple devices",
      "Mac malware is not what it used to be. For years, the biggest threats were annoying adware and browser hijackers, more of a nuisance than a real danger. But that is changing fast. As highlighted by\u00a0Malwarebytes, a new wave of information stealers is taking over, and they are far more dangerous, going after passwords, authentication cookies, credit card details and even cryptocurrency.",
      "This shift started in mid-2023 with the arrival of\u00a0Atomic Stealer, also known as AMOS, a piece of malware that looked much more like something you would see on Windows than the typical Mac threats. AMOS was not just effective. It was easy to use and sold as a service \u00a0for $1,000 a month with a slick web-based control panel. That success led to the rise of even more dangerous variants.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "One of them,\u00a0Poseidon, launched in mid-2024 and quickly became the dominant Mac stealer, responsible for 70% of infections. It can drain over 160 different cryptocurrency wallets, steal passwords from browsers and password managers and even grab VPN credentials.",
      "At the same time, cybercriminals have doubled down on\u00a0malvertising, using fake ads on Google and Bing to trick users into downloading malware instead of real software. These campaigns are highly targeted, allowing attackers to pinpoint Mac users and serve fake downloads based on their searches. With AI now being used to create and execute many of these attacks, they are likely to increase in scale.",

      "Things are worse for Android users",
      "While Mac malware is evolving, the situation on Android is even more alarming. Phishing attacks on the platform have reached staggering levels, with thousands of malicious apps designed to steal credentials and bypass security measures.",
      "So far in 2024, researchers have detected 22,800 phishing-capable apps, alongside 3,900 apps designed to read OTPs from notification bars and 5,200 apps capable of extracting OTPs from SMS messages. These numbers highlight how widespread and effective Android phishing malware has become.",
      "Just like phishing emails, phishing apps trick users into handing over their usernames, passwords and two-factor authentication codes. Once stolen, these credentials can be sold or used for fraud,\u00a0identity theft or further\u00a0cyberattacks. Because phishing apps require minimal code and fewer permissions than traditional malware, they are much easier to sneak onto app stores, including Google Play.",
      "Many phishing apps look like regular, fully functional software. Some impersonate games or utilities, while others appear as cracked versions of popular apps like TikTok, WhatsApp or Spotify. Some stay dormant for days to avoid detection before launching their attacks. Others rely on ad functionality to redirect users to phishing sites, making the malicious code harder to trace.",
      "Google Play Protect, which is built-in malware protection for Android devices, automatically removes known malware. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices.",

      "1. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "2. Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store, Google Play Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS, Android and all installed applications are up to date. Apple and Android frequently release security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS, Android and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here. It generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The days when Mac users could assume they were safe are long gone. Cybercriminals are evolving their tactics, with Mac malware shifting from simple adware to advanced information stealers. Android phishing apps are also becoming harder to detect and more widespread than ever. From stealing passwords and authentication cookies to intercepting OTPs and draining cryptocurrency wallets, these threats are growing in both sophistication and scale. No platform is immune, and as cybercriminals continue refining their techniques, users and organizations must stay ahead with strong security measures.",

      "The financial toll is staggering \u2014 scams cost Americans over $159 billion annually, with average individual losses now exceeding $3,500 per victim. This epidemic is not just a financial crisis but also a human rights issue, as many scams originate from forced labor operations in Southeast Asia.",

      "The word scam with data in the background\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The mechanics of \"pig butchering\"",
      "One of the most pervasive scams today is the so-called \"pig butchering\" scheme. Originating in China and spreading across Southeast Asia, this scam involves criminals building trust with victims through social media or messaging apps. Once trust is established, victims are lured into fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes. These scams are meticulously crafted to appear legitimate, often involving fake trading platforms and simulated profits. Victims are encouraged to invest more until they are \"slaughtered,\" losing their\u00a0entire savings when the scammers vanish with their funds.",
      "9 WAYS SCAMMERS CAN USE YOUR PHONE NUMBER TO TRY TO TRICK YOU",
      "Forced labor behind these scam centers",
      "What makes these scams even more horrifying is their reliance on human trafficking. Criminal syndicates in countries like Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos force trafficked individuals to run these operations under threat of violence. These \"scam centers\" operate in lawless regions controlled by rebel groups or corrupt officials, making international intervention challenging.

      "BEST PRESIDENT\u2019S DAY DEALS",
      "Why America is a prime target",
      "Cyberscams have taken hold in the U.S. for several reasons that make it particularly vulnerable. As an American, you\u2019re likely connected to the digital world through social media platforms, messaging apps and other online tools. This high level of connectivity makes it easier for scammers to reach you directly, whether through a text message, email or social media chat. The sheer number of people online in the U.S. creates a vast pool of potential targets for cybercriminals.",
      "Additionally, the growing popularity of cryptocurrency in the U.S. has made it a\u00a0prime medium for fraud. Cryptocurrency transactions are fast, anonymous and difficult to trace, which makes them ideal for scammers looking to steal funds without leaving a trail. Many scams are designed to exploit this lack of transparency, leaving victims with little chance of recovering their money once it\u2019s gone.",
      "Another major issue is the lack of a centralized reporting system for cyberscams in the U.S. If you\u2019ve ever been scammed or know someone who has, you might have noticed how confusing it can be to figure out where to report the crime \u2014 whether to the FBI, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or another agency. This fragmented system not only makes it harder for victims to seek help but also prevents authorities from gathering comprehensive data to tackle the problem effectively. These factors combined have made Americans some of the most targeted individuals in the world when it comes to cyberscams.",

      "Several countries have implemented innovative measures to combat cyberscams, offering valuable lessons for the U.S. Singapore, for instance, has introduced a mandatory SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) that requires organizations to register their alphanumeric Sender IDs. This system effectively blocks unregistered SMS senders, significantly reducing impersonation scams. In fact, cases involving scam SMSes in Singapore fell by 70% over three months after mandating the SSIR.",
      "Britain has taken a different approach by establishing a dedicated \"159\" hotline, allowing residents to instantly verify suspicious calls. This simple yet effective system provides a quick way for individuals to check the legitimacy of unexpected communications, potentially preventing many scams before they occur.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Many nations have also implemented stricter authentication measures, such as biometric checks and in-app verifications, which have proven highly effective in reducing fraud. For example, Singapore has required facial verification for higher-risk transactions through Singpass since 2022, resulting in no further reports of malware-enabled scams involving unauthorized CPF withdrawals since its implementation in June 2023.",
      "Some countries are exploring ways to slow down cryptocurrency transactions or cap transfer amounts, which could significantly hinder scammers who rely on quick, anonymous transfers. These measures, combined with a coordinated global response involving major victim nations like the U.S. and China, could prove instrumental in dismantling criminal networks more effectively.

      "Protecting yourself and your loved ones from scams requires vigilance and awareness. Here are eight effective ways to safeguard against scammers:",
      "1. Verify before you act: Always verify the identity of the person or organization contacting you. Use official contact information to reach out directly and confirm the legitimacy of the request.",
      "2. Limit personal information sharing: Avoid sharing personal or financial information over the phone, email or online unless you are certain of the recipient's identity and legitimacy.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts:\u00a0A robust password should include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple platforms, and consider using a reputable\u00a0password manager to store and generate complex passwords securely.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible:\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a code sent to your phone or biometric authentication. This ensures that even if your password is compromised, unauthorized access remains highly unlikely.",
      "5. Keep your devices and software up to date:\u00a0By regularly installing the\u00a0latest updates and security patches, you can ensure your devices are equipped with the latest security features and bug fixes, reducing the risk of becoming a target for cyberattacks. Many cyberattacks exploit unpatched vulnerabilities, so enabling automatic updates for your operating system, apps and antivirus software can significantly reduce your risk.",

      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using a service that specializes in removing your personal information from the internet to reduce your exposure to potential scammers. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "7. Monitor financial accounts: Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for any unusual or unauthorized transactions. Promptly report any suspicious activity.",
      "8. Be skeptical of unsolicited requests: Treat unexpected requests for money or personal information with caution. Scammers often create a sense of urgency to pressure you into acting quickly.",
      "9. Be vigilant against phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails or messages. Ensure your devices are protected with strong antivirus software that can detect and block malicious activities. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "10. Report Suspected Scams: If you suspect you've encountered a scam, report it to your local authorities, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and any relevant financial institutions.",

It stems in large part from FBI investigations into Trump himself, including two separate felony cases that were dropped when Trump was re-elected: one involving Trump's handling of classified documents, and the other involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.",
      "Patel previously worked on Capitol Hill and in the first Trump administration, after working as a federal prosecutor in Washington and a federal public defender in Florida. He was considered to take over the FBI during the first Trump administration, but then-Attorney General Bill Barr, among others, vehemently opposed the plan, saying that Patel was unqualified.",
      "Patel, a firebrand who appeared on a broad array of conservative media shows and has spoken about his desire to \"come after the people in the media,\" has attempted to walk back some of his more pugnacious comments from his podcast appearances.",
      "At his confirmation hearing in late January, Patel distanced himself from Trump's sweeping pardons of Capitol rioters, saying he disagreed with the commutations of individuals who assaulted law enforcement officers on Jan. 6. Democratic senators also confronted Patel about his repeated false contentions that the 2020 election was stolen.",
      "Patel has a close relationship with a network of conservative former FBI agents who were pushed out over the past several years, one of whom said he was \"screaming to the heavens\" when Trump nominated Patel.",
      "Julie Kelly, a conservative commentator who described herself as a friend of Patel's, predicted that Patel would \"do what needs to be done\" at the FBI, \u201cwhich is not just dismantle this agency from the top headquarters down to 56 FBI field offices, but also hold accountable those agents who have used their unaccountable power to weaponize the most powerful law enforcement agency in the country against the political foes of the regime.\u201d"

      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul will \u2014 for the time being \u2014 not remove embattled New York City Mayor Eric Adams from office, but will instead impose limits on his power, a source with direct knowledge told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "Hochul in recent weeks has been pressured to exercise her power to remove Adams from City Hall after the mayor's indictment last year on a host of corruption allegations.",
      "Calls to remove Adams from office have intensified after the Trump administration moved to drop all charges against the mayor and told him he needs to help federal authorities carry out immigration raids. That raised allegations from New York Democrats of a \"quid pro quo\" arrangement, making Adams allegedly beholden to Trump.",
      "The governor is expected to announce late Thursday afternoon that her plans to limit mayoral authority will include installation of a deputy inspector general to oversee him, a source with direct knowledge told NBC News.",
      "That move would require action by the state lawmakers in Albany and possibly the New York City Council.",
      "Adams has insisted on his innocence and refused to resign. The Trump administration has also denied a quid pro quo arrangement.",
      "Hochul is set to announce that she won't remove Adams from office \u201cright now,\u201d though she will impose strict \u201cguardrails\u201d on his administration, the source said.",
      "Federal prosecutors charged Adams back in September, accusing him of taking more than $100,000 in benefits and illegal campaign donations in exchange for favors to Turkish business and government interests.",
      "Adams has refused to back down and Hochul has kept largely mum about a previously, little-known element of the city charter that allows a New York governor to remove the mayor.",
      "\"The mayor may be removed from office by the governor upon charges and after service upon him of a copy of the charges and an opportunity to be heard in his defense,\" according to the charter.",
      "Hochul met with reporters on Wednesday to explain her plans to defend congestion pricing, a toll imposed on most drivers coming into Manhattan during non-overnight hours. And during that Q&A and Grand Central Terminal, Hochul refused to answer several questions lobbed to her about Adams.",
      "Danielle R. Sassoon, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York resigned that post last week, saying Adams was explicitly looking for a quid pro quo reward from federal prosecutors if those corruption chargers were to be dropped.",
      "\u201cAdams\u2019s attorneys repeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo, indicating that Adams would be in a position to assist with Department\u2019s enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed,\u201d Sassoon wrote in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "Adams insists there's no quid pro quo being asked for by himself or offered from the government.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Douglas Irwin is a New Hampshire college professor who has spent decades studying tariffs. On Feb. 2, he got a painful lesson in how they work in the real world.",
      "His utility company sent him a letter alerting him that with President Donald Trump planning to slap tariffs on Canada, his heating bill would rise. Trump later postponed the tariffs for a month, but the point had been made: New tariffs meant Irwin and other customers would be paying more to heat their homes in frigid New England winters with propane coming down from Canada.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a very cold winter up here, and [the tariffs] would have an immediate impact on a big-ticket item for consumers,\u201d Irwin said in an interview.",
      "As a candidate, Trump promised to impose tariffs on nations he says have shortchanged the United States. He also promised that people would pay lower prices. Either may be possible, but together the goals are incompatible, economists say.",
      "On another front, Trump wants to extend his multitrillion-dollar tax cut from the first term and simultaneously curb \"the unsustainable path of federal debt.\" A president can do one or the other but not both, according to budget analysts.",
      "Whatever savings Elon Musk\u2019s effort to shrink the government workforce achieve won\u2019t be nearly enough to offset the cost of the tax cuts, said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "\u201cWhat they [Musk and his aides] are doing is a drop in the bucket and potentially creating more chaos and uncertainty for the economy, which doesn\u2019t help with boosting incentives to grow and invest,\u201d she said.",
      "The start of Trump\u2019s second term has been a blur of activity. Each week brings fresh White House directives, orders and statements. Americans say they like the energy so far, according to a CBS News poll.",
      "Yet a peril of Trump\u2019s perpetual motion machine is that policies and pronouncements may collide head-on. Fulfilling one could snuff out another.",
      "Trump makes no apologies. Speaking to reporters over the weekend, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, this country has made more progress in the last three weeks than it\u2019s made in the last four years, and we\u2019re respected again as a country.\u201d",
      "A White House official said in an interview Wednesday that policies should be looked at not in isolation but in the aggregate.",
      "\u201cWhen you take a step back and look at the full picture of what this administration is doing, it\u2019s all complementary,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"When you look at the holistic set of policies here, our agenda very much makes sense.\u201d",
      "Getting in his own way",
      "The economy is but one arena in which Trump may be getting in his own way.",
      "An executive order Trump released on his first day in office called for ending the \u201cweaponization\u201d of government for political purposes. Yet in dropping a criminal case against New York Mayor Eric Adams, the Trump administration signaled that Trump may use law enforcement for leverage in enacting his agenda.",
      "Separately, Trump has called for stanching the flow of illegal drugs into the country, but his administration has temporarily redeployed more than 300 government agents whose jobs included stopping the flow of fentanyl into the United States.",
      "Instead, the agents have been told to help meet a different Trump objective: deporting undocumented immigrants, four people familiar with the decision told NBC News.",
      "The agents are part of a Homeland Security Department law enforcement unit whose mission also includes combating child exploitation, money laundering and human trafficking. That work may suffer as a result of the reassignments, the sources said.",
      "In reply, the White House official countered that deporting criminals living in the United States illegally and keeping drugs out of the country are interconnected goals. The two go \"hand in hand,\" the person said.",
      "Arresting criminal migrants living in the United States \"kills the business model of the cartels that are trafficking in both people and drugs,\" the official added.",
      "Another of Trump\u2019s stated goals is safeguarding free speech. He issued an executive order last month holding that \u201cthe First Amendment to the United\u00a0States Constitution, an amendment essential to the success of our Republic, enshrines the right of the American people to speak freely in the public square without government interference.\u201d",
      "Associated Press reporters, though, are facing staunch interference from the same president who put his name to that high-minded position.",
      "Upon taking office, Trump renamed the Gulf of Mexico the \u201cGulf of America,\u201d discarding a term that has been in use for centuries.",
      "The wire service, whose stylebook is the guidepost for many news outlets, said it would stick with the old name while noting Trump\u2019s change.",
      "That didn\u2019t sit well with Trump, and AP reporters have lost their seat on Air Force One and been barred from pools in which a small group of journalists are admitted into certain White House events where they\u2019re able to pose questions to the president.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep them out until such time as they agree that it\u2019s the Gulf of America,\u201d\u00a0Trump told reporters this week.",
      "Punishing an influential news service that exercises free speech would seem to be in conflict with Trump\u2019s own policy.",
      "\u201cPunitive measures against the AP are very bad and very strange,\u201d said Margaret Sullivan, executive director of Columbia University\u2019s Center for Journalism Ethics and Security. \u201cThe White House and the president don\u2019t get to write the stylebook for The Associated Press.",
      "\"There\u2019s an important First Amendment issue here: In the United States, the government is not supposed to control or restrain the free press, and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening here,\u201d she added.",
      "Asked about the treatment of the AP, the White House official said: \"The fact is that the chief executive of the United States government issued an executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico. If you won't report that accurately, we don't have confidence you'll cover other things correctly. So why would we give you access here?",
      "\"It's not like we have armed guards on the White House campus telling the AP to get lost,\" the official added. \"We're just saying if one party in a relationship is not acting in good faith, the other party is not going to unilaterally show good faith.\"",
      "Moreover, since it took office the Trump White House has restored 400 press passes the Biden administration had \u201crevoked,\u201d the official added, while Trump has proven far more accessible to the news media than Biden.",
      "Tariff troubles",
      "There may no economic instrument that Trump likes more than tariffs. He savors the word itself, calling it the \u201cmost beautiful\u201d in the language.",
      "In a speech Wednesday in Miami Beach, Florida, Trump previewed a new set of tariffs that are in the works.",
      "\"I\u2019m going to be announcing tariffs on cars and semiconductors and chips and pharmaceuticals, drugs and pharmaceuticals and lumber, probably, and some other things over the next month or sooner,\" he said.",
      "But following through and imposing all the tariffs he\u2019s considering risks neglecting a separate promise that may be more important to voters.",
      "Trump was elected in part to bring down the cost of groceries, gas and other staples of everyday life. If tariffs undercut his pledge to do just that, he risks blowback from some of the same voters who ousted Joe Biden.",
      "The CBS News survey found that nearly two-thirds of adults thought Trump's focus on lowering prices was \u201cnot enough.\u201d",
      "Tariffs raised the prices of washing machines and dryers during Trump\u2019s first term by 12%, a University of Chicago study found.",
      "But the White House official noted that Trump's tariffs in the first term didn\u2019t drive up inflation. And in the new term, the administration is addressing the \"root cause\" of inflation, \"which is not tariffs but runaway government spending that drives up demand and causes prices to rise.\"",
      "\"This administration has been ambitious with spending cuts, and that enables us to do tax cuts without driving up the deficit. They're not mutually exclusive.\"",
      "Still, there are early signs that Trump's tariffs may push up prices.",
      "A roofing materials company called GAF sent a letter to North American customers on Feb. 10 citing the 10% tariff Trump imposed on Chinese imports and mentioning potential \u201cprice inflation\u201d that may follow.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, a company spokesman said, \u201cWe expect that tariffs could\u00a0be an inflationary driver, but it\u2019s too soon to speculate on the\u00a0specific\u00a0impact until we have a better understanding of their\u00a0exact scope and timing of implementation.\u201d",
      "If Trump wants his tariffs, he may have to accept higher prices. If he wants lower prices, he may have to forgo tariffs.",
      "Trump may want both, he may have called for both, but \u201cyou can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t repeal the laws of economics. And that\u2019s what he is running into.\u201d"

      "But Hansford, 36, who leads a district of just under 1,000 students, disagrees with the president on one big issue: using public money to send children to private schools.",
      "\"School choice,\" as its proponents call it, is a Trump priority that has divided Republicans, drawing support from many conservative governors who see it as an issue of parents\u2019 rights but opposition from small communities concerned about losing much-needed public school funding. In his state, Hansford worries that a proposed private school tuition support bill wouldn\u2019t help local families who are unable to drive to reach those schools and may not find the special education services they rely on once they get there.",
      "\u201cHow is it \u2018choice\u2019 when there\u2019s no transportation or special education services provided?\u201d Hansford wrote recently on Facebook about the Mississippi bill. \u201cSchool choice with no transportation for families without a car is no choice at all.\u201d",
      "Last month, Trump signed an executive order directing the Education Department to identify ways federal funding could support students attending private and faith-based schools. On social media, he has urged legislators in Texas and Idaho to pass proposals to create private school vouchers or similar programs, and Linda McMahon, his nominee for education secretary, has backed the programs, as well.",
      "Idaho\u2019s bill, which would provide up to $5,000 in tax credits\u00a0for many students attending private school, \u201chas my complete and total support, MUST PASS!\u201d Trump posted Sunday on Truth Social.",
      "Idaho\u2019s Senate did just that Wednesday, and is now set to join the more than two dozen other states that have some form of public funding for private schools, according to EdWeek. The Texas bill appears likely to succeed, as well.",
      "But Republicans in some states where Trump has won by wide margins, including Mississippi and South Dakota, this year chose not to advance bills that would expand financial support for private schools.",
      "It\u2019s one of the few visible chasms in a party that has widely supported Trump\u2019s agenda. Some conservatives see sending public money to private schools as antithetical to the philosophy of less government and less spending, while Trump has framed it as a way to give parents more control over their children\u2019s education. A White House spokesperson said Trump\u2019s executive order aims to allow families to choose schools that \"fit\" their children\u2019s needs.",
      "To Patrick Wolf, a professor studying education policy at the University of Arkansas, the debate shows a looming battle in the Republican Party \u201cbetween pushing national policies that they think are good everywhere and respecting their commitment to federalism,\u201d he said, referring to the idea of sharing power between local and federal governments.",
      "The stakes for those who don\u2019t comply with the national party\u2019s view are rising.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s become a litmus test,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cRepublicans who voted against school choice do have a target on their backs. It certainly leaves them vulnerable to being primaried.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s what happened in Texas, where at least nine Republicans who rejected previous voucher bills were ousted in primaries last year.",
      "\u201cPolitics in Texas is a blood sport,\u201d said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston.",
      "This is the first session since those primaries, and voucher proponents are excited about a bill the Senate has passed to give families $10,000 \u2014 or more if their children have disabilities \u2014\u00a0for private school tuition.",
      "\u201cI think this push from President Trump is kind of what the proponents needed in the final 500 yards,\u201d Rottinghaus said. \u201cIt\u2019s an accelerant for the last and hardest push.\u201d",
      "The Texas bill also drew strong support from Gov. Greg Abbott, who has crisscrossed the state promoting voucher legislation, appearing this week with a San Antonio legislator who ousted an anti-voucher Republican. The legislation is\u00a0now before the House, where, Speaker Dustin Burrows said Monday, \u201cthe votes are there.\u201d",
      "In Idaho, too, legislators have faced primaries for opposing vouchers. At least four Republican lawmakers who had blocked bills previously lost their seats in the most recent elections. Two of them faced opposition from the American Federation for Children, a conservative nonprofit group, whose Idaho affiliate spent more than $500,000 in Idaho's elections last year. A Democratic incumbent the group opposed was also unseated. \"Politicians should fear losing their seats if they ignore their constituents on this issue,\" Tommy Schultz, the group's CEO, said in a statement.",
      "Between those electoral challenges and Trump\u2019s recent post, \"you see why there might be pressure to compromise,\" said Jaclyn Kettler, a political science professor at Boise State University.",
      "However, in South Dakota, which Trump won by 29 points last fall, three \u201cschool choice\u201d bills have failed this year.",
      "Kyle Schoenfish, a Republican who chairs the Senate Education Committee, said he worried that a proposal to siphon off property taxes to help fund private school scholarships could harm public school districts. That could lead communities to raise property taxes, in contrast with the conservative aim to \u201clook for ways to lower them,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not opposition to school choice necessarily, just the question of what should government pay for and what\u2019s more fiscally conservative or responsible,\u201d Schoenfish said.",
      "In Mississippi, where Republicans hold all statewide offices and control both legislative chambers, lawmakers quickly aligned themselves with Trump\u2019s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives by passing bills this session to ban such programs in public schools and universities.",

      "McConnell also shepherded Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut law through the Senate, which became Trump\u2019s signature legislative achievement during his first term.",
      "He has also served on the Appropriations Committee for years and unapologetically used his positions to steer federal funds to his home state, Kentucky. He said Thursday that he's proud to have used its power to help Kentucky \"punch above its weight.\"",
      "In a statement, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who replaced McConnell as the GOP's leader in the chamber, praised his predecessor's legacy of \"remarkable service to the Senate.\"",
      "\"Over decades of tireless work, his mastery of Senate procedure, commitment to the institution, and dedication to the rule of law have shaped the course of American governance for generations to come,\" Thune said. \"His leadership has strengthened the Senate\u2019s role as a deliberative body and delivered historic achievements, from advancing the judiciary to championing Kentucky\u2019s interests.\"",
      "In the Obama era, McConnell developed a reputation as \u201cDr. No,\" marshaling his caucus to unified opposition to much of the president\u2019s agenda, most notably the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. In 2017, he sought to undo the law when, in a now-iconic image, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., shocked him with an unexpected thumbs-down on the Senate floor to sink one of McConnell\u2019s top priorities.",
      "McConnell's oppositional posture softened somewhat under President Joe Biden, when the Kentucky Republican blessed several bipartisan deals \u2014 to expand infrastructure spending and invest in semiconductors through the CHIPS and Science Act, among other measures that became law.",
      "In recent years, McConnell has dedicated his focus to foreign policy and seeking to protect robust American involvement to shape global affairs and preserve the post-World War II order. It\u2019s an area where he has broken with Trump, whose \u201cAmerica First\u201d vision calls for less involvement in global affairs. The two have most notably disagreed on U.S. assistance to Ukraine as it seeks to fend off an invasion from Russia.",
      "McConnell will also be remembered as a fierce defender of the 60-vote filibuster threshold to pass most legislation in the Senate, a tool that was once rarely used but became normalized during his first tenure as minority leader. He resisted Trump\u2019s first-term demands to eliminate the 60-vote threshold.",
      "McConnell has battled some health issues in recent years, including several freeze-ups on camera and a recent fall that has caused him to work from a wheelchair in the Senate. Between his age and alienation from Trump\u2019s MAGA movement that has taken over the GOP, McConnell\u2019s retirement has long been anticipated.",
      "McConnell has been one of the few Republicans willing to break with Trump since he was inaugurated last month, voting against three of his high-profile Cabinet-level nominees. In addition to clashes over Ukraine, McConnell has also criticized Trump's plans to impose sweeping tariffs. His current term expires in January 2027.",
      "\u201cSo lest any of our colleagues still doubt my intentions for the remainder of my term, I have some unfinished business to attend to,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cRegardless of the political storms that may wash over this chamber, during the time I have remaining, I assure our colleagues I will depart with great hope for the endurance of the Senate as an institution.\u201d"

    "summary": "Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s decision not to run for re-election in Kentucky next year opens up his Senate seat for the first time since 1984 \u2014 and it is already drawing interest from heavy hitters looking to fill the seat.",

      "Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s decision not to run for re-election in Kentucky next year opens up his Senate seat for the first time since 1984 \u2014 and it is already drawing interest from heavy hitters looking to fill the seat.",
      "Former state Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who served as a McConnell aide before launching his own career in elected office, including a run for governor in 2023, announced his Senate candidacy less than an hour after the news about McConnell's retirement broke.",
      "And Republican Rep. Andy Barr reiterated his interest in the seat, writing that the state \"deserves a Senator who will fight for President Trump and the America First Agenda\" and teasing a decision \"soon.\"",
      "Barr, though, has already gotten some pushback from the conservative Club for Growth Action. The group launched a TV ad in the state last week targeting Barr's support for federal spending and his votes to raise the country's debt limit. Club for Growth Action President David McIntosh said in a statement that the group \"will oppose his candidacy.\" While the group hasn't endorsed a specific candidate, it did support Cameron in his unsuccessful gubernatorial bid.",
      "Others could jump in, too. Businessman Nate Morris said in a video posted to the social media platform X earlier this month that he's \"seriously\" looking at running for either governor or senator, framing himself as a political outsider who wasn't going to let \"McConnell dictate whether I run or not.\"",
      "Hours after McConnell's announcement, Morris spoke on a panel at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside of Washington, where he criticized \"two candidates that are looking at this race that are puppets of Mitch McConnell, and we can\u2019t have that.\u201d",
      "And other candidates who ran for statewide office recently, including former United Nations Ambassador Kelly Craft or former Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles (both of whom ran for governor in 2023, when Cameron won the GOP nomination but lost to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear in the general election), could decide to mount another statewide bid.",
      "One Republican who isn't interested: Rep. James Comer. Comer spokesman Austin Hacker said that \u201cCongressman Comer will not be running for Senate in 2026 but is strongly considering a run for governor in 2027.\u201d",
      "McConnell's departure opens up a plum political office in a state that's been good to Republicans at the federal level \u2014 no Democrat has won a Senate race there in the 21st century. But there's been less room for Republicans to move up the ladder in the state than one might think: Kentucky has only had four senators since McConnell first won his seat in 1984.",
      "Plus, Republicans have had tougher sledding running for governor \u2014 both Beshear and his father, Steve, won two gubernatorial elections, while both Republican governors who served over the last 25 years lost their re-elections.",
      "Beshear's campaign manager, Eric Hyers, told NBC News that the governor will not run for Senate.",
      "One Democratic strategist with experience in the state pointed to Beshear adviser Rocky Adkins as a potential strong candidate. Adkins is a former state legislator and Democratic leader in the state House.",
      "Though Beshear\u2019s recent success could encourage some Democrats to run for the seat, it would still be considered an uphill battle, even if the political environment becomes more favorable for the party. McConnell won his 2020 re-election by almost 20 points over Democrat Amy McGrath, and GOP Sen. Rand Paul won another term by a larger margin in 2022 against Democrat Charles Booker \u2014 even though Beshear won his state re-election race the next year."

      "\u201cIt was a very rich period,\u201d said British Egyptologist Chris Naunton, who was not involved in the excavation. But the mystery of Thutmose\u2019s tomb \u201cwas a glaring gap, and that gap has now been filled.\u201d",

    "summary": "DOGE wants access to filers\u2019 data, and the commerce secretary says Trump wants to scrap the IRS. But filing a return remains mandatory \u2014 the earlier the better, tax advisers say.",
    "story": [
      "This tax season is rife with uncertainty, as the world\u2019s richest person looks to shake up the Internal Revenue Service and the commerce secretary calls to eliminate it \u2014 but filers still need to carry on as usual, tax experts say.",
      "\u201cWhatever they\u2019re going to have to do to make their tax return accurate and true, they have to do,\u201d said Christina Wease, director of the Alvin. L. Storrs Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic at Michigan State University.",
      "\u201cIn the face of uncertainty,\u201d tax filers should consider getting their returns in as soon as they can, ideally electronically, said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \u201cThis was the case a few years ago with the pandemic,\u201d and the advice still holds true, she said \u2014 echoing a common refrain among tax advisers even in uneventful tax seasons.",
      "The current season has already been anything but.",
      "Alina Habba, an adviser to President Donald Trump, said at a conservative conference Thursday, \u201cWe\u2019re firing a bunch of the IRS today, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d Her remarks followed Associated Press reporting that thousands of probationary employees are slated to be cut this week.",
      "Late Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News\u2019 Jesse Watters that Trump wants to \u201cabolish\u201d the IRS \u201cand let all the outsiders pay\u201d via trade policies including tariffs (which tax American importers, not foreign businesses or governments). Watters then told his more than 3 million followers on X that their \u201ctax rates, interest rates, and mortgage rates are going to come hammering down.\u201d",
      "\u201cAbolishing the IRS or even, say, cutting funding to the IRS doesn\u2019t alter our tax system at all,\u201d said Kathleen DeLaney Thomas, a tax law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cOnly Congress could decide to repeal the many statutes in the Internal Revenue Code that provide the framework for our federal tax system.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency initiative is pressing for access to an IRS database containing sensitive taxpayer information, an effort that has drawn a lawsuit alleging privacy and tax law violations. The plaintiffs also claim DOGE\u2019s request poses a potential conflict of interest, since the data could involve tax records and investigations of Musk\u2019s business competitors.",
      "Tax policy and legal experts say much remains to be seen about the extent of any access to filers\u2019 data DOGE may gain and what the group might do with it. Two sections of the IRS tax code protect the confidentiality of returns and prohibit executive branch influence over agency audits and investigations.",
      "\u201cFor decades, since we\u2019ve had these privacy laws enacted by Congress, it\u2019s pretty much just been understood that IRS civil servants handled this data,\u201d Thomas said.",
      "In recent weeks, DOGE has made an aggressive push to slash federal spending and root out purported fraud and abuse across the government. While some of the initiative\u2019s high-profile claims have been called into question or included errors, conservative pundits and administration officials continue to promote them.",
      "\u201cWaste, fraud, and abuse have been deeply entrenched in our broken system for far too long,\u201d said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields, reiterating a statement he provided Sunday to NBC News. \u201cIt takes direct access to the system to identify and fix it.\u201d",
      "The IRS didn\u2019t respond to NBC News' requests for comment.",
      "In the meantime, taxpayers are still staring down the usual April 15 deadline to file their returns and have few ways to protect themselves from any potential fallout from non-IRS staffers\u2019 possible involvement.",
      "\u201cWhat DOGE now has meant for the IRS is a lot of uncertainty and a lot of concern,\u201d Holtzblatt said. \u201cThat uncertainty and concern will be spilling over to the rest of us during this filing season, and particularly those of us who have concerns with how our tax information is used.\u201d",
      "But she emphasized that filing a correct and complete return isn\u2019t optional. If taxpayers are concerned about DOGE employees potentially seeing their bank account information, they could opt not to receive refunds via direct deposit. The IRS also offers checks by mail, but that could take longer.",
      "Mary Clements Evans, a certified financial planner in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, has been advising clients not to file their returns by mail either, citing the reports of workforce cuts at the IRS. \u201cThose paper filings, they\u2019re going to require people looking at them,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the great things the IRS has done over the years is they\u2019ve automated the processes.\u201d",
      "Evans said she\u2019s now fielding clients\u2019 concerns about how changes at the agency might affect returns this year. Many taxpayers rely on the IRS for support, partly because of an ongoing shortage of certified public accountants, and she said she\u2019s worried that staff firings could leave filers with fewer free resources. But she echoed other tax experts in saying it remains a good idea to file sooner rather than later.",
      "\u201cAs far as the vast majority of individuals who are filing, they can go ahead and file,\u201d Evans said.",
      "Holtzblatt suggested using the IRS\u2019 new Direct File tool since it\u2019s less labor-intensive. The free filing system was piloted last year and has since expanded to 25 states.",
      "For fiscal year 2023, the IRS processed nearly 271.5 million tax returns and other forms, and issued $659.1 billion in returns, according to agency data. Taxpayers submit a wide variety of personal information in those documents, all of which helps calculate their tax liability. IRS employees then view taxpayers\u2019 returns to verify their filing status, exemptions and deductions before administering a refund if due. If something seems off, or if a taxpayer is selected for a random audit, the IRS will reach out via mail to request further information.",
      "The IRS database that DOGE is trying to access, called the Integrated Data Retrieval System, contains a slew of data that\u2019s central to this process. IRS employees are allowed to access it on a need-to-know basis, said Nina Olson, who served as the national taxpayer advocate at the IRS from 2001 to 2019. Agency staffers, usually auditors or case advocates, can use the IDRS to pull up individuals\u2019 tax returns, which can include from their Social Security numbers and income to details about their health histories and dependents.",
      "\u201cYou have to specify what you are going to be doing in order to be able to meet statutory requirements for having access to return information,\u201d Olson said, who herself did not have access to the IDRS in her role at the time. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019s a crime to access it.\u201d",
      "Normally, IRS systems containing taxpayer data are secure and information is locked down, said Amy O\u2019Hara, executive director of the Georgetown University Research Data Center, which deals with federal statistics. She said breaches are rare, usually personnel-related and punished quickly.",
      "Under current laws, DOGE staffers would have to meet the same requirements to access the IDRS as any other contractor or employee, O\u2019Hara said.",
      "\u201cThere are these checks and balances in place to ensure the integrity of the systems,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just need to make sure that that integrity holds.\u201d"

      "Former Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe called for \"peaceful civil disobedience\" and \"no kings\" Thursday in the wake of his highly publicized arrest at a Southern California city council meeting earlier this week.",
      "Kluwe was taken into custody Tuesday night after appearing at a Huntington Beach City Council meeting and labeling President Donald Trump and his \"Make America Great Again\" supporters a fascist movement.",
      "\"I appreciate everyone\u2019s messages of support, I\u2019m trying to get through all my mentions but as you can imagine, it\u2019s been a bit of a busy day,\" Kluwe wrote to his Bluesky followers Thursday. \"Remember \u2014 peaceful civil disobedience, and no kings, no tyrants. Not ever.\"",
      "Kluwe, who punted in Minnesota for eight seasons, took the podium during Tuesday night's public comment section of the Huntington Beach City Council meeting, expressing his opposition to the city honoring Trump.",
      "A city commission approved the purchase and installation of a  plaque at the library with stacked words: Magical, Alluring, Galvanizing, Adventurous \u2014 thus spelling MAGA, the polarizing slogan used by Trump and his supporters.",
      "Kluwe said he's been living in Huntington Beach for 15 years and opposes the spending of public funds on the apparent Trump tribute.",
      "The former player ran through a long list of topics on which he takes issue with Trump, including rights for transgender people; academic freedom; cutbacks at the Federal Aviation Administration \"while planes are crashing\"; \"firing the people overseeing our nuclear arsenal\"; \"firing military veterans and those serving them at the VA\"; and a White House effort to disband the Education Department.",
      "\u201c\u2018MAGA\u2019 is profoundly corrupt, unmistakably anti-democracy and, most importantly, \u2018MAGA\u2019 is explicitly a Nazi movement,\u201d he said in video of the meeting, drawing applause from the audience. \u201cYou may have replaced a swastika with a red hat, but that\u2019s what it is.\u201d",
      "He then added: \u201cI will now engage in the time-honored American tradition of peaceful civil disobedience.\u201d",
      "The video then showed the 6-foot-4 Kluwe take several steps toward council members before he was met by a police officer, then at least two more rushed to him.",
      "Kluwe did not appear to resist his arrest. He was placed face down and handcuffed before going limp, forcing three police officers to carry him out of the chamber.",
      "The 43-year-old former football player has been a longtime, outspoken proponent of LGBTQ rights. Kluwe urged others who oppose Trump and his agenda to do the same.",
      "Trump called himself a \u201cking\u201d Wednesday for trying to prevent New York from imposing tolls on cars entering Manhattan to raise funds for mass transit infrastructure upgrades.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m never going to ask someone to do something I\u2019m not willing to do myself,\u201d Kluwe told City News Service on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I learned from football \u2014 basic leadership. You\u2019ve got to prove you\u2019re willing to do it too.\u201d",
      "Kluwe grew up in nearby Seal Beach before moving on to UCLA, where he graduated in 2005 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science.",
      "He said the protest cost him about four hours behind bars.",
      "\u201cA lot of it was paperwork,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Huntington Beach Police Department was very professional and courteous. I have no complaints about how I was treated.\u201d"

    "title": "With eggs prices at record highs, why isn't the U.S. using a bird flu vaccine in poultry?",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:35:01 GMT",
    "summary": "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins is expected \u201cin the coming days\u201d to announce a new strategy for fighting the bird flu outbreak.",
    "story": [
      "The United States has so far avoided vaccination as a strategy to eradicating bird flu in poultry, instead relying on culling infected flocks. With the escalating outbreak driving up egg prices to record highs, could that approach soon change?",
      "And as millions of flocks continue to die, why aren\u2019t vaccines being given already?",
      "The Agriculture Department on Friday gave its strongest sign yet that the federal government could be shifting its strategy. The agency said it granted a conditional license for an H5N2 bird flu vaccine designed to work against variants of the H5N1 virus, the strain circulating among herds of dairy cows and domestic poultry in the U.S. H5N2 belongs to a family of bird flu viruses which includes H5N1.",
      "The license to Zoetis, a New Jersey-based vaccine manufacturer, is an acknowledgment that the vaccine has met the USDA\u2019s requirements for safety and \u201creasonable expectation\u201d of effectiveness, a company spokesperson said.",
      "However, the USDA has stopped short of allowing doses to be widely distributed. An agency spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the conditional license doesn\u2019t mean that it has approved the vaccine for commercial use or that poultry farmers can purchase it at this time.",
      "\u201cThis is simply a normal step in the research and development phase, not in the implementation of a vaccine strategy,\u201d the USDA spokesperson said.",
      "Still, experts say, the move suggests that federal health officials may be considering other tools, such as a vaccine, to address the ongoing crisis. In December, the government expanded testing of the nation\u2019s milk supply.",
      "As of Tuesday, more than 160 million chicken, turkey, goose and other infected birds have been euthanized, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There have been outbreaks in at least 972 dairy herds across 16 states, although culling livestock isn\u2019t a typical practice as they can recover from the disease.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins is expected \u201cin the coming days\u201d to announce a new strategy to fight the virus, a USDA spokesperson said, without commenting on whether vaccines would play a role.",
      "If the federal government were to vaccinate poultry, it could come with a number of complications, notably that many U.S. trading partners won\u2019t accept exports from countries that allow vaccinations, said Carol Cardona, an expert on avian health at the University of Minnesota.",
      "\u201cWhen we talk about poultry, we\u2019re talking about ducks and turkeys and chickens, and that\u2019s the chickens we eat and the egg laying chickens, and they\u2019re all grouped together in terms of trade restrictions,\u201d she said.",
      "The broiler industry \u2014 the agriculture sector responsible for raising chicken specifically for meat consumption \u2014 would likely be the most impacted, Cardona said. It represents about 96% of the poultry industry, she said, and has huge export markets. The broiler industry provides $449.5 billion in economic activity and $36.7 billion in government revenue, according to a report from the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association, an industry trade group.",
      "\u201cThe broiler industry, in their own interest, would say, \u2018No, no vaccine until there are no egg layers left,\u201d Cardona said. \u201cIt\u2019s an extreme position, but they could.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s more, the federal government and manufacturers will still need to make enough vaccines to immunize poultry farms across the U.S. The government,\u00a0 Cardona said, got burned in 2015 when it authorized a bird flu vaccine to be placed in the nation\u2019s stockpile, but was never used.\u00a0In January, the USDA said it would begin to rebuild its stockpile of bird flu vaccines for poultry.",
      "\u201cSo if the announcement comes, we\u2019re ready to vaccinate, people have to put in orders,\u201d she said.",
      "Daniel Perez, a poultry medicine expert at the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine who studies how influenza viruses jump from animals to humans, said he\u2019s concerned that vaccinating poultry could facilitate silent spread, where transmission occurs in asymptomatic birds.",
      "\u201cVaccines can sometimes be seen as kind of a double-edged sword,\u201d Perez said. \u201cThey can control the disease, but at the same time, they may not be able to control infections. So vaccinated animals may show no signs of the disease.\u201d",
      "As is seen with vaccinated humans, not every vaccinated bird will be protected or have the same level of protection as the next, he said.",
      "\u201cIf a high path virus enters into a facility of vaccinated chickens, there could be these low levels of viral replication that eventually promote the emergence of strains with mutations,\u201d Perez said, \u201cand the effect of those mutations could be a virus with increased host range, a virus that can infect other species,\u201d including humans.",
      "Cardona said it\u2019s \u201ctheoretical\u201d but it\u2019s possible there could be vaccinated birds with \u201csilent infections.\u201d",
      "However, she noted that the country has a lot more resources to manage a scenario like that than it previously had.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot more labs and a lot more testing capacity than we had back when those were theorized to be problems,\u201d Cardona said.",
      "Another consideration is that people who vaccinate the birds \u2014 likely farmworkers \u2014 will likely need adequate protection to make sure they\u2019re not infected by the virus, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.",
      "Public health experts, he said, have been concerned about the potential health risks of poultry and dairy workers who work in close proximity to animals and often in dirty environments.",
      "Perez said there\u2019s currently ongoing research to provide mass vaccination of poultry via drinking water, reducing human exposure.",
      "Another idea is vaccinating the farmworkers against the virus as well, Schaffner said.",
      "\u201cHazmat suits and face shields and gloves \u2014 things which work pretty well in the hospital when you\u2019re taking care of a patient \u2014 don\u2019t work so well when you\u2019re out on the farm,\u201d he said.",
      "Perez noted that influenza vaccines for poultry and humans aren\u2019t highly effective, and typically use an older technology that takes months to produce doses.",
      "\u201cI would say we should use this crisis as an incentive to do more research on improving vaccines,\u201d he said."

      "Months before his remains were discovered last week, his family requested two wellness checks with police in Canandaigua, New York, his mother, Linda Nordquist, told NBC News in a phone call.",
      "She added that her son expressed that he was in danger to local social services and she questioned if more could have been done to intervene before his killing.",
      "\"Sam may be alive today if they would have done their jobs,\" she said through tears.",
      "The Canandaigua Police Department's chief of police, Mathew Nielsen, said in a phone call that none of his roughly 30 officers spoke with the family prior to Sam's death. He suggested that the family is confused about which law enforcement agency they called to perform the wellness checks.",

      "The Ontario County Department of Social Services did not immediately return requests for comment.",
      "'He didn't sound like himself'",
      "Linda Nordquist said her son left her home in Oakdale, Minnesota, in September to visit his former partner Precious Arzuaga. Arzuaga lived at Paddy's Lodge, a motel in Canandaigua, New York, in Ontario County. The pair met online several month\u2019s earlier, she recalled, and spoke on the phone daily.",

      "Arzuaga, 38, is now one of five suspects in Nordquist's homicide case.",
      "Nordquist booked a flight to be home in Minnesota in early October, Linda Nordquist said. When he didn't come home or answer texts or phone calls, she requested a wellness check with police.",
      "Soon after, she received a call from her son and Arzuaga assuring her Sam was fine and that he wanted to stay to work on the pair's relationship. In the months since, Linda Nordquist said her calls with her son became infrequent.",
      "\"He didn't sound like himself,\" she said. \"It's like he was being coached what to say.\"",
      "Plans to escape, a missed appointment",
      "Then on Dec. 4, she received a distressing email from Ontario County Department of Social Services.",
      "\"I'm working with your son Sam. He wanted me to reach you,\" the email reads, according to a screenshot of the exchange. \"If you can please contact me as soon as your get this email.\"",
      "Linda Nordquist recalled that the DSS agent said her son recently visited their offices and confirmed her worries. He expressed that Arzuaga was controlling his cell phone use, that he wanted to come home and was trying to come up with an \"escape plan,\" the DSS said, according to Linda.",
      "He was supposed to return to the DSS office on Dec. 19, but never showed up, Linda Nordquist said.",
      "\"My problem is that if Sam said this, lock the doors and call the police. All these offices have doors on it. Lock the door, call the police and leave Sam there,\" she said.",
      "A wellness check and conflicting stories",
      "When she next spoke to her son over the phone, he told her he was \"fine,\" but she said she feared Arzuaga was listening to the call. The last time she heard from her son was by text on Jan. 31. After days went by without hearing from him, Linda Nordquist and her daughter Kayla Nordquist requested another wellness check with police on Feb. 9.",
      "Police told the family that Arzuaga's son answered the motel room's door and claimed to not know who Nordquist was, Linda Nordquist said. The police went back to the motel to speak with Arzuaga the same day, who claimed she and Nordquist broke up and that he left a few weeks ago, Linda Nordquist added.",
      "Unconvinced, Linda and Kayla Nordquist asked New York State Police Troop E to file a missing person's report. They said a state trooper declined.",
      "\"She said I need to stop watching so much TV, something about it not being a true crime episode,\" Kayla said. \"I need to stop watching so much TV and that they don't pass out missing people flyers.\"",
      "New York State Police did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "'Mom's here. Mom's looking.'",
      "The mother and daughter then went to their local police in Oakdale, Minnesota, to file a national missing person\u2019s report, they said. That prompted police to investigate, they said.",
      "They wondered if his identity as a trans person played a role in law enforcement's response.",

    "story": [
      "An Idaho judge denied several defense motions filed by Bryan Kohberger's defense team to suppress key DNA and other evidence that named him the suspect in the 2022 murders of four students near the University of Idaho.",
      "In a major blow to Kohberger's defense, Ada County Judge Steven Hippler\u00a0issued multiple new rulings Wednesday that will allow for cell phone and email records, surveillance footage, Kohberger's past Amazon purchases and DNA evidence to be used in trial.",
      "Kohberger was arrested in December 2022 and charged with murder in the November 2022 deaths of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Kernodle\u2019s boyfriend, Ethan Chapin, 20.",
      "A big win for prosecutors was the judge's move to allow DNA evidence found on the button of a knife sheath left near the body of two victims at the murder scene.",
      "Investigators had run the DNA sample through public ancestry websites to build a list of possible suspects.",
      "In the investigation, authorities learned Kohberger had driven from Pullman, Washington, to his parents' home in Monroe County, Pennsylvania. Law enforcement conducted a trash pull there and obtained DNA that tied Kohberger to the knife sheath. That DNA later proved to be a statistical match\u00a0to a swab taken from Kohberger\u2019s cheek taken in 2022.",
      "The defense had argued that law enforcement violated Kohberger\u2019s constitutional rights by failing to secure a warrant before conducting the investigative genetic genealogy and before the trash pull.",
      "The judge found that there was no constitutional violation as Kohberger allegedly \u201cexposed his DNA to the public by leaving it on the sheath, thus forfeiting any reasonable expectation of privacy in the DNA left behind\u201d and \u201cthere is no reasonable expectation of privacy in DNA found at a crime scene which is subsequently analyzed to identify an unknown suspect.\u201d",
      "Similarly, Hippler said that investigators were justified in searching through trash outside Kohberger\u2019s parents home after they zeroed in on him. Hippler said, \u201cby throwing away item of trash containing his DNA, defendant cannot object to testing of that DNA.\u201d",
      "In a hearing last month, Hippler seemed skeptical of tossing out DNA evidence saying: \u201cwhen there\u2019s a DNA match between the DNA and the sheath and Mr. Kohbeger, isn\u2019t that probable cause every day and twice on Sunday?\u201d",
      "In another filing, Hippler denied the defense\u2019s motion for a Franks hearing, which is when the defense challenges validity of information used by law enforcement to obtain a search warrant.",
      "The defense claimed law enforcement \"intentionally or recklessly misrepresented material facts in their probable cause affidavits for search warrant applications.\"",
      "A hearing was held in January on \"the alleged omission of information regarding Defendant's identification through investigative genetic genealogy,\" according to one of the filings. The judge found that the warrants are not invalid based on that omission, because that information \u201cwould have only bolstered probable cause for the searches.\u201d",
      "In that Franks motion, the defense also argued law enforcement misrepresented statements made by a roommate of the victims who was in her own bedroom at the time of the murders.",
      "The judge said that the defense\u2019s challenge \u201cmay be fodder for cross-examination,\u201d but noted her accounts in interviews with law enforcement were consistent. The judge further found no evidence of misrepresented material in the application for search warrants.",
      "Another motion asked Hippler to dismiss use of digital evidence investigators collected from AT&T, Google, Apple, Amazon and a USB drive, which the defense claimed violated Kohberger\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. Judge Hippler ruled that the evidence was lawfully obtained through search warrants and because Kohberger relinquished any privacy interest in the subpoenaed records due to third-party doctrine.",
      "The rulings were praised by the Goncalves family.",
      "\"All the motions to suppress and Franks motion have been denied! It\u2019s always a double edge sword waiting. You want the right decisions to be made but you also want them to be made quickly. We are thankful to the Court for a timely decision and appreciate the work prosecution has put in thus far. In the big picture of life justice is just moments away,\" the family said.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 19:26:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Kash Patel, a longtime loyalist to President Donald Trump, was confirmed by the Senate Thursday to serve as the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Kash Patel, a longtime loyalist to President Donald Trump, was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation \u2014 an agency he has talked about drastically restructuring\u00a0while echoing\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0claims of the\u00a0\u201cweaponization\u201d of the bureau\u2019s powers in its Capitol riot investigations and other recent cases.",
      "Patel was opposed by a pair of Republican senators: Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Maine's Susan Collins. But he won support from every other Republican, including Sen. Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, who had opposed some of Trump's other nominees. The final vote was 51-49, with all Senate Democrats opposing Patel.",
      "Patel's confirmation comes at time of significant turmoil and turnover at the FBI. Since Trump took office a month ago, an Elon Musk affiliate was among those brought into the bureau, sparking worries about partisan political figures taking the reins of the powerful law enforcement agency. The head of the Washington Field Office \u2014 which oversaw the sprawling Jan. 6 probe \u2014 was forced out, as were six of the FBI\u2019s most senior executives and multiple heads of FBI field offices around the country.",
      "Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll sparred with Trump-appointed Justice Department superiors over an order that he said would ultimately help them fire FBI agents involved in Jan. 6 cases. The FBI ultimately handed over the names of FBI employees who worked on Jan. 6 cases as requested, and Trump has said he will fire \u201csome\u201d FBI personnel who worked on Capitol riot cases.",
      "Altogether, it adds up to what many within the FBI see as the largest crisis facing the organization since the Watergate era. It stems in large part from FBI investigations into Trump himself, including two separate felony cases that were dropped when Trump was re-elected: one involving Trump's handling of classified documents, and the other involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.",
      "Patel previously worked on Capitol Hill and in the first Trump administration, after working as a federal prosecutor in Washington and a federal public defender in Florida. He was considered to take over the FBI during the first Trump administration, but then-Attorney General Bill Barr, among others, vehemently opposed the plan, saying that Patel was unqualified.",
      "Patel, a firebrand who appeared on a broad array of conservative media shows and has spoken about his desire to \"come after the people in the media,\" has attempted to walk back some of his more pugnacious comments from his podcast appearances.",
      "At his confirmation hearing in late January, Patel distanced himself from Trump's sweeping pardons of Capitol rioters, saying he disagreed with the commutations of individuals who assaulted law enforcement officers on Jan. 6. Democratic senators also confronted Patel about his repeated false contentions that the 2020 election was stolen.",
      "Patel has a close relationship with a network of conservative former FBI agents who were pushed out over the past several years, one of whom said he was \"screaming to the heavens\" when Trump nominated Patel.",
      "Julie Kelly, a conservative commentator who described herself as a friend of Patel's, predicted that Patel would \"do what needs to be done\" at the FBI, \u201cwhich is not just dismantle this agency from the top headquarters down to 56 FBI field offices, but also hold accountable those agents who have used their unaccountable power to weaponize the most powerful law enforcement agency in the country against the political foes of the regime.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 19:22:39 GMT",
    "summary": "DOGE wants access to filers\u2019 data, and the commerce secretary says Trump wants to scrap the IRS. But filing a return remains mandatory \u2014 the earlier the better, tax advisers say.",
    "story": [
      "This tax season is rife with uncertainty, as the world\u2019s richest person looks to shake up the Internal Revenue Service and the commerce secretary calls to eliminate it \u2014 but filers still need to carry on as usual, tax experts say.",
      "\u201cWhatever they\u2019re going to have to do to make their tax return accurate and true, they have to do,\u201d said Christina Wease, director of the Alvin. L. Storrs Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic at Michigan State University.",
      "\u201cIn the face of uncertainty,\u201d tax filers should consider getting their returns in as soon as they can, ideally electronically, said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \u201cThis was the case a few years ago with the pandemic,\u201d and the advice still holds true, she said \u2014 echoing a common refrain among tax advisers even in uneventful tax seasons.",
      "The current season has already been anything but.",
      "Alina Habba, an adviser to President Donald Trump, said at a conservative conference Thursday, \u201cWe\u2019re firing a bunch of the IRS today, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d Her remarks followed Associated Press reporting that thousands of probationary employees are slated to be cut this week.",
      "Late Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News\u2019 Jesse Watters that Trump wants to \u201cabolish\u201d the IRS \u201cand let all the outsiders pay\u201d via trade policies including tariffs (which tax American importers, not foreign businesses or governments). Watters then told his more than 3 million followers on X that their \u201ctax rates, interest rates, and mortgage rates are going to come hammering down.\u201d",
      "\u201cAbolishing the IRS or even, say, cutting funding to the IRS doesn\u2019t alter our tax system at all,\u201d said Kathleen DeLaney Thomas, a tax law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cOnly Congress could decide to repeal the many statutes in the Internal Revenue Code that provide the framework for our federal tax system.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency initiative is pressing for access to an IRS database containing sensitive taxpayer information, an effort that has drawn a lawsuit alleging privacy and tax law violations. The plaintiffs also claim DOGE\u2019s request poses a potential conflict of interest, since the data could involve tax records and investigations of Musk\u2019s business competitors.",
      "Tax policy and legal experts say much remains to be seen about the extent of any access to filers\u2019 data DOGE may gain and what the group might do with it. Two sections of the IRS tax code protect the confidentiality of returns and prohibit executive branch influence over agency audits and investigations.",
      "\u201cFor decades, since we\u2019ve had these privacy laws enacted by Congress, it\u2019s pretty much just been understood that IRS civil servants handled this data,\u201d Thomas said.",
      "In recent weeks, DOGE has made an aggressive push to slash federal spending and root out purported fraud and abuse across the government. While some of the initiative\u2019s high-profile claims have been called into question or included errors, conservative pundits and administration officials continue to promote them.",
      "\u201cWaste, fraud, and abuse have been deeply entrenched in our broken system for far too long,\u201d said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields, reiterating a statement he provided Sunday to NBC News. \u201cIt takes direct access to the system to identify and fix it.\u201d",
      "The IRS didn\u2019t respond to NBC News' requests for comment.",
      "In the meantime, taxpayers are still staring down the usual April 15 deadline to file their returns and have few ways to protect themselves from any potential fallout from non-IRS staffers\u2019 possible involvement.",
      "\u201cWhat DOGE now has meant for the IRS is a lot of uncertainty and a lot of concern,\u201d Holtzblatt said. \u201cThat uncertainty and concern will be spilling over to the rest of us during this filing season, and particularly those of us who have concerns with how our tax information is used.\u201d",
      "But she emphasized that filing a correct and complete return isn\u2019t optional. If taxpayers are concerned about DOGE employees potentially seeing their bank account information, they could opt not to receive refunds via direct deposit. The IRS also offers checks by mail, but that could take longer.",
      "Mary Clements Evans, a certified financial planner in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, has been advising clients not to file their returns by mail either, citing the reports of workforce cuts at the IRS. \u201cThose paper filings, they\u2019re going to require people looking at them,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the great things the IRS has done over the years is they\u2019ve automated the processes.\u201d",
      "Evans said she\u2019s now fielding clients\u2019 concerns about how changes at the agency might affect returns this year. Many taxpayers rely on the IRS for support, partly because of an ongoing shortage of certified public accountants, and she said she\u2019s worried that staff firings could leave filers with fewer free resources. But she echoed other tax experts in saying it remains a good idea to file sooner rather than later.",
      "\u201cAs far as the vast majority of individuals who are filing, they can go ahead and file,\u201d Evans said.",
      "Holtzblatt suggested using the IRS\u2019 new Direct File tool since it\u2019s less labor-intensive. The free filing system was piloted last year and has since expanded to 25 states.",
      "For fiscal year 2023, the IRS processed nearly 271.5 million tax returns and other forms, and issued $659.1 billion in returns, according to agency data. Taxpayers submit a wide variety of personal information in those documents, all of which helps calculate their tax liability. IRS employees then view taxpayers\u2019 returns to verify their filing status, exemptions and deductions before administering a refund if due. If something seems off, or if a taxpayer is selected for a random audit, the IRS will reach out via mail to request further information.",
      "The IRS database that DOGE is trying to access, called the Integrated Data Retrieval System, contains a slew of data that\u2019s central to this process. IRS employees are allowed to access it on a need-to-know basis, said Nina Olson, who served as the national taxpayer advocate at the IRS from 2001 to 2019. Agency staffers, usually auditors or case advocates, can use the IDRS to pull up individuals\u2019 tax returns, which can include from their Social Security numbers and income to details about their health histories and dependents.",
      "\u201cYou have to specify what you are going to be doing in order to be able to meet statutory requirements for having access to return information,\u201d Olson said, who herself did not have access to the IDRS in her role at the time. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019s a crime to access it.\u201d",
      "Normally, IRS systems containing taxpayer data are secure and information is locked down, said Amy O\u2019Hara, executive director of the Georgetown University Research Data Center, which deals with federal statistics. She said breaches are rare, usually personnel-related and punished quickly.",
      "Under current laws, DOGE staffers would have to meet the same requirements to access the IDRS as any other contractor or employee, O\u2019Hara said.",
      "\u201cThere are these checks and balances in place to ensure the integrity of the systems,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just need to make sure that that integrity holds.\u201d"

And Buck's really going to be put into that place of feeling abandoned, and he's going to react to it in a really \u2014 and I don't say this about myself, I say this about the story \u2014 a really cute way, that I think will go down very well with viewers of the show.",
      "I guess if I was to think about it, I don't think they necessarily would have been really in contact. You know, I feel like maybe that would feel like going around Eddie, or going behind Eddie's back, maybe. Or even if Eddie was aware of it, maybe just making Eddie jealous, because Eddie can't have that relationship with him. So I think Buck has kind of not tried to intervene too much in the situation, or not insert himself into the situation, because as much as he is a part of their life, you know, that is his son, and I don't think you would want to overstep too much. So, yeah, I actually don't think that Buck is in contact with Christopher and that he's kind of letting Eddie handle his business and just being there at the ready if needed.",
      "I think we've seen \u2014\u00a0and obviously Buck is also post-breakup, you know, he has a lot of things and he seems to just kind of be running, not from them, but through them. Keeping himself busy, whether it be the baking, whether it be work \u2014\u00a0just keeping things happening so that maybe he doesn't have too much time to stop and think, which, you know, always catches up with you eventually. But I kind of feel like that's where we find Buck at the moment. He's just keeping himself occupied so that the silence and the thoughts don't creep in.",
      "I have experienced that in some of the earlier seasons. I think it was hard to quiet that noise. And then once you read one thing or another, it's difficult to not let it seep in, you know? But I've kind of found the balance, and I don't think, as an actor on the show, I don't think you should be involved in fandom of the show, and I don't think you should read fandom of the show. I think your job is your job, and you have to make the thing, and then it gets given over to the fans to do whatever they want with it. And so, actually finding that boundary between the two has been really, really healthy for me.",
      "Season Eight, this season. It's definitely a newer thing for me. But, you know, listen, anytime I'm on a social media app, and anything \"9-1-1\" or anything Oliver Stark-related comes up, I gleefully (click) \"not interested in this post\" and get it out of my algorithm. And it's really helped me just kind of think more positively about it. So, yeah, it's a newer thing, but something that I'm really happy that I made a step towards.",
      "Episode 11 I think is really special. Not even just because of story, but one of our own directed it. One of the cast directed it, which is the first time that's happened on the show. So that was a really special experience for me. Not me the director, me the actor on the show. It's not me.",
      "I think I'm really excited for that to air, just because, I just think it's a really special moment, and it's this particular actor's first time doing it. So, yeah, just, it felt like a big moment.",
      "I think so. I\u2019m pretty sure it'll be revealed ahead of time, but I think they are keeping it secret for now."

      "Another added, \u201cNorth West was not good in The Lion King. And her family/production did her no favors in letting her go on anyway. Not all kids are good at all things and they need to be taught that. There were likely dozens of experienced kids that should have been cast.\"",
      "Kardashian anticipated the backlash in the Season 6, Episode 3 of \u201cThe Kardashians.\"",

      "The start of the episode looks into how North got the opportunity \u2014 and why Kardashian was hesitant to let her accept it. Disney approached the family about North's participation, according to the episode.",
      "\"I just can't decide,\" Kardashian said on the phone with her sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian. She said she was \"worried about\" people being mean.",
      "\"I'm really torn on if we should let her do this or not. \"She's not a singer. She raps. She's been on a stage with her dad for sure. As a mom, especially putting her child on a platform with a lot of opinions \u2014 it's something to really, really think about,\" she said.",
      "North, however, expressed her interest. \"Right away, she was like, 'Please, Mom, I want to do it,'\" Kardashian recalled her saying. She finally let her do it, saying she \"believes in her.\"",

      "The singers say they've already looked on social media and seen the fans comment, \u201cOh my God, I hope they fly in!\u201d",
      "Carter says they\u2019re \u201cnot committing\u201d to entering the same way, with Dorough adding in regards to the surfboards, \u201cWe don\u2019t know where they are.\u201d",
      "According to the group, they joke that Littrell has all the surfboards \u201cat his house.\u201d",
      "While Richardson notes that they had one or two surfboards in their storage from their \u201cancient archives,\u201d they hope to \u201cexplore Sphere to its maximum potential\u201d and will run tests on what\u2019s capable in the venue over the next couple of weeks.",
      "But there will be subtle differences, or \u201cupgrades,\u201d they say.",
      "The group is just in the beginning stages of crafting \u201cInto the Millennium.\u201d Richardson says the set list is being curated \u201cwithin the next few days.\u201d",
      "They will definitely highlight \u201cMillennium\u201d and sprinkle in some of their favorite songs from their other albums, plus \u201ca few deep cuts,\u201d greatest hits and their new song \u201cHey,\u201d he adds.",
      "With presale and general tickets going on sale, one has to ask: What's the best seat in the house?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s really no bad seat. It\u2019s just a different experience. So if you want a true, more concert-like experience, you can be on the floor,\u201d Richardson says. \u201cWe saw the Eagles there, and we were kind of just up above the floor in the lower bowl, looking straight at the screen.\u201d",
      "Depending on where you sit, he says, it will be a different experience because of Sphere\u2019s unique screens. One thing that\u2019s certain, Richardson says: The sound will be \u201camazing no matter where you\u2019re sitting.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s just a different experience on the floor, it\u2019s different than sitting back and taking everything in. If you\u2019re on the floor, you\u2019re looking right at the artist there, but then you\u2019re also going to be wanting to go, \u2018Wow,\u2019\u201d Richardson adds, looking all around.",
      "McLean notes that if you don\u2019t look around, \u201cyou\u2019re going to miss something.\u201d",
      "So what\u2019s the best option? Littrell sums it up: \u201cSo you just have to see it a couple times, two or three times.\u201d",
      "'Millennium 2.0' and the unreleased version of  'I Want It That Way'",
      "The Backstreet Boys reunited with Daly during a Feb. 14 appearance on TODAY, where they also announced \u201cMillennium 2.0.\u201d",
      "After their \u201cShow Me the Meaning of Being Lonely\u201d performance, during which Craig Melvin sang his heart out, the album\u2019s track list appeared on Spotify. Among the newer additions are \u201cI\u2019ll Be There For You,\u201d \u201cYou Wrote the Book on Love,\u201d \u201cIf You Knew What I Knew\u201d and \u201cMy Heart Stays With You,\u201d sung predominately by Dorough.",
      "Longtime fans have heard these songs on deluxe and imported versions of their CDs, but they will now be available to stream.",
      "Their new song \u201cHey,\u201d Littrell tells TODAY.com, was originally created for their ninth studio album, 2019's \u201cDNA.\u201d At the time, the song didn\u2019t quite match sonically with the rest of the album.",
      "Littrell adds, \u201cWe were trying to cram it in last minute, and it just didn\u2019t work. So we were like, \u2018Hey, this is a gem. It\u2019s special.\u2019 We wanted to hold on to it and the time came around, this announcement happened, it was like, \u2018Oh my gosh, what better way to present a brand-new song?\u2019 So it turned out perfect.\u201d",
      "Fans will also get to hear the alternate version of \u201cI Want It That Way\u201d that the group says \u201cmakes sense,\u201d a nod to fans\u2019 questions over the years about what the original song actually means. Instead of \u201ctell me why,\u201d the lyrics are switched up with versions of \u201cno goodbyes,\u201d \u201cno more lies\u201d and \u201cthat is why.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the rhyming scheme, it doesn\u2019t have the feel. You\u2019re going to understand why we chose to go with the other one,\u201d Richardson explains, with McLean adding that \u201csome of the lyrics are the same, but the majority is completely different.\u201d",
      "A look to the future and Grammy aspirations",
      "Dorough recalls a moment when they first started as a group and were touring high schools.",
      "\u201cThe microphones went out, we sang a cappella and still won all those kids over,\u201d Dorough says. \u201cRight from the beginning, we instilled that we can get through anything.\u201d",
      "With almost 32 years of history, the Backstreet pride is alive and well. Their accomplishments include millions of records sold, a slew of awards, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the distinction as the first pop band at Sphere, but the group is still holding out for one specific accolade.",
      "\u201cIt would be an honor for us to get established into our career with having a Grammy and the acknowledgement of that,\u201d Dorough says. \u201cThat\u2019s something I think we\u2019ve always had on our bucket list. And we\u2019ve been nominated, what, nine times? Every time we get it, we always get beat out by somebody about 30 years into the industry before us. So we\u2019re getting closer to that 30 years now, to maybe get one ourselves.\u201d",
      "According to the Grammys\u2019 website, the group has been nominated for eight awards. Their last nomination was in 2019 for best pop duo/group performance for their song \u201cDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart\u201d from \u201cDNA.\u201d Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper took the win for \u201cShallow.\u201d",
      "Despite the loss, McLean says, \u201cIt\u2019s just been this steady incline for us, and it\u2019s just been a blessing that we\u2019re still doing this 32 years later.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have the best fans in the world that keep wanting us to come back,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd it just seems to happen organically, that opportunities like Sphere reignite this flame. They inspire us and it gets us excited again.\u201d"

      "In the show, doctors find a rare cancer \u2013 called pleomorphic sarcoma undifferentiated \u2014 in Milla\u2019s arm. Rather than follow their recommendations and amputate, the 22-year-old opts for an alternate medical regimen involving juice and coffee enemas. She builds a career on the idea that she healed her cancer holistically. It seems to work for a while, until the cancer comes back. This time, the spread is fatal and Milla dies.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the facts and fiction of Milla.",
      "Who is Milla Blake based on in real life?",
      "\u201cMilla is an amalgamation of wellness influencers at the time,\u201d Debnam-Carey tells\u00a0TODAY.com. \u201cWe created Milla as her own thing. That was what was so great about it \u2026 we could boost her up so that she could be going toe-to-toe with Belle.\u201d",
      "She says the character was inspired in part by\u00a0Jessica Ainscough, the editor of a teen magazine who was diagnosed with epithelioid sarcoma, a rare cancer, when she was 22, and nicknamed\u00a0herself\u00a0\u201cThe Wellness Warrior.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Ainscough and Milla share similarities. In Ainscough\u2019s now-deleted blog post on her five-year diagnosis anniversary in 2013, viewed on the Internet Archive, Ainscough remembered hearing of a sacrcoma diagnosis.",
      "\u201c'The results have told us that you have a rare type of cancer called epithelioid sarcoma.\u2019 I went numb. \u2018It\u2019s not treatable with chemotherapy or radiation, and there\u2019s a good chance we will have to amputate your arm but this disease is essentially terminal,\u2019\u201d\u00a0she wrote.",

      "\u201cIt is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to \u2018fix\u2019 her negative reputation which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions. These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloane with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Tensions between the Trump administration and the Ukrainian government had been escalating behind the scenes for the past week before\u00a0they fully\u00a0erupted into public view Wednesday.",
      "Privately, Ukrainian officials were alarmed after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was told his meetings with top Trump administration officials could be canceled if he didn\u2019t swiftly agree to certain demands. They worried about mixed messages, in public and private, from senior Trump advisers about whether the possibility of Ukraine\u2019s joining NATO would be on the table in negotiations with Russia to end the war. And they were concerned when Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told them in a closed-door meeting that the United States may withdraw a significant number of its troops from Europe.",
      "From President Donald Trump\u2019s perspective, Zelenskyy was showing resistance to what\u00a0Trump\u00a0views as reasonable asks of a country the United States has set up to receive more than $75 billion in military aid. He found Zelenskyy in no rush to\u00a0make some compromises\u00a0that U.S. and European officials have long conceded in private would be required\u00a0in a peace deal. And he grew incensed over Ukraine\u2019s public complaints about being excluded from talks between the United States and Russia about ending the war after Zelenskyy met several times with some of Trump\u2019s top advisers.",
      "\u201cThere is frustration,\u201d a White House official said, accusing Zelenskyy and some other European leaders of trying to \u201cdenigrate\u201d Trump\u2019s peace efforts.",
      "This article is based on interviews with more than a dozen U.S. and European officials and other people with knowledge of private meetings and discussions between and within the Trump administration and the Ukrainian government. All of them spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal conversations.",
      "Trump lashed out Tuesday, blaming Ukraine for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s\u00a0decision to invade\u00a0and calling for new elections in Kyiv. After Zelenskyy countered that Trump is peddling Russian \u201cdisinformation,\u201d Trump\u00a0ramped up his rhetoric by calling Zelenskyy, the elected Ukrainian leader, a \u201cdictator\u201d who \u201chas done a terrible job.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy was elected in 2019, and elections scheduled for last year were suspended because of the war.",
      "The escalating back-and-forth has raised concerns in the United States, including among some of Trump\u2019s Republican allies.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis,\u00a0R-N.C., told NBC News the war of words between Trump and Zelenskyy \u201cfeeds into Putin\u2019s hand.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s approach",
      "After Trump won the November election, Ukraine\u2019s Republican supporters in Congress and lobbyists hired by Kyiv in Washington advised Zelenskyy to demonstrate that his government was ready to compromise in peace talks and try to convince Trump that Russia was the main obstacle to any settlement, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.",
      "\u201cThe key was to convince Trump that Ukraine was not the problem,\u201d one of those people said.",
      "Putin has had little interest in negotiating a peace deal \u2014 and\u00a0intelligence from the United States and allies\u00a0indicates\u00a0that his views are unchanged\u00a0and that he eventually wants to control all of Ukraine. But\u00a0Zelenskyy\u2019s government recognized that Trump was skeptical of its cause and\u00a0that\u00a0he had a track record of avoiding criticism of Russia, two of the people with knowledge of the matter said.",
      "Zelenskyy sought to show his government was flexible. With NATO membership a distant prospect, though the United States hadn\u2019t declared that publicly, Zelenskyy suggested, for instance, that European countries could deploy troops to Ukraine as a security guarantee in a postwar arrangement.",
      "His approach seemed to be working.",
      "Trump delivered some harsh rhetoric about Russia, threatening Moscow with tariffs, sanctions and taxes on the sale of Russian goods to the United States and other countries if Putin didn\u2019t negotiate an end to the war. He also tapped retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, who has been sympathetic to Kyiv, as his Ukraine envoy.",
      "Then last week everything changed.",
      "Putin freed a U.S. teacher, Marc Fogel, who was imprisoned in Russia. The move allowed Trump to follow through with a promise he made during the campaign. Steve Witkoff,\u00a0his envoy to the Middle East, met with Putin for three hours while he was in Moscow to retrieve Fogel, Trump said.",
      "The next day, Feb. 12, Trump spoke with Putin, announcing afterward that the two countries would launch negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. Afterward Trump spoke with Zelenskyy.",
      "In announcing\u00a0his\u00a0team that would negotiate with the Russians, Trump left out Kellogg, who was stung, according to a U.S. official familiar with his response. Kellogg is holding meetings in Kyiv but wasn\u2019t among the U.S. officials who met with the Russians in Saudi Arabia this week.",
      "Tensions in Munich",
      "As U.S. and European officials prepared to convene in Brussels and Munich\u00a0last week\u00a0\u2014 in meetings that would coincide with Trump\u2019s announcing his rapprochement with Putin \u2014 some Trump administration officials tried to keep the relationship between Washington and Kyiv from fracturing.",
      "Ahead of Hegseth\u2019s speech in Brussels on Feb. 12, some State Department officials advised his team that he shouldn\u2019t publicly say Ukraine won\u2019t gain membership in NATO\u00a0as part of a peace deal with Russia, according to four administration and congressional officials.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s speech didn\u2019t follow that advice. He departed from a draft prepared earlier in the day to deliver a blunter message about Ukraine\u2019s prospects for NATO membership than originally\u00a0written: \u201cThe United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\u201d he said.",
      "His prepared remarks had said security guarantees for Ukraine \u201cshould not be provided through NATO membership,\u201d according to three U.S. officials familiar with\u00a0them.",
      "Hegseth, who has said his comments about Ukraine\u2019s possible NATO membership were made in coordination with the rest of Trump\u2019s national security team,\u00a0tempered his comments the next day. He insisted \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d in negotiations. And while Trump told reporters Thursday that he hadn\u2019t asked Hegseth to walk back his remarks, he also noted that Hegseth\u2019s tone had gotten \u201ca bit softer.\u201d",
      "At the same time,\u00a0Trump said he thought Hegseth\u2019s\u00a0initial remarks \u201cwere pretty accurate,\u201d further fueling confusion and criticism that the United States was ceding to a key Russian demand before negotiations had even begun.",
      "Privately, Hegseth stunned the Ukrainians when he told them at a meeting with Zelenskyy that the Trump administration is considering drawing down many U.S. forces in Europe as the United States focuses more on the Asia-Pacific region and its border with Mexico, according to five U.S. officials and another person familiar with the meeting.",
      "\u201cYour reporting is 100% false,\u201d\u00a0Pentagon press secretary John Ullyot\u00a0wrote by email in response to a request for comment about Hegseth\u2019s speech, the advice he received from State Department officials and his private remarks about reducing U.S. troops in Europe.",
      "\u201cAt no time was Secretary Hegseth advised by administration officials to avoid casting doubt on NATO membership \u2014 The secretary\u2019s remarks were coordinated with senior members of the president\u2019s national security team, and they supported the message he delivered top to bottom, full stop. In addition, the president himself reinforced Secretary Hegseth\u2019s remarks concerning NATO membership shortly thereafter in his own public comments in the Oval Office,\u201d Ullyot wrote.",
      "Ullyot also said Hegseth \u201cmade no announcement on, nor timeline for, a drawdown of U.S. troops in Europe.\u201d",
      "But Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance delivered a consistent message during their travels last week \u2014 that Europe needs to take more responsibility for its own defense as the Trump administration prioritizes the southern U.S. border and the Indo-Pacific.",
      "One security guarantee the United States is considering as part of a peace deal is to automatically grant Ukraine NATO membership if Russia violates the agreement, four\u00a0U.S. officials said.",
      "Such a provision would be aimed at addressing a key concern for Ukraine and its allies \u2014 that Russia would regroup and invade the country again, the four officials said.\u00a0If Russia were to do that, under the idea the U.S. is considering, Ukraine would bypass a series of steps typically required to attain NATO membership and be welcomed into the alliance,\u00a0the\u00a0officials said.",
      "Other parts of Hegseth\u2019s Brussels speech, which he delivered with Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov sitting just three seats away, also made Kyiv nervous. He said it is \u201can unrealistic objective\u201d that Ukraine will return to its borders before Russia first invaded in 2014 and annexed Crimea, a declaration that was seen as a concession to Russia.",
      "The day of Hegseth\u2019s speech and Trump\u2019s phone calls with Putin and Zelenskyy, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was in Kyiv for a meeting with Zelenskyy that didn\u2019t go well for either side.",
      "Bessent presented Zelenskyy with a document that would give the United States ownership of half of Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals, which are critical to making a variety of technologies.\u00a0Zelenskyy was taken aback by Bessent\u2019s approach.",
      "When Zelenskyy said he needed time to study the proposal, Bessent told him he had an hour to sign it or risk having his upcoming meetings with Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio canceled, according to five U.S. officials and another person with knowledge of the discussion.",
      "The Ukrainians saw those meetings, scheduled\u00a0to happen later that\u00a0week on the sidelines of a security conference in Munich, as critical for understanding Trump\u2019s strategy for peace talks.",
      "Bessent explained to Zelenskyy that an agreement with the Trump administration about rare earth minerals is a critical component of building a strategic partnership between the United States and Ukraine, which ultimately would contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv after a negotiated end to the war.",
      "The Treasury Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Zelenskyy didn\u2019t sign the document. In Munich, Ukrainian officials were initially told Zelenskyy\u2019s meetings with Vance and Rubio were postponed, according to U.S. and European officials and another person briefed on the discussions. They were delayed but ultimately took place.",
      "The rare earth minerals\u00a0agreement\u00a0remains in limbo.",
      "After having initially said the United States and Ukraine are still talking about the proposal, Zelenskyy signaled he won\u2019t agree to the current version because it wouldn\u2019t protect his country enough.",
      "Bessent said Tuesday in an interview with Fox News that he believes Zelenskyy will ultimately sign an agreement with the United States on Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals, saying it would deter future Russian aggression after the end of the war.",
      "The White House official said that \u201cthe Bessent offer is about acknowledging that Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend itself so far was largely contributed to by American taxpayers.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat offer is about recouping some of that,\u201d the official said, \u201cand acknowledging that when there is peace, Ukraine has the potential to grow itself into a stronger economic position, through a partnership with the U.S.\u201d"

    "summary": "Hamas released the bodies of four Israeli hostages on Thursday, including what it says are three members of the Bibas family.",
    "story": [
      "Hamas released the bodies of four Israeli hostages Thursday, parading four black caskets on a stage against a backdrop of propaganda slogans and behind white missiles spattered with red paint bearing the phrase \"they were killed by USA bombs.\"",
      "In what is likely to be one of the defining images of the war in the Gaza Strip, the four caskets sat on a raised platform in front of smiling illustrations of three members of the Bibas family and 84-year-old Oded Lifshitz.",
      "Among the bodies believed to be handed over by Hamas were those of Kfir and Ariel Bibas, the two youngest captives seized in the attack that triggered Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Israel has said that the bodies, the first to be returned under the current ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, will need to undergo forensic testing before authorities can confirm their identities. Lifshitz's family said Thursday that his body had been identified.",
      "Each casket also carried a small photograph of one of the four hostages.",
      "The body of the Bibas children's mother, Shiri, was also handed over, along with that of Lifshitz, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of those still in Hamas captivity.",
      "The handover took place in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, where large crowds gathered and armed Hamas militants in black and camouflage uniforms patrolled the area. The caskets were displayed in front of a large banner that showed a caricature replicating antisemitic tropes of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with vampiric teeth and blood running down his face.",
      "Netanyahu reacted to the release of the deceased hostages in a post on X later Thursday, saying that \"we bow our heads for the heavy loss of our four hostages.\"",
      "\"We are all in pain, a pain that is mixed with rage,\" he said, adding that he planned to return the remaining hostages, \"destroy the murderers and eliminate Hamas.\"",
      "After representatives from Hamas and the Red Cross signed paperwork on a table with a camouflage cover and two Palestinian flags, the caskets were carried into white Red Cross vehicles that then drove them away to be transferred to the Israel Defense Forces and Israel Security Agency.",
      "The children's father, Yarden Bibas, 35, was\u00a0released Feb. 1 under the first phase of the ceasefire deal. He had been held in a different part of Gaza from his wife and children, according to hostages who were with him in captivity and have since been freed.",
      "While all other child hostages were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners during a one-week ceasefire in November 2023, the Bibas family never emerged from Gaza.",
      "On one of the final days of the brief pause in fighting, Hamas released a statement claiming that Shiri Bibas and the children had been killed in an Israeli airstrike, although Israel\u2019s military said the claim could not be confirmed before later acknowledging its fears for the family.",
      "The Hamas leader in Gaza, Khalil al-Hayya, announced Tuesday that the bodies of Shiri Bibas and the two children would be among those returned this week.",
      "He also announced that four of the remaining living captives would be released Saturday, in addition to two others who have been held in the Gaza Strip for about a decade.",
      "The Israeli prime minister\u2019s office confirmed it had reached an agreement on the releases during negotiations held in Cairo last week, but refrained from naming any of the hostages.",
      "Israel had long braced to learn the fate of Kfir Bibas, who\u00a0was just shy of nine-months-old when he was abducted along with his parents and brother, Ariel, who was 4 at the time, from their kibbutz, Nir Oz.",
      "In late 2023, Hamas said that Shiri Bibas and the children had been killed by Israeli bombardments. Israel has yet to confirm their deaths.",
      "On Tuesday, the Bibas family said it was \u201cin turmoil\u201d over the Hamas leader\u2019s announcement of the return of Shiri Bibas and the children.",
      "\u201cUntil we receive definitive confirmation, our journey is not over,\u201d the family said in a statement.",
      "The Hostage and Missing Families Forum also named the six living hostages slated for release Saturday: Eliya Cohen, Omer Shem Tov, Omer Wenkert, Tal Shoham, Hisham Al-Sayed and Avera Mengistu.",
      "\u201cWhile we feel profound relief at their homecoming, we are devastated by the news that the remains of four of our loved ones will be returned this Thursday,\u201d it said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Cohen, 27, Shem Tov, 22, and Wenkert, 23, were abducted from the Nova music festival, where an estimated 364 people were killed. Shoham, 40, was taken from the community of kibbutz Beeri, according to the group.",
      "Civilians Al-Sayed and Mengistu have been separately held in Gaza for about a decade after they were kidnapped while crossing the border in 2015 and 2014, respectively.",
      "About 1,200 people were killed and 251 were captured in the Oct. 7 terror attack, according to Israeli officials. Israel's ensuing military offensive in Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to the local Hamas-run Health Ministry, and forcibly displaced most of its 2.3 million population.",
      "Saturday\u2019s handover, if successful, will mean that four hostages, all presumed dead, are still left in Gaza from the group of 33 scheduled for\u00a0release under the first phase of the ceasefire deal.",
      "Negotiations over the second stage of the ceasefire deal, originally slated to begin Feb. 4, will work to secure the release of the remaining 64 hostages and oversee the administration of post-war Gaza. Talks are expected to get underway in the coming days."

      "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel is preparing to receive six hostages Saturday, in addition to a number of captives' bodies to be delivered from Gaza on Thursday, a source briefed on the talks told NBC News on Monday.",
      "Talks mediated by Qatar and Egypt are ongoing, said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, and would involve Israel sending in a number of temporary housing structures into the besieged Palestinian enclave.",
      "That would be more than the number of Israeli hostages that have been released every Saturday since the ceasefire was agreed on Jan. 19. So far, Hamas has sent the names of those to be released on the Friday before the exchange, which has also involved the freeing of dozens of Palestinian detainees and prisoners.",
      "The source said there were also discussions about handing over the bodies of deceased hostages on Thursday.",
      "Six live hostages and eight dead ones remain out of the 33 due to be released in the first phase of the three-part ceasefire deal\u00a0Hamas and Israel agreed to on Jan. 19.",
      "Israel\u2019s security cabinet earlier met to discuss the second phase of ceasefire, even as Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0voiced his support for President\u00a0Donald Trump's controversial plan to take over Gaza.",

      "Netanyahu\u2019s office said the negotiating team would receive \u201cinstructions for the continuation of negotiations on Phase B issues\u201d after the Israeli security cabinet\u2019s discussion on the matter.

    "story": [
      "Israeli forces will remain in five strategic locations in southern Lebanon near the border after Tuesday\u2019s deadline for their full withdrawal, an Israeli official said Monday.",
      "The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s government has opposed any further delay in the Israeli pullout under the ceasefire agreement that ended fighting with the Hezbollah militant group. There was no immediate comment from Lebanese or Hezbollah officials. Earlier on Monday, an Israeli strike in Lebanon killed a senior Hamas leader.",
      "The news came as Israelis were marking the 500th day since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which ignited the war in the Gaza Strip and rippled across the region, eventually setting off a full-blown war between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "The war in Gaza was paused last month\u00a0when a fragile ceasefire took hold. The first phase of the truce is set to end in early March, and it\u2019s unclear whether it will be extended to allow the release of dozens more hostages, or if Israel will renew its military offensive against Hamas with U.S. support.",
      "Separately, an anti-settlement watchdog said Monday that Israel has issued a tender for the construction of nearly 1,000\u00a0additional settler homes\u00a0in the occupied West Bank.",
      "Peace Now says the development of 974 new housing units would allow the population of the Efrat settlement to expand by 40% and further block the development of the nearby Palestinian city of Bethlehem. Hagit Ofran, who leads the group\u2019s settlement monitoring, said construction can begin after the contracting process and issuing of permits, which could take another year at least.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Israeli government.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state and view the settlements as a major obstacle to peace, a position with wide international support.",
      "Settlement expansion",
      "President Donald Trump lent\u00a0unprecedented support to the settlements\u00a0during his previous term. Israel has also steadily expanded settlements during Democratic administrations, which were more critical but rarely took any action to curb them.",
      "Israel has built well over 100 settlements across the West Bank, ranging from hilltop outposts to fully developed suburban communities, with apartment blocks, malls and parks.",
      "Over 500,000 settlers live in the occupied West Bank, which is home to some 3 million Palestinians. The settlers have Israeli citizenship, while Palestinians live under military rule with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.",
      "The Israeli government views the West Bank as the historical and biblical heartland of the Jewish people and is opposed to Palestinian statehood, while human rights groups have accused Israel of\u00a0discrimination against and oppression of\u00a0Palestinians in the West Bank.",
      "Peace Now, which favors a negotiated two-state solution to the conflict, accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government of pressing ahead with settlement construction while dozens of hostages captured in Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack languish in captivity in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\u201cThe Netanyahu government is operating \u2018on steroids\u2019 to establish facts on the ground that will destroy the chance for peace and compromise,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "500 days",
      "Israelis held protests across the country on Monday calling for the ceasefire to be extended so that more hostages can be released. Demonstrators blocked a main intersection in Tel Aviv, and some protesters planned to fast for 500 minutes in a show of solidarity with the captives.",
      "\u201cAll I care about, all I want, is for my friends to return. There were six of us living in unbearable conditions, in a six-square-meter (65-square-foot) space. I got out, but they are still there,\u201d Ohad Ben Ami, a\u00a0hostage who was released a week and a half ago, told Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Monday. He added that hostages don\u2019t count days while in captivity, they count minutes and seconds.",
      "Hamas is set to continue the gradual release of 33 hostages during the current phase of the truce in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces have pulled back from most parts of Gaza and allowed a surge of humanitarian aid.",
      "But the two sides have yet to negotiate the second phase, in which Hamas would release more than 70 remaining hostages \u2014 around half of whom are believed to be dead \u2014 in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal and a lasting ceasefire.",
      "Netanyahu and the Trump administration have given conflicting signals over whether they want to continue the ceasefire or renew the war. Both they say are committed to the eradication of Hamas and the return of all the hostages, but those goals are widely seen as incompatible.",
      "Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack and abducted around 250. More than half of the hostages have been returned in agreements with Hamas or other deals, while just eight have been rescued in military operations.",
      "The militant group, though weakened,\u00a0remains in full control of the territory. Hamas has said it is willing to relinquish power to other Palestinians but will not accept any occupying force.",
      "Israel\u2019s air and ground war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The war destroyed vast areas of Gaza and at its height had displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million.",
      "Trump has called for Gaza\u2019s population to be permanently relocated to other countries and for the United States to take ownership of the territory and rebuild it for others. Israel has welcomed the plan, while Palestinians and Arab nations\u00a0have universally rejected the idea.",
      "Rights groups and experts say the proposal, if implemented,\u00a0would likely violate international law.",
      "The proposal has meanwhile cast further doubt over the future of the ceasefire. Hamas may be unwilling to release the remaining captives \u2014 its only bargaining chips \u2014 it if believes Israel is going to resume the war with the goal of expelling the Palestinian population.",
      "Hamas official killed",
      "An Israeli drone strike targeted a car in Lebanon\u2019s southern port city of Sidon, the deepest strike since the ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel took effect in November.",
      "Israel said it targeted Muhammad Shaheen, the head of Hamas\u2019 operations in Lebanon. Footage circulating online showed a car engulfed in flames. The strike occurred near a Lebanese army checkpoint and Sidon\u2019s municipal sports stadium.",
      "The original withdrawal deadline was in late January, but under pressure from Israel, Lebanon agreed to extend it to Feb. 18. It remains unclear whether Israeli troops will complete their withdrawal by Tuesday.",
      "Since the ceasefire, Israel has continued airstrikes in southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it is targeting military sites containing missiles and combat equipment. Each side has accused the other of violating the truce."

      "The event was originally supposed to include comments to the media by Zelenskyy and retired U.S. Lt. Gen.\u00a0Keith Kellogg , but it was changed at the last minute to a simple photo opportunity where the two posed for journalists. They did not deliver statements or field questions as expected. The change was requested by the U.S. side, Ukrainian presidential spokesman Serhii Nikiforov said.",
      "Kellogg\u2019s trip to Kyiv coincided with\u00a0recent feuding between Trump and Zelenskyy that has bruised their personal relations and cast further doubt on the future of U.S. support for Ukraine\u2019s war effort.",

As the meeting began, photographers and video journalists were allowed into a room where the two men shook hands before sitting across from each other at a table.",
      "Journalists were then informed that there would be no news conference with remarks by the leaders or questions from reporters. Nikiforov gave no reason for the sudden change except to say that it was in accordance with U.S. wishes.",

      "The two men were due to speak about Trump\u2019s efforts to end the war. Zelenskyy had previously said he looked forward to explaining what was happening in Ukraine and showing it to Kellogg.",

      "\u201cWe can and must make peace reliable and lasting so that Russia can never return with war again,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUkraine is ready for a strong, truly beneficial agreement with the President of the United States on investments and security.\u201d",

      "Zelenskyy was unhappy that a U.S. team opened the talks without inviting him or European governments that have backed Kyiv.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Traveling around Seoul in a prison transport vehicle, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared in two different courts on Thursday, contesting his arrest on rebellion charges in one and fighting an effort to remove him from office in the other.",
      "Both cases \u2014 one on criminal charges, one an impeachment \u2014 are related to his brief imposition of martial law in December.",
      "Security was heightened at the Seoul Central District Court as the motorcade transporting Yoon arrived for a preliminary hearing that involved discussions of witnesses, proposed evidence and other preparations for his criminal trial.",
      "The court, which scheduled another preliminary hearing in March, was also reviewing a request by Yoon\u2019s lawyers to cancel his arrest and release him from custody. Such challenges are rarely successful. The court was expected to make a decision later Thursday.",
      "Yoon next traveled across the capital to the Constitutional Court, which is nearing a decision on whether to formally remove him from office after he was impeached by the National Assembly. Yoon temporarily left the courtroom when Prime Minister Han Duck-soo appeared as a witness. Yoon\u2019s lawyer explained to the justices that his client believed it would damage the country\u2019s image if both were seen in court together.",
      "Han supported Yoon\u2019s claim that the liberal opposition, with its legislative majority, had disrupted state affairs through pushing for impeachments of senior officials and undermining the government budget. However, Han repeated his previous statements to lawmakers and investigators that Yoon had violated constitutional requirements by failing to deliberate in a formal Cabinet meeting before declaring martial law on Dec. 3. Han said he didn\u2019t know of any Cabinet member who expressed support of Yoon\u2019s step.",

      "Martial law was lifted about six hours after Yoon declared it but has caused political turmoil, disrupted high-level diplomacy and tested the resiliency of the country\u2019s democracy. Yoon\u2019s conservative supporters rioted at the Seoul Western District Court after it authorized his arrest last month, while his lawyers and ruling party have openly questioned the credibility of courts and law enforcement institutions handling the case.",

    "story": [
      "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 He\u2019s an investment banker with a distinctly American pedigree, having studied at Harvard and Stanford before going on to work at Goldman Sachs and McKinsey. But as U.S. and Russian negotiators work to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine, Kirill Dmitriev will be trying his best to secure the best deal for one man: President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Fluent in English and married to a close friend of Putin\u2019s daughter, Dmitriev, 49, is a longtime confidante of the Russian leader, entrusted with running the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and a key player in the recent high-level talks in Saudi Arabia about ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Dmitriev was involved in the meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Yuri Ushakov, Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser, and an American delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. He also attended separate meetings in Riyadh and made an argument that might appeal to President Donald Trump\u00a0\u2014 that sanctions had cost U.S. companies billions of dollars.",
      "\u201cHis main role, his main task, is what Putin assigned him: to get the Americans to lift sanctions pressure. That\u2019s his job,\u201d Andrei Fedorov, Russia\u2019s former deputy foreign minister, told NBC News in a telephone conversation last week.",
      "Putin thinks of Dmitriev as an official who can be relied on, Fedorov said, adding that he was a \u201cvery good executor\u201d when it came to negotiations.",
      "Dmitriev has already courted the new administration in the White House by playing a crucial role in facilitating the prisoner swap that led to the release of Marc Fogel, three and a half years after a Russian court handed him a 14-year jail sentence for a minor medical cannabis infraction.",
      "Fogel, a 63-year-old teacher from Pennsylvania, flew back to the U.S. last week with Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, who credited a man called \u201cKirill\u201d for making the deal.",
      "\u201cWe had a reach-out from someone who is a go-between between the Russian government and the American government and I presented it,\u201d Witkoff told Fox News a few days after they touched down on U.S. soil. \u201cThe president and we all determined that it was credible, that there was an opportunity to get Marc Fogel back, and the president listened, carefully decided it was actionable and said hop on the plane and let\u2019s hope to get a good result.\u201d",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was also heavily involved in the deal to secure Fogel\u2019s release, according to a senior Saudi official who credited Dmitriev as \u201cabsolutely the go-to\u201d and \u201chighly active\u201d in the negotiations surrounding the exchange, which saw convicted money launderer Alexander Vinnik return to Russia.",
      "Dmitriev has long established ties with the Saudi leader and, in October 2019, he was awarded the King Abdulaziz Second-Class Order of Merit, the kingdom\u2019s highest award, for his work to strengthen cooperation between Russia and Saudi Arabia after he helped secure an oil price agreement under the expanded OPEC+ producers\u2019 forum.",
      "\u201cHe is well connected with the Saudis; he is one of them,\u201d Fedorov said. \u201cThey make money together.\u201d He added that when the prisoner exchange was broached, \u201cthe Saudis were the first to confirm that they were willing to help with the matter.\u201d",
      "The Saudi award was another in a long list of honors for Dmitriev, who has been presented with no less than three titles, the Order of Alexander Nevsky, the Order of Honour and the Order of Friendship, by the Kremlin.",
      "But his success has come as little surprise to those who have tracked his career.",
      "Born in what is now Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, but was then part of the Soviet Union, as a teenager Dmitriev took part of a high-school exchange with the U.S., where he later returned to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree at Stanford University and an MBA at Harvard. In 2009 he was a \u201cyoung global leader\u201d at the World Economic Forum.",
      "He went on to work in Ukraine before moving back to Russia, where American business channels CNBC and Bloomberg would feature him because of his expertise on local markets.",
      "Putin then tapped him up to head the Russian Direct Investment Fund, which was created in 2011 to facilitate foreign investment.",
      "Describing him as \u201cextraordinarily smart,\u201d a senior U.S. finance executive who asked not to be named to protect their business relationships, said Dmitriev was able to move in Western circles \u201cwith ease.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of Russians who speak good English have no f---ing idea how we think,\u201d he said. \u201cHe actually is a guy who has spent enough time with Westerners, particularly Americans, and he actually has a pretty good feel for how we process information.\u201d",
      "While Dmitriev was \u201cvery pro-American and pro-Western,\u201d he added that he was \u201cultimately totally loyal and patriotic to Russia\u201d and Putin.",
      "In his role, he subsequently championed his country and encouraged investment in the face of hostility about the Russian annexation of Crimea.",
      "He also played a part in early contacts with the U.S. when Trump was first elected president in 2016. Among the people he met was Erik Prince, the founder of the now defunct Blackwater security firm and a supporter of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential run.",
      "Their secret meeting in the Four Seasons Hotel in the Seychelles, on Jan. 11, 2017, was featured in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, which said Dmitriev sought an introduction to a Trump transition team member in order to begin improving U.S.-Russia ties.",
      "Two years later, as Covid-19 pandemic took hold, Dmitriev invested in and promoted Russia\u2019s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine.",
      "But after Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Dmitriev seemed to disappear from public view in the West, although he routinely attended major events in Russia and met Putin on several occasions. He also made regular media appearances in his homeland.",
      "Four days after Russian forces crossed into Ukraine, the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned Dmitriev, calling him a \u201cclose associate of Putin.\u201d His wife, Natalya Popova, \u201cbelieved to be close to one of Putin\u2019s daughters, Katerina Tikhonova,\u201d was also sanctioned.",
      "But after Trump was elected again last year, Dmitriev re-entered the spotlight praising the president\u2019s \u201cdecisive leadership\u201d as he issued a series of executive orders.",
      "The week before Trump\u2019s inauguration he met with Putin to talk about Russian investments, according to the Kremlin\u2019s website.",
      "After the ceasefire talks in Riyadh, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that both countries had agreed to re-establish \u201cthe functionality of our respective missions in Washington and Moscow\u201d and that Washington would create a high-level team to work on a path to ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Dmitriev was there to discuss \u201ceconomic issues,\u201d according to Ushakov, Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser.",
      "Whether those discussions included the lifting of American sanctions is unclear, but Fedorov, Russia\u2019s former deputy foreign minister, was convinced that he would eventually achieve that goal.",
      "\u201cWhen he is given a task, he does it,\u201d he said.",
      "Keir Simmons reported from Riyadh and Natasha Lebedeva from Washington."

    "story": [
      "SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic \u2014 They\u2019re known as \u201cfrog men,\u201d inmates who are forced to sleep on prison floors across the Dominican Republic, often next to overflowing toilets or holes in the ground that serve as one.",
      "Thousands of them are crammed into the country\u2019s severely overcrowded prisons, some operating at seven times their capacity. A majority languish there without ever having been charged with a crime, and activists warn they face inhuman conditions and a lack of medical care.",
      "Despite promises to improve the system, critics say the Dominican Republic continues to push for and allow pretrial detentions in nearly all criminal cases where no charges have been filed and has made few changes as problems within prisons keep mounting.",
      "\u201cPrisons have become no man\u2019s land,\u201d said Rodolfo Valent\u00edn Santos, director of the Dominican Republic\u2019s National Public Defense Office.",
      "Over 60% of the country\u2019s roughly 26,000 inmates are being held under preventive detention, without any charges, according to the National Public Defense Office. Proponents argue the measure aims to protect society and allows authorities time to collect evidence in a case.",
      "But some detainees have spent up to 20 years in prison without ever being found guilty of a crime, Valent\u00edn said.",
      "He noted that the country\u2019s Constitution and penal code dictate that preventive detention is an \u201cexceptional\u201d measure. There are six other measures that don\u2019t involve prison time, including bail, but Valent\u00edn said they are rarely used.",
      "\u2018We have a situation\u2019",
      "On a recent afternoon, Darwin Lugo and Yason Guzm\u00e1n walked out of La Victoria National Penitentiary, in the northeast corner of the sprawling capital, Santo Domingo.",
      "The prison was built for a maximum of 2,100 inmates but holds more than 7,000 of them, with more than 3,300 under pretrial detention, according to the National Public Defense Office.",
      "It is the country\u2019s oldest and most populated prison.",
      "\u201cYou have to watch out for your life,\u201d said Lugo, who with Guzm\u00e1n visited several friends held there, some under pretrial detention.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of them who are not doing well,\u201d Guzm\u00e1n said of inmates there. \u201cThere\u2019s extreme poverty.\u201d",
      "They said their friends, who have spent more than five years incarcerated there, are well-connected and only occasionally request money or ask that their cell phone\u2019s SIM card be recharged.",
      "Last year, at least 11 inmates died at La Victoria following a short circuit in a cell that sparked a fire and an explosion. It was one of the country\u2019s deadliest prison fires since 2005, when at least 134 inmates were killed in the eastern town of Hig\u00fcey after rival gangs set their bedding ablaze.",
      "After last year\u2019s fire at La Victoria, Dominican President Luis Abinader appointed former prisons director Roberto Santana as head of a commission tasked with overhauling and improving the country\u2019s more than 40 prisons.",
      "\u201cWe must admit, gentlemen, that we have a situation in all of the country\u2019s prisons,\u201d Abinader said when he announced the appointment last March. He also announced that money recovered from corruption cases would help fund construction of new prisons.",
      "Santana has long called for the closure of La Victoria and the 15 de Azua prison, located in the country\u2019s western region. The commission he leads is working on those and other monumental tasks, free from outside interference, he said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t take orders from politicians or anyone else,\u201d said Santana, who previously trained staff for the new prisons built in the early 2000s.",
      "Santana, who once served as president of the Federation of Dominican Students in the 1970s, was arrested multiple times under President Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, known for having political opponents and dissidents jailed and sometimes killed.",
      "Santana knows first-hand the conditions of La Victoria \u2014 he spent two years in solitary confinement there.",
      "\u2018On the brink of collapse\u2019",
      "In the early 2000s, the Dominican Republic began building 21 new prisons to improve conditions. They were staffed by trained personnel, not police and soldiers, which oversee the country\u2019s other 19 prisons.",
      "But conditions in the new prisons have deteriorated, according to the Dominican Republic\u2019s National Commission of Human Rights.",
      "\u201cThe Dominican Republic\u2019s prison system is on the brink of collapse,\u201d the commission said in its 2023 report, the latest one available.",
      "In prisons across the country, overcrowding is rampant. Cells lack bathrooms, natural light and ventilation, leading to worsening health conditions. Some 5,000 inmates are ill with conditions ranging from heart problems to cancer to HIV, but they receive only the most basic medication, if that, and some prisons have no medical staff, according to Valent\u00edn, whose office issues a yearly in-depth report on the conditions of all prisons.",
      "In its 2023 report, the latest year available, his office called for the closure of prisons including one in the north coastal city of Nagua.",
      "\u201cThe level of overcrowding\u2026makes it impossible to achieve true rehabilitation for the inmates since they have been forgotten by the state,\u201d the report read. \u201cIn the conditions they are in, it is obvious that they are treated as objects and not as human beings endowed with rights.\u201d",
      "Another prison was so overcrowded that the government held inmates outdoors in trucks with metal roofs that broiled under the sun, sparking lawsuits, Valent\u00edn said.",
      "A spokesperson for Col. Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez Basilio, director of prisons, did not respond to requests for an interview. Hern\u00e1ndez has previously said his office is taking measures to improve conditions.",
      "Meanwhile, Dominican Attorney General Miriam Germ\u00e1n Brito has repeatedly spoken out against pretrial detention but noted that the decision lies in the hands of judges. A spokesperson for Germ\u00e1n said she is not granting media interviews.",
      "Both Santana and Valent\u00edn said they believe government corruption is one reason the country has dragged its feet in overhauling the system, accusing soldiers and police who run prisons of benefiting from illegal activities.",
      "Public corruption also prompted authorities to halt construction of a much-touted prison in recent years that was expected to ease overcrowding.",
      "Even as that half-built prison wastes away, Santana said he expects that 25 new prisons capable of holding more than 20,000 inmates will be built by 2028.",
      "While those are expected to help ease overcrowding, concerns remain. Activists note that inmates are not freed even when a judge has legally released them.",
      "The National Commission of Human Rights noted that roughly 2,700 inmates are still in prison because their paperwork is paralyzed in backlogged courts. Meanwhile, hundreds of others remain incarcerated despite being officially freed because they owe the government money and are unable to pay fines ordered by a judge."

      "The M23 rebels on Tuesday attacked all the main Congolese army positions on the road to Butembo, a city of 150,000 people, and the situation was rapidly deteriorating, said Auguste Kombi, a civil society leader in Kitsombiro, a town along the road.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re afraid that the enemy will advance to Butembo,\u201d Kombi said.",
      "Butembo is about 130 miles north of Goma, the city of over 2 million people that the M23 rebels seized last month as about 3,000 people were killed.",
      "The advance on Butembo means the rebels are spanning out both north and south of Goma. The rebels this week seized another provincial capital to Goma\u2019s south, Bukavu, near Burundi. The region is rich in gold and coltan, a key mineral for the production of capacitors used in most consumer electronics such as laptops and smartphones.",
      "Also Tuesday, the M23 captured the town of Kamanyola, about 15 miles south of Bukavu, after they overcame resistance from the Congolese army in the evening, said Steve Mubalama, a civil society representative in the town.",
      "Mubalama expressed fears that the M23 rebels would advance a further 45 miles to the south to take the strategic city of Uvira.",
      "The M23 is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of eastern Congo\u2019s trillions of dollars in mineral wealth. The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, over 1,000 miles away.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re worried because we\u2019re in danger of experiencing a situation similar to that in Goma, with the loss of human lives,\u201d said Kambale Nyuliro, a Kitsombiro civil servant. He told the AP that Lubero town, on the way to Butembo, was surrounded on three sides by M23 fighters but still under Congolese army control.",
      "\u201cSince the fighting began, the enemy has only advanced,\u201d he said."

      "Attacks by Sudan\u2019s Rapid Support Forces have killed more than 200 people over the past three days, activists said Tuesday, as the paramilitary group delayed signing a political charter that could pave the way for a breakaway government.",
      "After nearly two years of war between the RSF and Sudan\u2019s army, the RSF controls most of the west of Sudan and parts of the capital, Khartoum, but has been losing ground in central Sudan to the army.",
      "White\u00a0Nile\u00a0state, where activists said three days of RSF attacks had left more than 200 dead, has emerged as a key battleground as the army regains territory.",
      "The attacks occurred in villages around the town of al-Gitaina, said Emergency\u00a0Lawyers, a group that has monitored the impact of the conflict on civilians.",
      "\u201cThose who tried to flee across the\u00a0Nile\u00a0were shot at, drowning them,\u201d Emergency\u00a0Lawyers\u00a0said, in what it called \u201can intentional act of genocide.\u201d",
      "The RSF could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "The war in Sudan has created what the U.N. has called the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis, and both the RSF and army have been accused of extensive human rights violations. The United States has determined that the RSF has committed genocide in areas under its control.",
      "The attacks came as the RSF assembled allied politicians and armed group leaders in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, to sign a charter that would provide for a \u201cGovernment of Peace and Unity\u201d to govern the territories the force controls.",
      "The charter\u00a0could mark\u00a0a turning point in the war, cementing a split along battle lines even as the fight for control over some areas rages on.",
      "However, politician Fadlallah Burma Nasir, head of the Umma Party which is split over whether to participate, said that the signing of the charter was postponed until later in the week to allow for a fuller representation from rebel leader Abdelaziz al-Hilu\u2019s SPLM-N.",
      "The SPLM-N is a large secular military faction that controls wide swaths of the famine-stricken South Kordofan and had not previously taken a firm position in the conflict between the army and the RSF.",
      "An alliance with the RSF \u2014 on the basis of self-described marginalized groups fighting against the powerful center represented by the army \u2014 could boost the paramilitary\u2019s territory and numbers.",
      "\u201cWe want to build a new state, that is different from the old Sudan, which was based on separation, discrimination, hatred, corruption, and so on,\u201d said al-Hilu.",
      "Government spokesman Khalid Aleisir told Reuters: \u201cAbdelaziz al-Hilu\u2019s group showed poor judgment when they joined (the RSF\u2019s) agenda, but we know there is external power being exerted,\u201d alluding to army accusations that the United Arab Emirates supports the RSF, which the UAE denies.",
      "\u201cIn all the areas these gangs are present, the population refuses completely for the militia to speak for them or to impose a \u2018New Sudan,\u2019\u201d he added."
