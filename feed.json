      "The Tennessee Board of Parole has recommended a pardon for country music star Jelly Roll, a Nashville native who has spoken openly about his criminal history and what it has taken to overcome it",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Board of Parole on Tuesday recommended a pardon for country music star Jelly Roll, a Nashville native who has spoken openly about his criminal record and what it has taken to overcome it. The board's action leaves the final decision on a pardon up to Gov. Bill Lee.",
      "The rapper-turned-country singer wants to be able to travel internationally to perform and share his message of redemption, after spending time behind bars as a young person.",
      "The board issued its nonbinding recommendation unanimously after a hearing that lasted about an hour and 45 minutes with several witnesses, including Nashville Sheriff Daron Hall, advocating for the 40-year-old musician named Jason DeFord. One board member recused themselves from voting.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \u201cWhitsitt Chapel\u201d and crossover songs like \u201cNeed a Favor.\u201d He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and earned four Grammy nominations, including for new artist of the year.",
      "\u201cThis was incredible,\u201d he said of the board's decision. \u201cI pray this goes through. But today was special for me, regardless.\u201d",
      "His most serious convictions include a robbery at age 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two other young men enter a house in 2002. Both of the others were carrying guns, although Jelly Roll was unarmed. They demanded money, and received $350 and a wallet with no money in it. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were arrested right away. He was sentenced to serve a year in prison and additional time on probation.",
      "Later, in 2008, police on patrol found both marijuana and crack cocaine in his car. He was sentenced to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "He also has two misdemeanor offenses for driving without a license and possession of drug paraphernalia.",
      "Lee, a Republican, said every case seeking clemency, such as pardons, is equally important and goes through a thorough process.",
      "\u201cThe reporting on Jelly Roll, that\u2019s encouraging for his situation, but there are steps yet to happen in that case,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Jelly Roll told the board that while in a detention center, he fell in love with songwriting. \u201cIt started as a passion project that felt therapeutic and would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable and opened doors that I\u2019ve never thought possible.\u201d",
      "These days, he often visits jails and rehabilitation centers before performing concerts. He has bought restaurants out for the day to feed people who are homeless and played basketball with kids at a youth center the same day that he performed in Winnipeg. He said he generally doesn't seek out news coverage when he makes these visits.",
      "As a part of the pardon application, friends and civic leaders wrote to the board about Jelly Roll\u2019s transformation and generosity. Hall, who runs Nashville\u2019s jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino also wrote in his favor, pointing out all the money he's given from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "One of the reasons Jelly Roll gave for needing a pardon is to be able to travel to Canada to perform, which his criminal record makes difficult. Currently, he would need to apply for a special permit that can include long wait times for a decision, according to a letter from an immigration attorney submitted with his clemency packet.",
      "\u201cI want to be an inspiration for people who are now where I used to be \u2014 to let them know that change is truly possible,\" Jelly Roll told the board. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m asking for your recommendation for this pardon is because I\u2019m looking to take my message of redemption through the power of music and faith through the rest of the world.\u201d",
      "He said he would use the pardon for much more than going on tour, though.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll still be using this same pardon, God willing, to go do missionary work in my 50s and 60s,\u201d he said.",
      "Due to his criminal record, he told the board that every time he travels it \u201ctakes a team of lawyers and a mountain of paperwork to secure my entry into those countries.\u201d He said he recently was able to make his first tour in Canada and took his first trip to the United Kingdom, where he spoke about a rehabilitation program.",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks at least five years since his sentence expired.",
      "Lee has issued more than 90 pardons since taking office in 2019, all of them since 2021.",

      "Opening statements are set in former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape retrial, this time with a majority-female jury deciding the landmark #MeToo case",
      "NEW YORK -- Opening statements are set for Wednesday in former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape retrial, this time with a majority-female jury deciding the landmark #MeToo case.",
      "After a dayslong selection process yielded a seven-woman, five-man jury and five alternate jurors by Monday, prosecutors and Weinstein\u2019s lawyers finished choosing a sixth and final alternate on Tuesday. Alternates step in if a member of the main panel can\u2019t see the trial through.",
      "The main jury is more female than the five women and seven men who convicted Weinstein at his first trial five years ago. The verdict marked a signature moment for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct, which had been fueled in 2017 by a slew of allegations against Weinstein, then a high-flying movie producer of a string of Oscar winners including \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d",
      "But in a reversal that dismayed #MeToo activists, New York\u2019s highest court last year overturned Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence. The court found that the original trial judge allowed prejudicial testimony. That judge\u2019s term expired in 2022, and he is no longer on the bench.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "Drawn from Manhattan\u2019s jury pool, the 12 members of the main jury for the New York retrial include a physics researcher, a photographer, a dietitian, a therapist, an investment bank software engineer and a fire safety director. Others have experience in real estate, TV commercials, debt collection, social work and other fields.",
      "One has a high school equivalency degree. Others have master\u2019s degrees. Some have served as jurors or grand jurors multiple times before; others, never.",
      "Hundreds of other potential jurors were excused for reasons ranging from language barriers to strong opinions about Weinstein \u2014 \u201cthe first word that came in my head was \u2018pig,\u2019\u201d said one man who was soon let go.",
      "Those chosen were quizzed about their backgrounds, life experiences and various other points that could relate to their ability to be fair and impartial about the highly publicized case.",
      "\u201cYou may hear sexual allegations here of a salacious nature \u2014 graphic, perhaps. Would hearing that indicate that \u2026 Mr. Weinstein must be guilty?\u201d defense attorney Mike Cibella asked one prospective juror on Monday. The woman, who ultimately was chosen, answered no.",
      "Prosecutor Shannon Lucey sought assurances that prospective jurors could put aside any position or feelings they had about the #MeToo movement.",
      "\u201cIs there anyone who is going to think of the movement and think, \u2018OK, that\u2019s just something that I have to keep in the back of my mind when I\u2019m deciding this case\u2019? Everyone can put that aside?\u201d Lucey asked a group of 24 possible jurors. All indicated they could do so.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s rape and sexual assault retrial involves accusations from three women: an aspiring actor who said he raped her in 2013, and two women who made separate allegations of forced oral sex in 2006. One of the two wasn\u2019t part of the original trial.",
      "Meanwhile, Weinstein is challenging a separate 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Oscar voters will no longer be able to skip watching some of the nominated films.",
      "The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences on Monday announced that members will from now on be required to watch all nominated films in each category to be eligible to vote in the final round of Oscar voting. Up until now, Oscar voters had only been encouraged to watch the nominees, and vote in categories they felt qualified in.",
      "But in recent years, what films get watched by academy members has been increasingly seen as a significant factor in what wins. At the same time, the publication of anonymous Oscar ballots has often featured members confessing that they didn't get around to watching some notable films or not finishing lengthier nominees.",
      "On Monday, the academy also put forth a handful of new regulations on issues including AI, refugee filmmakers and the newly launched casting category.",
      "In the best international film category, the academy will now allow filmmakers with refugee or asylum status to be represented by a country not their own. The rule change keeps in place the broad apparatus of how international nominees are submitted through countries, but it tweaks eligibility.",
      "The regulation now reads: \u201cThe submitting country must confirm that creative control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens, residents, or individuals with refugee or asylum status in the submitting country.\u201d",
      "Critics have long called on changes to the nominating process for best international film because it leaves the submission process in the hands of governments, not the academy. That's left dissident filmmakers working under authoritarian or undemocratic regimes with limited pathways to reaching the Oscars.",
      "Last year, for instance, the Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran before he was to be flogged and imprisoned for eight years in order to release his film \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig.\u201d Germany, where Rasoulof settled, submitted it for the Oscars and it was nominated. But other filmmakers, including Rasoulof's friend and countryman Jafar Panahi, have released films without a mechanism for submission.",
      "The rule change notably won't alter the Oscar prospects for filmmakers who haven't fled their home countries or change anything for films passed over by their nation's selection committees.",
      "The academy also ruled that the use of generative artificial intelligence tools \u201cneither help nor harm the chances of a nomination.\u201d How significantly AI is used in filmmaking has, as in other industries, been a much-debated topic in Hollywood. In this year's Oscar race, Brady Corbet's \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d was a subject of some controversy after its editor said that AI had been used to enhance the Hungarian dialogue of stars Adrien Brody (who ultimately won best actor ) and Felicity Jones (who was nominated for best supporting actress).",
      "\u201cThe academy and each branch will judge the achievement, taking into account the degree to which a human was at the heart of the creative authorship when choosing which movie to award,\u201d the academy said Monday.",
      "The film academy also set down some rules for its new achievement in casting Oscar. After a preliminary round of voting to determine a shortlist of 10 films, members of the casting branch will be invited to a \u201cbake-off\u201d presentation from the shortlisted films, including a Q&A with nominees.",
      "Earlier in April, the academy announced a new category for stunt design, but that award won't begin until the 2028 Oscars.",

      "But creator Tony Gilroy says he and his collaborators felt little pressure from Disney and Lucasfilm as they sought to tell the story of a growing revolutionary resentment against the Galactic Empire and the birth of the Rebel Alliance leading up to the events of the 2016 film he scripted, \u201cRogue One.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe took no creative notes on this show,\u201d Gilroy, whose deep screenwriting resume also includes four films in the \u201cBourne\u201d franchise and 2007 Oscar nominee \u201cMichael Clayton,\" which he also directed. He told The Associated Press that \u201cI\u2019ve never had this much freedom before, even in final-cut films that I worked on. The latitude was astonishing.\u201d",
      "The forthcoming season, whose production was delayed by Hollywood's 2023 strikes, are coming with high expectations from fans who have been disappointed in other recent \u201cStar Wars\u201d TV offerings, with no new movies released in the franchise in six years.",
      "The new episodes trace how the spark lit in Diego Luna's Cassian Andor in the 2022 first season spreads through the galaxy. And they do it with characters and arcs rarely found in this realm before.",
      "\u201cThis second season, it\u2019s about all the layers, and the social and political climate that needs to happen for a revolution to erupt, for a rebellion to exist,\u201d Luna told the AP. \u201cThe universe of \u2018Star Wars\u2019 never stopped to tell the story of these regular people that becomes crucial for the history that we know.\u201d",
      "Gilroy drew inspiration from a broad range of historical and fictional sources.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s ever going to get another chance to do another 1,500 pages on revolution again, with this much money and this much muscle, and everything else?\u201d he said.",
      "But as epic as the story is, its most essential moments are marked by intimate, one-on-one conversations.",
      "\u201cI start small,\u201d Gilroy said. \u201cI work teaspoon by teaspoon.\u201d",
      "That includes a season-opening scene that starts with Cassian giving a young imperial mechanic the courage to help him in a major heist. He sells her on the ecstatic feelings of destiny rebellion can bring.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite beautiful and idealistic also, like a revolution has to be, It\u2019s a great reminder of how romantic the idea of revolution is,\u201d Luna said.",
      "Cast members say it can feel revolutionary working for Gilroy, who passes on the same freedom to them that Disney gives to him. They're never kept in the dark with the sort of script-rationing and secret-keeping that are the norm in major franchises.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in withholding information as power,\u201d said Adria Arjona, who plays Andor's partner Bix Caleen. \u201cBefore I read episode one, I knew the end. It\u2019s just unheard-of.\u201d",
      "Her character's arc in particular brings real-world elements including addiction and even darker forms of trauma unlike anything \u201cStar Wars\u201d has shown before.",
      "Gilroy said he didn't have to fight over the galaxy's canon at all. He had to get used to certain elements when he first worked within the franchise \u2014 no paper, no hinged doors, no knives, for example. But it's not necessarily held as sacred.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen canon stretch so much,\" he said. \"It was really tight on \u2018Rogue.\u2019 But a lot of things have changed since then.\u201d",
      "The overall direction of the show was basically determined when work began on the series five years ago.",
      "\u201cI know what I\u2019m doing with Cassian,\u201d Gilroy said. \u201cI know that the first year is the making of a revolutionary and the road to Damascus, that\u2019s the first year, I know I\u2019m leading to Rogue, I know where he\u2019s gonna end up.\"",
      "Other elements, like the route Mon Mothma (Genevieve O\u2019Reilly) takes from respectable senator to leader of the rebellion, were not predetermined. They were discovered in the writing and in the performances.",
      "Her early-season path includes a wedding ceremony full of rituals \u2014 and dances \u2014 new to \u201cStar Wars\u201d that Gilroy invented out of whole cloth. He said one of the pleasures of getting to make something so large and sprawling is that he has gotten to use nearly every writing thought he has had.",
      "\u201cAll I did for five years was just max out my imagination,\" Gilroy said.",
      "Mothma is among the \u201cRogue One\u201d characters who appeared in the first season and return for the second, along with Forest Whittaker's radical rebel Saw Gerrera, who this season gives a spine-tingling call to arms that is teased in the trailer: \u201cRevolution,\" he preaches to an underling, \"is not for the sane!\u201d",
      "Season 2 also sees the emergence of \u201cRogue One\u201d characters for the first time in the TV series, including Andor's droid sidekick K-250, played by Alan Tudyk, and Death Star builder Orson Krennic, played by Ben Mendelsohn.",

      "Brand names, not filmmakers or stars, are said to rule the box office these days",
      "NEW YORK -- Brand names, not filmmakers or stars, are said to rule the box office these days. But Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners,\u201d led by twin Michael B. Jordans, proved a bloody exception to modern movie rules, launching with $45.6 million in ticket sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "\u201cSinners,\u201d a Warner Bros. release that cost about $90 million to produce, was a bold gamble on originality \u2014 albeit with genre elements \u2014 and one of the most bankable American directors in Coogler. The \u201cCreed\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d director wrote and produced \u201cSinners,\u201d a 1932-set vampire movie about bootlegging brothers (both played by Jordan) who open a juke joint in their Mississippi hometown.",
      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d the year\u2019s biggest Hollywood hit, followed close behind in second, collecting $41.3 million in its third week of release. That gave Warner Bros., after a handful of disappointments, an enviable one-two punch at the box office with one original, director-driven movie and one IP-based property.",
      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d which Warner Bros. co-produced with Legendary Pictures, has amassed $720.8 million worldwide in three weeks of release.",
      "Pam Abdy and Mike De Luca, co-chairs of Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, celebrated the two films\u2019 resonance with moviegoers. The studio accounted for a remarkable 64% of the domestic box office for the Easter weekend.",
      "\u201cMovies have the power to transport us to worlds only seen on the big screen, and Warner Bros. Pictures remains committed to bringing singular in-theater experiences to audiences looking for bold movies, both original and those based on beloved existing properties,\u201d Abdy and De Luca said in a statement Sunday.",
      "But all eyes were on the performance on \u201cSinners,\u201d which Warner Bros. went to extreme lengths to secure. Abdy and De Luca agreed to give Coogler not just a cut of gross ticket sales but ownership of the film after 25 years \u2014 a virtually unheard of concession.",
      "But Coogler and Jordan, whose collaborations stretch back to \u201cFruitvale Station,\u201d make up one of the industry\u2019s most potent director-actor duos. Reviews (98% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes) were stellar for \u201cSinners\u201d and audiences, too, were enthralled by its supernatural twists. The film earned an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore from moviegoers.",
      "Overseas, \u201cSinners\u201d faced a more uphill battle. It collected $15.4 million in 71 international markets. Domestically, \u201cSinners\u201d attracted a diverse audience: 38% Black, 35% white, 18% Hispanic and 5% Asian.",
      "Before \u201cSinners,\u201d dual roles had been rough business for Warner Bros. The studio saw flops in both \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d (a period gangster film featuring a doubled Robert De Niro) and \u201cMickey 17\u201d (a sci-fi movie with two Robert Pattinsons).",
      "But the strong opening for \u201cSinners,\u201d which should be sustained in the coming weeks given the strong word of mouth, cements Coogler\u2019s place as one of a handful of filmmakers whose name draws big audiences. Another would be Jordan Peele, whose \u201cNope\u201d (2022) debuted similarly with $44.3 million.",
      "Angel Studios\u2019 \u201cThe King of Kings,\u201d an animated tale of Jesus\u2019 life aimed at Christian audiences, capitalized on the Easter weekend, grossing $17.2 million in its second week of release. That was nearly equal to its opening weekend ($19.1 million), and brought \u201cThe King of Kings\u201d to a domestic total of $45.3 million.",
      "Bleecker Street\u2019s \u201cThe Wedding Banquet,\u201d Andrew Ahn\u2019s reimagining of Ang Lee\u2019s 1993 queer comedy of errors, opened on 1,142 North American screens with $922,906 in ticket sales. \u201cThe Wedding Banquet,\u201d a hit at the Sundance Film Festival, stars Lily Gladstone, Bowen Yang, Kelly Marie Tran and newcomer Han Gi-chan.",
      "With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",
      "1. \u201cSinners,\u201d $45.6 million.",
      "2. \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d $41.3 million.",

      "\u201cOn some days, I\u2019m like that was just a blink away. But for the most part, yeah, it feels like a long time because I\u2019ve been waiting. I felt stagnant, I felt stuck for a while, and conflicted,\u201d said the two-time Grammy-nominated artist. \u201cI\u2019m very much approaching this like I\u2019m starting over because that\u2019s how it feels to me. I\u2019ve lived nine lives since I last released \u2026 I\u2019m a whole different person.\u201d",

It's her third album, following 2010\u2019s \u201cNo Boys Allowed,\u201d and is the first of a trilogy set for release this year. Led by the sultry single \u201cBae,\u201d the nine-track album delves into romance and introspection.",
      "\u201cI feel resolved, both with the art and within about stepping back into the light. So, I think that resolve kind of had to be found before I felt confident enough to release the body of work and also unleash myself to the world again,\u201d explained Hilson, who said she\u2019s never stopped recording. \u201cThere were songs in my past that I felt were political moves, songs I didn\u2019t really love that I had to sing \u2026 I didn\u2019t want to feel like that this time around.\u201d",
      "One of those songs was a leaked remix to her popular 2009 single \u201cTurnin Me On\u201d featuring Lil Wayne, which peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. Lyrics included a diss fans perceived to be aimed at Beyonc\u00e9.",
      "Hilson, who had yet to drop her introductory album, \u201cIn A Perfect World,\u201d which debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard Top 200 and No. 1 on Top R&B albums, claimed that she was forced to sing the lines, \u201cShe can sing / But she need to move it to the left, left,\u201d assumed to reference Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cIrreplaceable.\u201d She says she was threatened her album might not be released if she refused.",
      "Last week, Hilson trended on social media following an interview with iHeartMedia\u2019s \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d after recalling the incident. While she has talked about it several times in the past, during that interview, the singer publicly named those involved, including producer Polow Da Don who she was signed to. She did not name singer-songwriter Ester Dean. However, after social media users tagged Dean in posts, she later identified herself.",
      "The ending of a decadelong relationship, a lack of control over her career and the intense, never-ending backlash from the BeyHive triggered depression and led to her retreat from music.",
      "During her time away, the Georgia native embarked on a journey of healing that included therapy, journaling and spiritual retreats.",
      "\u201cThere were some perspectives that I needed to uncover ... untruths, beliefs that I kind of picked up or inherited about myself,\u201d said Hilson, who shifted to acting.",
      "Her comeback has included very selective press, avoiding what she describes as \u201cnew media\u201d outlets such as social media-driven platforms, saying monetization can reward the promotion of gossip or incentivize the creation of lies. The salacious blog culture of the 2010s was a driving force in fanning the flames of her perceived beef with Beyonc\u00e9, who has never publicly commented on the situation.",
      "Hilson \u201ccan definitely operate and navigate within the realm of R&B. She has a fan base,\u201d said Keithan Samuels, founder of the popular website RatedRnB.com. \u201cHer core fan base has matured \u2026 she can navigate within this new era of R&B where there\u2019s a lot of diversity and sound.\u201d",
      "Crafted with unofficial writing camps and records created throughout the years, \u201cWE NEED TO TALK: LOVE\u201d finds Hilson delivering vulnerable and flirty lyrics over a wide range of R&B sounds. Writing on all but one song, she avoided current R&B trends that developed during her absence, citing individuality as a key to her early success. She also believes algorithms have created a culture of musical homogeny, rather than creativity.",
      "There are quintessential \u201cMs. Keri Baby\u201d songs like the fun, Pop&B styled \u201cSomethin (Bout U),\u201d but there\u2019s also the introspective \u201cNaked (Love),\u201d and \u201cSay It,\u201d in which she expresses, \u201cI won\u2019t say I love you / \u2018til you say you love me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very \u2018girl boss\u2019 in my life, right? When it comes to relationships, I prefer to be a lady. I prefer to be approached. \u2026 I prefer for the man to say \u2018I love you\u2019 first. I just prefer for a man to lead,\u201d said Hilson. \u201cI\u2019m really a damsel \u2013 without the distress.\u201d",
      "The bedroom mood is set on the sexy slow jam \u201cScream,\u201d while the bright \u201cWhatever\u201d floats with beautiful stacked harmonies.",
      "\u201cI feel like it\u2019s something I would have written for Whitney. And I actually wrote a song for Whitney that she never was able to record,\u201d said Hilson, who began her career as an in-demand writer whose credits include songs for Chris Brown, Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears. \u201cThis reminds me of a Whitney Houston record, where I think she would be now.\u201d",
      "Samuels of RatedRnB.com says this project is evident of the newfound control Hilson has over her career.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not, to me, an attempt to have this commercial comeback \u2026 it feels more personal,\u201d said Samuels. \u201cThe other two albums, I feel like were more catered to what was current then.\u201d",
      "Hilson says she\u2019s still open to writing for other artists and giving away songs that may not fit her current musical era. She also has a new Lifetime movie, \u201cFame: A Temptations Story,\u201d co-starring Keshia Chant\u00e9, premiering April 26 at 8 p.m. EDT. Hilson says acting is now an equal part of her career.",
      "Though Hilson may be cautiously re-emerging musically, fans are welcoming her return. After The Breakfast Club interview, fans flooded her with sympathy and positivity, possibly due to a combination of her finally telling her side of the story in detail, as well as the passing of time. Some fans said they forgot about the incident or were too young to know about it.",
      "\u201cI just control what I can control \u2026 I control what I allow to bring me up or down. These are realizations that I\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been away,\u201d said Hilson. \u201cI feel unburdened \u2026 I\u2019m not projecting too much of the past onto now, and all of that is freeing.\u201d",

      "Judge Paul Goetz late Thursday ordered that Weinstein be immediately relocated from the city\u2019s notorious Rikers Island jail complex to the prison ward at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan so he can receive necessary medical treatment.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers lobbied for the move as jury selection got underway this week.",
      "They argued in court papers that being locked up in a sometimes freezing jail cell was exacerbating the Oscar-winning producer's health issues, which include chronic myeloid leukemia, diabetes and walking difficulties that require a wheelchair to get in and out of court.",
      "Goetz\u2019s order will remain in effect at least until next Thursday, when he is set to hold a hearing to discuss the matter further.",
      "A different judge, Curtis Farber, is presiding over Weinstein's retrial. The case will resume Monday with more jury selection after nine jurors were picked this week. In all, 12 jurors and six alternates need to be seated.",
      "Weinstein is being tried again on rape and sexual assault charges after New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, last year overturned his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence and ordered a new trial, finding that improper rulings and prejudicial testimony tainted the original one.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "Weinstein has been back and forth numerous times to Bellevue in recent months for treatment of various maladies. At a pretrial hearing in January, he railed against his treatment at Rikers, telling Farber he wanted to \u201cget out of this hellhole as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "Weinstein's lawyers filed a legal claim against New York City last November, alleging he was receiving substandard medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at Rikers. The claim, which seeks $5 million in damages, argues that Weinstein has been returned to Rikers each time before fully recovering at the hospital.",
      "The troubled jail complex has faced growing scrutiny for its mistreatment of detainees and dangerous conditions. Last year, a federal judge cleared the way for a possible federal takeover, finding the city had placed inmates in \u201cunconstitutional danger.\u201d",

      "Hip hop superstar Drake is now complaining about rival rapper Kendrick Lamar's performance of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d at this year's Super Bowl, adding it to his defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group over the diss track and its allegations of pedophilia against Drake.",
      "\u201cThe Recording was performed during the 2025 Super Bowl and broadcast to the largest audience for a Super Bowl halftime show ever, over 133 million people, including millions of children, and millions more who had never before heard the song or any of the songs that preceded it,\" says the amended lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "It adds, \"It was the first, and will hopefully be the last, Super Bowl halftime show orchestrated to assassinate the character of another artist.\u201d",
      "Although Lamar removed the word \u201cpedophile\u201d that's in the track during the halftime show, the fact that it was omitted showed that \u201cnearly everyone understands that it is defamatory,\u201d the suit says. It also alleges Universal Music used financial benefits and leveraged business relationships to secure the headliner spot for Lamar at the Super Bowl, and promoted the performance.",
      "\u201cDrake\u2019s amended complaint makes an already strong case stronger,\u201d his lawyer, Michael Gottlieb, said in a statement. \"Drake will expose the evidence of UMG\u2019s misconduct, and UMG will be held accountable for the consequences of its ill-conceived decisions.\u201d",
      "This year's Super Bowl and its halftime show were the most-watched ever, according to Nielsen.",
      "In a statement responding to the court filing, Universal Music, the parent record label of both artists, continued to deny Drake's allegations.",
      "\u201cDrake, unquestionably one of the world\u2019s most accomplished artists and with whom we\u2019ve enjoyed a 16-year successful relationship, is being misled by his legal representatives into taking one absurd legal step after another,\" the company said. \u201cIt is shameful that these foolish and frivolous legal theatrics continue.\u201d",
      "The amended lawsuit also adds that defamatory portions of \u201cNot Like Us\" were played at the Grammy Awards in February, when the single won five awards, including song and record of the year. The suit claims that Universal Music also helped secure the Grammy nominations and allowed the song to be played at the ceremony.",
      "Drake sued Universal Music, but not Lamar, for undisclosed damages in January, saying the company published and promoted \u201cNot Like Us\u201d despite its false pedophilia allegations and suggestions that listeners should resort to vigilante justice.",
      "The result, the suit says, was intruders shooting a security guard at Drake\u2019s Toronto home and two attempted break-ins there, online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and a decrease in his brand\u2019s value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year. The amended lawsuit also adds more online comments indicating people believe the pedophilia allegations.",
      "Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner with 22 Grammy wins, have been beefing for years. The feud is among the biggest in hip hop in recent years.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year, as both launched diss tracks at each other, including Lamar's \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young / You better not ever go to cell block one,\u201d Lamar raps.",
      "In its motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Universal Music says Drake helped fuel the beef with his own inflammatory diss tracks aimed at Lamar.",
      "\u201cPlaintiff, one of the most successful recording artists of all time, lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated,\" the motion says. \"Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds.\u201d",

      "Corso, the longtime ESPN broadcaster and folksy former coach widely known for his endearing expressions and elaborate headgear picks, is set to retire after a career with the show that began in 1987, ESPN announced Thursday. His final broadcast will be Aug. 30 \u2014 Week 1 of the 2025 college football season \u2014 and the network said additional programming to celebrate Corso is also planned.",

    "story": [
      "Health officials in the Gaza Strip say more than 400 dialysis patients have died during the 18-month Israel-Hamas war because of lack of proper treatment",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Twice a week, Mohamed Attiya\u2019s wheelchair rattles over Gaza\u2019s scarred roads so he can visit the machine that is keeping him alive.",
      "The 54-year-old makes the journey from a temporary shelter west of Gaza City to Shifa Hospital in the city\u2019s north. There, he receives dialysis for the kidney failure he was diagnosed with nearly 15 years ago. But the treatment, limited by the war's destruction and lack of supplies, is not enough to remove all the waste products from his blood.",
      "\u201cIt just brings you back from death,\u201d the father of six said.",
      "Many others like him have not made it. They are some of Gaza\u2019s quieter deaths from the war, with no explosion, no debris. But the toll is striking: Over 400 patients, representing around 40% of all dialysis cases in the territory, have died during the 18-month conflict because of lack of proper treatment, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "That includes 11 patients who have died since the beginning of March, when Israel sealed the territory's 2 million Palestinians off from all imports, including food, medical supplies and fuel. Israeli officials say the aim is to pressure Hamas to release more hostages after Israel ended their ceasefire.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid, declined to comment on the current blockade. It has said in the past that all medical aid is approved for entry when the crossings are open, and that around 45,400 tons of medical equipment have entered Gaza since the start of the war.",
      "Attiya said he needs at least three dialysis sessions every week, at least four hours each time. Now, his two sessions last two or three hours at most.",
      "Israel\u2019s blockade, and its numerous evacuation orders across much of the territory, have challenged his ability to reach regular care.",
      "He has been displaced at least six times since fleeing his home near the northern town of Beit Hanoun in the first weeks of the war. He first stayed in Rafah in the south, then the central city of Deir al-Balah. When the latest ceasefire took effect in January, he moved again to another school in western Gaza City.",
      "Until recently, Attiya walked to the hospital for dialysis. But he says the limited treatment, and soaring prices for the mineral water he should be drinking, have left him in a wheelchair.",
      "His family wheels him through a Gaza that many find difficult to recognize. Much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "\u201cThere is no transportation. Streets are damaged,\u201d Attiya said. \u201cLife is difficult and expensive.\u201d",
      "He said he now has hallucinations because of the high levels of toxins in his blood.",
      "\u201cThe occupation does not care about the suffering or the sick,\u201d he said, referring to Israel and its soldiers.",
      "Six of the seven dialysis centers in Gaza have been destroyed during the war, the World Health Organization said earlier this year, citing the territory\u2019s Health Ministry. The territory had 182 dialysis machines before the war and now has 102. Twenty-seven of them are in northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people rushed home during the two-month ceasefire.",
      "\u201cThese equipment shortages are exacerbated by zero stock levels of kidney medications,\u201d the WHO said.",
      "Israel has raided hospitals on several occasions during the war, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes. Hospital staff deny the allegations and say the raids have gutted the territory's health care system as it struggles to cope with mass casualties from the war.",
      "The Health Ministry says over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel's offensive, without saying how many were civilians or combatants. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.",
      "At Shifa Hospital, the head of the nephrology and dialysis department, Dr. Ghazi al-Yazigi, said at least 417 patients with kidney failure have died in Gaza during the war because of lack of proper treatment.",
      "That\u2019s from among the 1,100 patients when the war began.",
      "Like Attiya, hundreds of dialysis patients across Gaza are now forced to settle for fewer and shorter sessions each week.",
      "\u201cThis leads to complications such as increased levels of toxins and fluid accumulation \u2026 which could lead to death,\u201d al-Yazigi said.",
      "Mohamed Kamel of Gaza City is a new dialysis patient at the hospital after being diagnosed with kidney failure during the war and beginning treatment this year.",
      "These days, \u201cI feel no improvement after each session,\u201d he said during one of his weekly visits.",
      "The father of six children said he no longer has access to filtered water to drink, and even basic running water is scarce. Israel last month cut off the electricity supply to Gaza, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory.",
      "Kamel said he has missed many dialysis sessions. Last year, while sheltering in central Gaza, he missed one because of an Israeli bombing in the area. His condition deteriorated, and the next day he was taken by ambulance to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital.",
      "\u201cThe displacement has had consequences,\u201d Kamel said. \u201cI am tired.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The head of the Environmental Protection Agency says his agency will be providing Mexico a list to complete to stop the flow of sewage from Tijuana",
      "SAN DIEGO -- The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that Mexico must stop the flow of billions of gallons of sewage and toxic chemicals from Tijuana that has polluted the Pacific Ocean off neighboring Southern California, closing beaches and sickening Navy SEALs who train in the water.",
      "Lee Zeldin made the demand during an Earth Day trip to the California-Mexico border, where he toured a plant in San Diego County that treats the sewage as a secondary facility and flew along the frontier to see the Tijuana River. He also was scheduled to meet with SEALs.",
      "Zeldin said that in the next day or so, his agency will present Mexico a to-do list of projects to resolve the decades-long environmental crisis, but he stopped short of specifying how the Trump administration would hold Mexico accountable if it does not act.",
      "The problem is \u201ctop of mind\u201d for President Donald Trump, Zeldin said, while adding that they have not talked about possibly imposing tariffs if nothing is done.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to know whether or not Mexico is going to do its part to resolve it, and then we\u2019ll go from there, as far as strategy and tactics,\u201d Zeldin said.",
      "Alicia B\u00e1rcena, Mexico's Environment and Natural Resources secretary, said her country also wants to resolve the problem. She met with Zeldin the previous evening and said they made progress in finding solutions.",
      "\u201cWe are here because we want to solve this,\u201d B\u00e1rcena said in a statement in Spanish. \u201cNot only so there is no untreated wastewater on Mexican beaches, but in the United States as well.\u201d",
      "The 120-mile (195 km)-long Tijuana River runs near the coast in Mexico and crosses into Southern California, where it flows through Navy-owned land and out to the Pacific.",
      "As Tijuana\u2019s wastewater treatment plants have aged and its population and industry have boomed, an increasing amount of toxins have made their way into the river and into San Diego County \u2014 since 2018, more than 100 billion gallons of raw sewage laden with industrial chemicals and trash.",
      "The pollution has sickened not only swimmers, surfers and lifeguards but also schoolchildren, Border Patrol agents and others who do not even go in the water. Scientists say the sewage is vaporized when it foams up and enters the air people breathe.",
      "The Navy is reviewing whether to relocate its training site for SEAL candidates after the Naval Special Warfare Center reported 1,168 cases of acute gastrointestinal illnesses of its recruits from 2019 to 2023.",
      "California beaches near the border have been closed more often than not over the past four years.",
      "Since 2020 more than $653 million in funds have been allocated to address the issue, but the crisis has continued largely because of delays by the Mexican government, Zeldin said. He added that he and Trump are hopeful that will change under the relatively new administration of President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office last October.",
      "Zeldin said that after meeting with Mexico officials in San Diego for 90 minutes, he was left with the impression that Sheinbaum and her environmental secretary want to have a \u201cstrong collaborative relationship.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s being communicated by the new Mexican president is an intense desire to fully resolve this situation,\u201d Zeldin said. But he made clear that he wants Mexico to step up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way that we are going to stand before the people of California and ask them to have more patience and just bear with all of us as we go through the next 10 or 20 or 30 years of being stuck in 12 feet of raw sewage and not getting anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are all out of patience.\u201d",
      "Flanked by lawmakers from both parties, Zeldin noted that cleanup efforts have rare bipartisan support.",
      "Zeldin visited the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant, which was built with funds from both countries to treat 25 million gallons per day as a secondary plant on the U.S. side.",
      "Mexico is working on several wastewater treatment projects to reduce the flow and make major upgrades to its existing plants. B\u00e1rcena said the now-repaired San Antonio de los Buenos plant, which went back to operating at full capacity this month, should make a difference.",
      "But Zeldin said Mexico must complete a number of other projects, including installing floodgates to collect trash in Tijuana. Another one being considered would divert 10 million gallons of sewage away from the shore.",

      "The state began selling its own generic version of Narcan last year for $24 per twin-pack to businesses and local governments, and will now also sell to individual consumers online. A box containing two doses of naloxone nasal spray costs between $45 and $70 from regular pharmacies and online marketplaces.",
      "Opioid overdose deaths, which are caused by heroin, fentanyl and oxycodone, have increased dramatically in California and across the country in recent years, reaching 7,847 in the state in 2023. But California officials say they have started to see a decline in these deaths.",
      "The move is part of a broader push by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to try to force drug companies to lower their prices by offering cheaper, competing versions of medication under the state's CalRx label.",
      "\u201cLife-saving medications shouldn\u2019t come with a life-altering price tag. CalRx is about making essential drugs like naloxone affordable and accessible for all \u2014 not the privileged few,\u201d Newsom said in a statement.",
      "Naloxone, which can reverse overdoses of opioids, has been available in the U.S. without a prescription since March of 2023, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Narcan, a nasal spray brand produced by the Maryland-based pharmaceutical company Emergent BioSolutions.",

      "WINDHOEK, Namibia -- Susan de Meyer's horses have different effects on different children. Hyperactive kids learn to be a little quieter around them while nonverbal children are moved to communicate and to bond with them.",
      "De Meyer runs a program in the southern African country of Namibia that harnesses the power but also the gentleness of horses to help children with learning disabilities and conditions like ADHD and autism.",
      "Each weekday morning, de Meyer's dusty paddock just outside the capital, Windhoek, is enlivened by a group of eight to 10 children from one of the special schools she helps. The children ride the horses, groom them, stroke them and often, de Meyer says, talk to them.",
      "De Meyer grew up on a farm surrounded by horses and they've always been part of her life. She said they have a quality that is invaluable: They don't judge the children, no matter how different they are.",
      "\u201cThe horse is the hero in this whole situation because these kids don\u2019t want to be around a lot of people,\" de Meyer said.",
      "De Meyer's program, \"Enabling Through the Horse,\" is supported by the Namibian Equestrian Federation and won an award last year from the International Equestrian Federation because it \u201cunderlines the wonderful characteristics of the horse in exuding sensitivity and intuition.\u201d",
      "Horse therapy has been promoted by autism groups and those that work with children with learning disabilities as having a positive impact. And animal therapy in general has been found to be useful in many instances, like dogs that help military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and therapy cats that are taken to hospitals and nursing homes.",
      "Some survivors of the devastating 2023 Hawaii wildfires found relief in horse therapy while grieving loved ones they had lost.",
      "De Meyer jokes she has \u201ctwo-and-a-half horses.\u201d These include two Arabians \u2014 a white mare named Faranah and a brown gelding, Lansha \u2014 while the \u201chalf\u201d is a miniature horse called Bonzi, who is about head-high for a 5-year-old.",
      "The Arabians are often the most useful for the children's therapy because of their size, de Meyer said.",
      "\u201cIt gives them self-esteem. When they stroke the horse, the therapy starts because this is a very big animal compared to their height, and they are not scared to stroke the horse ... and then to ride it and tell the horse what they want,\u201d she said.",
      "De Meyer works with children with a range of conditions or disabilities, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Down syndrome, those who are nonverbal or touch sensitive, and some who were born with fetal alcohol syndrome and have developmental problems.",
      "She has received interest from other countries in Africa and Asia to start similar programs there.",
      "\u201cThe changes that I\u2019ve seen with the learners are significant,\u201d said Chriszell Louw, a teacher at Dagbreek School, which says it is one of just two government schools in Namibia for children with intellectual disabilities. \u201cWe have a learner that likes to talk a lot. When we come here, she knows she has to keep quiet. She sits in her place.\u201d",
      "\"Some of them you see they are more open, they are happy. Some of them were very scared when they started with the horse riding but now they are very excited. When they hear we\u2019re going to the horses they are very excited and just want to go by themselves,\u201d Louw said.",
      "De Meyer said her program helps with fine-motor skills, gross-motor skills, muscle strengthening, coordination, balance and posture, all important for kids who struggle to sit at a desk at school and learn.",
      "One simple exercise de Meyer has children do when they ride is to let go of the reins and stretch their arms out straight and to the sides, using only their torso and lower body to balance as a groom leads the horse around the paddock.",
      "Some of the kids break out in smiles when they let go and look like they're soaring.",

      "America\u2019s two largest retailers want to deliver prescriptions to your doorstep, sometimes in a matter of hours",
      "America\u2019s two largest retailers want to deliver prescriptions to your doorstep in as little as a few hours.",
      "Amazon and Walmart are undergoing national expansions in same-day prescription deliveries. They\u2019re joining a trend that has gained momentum since the COVID-19 pandemic, with drugstore chains and companies like Instacart and DoorDash rushing to deliver prescriptions as soon as possible.",
      "Fast prescription delivery options are growing as traditional drugstores close and more people use telemedicine or subscription-based care that encourages regular deliveries.",
      "But this trend may run into limits in the complicated U.S. health care system, where drug costs and coverage can outweigh convenience for consumers, some of whom still like visiting a store.",
      "\u201cIt takes a lot to change people\u2019s behavior when it comes to their health care,\u201d said Arielle Trzcinski, a principal analyst with the consulting firm Forrester.",
      "Independent drugstores have done same-day deliveries for years, especially for patients who are homebound or recovering from surgeries, said Brigid Groves, a vice president with the American Pharmacists Association.",
      "CVS Health started same-day deliveries in 2017 and has since expanded its reach. The chain delivered more than 4 million prescriptions through that service in 2023.",
      "Walgreens also does this nationally and offers a service at hundreds of locations that will deliver within two hours.",
      "Instacart got into prescription deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic when it started a partnership with Costco. The grocery delivery company has since launched same-day delivery partnerships with Wegmans and Publix.",
      "Amazon expects to offer same-day prescription deliveries to nearly half of its U.S. customers by the end of this year. It\u2019s adding 20 small pharmacies to distribution centers around the country to improve delivery speeds.",
      "Separately, the company also has opened 10 prescription processing centers in the past few years. It can do same-day deliveries from those as well.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re building a modern pharmacy, what we like to think of as a pharmacy in your pocket,\u201d Amazon executive Hannah McClellan said at a company presentation last fall.",
      "The Amazon Pharmacy vice president added that this included rapid deliveries and around-the-clock access to pharmacists.",
      "Walmart launched same-day deliveries last fall in six states and expanded earlier this year to every state except North Dakota, where it has no pharmacies. The company allows customers to get their medicines along with groceries or other store items.",
      "It offers several levels of service, including some deliveries in a half hour.",
      "Customer demand drove Walmart\u2019s expansion, said Kevin Host, a pharmacy senior vice president. He said prescription deliveries were the top thing customers requested when surveyed by the company.",
      "Host noted that most people pick a pharmacy based on how close it is to their home or whether it has a drive-through window.",
      "\u201cThis is just elevating that level of convenience,\u201d he said.",
      "Same-day deliveries can help people get started quicker on antibiotics or COVID-19 treatments when they are sick and see a doctor via telemedicine.",
      "McClellan also said that customers who get their prescriptions quickly are more likely to take them. She said Amazon was doubling down on same-day deliveries this year and has \u201cbig plans to continue to build and scale those capabilities in the years to come.\u201d",
      "Patients may like convenience, but they like saving money even more.",
      "Same-day deliveries can come with additional fees. People who consider them will want to know whether they are getting a better deal on their medicines, Trczinski said. She noted that this is especially true with so-called maintenance prescriptions that are refilled repeatedly.",
      "People with insurance who are taking those maintenance drugs may already have them delivered, noted Andrew Mulcahy, a senior health economist with the nonprofit research organization RAND Corp.",
      "\u201cThe practical implications of these kinds of programs will be very muted,\u201d he said.",
      "Customers also will have to trust that their regular prescriptions get delivered on time and are covered by their health insurer, especially if they switch pharmacies for deliveries. Some pharmacy benefit managers limit coverage outside certain pharmacies.",
      "Drugstore pharmacists also have started providing more care and working with customers to manage conditions like high blood pressure. These things give people more reasons to visit a store.",
      "Plus, some people just prefer going to drugstores. Don Watson says he might consider prescription deliveries \u201cmaybe 10 years from now when I\u2019m not able to do it myself.\u201d",
      "The 72-year-old Indianapolis resident said as he left a Walgreens store recently that he has no problem picking up prescriptions.",
      "\u201cSometimes the wait can be a little long \u2026 that\u2019s my only gripe,\u201d he said.",

      "Allergy season can be miserable for tens of millions of Americans each year",
      "ATLANTA -- ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Allergy season can be miserable for tens of millions of Americans when trees, grass, and other pollens cause runny noses, itchy eyes, coughing and sneezing.",
      "Where you live, what you\u2019re allergic to and your lifestyle can make a big difference when it comes to the severity of your allergies. Experts say climate change is leading to longer and more intense allergy seasons, but also point out that treatments for seasonal allergies have become more effective over the last decade.",
      "Here are some tips from experts to keep allergy symptoms at bay \u2014 maybe even enough to allow you to enjoy the outdoors.",
      "The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America issues an annual ranking of the most challenging cities to live in if you have allergies, based on over-the-counter medicine use, pollen counts and the number of available allergy specialists.",
      "This year, the top five cities are: Wichita, Kansas; New Orleans; Oklahoma City; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Memphis.",
      "There are three main types of pollen. Earlier in the spring, tree pollen is the main culprit. After that grasses pollinate, followed by weeds in the late summer and early fall.",
      "Some of the most common tree pollens that cause allergies include birch, cedar, cottonwood, maple, elm, oak and walnut, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Grasses that cause symptoms include Bermuda, Johnson, rye and Kentucky bluegrass.",
      "Pollen trackers can help you decide when to go outside. The American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology tracks levels through a network of counting stations across the U.S. Counts are available at its website and via email.",
      "The best and first step to controlling allergies is avoiding exposure. Keep the windows in your car and your home closed, even when it\u2019s nice outside.",
      "If you go outside, wearing long sleeves can keep pollen off your skin to help ward off allergic reactions, said Dr. James Baker, an allergist at the University of Michigan. It also provides some sun protection, he added.",
      "When you get home, change your clothes and shower daily to ensure all the pollen is off of you \u2014 including your hair. If you can\u2019t wash your hair every day, try covering it when you go outside with a hat or scarf. Don\u2019t get in the bed with your outside clothes on, because the pollen will follow.",
      "It's also useful to rinse your eyes and nose with saline to remove any pollen, experts said. And the same masks that got us through the pandemic can protect you from allergies \u2014 though they won\u2019t help with eye symptoms.",
      "Over-the-counter nasal sprays are among the most effective treatments for seasonal allergies, experts said.",
      "But the vast majority of patients use them incorrectly, irritating parts of the nose, said Dr. Kathleen Mays, an allergist at Augusta University in Georgia. She suggested angling the nozzle outward toward your ear rather than sticking it straight up your nose.",
      "Over-the-counter allergy pills like Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec are helpful, but may not be as effective as quickly since they're taken by mouth, experts said.",
      "Experts also said that if your allergy symptoms are impacting your quality of life, like causing you to lose sleep or a lack focus at work or school, it might be time to consider an allergist appointment for immunotherapies.",
      "Some remedies for allergy relief that have been circulating on social media or suggested by celebrities \u2014 like incorporating local honey into your diet to expose yourself to pollen \u2014 have been debunked.",
      "Dr. Shayam Joshi, an allergist at Oregon Health and Science University, said that's because the flowers that bees pollinate typically don't contain the airborne pollen that causes allergy symptoms.",
      "With climate change, winters are milder and growing seasons are longer, meaning there\u2019s more opportunity for pollen to stay in the air, resulting in longer and more severe allergy seasons.",
      "In many areas across the country, pollen counts have broken decades of records. In late March, the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Center measured a pollen count of over 14,000 grains per cubic meter, which is considered extremely high.",

    "story": [
      "First, the nation\u2019s top law firms",
      "WASHINGTON -- First the nation\u2019s top law firms. Then its premier universities. Now, President Donald Trump is leaning on the advocacy groups that underpin U.S. civil society.",
      "Trump said Thursday that the administration is looking at the tax-exempt status not just of Harvard, but environmental groups and specifically the ethics watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. It could be a devastating financial blow to the nonprofit organizations \u2014 and his perceived political foes.",
      "The president\u2019s remarks, during an event at the White House, began to confirm what advocacy groups have been quietly warning: Trump\u2019s campaign of retribution is coming next for them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a charitable organization,\u201d Trump said about CREW, in particular. \u201cThe only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. So we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at a lot of things.\u201d",
      "Trump and his team have been working their way through the nation\u2019s institutions, threatening to chisel away at the independence and autonomy of the law firms, college campuses and now advocacy groups \u2014 or putting them at risk of losing their federal funds or professional livelihood.",
      "It's all coming quickly, not yet 100 days into the new administration, and in ways historically unheard of in this country for their speed and scope. And it's sending shock waves reverberating throughout the American system.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day in this country when organizations that provide critical services to their communities are under attack from their government,\u201d said Cole Leiter, executive director of the advocacy group Americans Against Government Censorship. \u201cNo administration, Republican or Democratic, should be able to weaponize the weight of the government against their political enemies.\"",
      "On their own, Trump's actions are an almost daily list of executive pronouncements from the White House. The Trump administration has issued orders against the law firms that had cases or attorneys perceived to be against him, and it has made demands of the universities over their rules around campus activism.",
      "Thursday brought potentially more to the stack: Trump singled out CREW, the watchdog group whose founder, Norm Eisen, played a pivotal role in Trump\u2019s first impeachment, and the environmental groups that largely stand at odds with his \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d agenda.",
      "\u201cTax exempt status \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a privilege. It\u2019s really a privilege, and it\u2019s been abused by a lot more than Harvard,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be making some statements. It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d",
      "But taken together, the executive orders and actions and memos are making one thing clear: The Trump administration is eager to test new ways to flex executive power, and dare the courts and Congress to intervene. And there\u2019s more expected to come.",
      "Environmental, immigration and civil society advocacy groups have been bracing for potential threats to their tax-exempt status, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. The person said some expect Trump might start taking action against the environmental groups on Earth Day, which is Tuesday.",
      "These are the largely nonprofit organizations and groups, many based in Washington, advocating for various communities, constituencies and causes.",
      "Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said environmental groups have heard that the Trump administration is preparing executive orders targeting the tax status of environmental groups that work on climate change, as well as that of any foundations that fund their work.",
      "\u201cTrump is marshaling all the power of government to punish his perceived enemies,\" Suckling said. \"We\u2019ve got a crack legal team and will have him in court within 24 hours. We\u2019re ready and waiting for him to come at us.\u201d",
      "CREW has been a leading ethics group in Washington, with Trump long the subject of its probes.",
      "Ahead of the 2024 election, the group was part of the legal effort to disqualify Trump from regaining the White House under the 14th Amendment, in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. More recently, CREW sued over the firing of federal workers by Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\u201cFor more than 20 years, CREW has exposed government corruption from politicians of both parties who violate the public trust and has worked to promote an ethical, transparent government,\" said Jordan Libowitz, the organization's vice president.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on civil society have created a climate that is potentially chilling for the organizations in question \u2014 but they have had mixed results.",
      "Five of the major law firms and Trump reached a deal in which they agreed to provide a combined hundreds of millions of dollars in pro bono counsel to causes the administration says it supports. The firms are trying to avoid various sanctions, including terminated federal contracts, federal employment investigations over diversity hiring and others.",
      "While Columbia University agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s demands to overhaul its rules for public protests rather than risk billions of dollars in lost federal funds, Harvard rebuffed the administration and now faces a $2 billion federal funding freeze and the threat to its tax-exempt status.",
      "The tax-exempt status allows nonprofit organizations to receive donations that are crucial to their financial bottom line. Changing that could, in some situations, lead to calamity.",
      "\u201cGood governance groups are the heart of a healthy democracy,\" Libowitz said. \"We will continue to do our work to ensure Americans have an ethical and accountable government.\u201d",

      "Taking a mental health leave from work is becoming more of an option for people in the United States even thought most of them probably don't know it",
      "NEW YORK -- Her first panic attack came at a company-wide meeting, right before her scheduled presentation. Carolina Lasso had given many similar talks about her marketing team's accomplishments. When her name was called this time, she couldn\u2019t speak.",
      "\u201cI felt a knot in my throat,\u201d Lasso said. \u201cMy head, it felt like it was inside a bubble. I couldn\u2019t hear, I couldn\u2019t see, and it felt like an eternity. It was just a few seconds, but it was so profound, and in a way earth-shattering to me.\u201d",
      "Lasso was struggling after a cross-country move followed by a divorce. Her boss suggested a mental health leave, a possibility she didn\u2019t know existed. She worried whether taking time off would affect how her team viewed her or cost her a future promotion, but in the end she did.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thankful for that opportunity to take the time to heal,\" Lasso, 43, said. \u201cMany people feel guilty when they take a leave of absence when it\u2019s mental health-related. ... There is some extra weight that we carry on our shoulders, as if it had been our fault.\u201d",
      "Despite a fear of repercussions, more adults are recognizing that stepping back from work to deal with emotional burdens or psychological conditions that get in the way of their lives is a necessary choice, one that a growing number of employers recognize.",
      "ComPsych Corp., a provider of employee mental health programs and absence management services, encourages its business clients to make the well-being of workers a priority before individuals get to a breaking point while also having processes in place for those who require leaves of absence.",
      "\u201cSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, collectively we\u2019ve just been in this constant state of turmoil,\u201d Jennifer Birdsall, the senior clinical director at ComPysch, said. \u201cWe just have had this barrage of change and uncertainty.\u201d",
      "Depression, anxiety and adjustment disorder, which involves excessive reactions to stress, were the top three diagnoses of employees who took mental health leaves in the past two years among clients of Alight, a Chicago-based technology company which administers leaves and benefits for large employers.",
      "A mental health leave can last weeks or months. In some cases, workers get approval to work a reduced schedule or to take short periods of time off when needed, using an approach called \u201cintermittent leave.\u201d",
      "At most U.S. organizations with 50 or more employees, people can request leaves through the Family and Medical Leave Act. The federal law entitles workers with serious health conditions to paid or unpaid leaves of up to 12 weeks, depending on state and local laws.",
      "Some employers require people to use sick days or accumulated vacation days to continue receiving a paycheck while out. For longer leaves, workers can access short-term disability plans, if their employer offers one.",
      "Lasso's leave lasted six months, and included therapy and travel to India for additional treatment. She returned to her job but decided after a year to leave for good. She later launched a business to train people on fostering a more humane work culture.",
      "A mental health leave is \u201cnot only OK, but it can really unlock new possibilities once we have the time to do the work \u2014 therapy, medication, whatever it is \u2014 and have enough distance from work to be able to reconnect with ourselves,\u201d Lasso said.",
      "A social stigma around mental health challenges causes many people to avoid seeking treatment or requesting a leave of absence. Newton Cheng, director of health and performance at Google, hopes to change that by sharing his own struggles.",
      "His first self-disclosure happened during the pandemic, when a senior manager invited employees at a meeting to share how they were doing. When it was his turn, Cheng started crying.",
      "He explained he was struggling to live up to his expectations of himself as a father and didn't know how to turn things around.",
      "\u201cIt was just totally horrifying to me because, one, I had just cried in front of my coworkers and I was definitely taught as a professional \u2014 and as a man \u2014 you do not do that,\" Cheng recalled. \"And then two, I had never really articulated and said out loud those words. I hadn\u2019t even allowed myself to think that. But now they\u2019re out there and I had to face them.\u201d",
      "Colleagues responded by relaying their own struggles, but Cheng's difficulties continued. By February 2021, he couldn't get out of bed because he felt paralyzed by dread, he said. A therapist said he was showing symptoms of major depression and anxiety.",
      "\u201cI just realized, \u2018I\u2019m struggling a lot and this goes pretty deep. I don\u2019t think I can keep just putting duct tape on this. I probably need to take some leave,\u2019\u201d Cheng recalled.",
      "Hoping his decision would benefit others, he announced to 200 people at a conference that he planned to take mental health leave. Instead of derailing the gathering as he feared, his honesty inspired fellow conference attendees to open up.",
      "\"It was like a fireworks show,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe he did that.\u2019 Then they forgot about me. But the tone was set. It was like \u2019Oh, this is what we\u2019re doing. Let me talk about what\u2019s going on with me, too.'\u201d",
      "While balancing classes and a full-time job during her last year of college, Rosalie Mae began struggling to get out of bed and crying uncontrollably. Yet she felt like she had \u201cto keep it together\u201d to avoid burdening her colleagues at the University of Utah bookstore, where Mae worked as an accounting clerk.",
      "Then she found herself calling a suicide hotline. \u201cOnce it reached that point, I knew, especially at the urging of my husband, we need to do something more,\u201d Mae, 24, said.",
      "In her case, that meant taking a five-week work leave to put her own health and well-being first. She recommends the same for others who find themselves in a similar position.",
      "\u201cTaking a mental health leave is not necessarily a cure-all, but it is important to give yourself a break and allow yourself to regroup, make a plan of how to proceed and take the steps to work towards feeling better,\" Mae said.",
      "Before broaching the subject of a mental health leave with a manager, consider the workplace culture and the strength of your professional relationships, Cheng said. He recalls saying, \u201cFor my health and well-being, and the sake of my family and what's best for the business, the least risky thing for me to do is to go on leave soon.\u201d",
      "Individuals who suspect an unsympathetic reception can simply say, \u201cI need to go on medical leave. I need time to recover,\u201d he advised.",
      "There's also no legal or ethical requirement to tell everyone you work with the nature of your leave.",
      "\u201cYour coworkers don't need to know why,\u201d said Seth Turner, co-founder of AbsenceSoft, a leave and accommodation management solutions provider. \u201cThey just need to know, 'I\u2019m going to be here at this time, and I'm going to be gone at this time, and I'll be back.'\u201d",

      "Sotheby\u2019s auction house announced the sale on Wednesday, Shakespeare's 461st birthday. It said the May 23 sale will be the first time since 1989 that a set of the First, Second, Third and Fourth Folios has been offered at auction as a single lot.",
      "The auction house estimated the sale price at between 3.5 million and 4.5 million pounds.",
      "After Shakespeare\u2019s death in 1616, his plays were collected into a single volume by his friends John Heminges and Henry Condell, actors and shareholders in the playwright\u2019s troupe, the King\u2019s Men.",
      "The First Folio \u2014 fully titled \u201cMr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories & Tragedies\u201d \u2014 contained 36 plays, of which half were published there for the first time. Without the book, scholars say, plays including \u201cMacbeth,\u201d \u201cThe Tempest\u201d and \u201cTwelfth Night\u201d might have been lost. Sotheby\u2019s called the volume \u201cwithout question the most significant publication in the history of English literature.\u201d",
      "About 750 copies were printed in 1623, of which about 230 are known to survive. All but a few are in museums, universities or libraries. One of the few First Folios in private hands sold for $9.9 million at an auction in 2020.",
      "The First Folio proved successful enough that a an updated edition, the Second Folio, was published in 1632, a third in 1663 and a fourth in 1685.",
      "Although the First Folio is regarded as the most valuable, the third is the rarest, with 182 copies known to survive. It is believed the third book\u2019s rarity is because some of the stock was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666.",
      "The Third Folio included seven additional plays, but only one \u2013 \u201cPericles, Prince of Tyre\u201d \u2013 is believed to be by Shakespeare.",

      "The statement from the Geneva-based think tank and event organizer late on Tuesday came after a report published in the Wall Street Journal cited a whistleblower letter alleging financial and ethical misconduct by Schwab, 87, and his wife Hilde.",
      "The newspaper reported that the allegations were sent in an anonymous letter to the board last week and included claims that the Schwab family mixed their personal affairs with Forum resources.",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, the Forum said its board \u2014 which includes former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, Jordan's Queen Rania and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde as members \u2014 agreed to a decision by its risk and audit committee to open the probe.",
      "\u201cWhile the Forum takes these allegations seriously, it emphasizes that they remain unproven, and will await the outcome of the investigation to comment further,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The AP was not immediately able to reach Schwab or a contact person for him.",
      "The allegations emerged two days after the WEF announced Schwab had retired \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d as chairman, and that former Nestle Chairman and CEO Peter Brabeck-Letmathe was taking over as interim chairman.",
      "For decades, the Forum\u2019s annual gathering in Davos has hosted top business executives, government leaders, academics, international organizations, cultural figures, sports legends and celebrities to discuss government policy, deal-making and current affairs.",

      "LONDON -- European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc\u2019s digital competition rules.",
      "The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store.",
      "The commission, which is the EU\u2019s executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrustcases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \u201cperiodic penalty payments,\u201d the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It\u2019s a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \u201cgatekeepers\u201d from cornering digital markets.",
      "The DMA seeks to ensure \u201cthat citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,\u201d Henna Virkkunen, the commission\u2019s executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe decisions adopted today find that both Apple and Meta have taken away this free choice from their users and are required to change their behavior,\u201d Virkkunen said.",
      "Both companies indicated they would appeal.",
      "Apple accused the commission of \u201cunfairly targeting\u201d the iPhone maker, and said it \"continues to move the goal posts\u201d despite the company's efforts to comply with the rules.",
      "Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in a statement that the \u201cCommission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards.\u201d",
      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA\u2019s provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \u201cnon-compliant\u201d conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \u201cspent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\u201cDespite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "The EU\u2019s Meta investigation centered on the company\u2019s strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union\u2019s top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users\u2019 online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta\u2019s model, saying it doesn\u2019t allow users to exercise their right to \u201cfreely consent\u201d to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also including Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp, and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don\u2019t want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it's \u201ccurrently assessing\u201d this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option's impact.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,\" Kaplan said. \"And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.\u201d",

      "BAGHDAD -- An official invitation to new Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa to attend the upcoming Arab League summit in Baghdad has triggered sharp political divisions within Iraq.",
      "Al-Sharaa took power after leading a lightning rebel offensive that unseated his predecessor, Bashar Assad, in December. Since then, he has positioned himself as a statesman aiming to unite and rebuild his country after nearly 14 years of civil war, but his past as a Sunni Islamist militant has left many \u2014 including Shiite groups in Iraq \u2014 wary.",
      "Formerly known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, al-Sharaa joined the ranks of al-Qaida insurgents battling U.S. forces in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and still faces a warrant for his arrest on terrorism charges in Iraq.",
      "Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani confirmed last week that Iraq had extended a formal invitation to al-Sharaa to attend the May 17 summit, following a previously unannounced meeting between the two in Qatar. Al-Sharaa has not confirmed plans to attend.",
      "Iraq, which has strong ties with both the United States and Iran, has sought to position itself as a regional mediator. It hosted talks between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia before they reached a deal to normalize relations.",
      "Many Iraqi and regional stakeholders see the invitation to al-Sharaa as an opportunity to bolster Baghdad\u2019s image as a hub for regional diplomacy.",
      "However, strong opposition to al-Sharaa\u2019s invitation has emerged from powerful Shiite factions aligned with Iran. Tehran, which backed Assad in Syria\u2019s civil war and used Syria as a conduit to smuggle weapons to the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, was widely seen as the biggest loser from Assad\u2019s ouster.",
      "Several Iraqi Shiite militias fought alongside Assad's forces during the civil war that followed his brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2011, making al-Sharaa a particularly sensitive figure for them.",
      "Mustafa Sand, a member of parliament from the Coordination Framework \u2014 a coalition of Iran-allied factions that brought al-Sudani to power in 2022 \u2014 said in a video posted on X, formerly Twitter, that the foreign ministry had reached out to Iraq\u2019s Supreme Judicial Council to verify whether an arrest warrant was issued against al-Sharaa and that the council had confirmed the existence of a valid warrant.",
      "A security official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly confirmed the existence of the warrant to The Associated Press.",
      "The Islamic Dawa Party, led by former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki \u2014 one of the most influential figures in Iraq\u2019s ruling coalition \u2014 called on the government in a statement to \u201censure that any summit participant has a clean judicial record, both locally and internationally,\u201d adding, \u201cThe blood of Iraqis is not cheap, and those who have violated their sanctity or committed documented crimes against them should not be welcomed in Baghdad.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the powerful militia Kataib Hezbollah, Abu Ali Al-Askari, said in a statement, \u201cArab summits have been held without President Assad, Iraq, or Libya. They certainly won\u2019t stop because the criminal Abu Mohammad al-Golani ... isn\u2019t attending.\u201d",
      "On the other side, Sunni political factions have rallied to defend al-Sharaa\u2019s inclusion in the summit. Former MP Dhafir Al-Ani, a prominent Sunni figure, said he supports Baghdad\u2019s attempts to build ties with the new Syrian authorities.",
      "\u201cPreventing his presence would be a stab in the heart of the Iraqi government and a sign that violence still dictates the country\u2019s fate,\u201d he said.",
      "The Iraqi government has not responded publicly to the backlash.",
      "A warrant would not necessarily block al-Sharaa from joining the summit. Other countries have chosen to waive similar measures. In December after Assad\u2019s fall, the United States said it had decided not to pursue a $10 million reward it had previously offered for al-Sharaa\u2019s capture, although Washington also has not yet officially recognized the new Syrian government.",
      "However, observers said the controversy highlights deep divisions within Iraq\u2019s political system and underscores the challenges facing national reconciliation efforts.",
      "\u201cSome see welcoming al-Sharaa as an insult to the memory of Iraq\u2019s victims, while Sunni factions view his participation as a political victory,\u201d said political analyst Munaf Al-Musawi, head of the Baghdad Center for Strategic Studies. \u201cThis could risk fueling sectarian tensions.\u201d",

      "Some European allies are wary of the American proposal. But there\u2019s also acknowledgment by some allies that Russia is firmly entrenched wholly or partially in five regions of Ukraine \u2014 Crimea, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.",
      "If the goal is to obtain a ceasefire immediately, \u201cit should be based on the line of contact as it is,\u201d said a senior French official. The official was not authorized to be publicly named and spoke on the condition of anonymity according to French presidential policy.",

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis had a learning curve on clergy sexual abuse, with the turning point coming in 2018",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Few could have predicted that a comment Pope Francis made during a 2018 visit to Chile would blow up into the biggest crisis of his papacy, and one that eventually set the Catholic Church on a new path of accountability for clergy sexual abuse.",
      "Francis was asked by a TV reporter about a Chilean bishop who had been accused by victims of having covered up the crimes of Chile\u2019s most notorious pedophile. Francis had been defending the bishop for years and shot back that there was \u201cnot one shred of proof against him. It\u2019s all slander. Is that clear?\u201d",
      "His irate response struck a nerve in Chile, which was just beginning to come to terms with a horrific legacy of clergy abuse, and it prompted Francis\u2019 top child protection adviser to sternly rebuke the pope for his harmful words.",
      "But then something remarkable happened: Rather than dig in, Francis commissioned an investigation, realized he was wrong, apologized to the victims he discredited, and got the entire Chilean hierarchy to offer to resign. It was one of the greatest midcourse corrections of the modern papacy.",
      "\u201cHe recognized his mistakes,\u201d said papal biographer Austen Ivereigh. \u201cHe learned from them. He said \u2018sorry.\u2019 And he put it right.\u201d",
      "When Francis was elected history\u2019s first Latin American pontiff in 2013, abuse survivors and their advocates initially questioned whether he \u201cgot it\u201d about abuse, because he freely admitted he had never handled cases of accused priests as archbishop of Buenos Aires.",
      "Francis did create a sex abuse commission early on to advise the church on best practices and placed a trusted official, Boston\u2019s Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, in charge. But the commission lost its influence after a few years and its crowning recommendation \u2014 the creation of a tribunal to judge bishops who covered up for predator priests \u2014 went nowhere.",
      "And then came Chile.",
      "During the now-infamous visit to Iquique, Chile, Francis was asked about Bishop Juan Barros, whom he had transferred to a southern diocese over the objections of the local faithful. Their complaint? Barros had been a priest under the sanctioned Rev. Fernando Karadima, and was accused by Karadima\u2019s victims of having witnessed and covered up the crimes.",
      "Francis had defended Barros because one of his friends and advisers, Chilean Cardinal Javier Errazuriz, also had defended the bishop.",
      "After being pressed on the plane home by journalists about his Barros defense, Francis commissioned an investigation into the Chilean church and realized he had been misled by Errazuriz and others.",
      "Juan Carlos Cruz, one of Karadima\u2019s victims who received the pope\u2019s personal apology that year, later developed a personal friendship with the pontiff.",
      "\u201cHe sincerely wanted to do something and he transmitted that,\u201d Cruz said.",
      "Years later, Francis acknowledged 2018 was the turning point, or \u201cconversion,\u201d in his understanding about abuse, and he credited journalists, including The Associated Press, with enlightening him.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. You were the one on the plane who told me, \u2018No, that\u2019s not the way it is, Father,\u2019\u201d Francis told AP in a 2023 interview. Making a gesture that indicated his head had exploded, the pope continued: \u201cThat\u2019s when the bomb went off, when I saw the corruption of many bishops in this.\u201d",
      "By mid-2018, Francis had largely atoned for the Chile scandal. But then the next crisis hit.",
      "In July of that year, Francis removed once-influential American Cardinal Theodore McCarrick after church investigators said an allegation that he groped a teenage altar boy in the 1970s was credible. Subsequently, several former seminarians and priests reported that they had been abused or harassed by McCarrick as adults.",
      "It was apparently common knowledge in the U.S. and Vatican leadership that \u201cUncle Ted,\u201d as McCarrick was known, slept with seminarians, but he still rose steadily in the church's ranks.",
      "Having removed McCarrick and approved a canonical trial against him, Francis should have emerged as the hero in the saga since he righted the wrong of St. John Paul II, who had promoted McCarrick despite his reputation.",
      "But Francis\u2019 get-tough victory lap was cut short when a former Vatican ambassador to the U.S. accused the pope himself of participating in the McCarrick cover-up.",
      "In an 11-page denunciation in August 2018, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano claimed he had told Francis in 2013, at the start of his pontificate, that McCarrick had \u201ccorrupted a generation\u201d of seminarians and priests and that Pope Benedict XVI had eventually sanctioned McCarrick for his sexual misconduct. Vigano claimed Francis disregarded his 2013 warning and rehabilitated McCarrick. He called on Francis to resign.",
      "Francis didn\u2019t initially respond. But he authorized a two-year investigation into McCarrick, finding that bishops, cardinals and popes over three decades played down or dismissed multiple reports of sexual misconduct against him. The report largely spared Francis and instead found that Vigano had failed in monitoring McCarrick while he was U.S. ambassador.",
      "McCarrick died earlier this month; Francis excommunicated Vigano last year for schism.",
      "The crisis prompted Francis to take even bolder action to hold the hierarchy accountable for covering up abuse. In 2019, he summoned the heads of bishops' conferences from around the world to the Vatican to impress on them the need to act to prevent abuse and punish offending priests.",
      "He changed church law to remove the \u201cpontifical secret\u201d covering abuse cases and passed a law requiring church personnel to report allegations in-house, although not to police. He approved procedures to investigate bishops who abused or covered up for their pedophile priests, seeking to end the tradition of impunity for the hierarchy.",
      "Ivereigh, the papal biographer, said those reforms were the result of Francis\u2019 learning curve on abuse.",
      "\u201cI think he understood that at the root of the sex abuse crisis was a culture and a mindset which he constantly called clericalism, a sense of entitlement, and which led not only to ultimately to abuse of power and sexual abuse, but its cover up,\u201d Ivereigh said.",
      "But questions continued to dog Francis even after the scandal passed.",
      "One case that haunted him for years was that of Argentine Bishop Gustavo Zanchetta, who was accused, and eventually convicted, in an Argentine court of abusing his seminarians. Francis had created a job for Zanchetta at the Vatican after he had been accused of misconduct, spiriting him out of Argentina for purported \u201chealth\u201d reasons.",
      "Francis never responded to questions about the Rev. Julio Grassi, who was Argentina\u2019s most notorious clerical sexual abuser. While Francis was archbishop of Buenos Aires, he commissioned a study into Grassi\u2019s conviction that concluded he was innocent, that his victims were lying, and that the case never should have gone to trial. Argentina\u2019s supreme court upheld the conviction.",
      "\u201cBefore Pope Francis can enact accountability for bishops and other church leaders, he has to own up to the harm he himself caused victims in Argentina,\u201d said Anne Barrett Doyle of the online resource Bishop Accountability, which pressed Francis to get even tougher about abuse and cover-ups throughout his pontificate.",

      "Thousands of people are filing through the central aisle of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to pay their final respects to Pope Francis",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Thousands of people filed through the central aisle of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to pay their final respects to Pope Francis on Wednesday, the start of three days of public viewing ahead of the pontiff's funeral.",
      "Throngs of ordinary faithful made their way slowly to the 16th-century basilica's main altar, where Francis' simple wooden casket was perched on a slight ramp, as four Swiss Guards stood at attention. Over the coming days, tens of thousands of people are expected to pass through the basilica, which is staying open until midnight to accommodate them.",
      "Cardinals, meanwhile, met in private to finalize preparations for Saturday's funeral and plan the conclave to elect Francis' successor.",
      "Francis died on Monday at age 88, capping a 12-year pontificate characterized by his concern for the poor and message of inclusion, but also some criticism from conservatives who sometimes felt alienated by his progressive bent.",
      "Wednesday opened with the bells of St. Peter\u2019s tolling as pallbearers carried Francis' body from the Vatican hotel where he lived into the basilica in a procession through the same piazza where he had delivered what became his final goodbye. Francis made a surprise popemobile tour through the faithful on Easter Sunday, after being assured by his nurse he could despite his continued frail health from a bout of pneumonia.",
      "Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who is running the Vatican temporarily until a new pope is elected, led the procession down the central aisle to the altar, with clouds of incense preceding him and the choir chanting the Litany of Saints hymn. In pairs, cardinals in red cassocks approached the casket, bowed and made a sign of the cross, followed by small groups of purple-robbed bishops, black-clad ushers, priests and nuns \u2014 and then the doors were thrown open to the public.",
      "Heads of state are expected for Francis' funeral, but the three days of public viewing in the basilica allow ordinary Catholics to grieve the Argentine pope. The viewing ends Friday at 7 p.m., after which Francis' casket will be closed and sealed.",
      "Francis' death and funeral inaugurates a carefully orchestrated period of transition in the 1.4 billion-strong Catholic Church, with cardinals gathering over the coming days before entering into a conclave, the secretive ritual voting in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope. There are 135 cardinals under age 80 and eligible to vote, and the new pontiff will likely come from within their ranks. The conclave is not expected to begin before May 5.",
      "South Korean Cardinal Lazarus You Heung-sik, who heads the Vatican's office for priests, predicted a short conclave, but acknowledged the transition is full of uncertainties.",
      "\u201cWe'll see what the Holy Spirit says,\u201d he said Wednesday. Asked if the next pope could come from Asia, where the Catholic Church is growing, he insisted: \u201cFor the Lord, there's no East or West.\u201d",
      "Papua New Guinea\u2019s first and only cardinal, John Ribat, prepared Wednesday to leave for Rome to participate in the vote, pleased to represent the poor South Pacific island nation of 12 million people and more than 800 languages in a College of Cardinals that Francis greatly diversified over 12 years.",
      "\u201cThe important thing is that \u2026 Papua New Guinea is part of the church, the global church. And to be able to have a representative from here to be in the conclave, it is a big thing,\u201d Ribart told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. He said he hoped the next pope would be someone who could lead the church in \u201ca way that is truthful and binds everyone together.\u201d",
      "Francis first lay in state in the Domus Santa Marta hotel in a private viewing for Vatican residents and the papal household. Images released by the Vatican on Tuesday showed the pope in an open casket, wearing the traditional pointed headdress of bishops and red robes, his hands folded over a rosary. The Vatican\u2019s No. 2, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, was pictured praying by Francis.",
      "Once inside the basilica, Francis' casket wasn't put on an elevated bier \u2014 as was the case with past popes \u2014 but placed on a ramp, facing the pews. It was in keeping with Francis' wishes for all the rituals surrounding a papal funeral to be simplified to reflect his belief that the pope's role is that of simple pastor, not world leader.",
      "\u201cFor me, Pope Francis represents a great pastor, as well as a great friend to all of us,\u2019\u2019 said Micale Sales, visiting St. Peter\u2019s Basilica from Brazil.",
      "Italian police have tightened security for the viewing and the funeral, carrying out foot and horse patrols around the Vatican, where pilgrims continued to arrive for the Holy Year celebrations that Francis opened in December. The faithful who walk through St. Peter\u2019s Holy Door during such years are granted indulgences, a way to help atone for sins.",
      "\u201cI think he spread a positive message around the world, saying there shouldn\u2019t be any violence, there should be peace around the world,\u2019\u2019 said Amit Kukreja, from Australia.",
      "The funeral has been set for Saturday at 10 a.m. in St. Peter\u2019s Square, and will be attended by leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Cardinals are continuing their meetings this week to plan the conclave and make other decisions about running the Catholic Church.",
      "History\u2019s first Latin American pontiff charmed the world with his humble style and concern for the poor but alienated many conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change.",
      "Francis had some reservations about his final popemobile tour through St. Peter\u2019s Square on Easter, Vatican News reported on Tuesday. But he overcame them, the news agency said, and was thankful that he had greeted the crowd. He died the next morning.",
      "\u201cThe death of a pope is not a small thing, because we\u2019ve lost our leader,\u2019\u2019 Julio Henrique from Brazil said just outside the basilica. \u201cBut still, in a few days, we will have a new leader. So \u2026 the thing of hope remains. Who will assume Peter\u2019s throne?\u201d",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Yemen's Houthi rebels launched a missile early Wednesday toward northern Israel, a rare target for the group as a monthlong intense U.S. airstrike campaign continues to target them.",
      "Sirens sounded in Haifa, Krayot and other areas west of the Sea of Galilee, the Israeli military said.",
      "\u201cAn interceptor was launched toward the missile, and the missile was most likely successfully intercepted,\u201d the Israeli military said.",
      "Those in the area could here booms in the predawn darkness.",
      "The Houthis did not immediately claim the attack, though it can take them hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults.",
      "American airstrikes, meanwhile, continued targeting the Houthis on Wednesday morning, part of a campaign that began on March 15. The Houthis reported strikes on Hodeida, Marib and Saada governorates. In Marib, the Houthis described a strike hitting telecommunication equipment, which has previously been a target of the Americans.",
      "The U.S. military's Central Command did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The U.S. is targeting the Houthis because of the group\u2019s attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a crucial global trade route, and on Israel. The Houthis are the last militant group in Iran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d that is capable of regularly attacking Israel.",
      "The new U.S. operation against the Houthis under President Donald Trump is more extensive than attacks on the group were under President Joe Biden, an AP review found. The new campaign started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid from entering the Gaza Strip.",
      "From November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually. The Houthis also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.",
      "Assessing the toll of the month-old U.S. airstrike campaign has been difficult because the military hasn\u2019t released information about the attacks, including what was targeted and how many people were killed. The Houthis, meanwhile, strictly control access to attacked areas and don\u2019t publish complete information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites.",
      "Last week, a strike on the Ras Isa fuel port killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others in the deadliest-known attack of the American campaign.",

      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Hundreds of people packed into a Barcelona church on Tuesday to mourn a Spanish family of five who died earlier this month in a sightseeing helicopter crash in New York City and whose bodies were laid to rest in Spain.",
      "As church bells tolled against a brilliant blue sky, mourners gathered and wept quietly as they paid respects to Agust\u00edn Escobar, Merc\u00e8 Camprub\u00ed Montal and their three young children, all of whom were killed on April 11 when a helicopter broke apart midair and crashed into the Hudson River between New York City and New Jersey.",
      "\u201cWe have been in pain for the last 11 days, but they will always remain in our memories and remind us from up high to never lose our ability to smile,\" said the woman's father, Joan Camprub\u00ed, during the funeral service.",
      "He thanked those who attended, which included Catalonia's regional leader Salvador Illa and Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni, and shared memories of his daughter, son-in-law, and three grandchildren. Camprub\u00ed also mentioned the passing of the Pope, saying that the pontiff believed in the transformative power of a \u201csmile and a sense of humor.\u201d",
      "A trip that was intended to celebrate the ninth birthday of the couple's middle child ended up being the family's final moments. Shortly before the flight over the towering skyscrapers of New York City took off, a photo shows Agust\u00edn Escobar flashing a thumbs-up while his wife and children beamed big smiles.",
      "Despite the tragedy, relatives of the Barcelona family on Tuesday recalled the joy that their lost loved ones gave them and the family's love for life. Several dozen people watched the nearly two-hour service on screens set up outside the front entrance of the church, which had reached capacity.",
      "Escobar was global CEO of rail infrastructure at Siemens Mobility while Merc\u00e8 Camprub\u00ed Montal worked for Siemens Energy, a separate company. Camprub\u00ed Montal\u2019s grandfather was a former president of the famous Barcelona FC soccer club. Their children Agust\u00edn, Merc\u00e8 and V\u00edctor were 10, 9 and 4.",
      "The service ended with photos displayed of the family during previous holidays and at family gatherings. As family and friends recalled happier moments in the Barcelona family's life, the song playing was Frank Sinatra's \u201cNew York, New York.\u201d",

      "A panel of Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court justices have started proceedings to determine whether federal officers, retired military officers and an aide of former President Jair Bolsonaro will also stand trial for allegedly attempting to stage a coup",
      "SAO PAULO -- A panel of Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court justices started proceedings on Tuesday morning to determine whether federal officers, retired military officers and an aide of former President Jair Bolsonaro will also stand trial for allegedly attempting to stage a coup.",
      "Last month, the panel unanimously accepted charges against Bolsonaro and seven close allies over an alleged attempt to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and ordered him to stand trial.",
      "When Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet accused Bolsonaro and 33 others of attempting a coup, he divided them into five different groups, based on their roles and positions in the alleged plot.",
      "Bolsonaro and his closest allies, including running mate Gen. Braga Netto, were placed in the \u201ccore group,\u201d according to the charges. Now, the Supreme Court panel will review charges against the second group, which Gonet said held managerial roles.",
      "The second group includes former presidential foreign affairs adviser Filipe Martins, retired Gen. Mario Fernandes, former Federal Highway Police director Silvinei Vasques, former presidential aide Col. Marcelo C\u00e2mara and two federal police officers, Fernando Oliveira and Marilia Alencar.",
      "These individuals coordinated actions planned by the core group, Gonet said in the indictment. These included mobilizing police officers to support the alleged coup, monitoring authorities and drafting a document intended to justify a state of exemption in the country.",
      "If a majority votes in favor, the accused will become defendants in a criminal case.",
      "Bolsonaro and his allies have repeatedly denied wrongdoing. The former president says that he\u2019s being politically persecuted. He has been hospitalized for more than a week, recovering from bowel surgery. On Monday, from his hospital bed in Brasilia, he gave an interview to local television network SBT and said that his trial wasn't technical, but political.",
      "Under Brazilian law, a coup conviction alone carries a sentence of up to 12 years, but when combined with the other charges, it could result in a sentence of decades behind bars. The former president is expected to stand trial in the next few months at Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court.",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Police raids have rescued 33 West Africans from a human trafficking ring in Ivory Coast that lured people into paying fees and providing coerced labor by promising them jobs in Canada, the international police agency Interpol said Tuesday.",
      "Victims paid as much as $9,000 to supposed recruiters who instead trafficked them to the city of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast, where they were held under physical and psychological coercion, the agency said in a statement.",
      "They also were forced to help scam others with the same promise of finding a job abroad by taking photos of themselves in upscale restaurants and hotels and posting them online as though they were in Canada. The traffickers allowed them limited contact with their families to maintain the illusion of living overseas.",
      "The initial raids on two of the locations associated with the trafficking ring were conducted in February in a joint operation between Ivory Coast and Ghana, where some of the victims were from.",
      "The scheme first came to light when the father of two victims came forward to Ghanaian authorities. Victims were from Benin, Burkina Faso, Togo and Ghana.",
      "Youssouf Kouyate, director general of the Ivory Coast National Police, commended the \u201cclose cooperation\u201d with Ghanaian police and Interpol, as well as \u201cthe bravery of the victims who came forward to assist in this investigation.\u201d",
      "After the 33 victims were freed, they were referred to a nongovernmental organization for assessment, the Interpol statement said.",
      "Scams of this type are increasingly common in West Africa and police forces across the region have conducted mass raids in the past including the arrest of over 300 people in 2024.",

      "Greece\u2019s prime minister has announced 1 billion euros in financial benefits for lower-income households and the country\u2019s public investment program",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Greece\u2019s prime minister on Tuesday announced 1 billion euros ($1.15 billion) in financial benefits for lower-income households and the public investment program, after the country became one of the few European Union members to post a budget surplus in 2024.",
      "Only six of the EU\u2019s 27 member nations posted a surplus for 2024, figures released by Eurostat showed. Greece\u2019s surplus of 1.3% of gross domestic product \u2014 compared to an overall EU deficit of 3.2% \u2014 was a marked improvement in financial performance for a country that was deeply mired in a debt crisis that roiled the EU and international financial markets about a decade ago.",
      "The figures \u201crecord a significant overperformance by the national economy and a surplus in state coffers. Which means that, with everyone\u2019s help, we did much better than we expected,\u201d Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a televised address to the nation.",
      "\u201cDynamic growth, along with the fight against tax evasion and a series of other reform measures, brought additional revenue, even above the targets we had set,\u201d Mitsotakis said. \u201cSo despite the strict European fiscal rules, a significant portion of them can now be returned to citizens.\u201d",
      "In order to tackle housing problems, renters will have the cost of one month\u2019s rent returned to them each November, starting this year, Mitsotakis said, while 250 euros (nearly $290) per year will be given at the end of each November to older, disabled and uninsured people.",
      "Finance Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis said that the rent returns will be allocated to households according to annual income levels, and will apply to 948,000 households, or about 80% of renters in Greece, while the 250-euro benefit will apply to a total of 1.4 million people.",
      "An additional 500 million euros ($575 million) per year will be paid into the country\u2019s Public Investment Program to speed up public infrastructure and social projects \u201cand, amidst international instability, to increase investments so that new jobs continue to be created,\u201d he added.",
      "Greece\u2019s fiscal performance has been steadily improving since it began emerging a few years ago from a nearly decade-long financial crisis which saw it lose access to borrowing on the international bond market, leaving it dependent on successive international bailouts. Unemployment skyrocketed as the country saw a quarter of its economy wiped out.",

      "BERLIN -- Walter Frankenstein, who survived the Holocaust by hiding in Berlin with his wife and infant children and spent his later years educating young people to keep the events alive in memory, has died. He was 100.",
      "Klaus Hillenbrand, a close friend who wrote a book about Frankenstein, confirmed the death on Tuesday. He said Frankenstein died on Monday. The foundation that oversees Berlin's Holocaust memorial also confirmed that he died Monday in Stockholm.",
      "Frankenstein was born in 1924 in Flatow in what is now Poland but was then part of Germany. Three years after the Nazis came to power, in 1936, he was no longer allowed to attend the town\u2019s public school because he was Jewish.",
      "With the help of an uncle, his mother sent him to Berlin where he could continue his school education, and he later trained as a bricklayer at the Jewish community\u2019s vocational school. He stayed at the Jewish Auerbach\u2019sche Orphanage where he met Leonie Rosner, who would later become his wife.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press in 2018, Frankenstein described how he witnessed Kristallnacht \u2014 the \u201cNight of Broken Glass\u201d on November 9, 1938, when Nazis, among them many ordinary Germans, terrorized Jews throughout Germany and Austria. They killed at least 91 people and vandalized 7,500 Jewish businesses. They also burned more than 1,400 synagogues, according to Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. Up to 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and taken to concentration camps.",
      "Frankenstein, who was then 14, climbed on the roof of the orphanage and saw fire lighting up the city.",
      "\u201cThen we knew: the synagogues were burning,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next morning, when I had to go to school, there was sparkling, broken glass everywhere on the streets.\u201d",
      "Starting in 1941, Frankenstein had to do forced labor in Berlin, repeatedly threatened by the danger of being deported by the Nazis.",
      "In 1943, five weeks after their son Peter-Uri was born, he went into hiding with his wife, Leonie, as the Nazis were deporting thousands of Jews from Berlin to Auschwitz.",
      "\u201cWe had promised ourselves not to do what Hitler wanted,\u201d Frankenstein told the AP. \u201cSo we went into hiding.\u201d",
      "Together with their baby, the couple spent 25 months in hiding in Berlin. A second son, Michael, was born in 1944, during their time on the run. They stayed with friends or in bombed-out buildings.",
      "Up to 7,000 Berlin Jews had gone into hiding, but only 1,700 of them were able to survive. The others were either arrested, died of illness or perished in air raids.",
      "In 1945, when Berlin was liberated by the Soviet Red Army, Frankenstein\u2019s children were among the youngest of a total of only 25 Jewish children who had survived in Berlin.",
      "Before the Holocaust, Berlin had the biggest Jewish community in Germany. In 1933, the year the Nazis came to power, around 160,500 Jews lived in Berlin. By the end of World War II in 1945 their numbers had diminished to about 7,000 through emigration and extermination.",
      "All in all, some 6 million European Jews were murdered in the Holocaust.",
      "After the collapse of the Nazis\u2019 Third Reich, the Frankensteins immigrated to what was then Palestine and later became Israel. Eleven years later, in 1956, they moved to Sweden, where they settled for good.",
      "Later in life, Walter Frankenstein returned to Germany several times a year. He often talked to schoolchildren about his life and in 2014, he received Germany\u2019s highest honor, the Order of Merit.",
      "He was also an ardent fan of the Hertha Berlin soccer club. As a teenager he went to its games, and when Jews were no longer allowed to visit the stadium he would listen to reports of matches on the radio. In 2018, Frankenstein became an honorary member of the club with the membership number 1924, his year of birth.",
      "Every time Frankenstein traveled to Berlin in his later years, he brought along the small blue case containing the Order of Merit. Inside the case\u2019s lid, he had attached the first \u201cmark\u201d he got from the Germans: the yellow badge, or Jewish star, that he had to wear during the Nazi reign to identify him as a Jew.",
      "\u201cThe first one marked me, the second one honored me,\u201d he said.",

      "U.S. Vice President JD Vance has called for greater collaboration with India in sectors such as defense, energy and technology",
      "NEW DELHI -- U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday called for enhanced engagement with India and said that the South Asian country should buy more defense equipment and energy from the U.S. and allow Washington greater access to its market, lending momentum to an expected bilateral trade deal.",
      "Vance, who is on a four-day visit to India, said that he and Prime Minister Narendra Modi made progress on trade talks during their discussions on Monday, and confirmed that both sides had finalized the terms of reference for the trade negotiation \u2014 a vital step towards setting the road map for the final agreement.",
      "India and the U.S. hope to seal a bilateral trade agreement this year and have set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. If achieved, the trade deal could significantly enhance economic ties between both countries and potentially strengthen diplomatic ties as well.",
      "\u201cI believe there is much that India and America can accomplish together,\u201d Vance said at an event in the western city of Jaipur, where he, his wife Usha Vance and their three children were on a sightseeing tour.",
      "Vance\u2019s first visit to New Delhi came amid the backdrop of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s partially-paused tariff program against most countries, including India. Earlier this month, Trump announced a 90-day pause in which imports from most countries would face a baseline 10% tax so that there was time to hold talks and possibly structure broader deals.",
      "The trade negotiations are especially urgent for India and could help New Delhi avoid sharp U.S. tariffs. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has portrayed its strategy of tariffs as forcing negotiations that could limit the reach and influence of China, the world\u2019s dominant manufacturer and New Delhi\u2019s main rival in the region.",
      "At the event, Vance sought to assuage fears over Trump\u2019s tariff decisions and said his administration was seeking to rebalance global trade so that the U.S., with friends like India, can build a better future. He said that trade relations must be based on fairness.",
      "\u201cI come here with a simple message,\" Vance said. The Trump administration \u201cseeks trade partners on the basis of fairness and shared national interest. We want to build relationships with our foreign partners who respect their workers.\u201d",
      "Vance said that he was in India to strengthen ties between both nations, and criticized previous governments for looking at New Delhi as a cheap source of labor.",
      "\u201cI believe that if India and the United States work together successfully, we are going to see a 21st century that is prosperous and peaceful,\u201d he said, adding that if this didn\u2019t happen, it would mean a \u201cdark time for all humanity.\u201d",
      "Washington has long sought to develop a deeper partnership with New Delhi, which is seen as a bulwark against China. Modi has established a good working relationship with Trump, and the two leaders are likely to further boost cooperation between their countries.",
      "Modi was also among the first leaders to visit the U.S. and hold talks with Trump that kickstarted a negotiation process to minimize the possible fallout of Trump\u2019s tariffs. The two leaders also said they planned to grow their defense partnership.",
      "India is a close partner of the U.S. and is part of the Quad, which is made up of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia, and is seen as a counterbalance to China\u2019s expansion in the region. It is also a major defense partner of the U.S., a status only enjoyed by some of the closest allies of Washington.",
      "In line with Trump\u2019s push for supplying more military equipment to India, Vance said Washington was seeking greater collaboration with New Delhi for the sale of advanced military gear, as well as coproduction. He also pitched Washington's fifth-generation stealth fighter to India.",
      "\u201cF-35 will help protect your people like never before,\u201d he said.",
      "Over the past several decades, India has been largely dependent on Russian weapons, fighters and military equipment, but has gradually started diversifying its purchase basket from countries such as the U.S., France and the U.K.",
      "In recent years, India has embedded advanced American jets, helicopters, missiles and other equipment into its armed forces and the two countries have announced plans to sign a 10-year framework later this year to further strengthen the defense partnership.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pushing back at the notion of ceding territory to Russia as part of any potential peace agreement",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday pushed back at the idea of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia as part of any potential peace agreement, a day before American, European and Ukrainian officials are set for high-level talks in London.",
      "During similar talks last week in Paris, U.S. officials presented a proposal that included allowing Russia to keep control of occupied Ukrainian territory as part of a deal, according to a European official familiar with the matter.",
      "The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the issue is expected to be on the agenda for discussion again this week as all parties focus on finding consensus on a credible approach for ending the war that the United States can convey to the Russians.",
      "But amid media reports about the U.S. proposal, Zelenskyy said the idea of ceding territory \u2014 including Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, seized by Russia more than a decade ago \u2014 is a nonstarter.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing to talk about \u2014 it is our land, the land of the Ukrainian people,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "Some European allies are at least somewhat wary of the American proposal. But there's also acknowledgment by some allies that Russia is firmly entrenched wholly or partially in five regions of Ukraine \u2014 Crimea, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.",
      "If the goal is to obtain a ceasefire immediately, \u201cit should be based on the line of contact as it is,\u201d said a senior French official. The official was not authorized to be publicly named and spoke on the condition of anonymity according to French presidential policy.",
      "Still, Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and aspirations to strengthen ties with the rest of the continent are a top priority for the Europeans, the European official said.",
      "It remains to be seen whether the latest diplomatic efforts can lead to an endgame after more than three years of war since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of its neighbor.",
      "The fighting continued Tuesday as Russian drones battered the port city of Odesa and glide bombs hit Zaporizhzhia, local authorities said, as the Kremlin again warned that negotiators are unlikely to obtain a swift breakthrough in peace talks.",

      "Trump said last week that negotiations were \u201ccoming to a head\u201d and insisted that neither side is \u201cplaying\u201d him in his push to end the war. That came after Rubio suggested that the U.S. might soon back away from negotiations if they don\u2019t progress.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov cautioned that \u201cthe settlement issue is so complex that it would be wrong to put some tight limits to it and try to set some short time frame for a settlement, a viable settlement \u2014 it would be a thankless task.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine\u2019s delegation heading to the U.K. has a mandate to discuss only an unconditional or partial ceasefire with Russia.",
      "\u201cWe are also ready to commit that after a ceasefire, we\u2019re prepared to sit down for talks in any format,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "Zelenskyy added that Ukraine would only believe Russia is serious about peace once it shows results.",
      "Putin\u2019s foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Witkoff was expected to visit Moscow again this week. Ushakov provided no further details.",
      "Western analysts say Moscow is in no rush to conclude peace talks, because it has battlefield momentum and wants to capture more Ukrainian land.",

      "Odesa came under a \u201cmassive attack\u201d by Russian drones overnight, wounding at least three people, the head of the regional administration, Oleh Kiper, wrote on his Telegram page.",
      "A residential building in a densely populated urban area, civilian infrastructure and an educational facility were hit, he said.",
      "Later Tuesday, Russia hit the southern city of Zaporizhzhia with two aerial glide bombs \u2014 a retrofitted Soviet weapon that for months has been used to lay waste to eastern Ukraine.",
      "The attack killed a 69-year-old woman and wounded 24 people, including four children, according to regional governor Ivan Fedorov.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post that his earlier offer of a ceasefire covering civilian sites still stands.",
      "\u201cRussia needs to be seriously prepared to talk about this,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \"There are no obstacles on the Ukrainian side, and there will be none.\u201d",
      "Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said there are no plans for talks on the proposal. He said Moscow is prepared to consider such a step, but noted that reaching an agreement could take time.",
      "\u201cWhile talking about civilian infrastructure, it\u2019s necessary to clearly define when such facilities can be a military target and when they can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a military meeting is held there, is it a civilian facility? It is. But is it a military target? Yes, it is. There are some nuances here that need to be discussed.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian air force said Russia fired 54 Shahed and decoy drones at Ukraine overnight, marking a resumption of long-range attacks that have blasted civilian areas and sown terror.",

      "Former Deputy Attorney General Nate Naksuk and former prosecutor Chainarong Sangthongaram were sentenced to three and two years, respectively, for abuse of power to help an individual avoid prosecution, said the Central Criminal Court for Corruption and Misconduct Cases in Bangkok.",
      "They were among eight people charged with conspiring to alter the recorded speed of the Ferrari driven by Vorayuth \u201cBoss\u201d Yoovidhya to help him evade a speeding charge. The rest, including former Police Chief Gen. Somyot Poompanmoung, were acquitted due to a lack of evidence linking them to the cover-up, the court said on Tuesday.",
      "However, the court ordered all eight to be detained pending an appeal, according to the court statement, which didn\u2019t provide further details. They were later released on bail, local media reported.",
      "Vorayuth escaped justice by fleeing abroad in a case widely viewed as an example of how the rich and well-connected enjoy impunity in Thailand.",

      "Police have said Vorayuth smashed his Ferrari into the back of a police officer\u2019s motorbike around dawn on a major Bangkok road in September 2012. The officer was flung from the bike and died at the scene. Vorayuth drove home and was later arrested. Medical tests showed traces of alcohol and cocaine in his bloodstream, according to police.",
      "Vorayuth avoided further legal action by consistently failing to meet with prosecutors, while continuing for years to live a jet-set life. By the time prosecutors finally issued an arrest warrant in April 2017, Vorayuth had fled abroad.",
      "His case has been marked by numerous delays in the investigative and judicial processes, running down the clock on most of the charges involving the hit-and-run death of the officer. There is a single charge left of reckless driving causing death, which expires under the statute of limitations in 2027.",

      "BERLIN -- Eighty years after the Holocaust, more than 200,000 Jewish survivors are still alive but 70% of them will be gone within the next 10 years \u2014 meaning time is running out to hear the voices of the last generation who suffered through one of the worst atrocities in history.",
      "Currently, the survivors' median age is 87, and more than 1,400 of them are over 100 years old, a new report said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe have known that this population of survivors would be the last, our final opportunity to hear their first-hand testimonies, to spend time with them, our last chance to meet a survivor,\" said Greg Schneider, the executive vice president of the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also referred to as the Claims Conference, which published the study.",
      "The report's analysis of population projections and mortality rates provides details through 2040. It is based on the extensive data collected since 1952 by the Claims Conference, which includes survivors who receive direct payments or social welfare services funded by the organization as a result of ongoing negotiations with Germany.",
      "Notably, nearly 50% of all Holocaust survivors will pass away within the next six years, while 70% will die within 10 years and 90% within 15 years, according to the report titled \u201c Vanishing Witnesses.\"",

      "In Poland, of the 3.3 million Jews living there in 1939, only about 300,000 survived.",
      "Around 560,000 Jews lived in Germany in 1933, the year Adolf Hitler came to power. After the Holocaust, their numbers had diminished to about 15,000 through emigration and extermination.",
      "After the end of World War II,  survivors settled all over the globe and even today they are still living in 90 different countries.",
      "The \u201cVanishing Witnesses\u201d report shows that mortality rates for survivors vary greatly across locations depending on access to health care and economic stability.",
      "For example, Israel, which is home to about half of all Holocaust survivors, had 110,100 survivors as of October 2024 and is estimated to see their population decline to 62,900 by 2030, a drop of 43%.",
      "The United States had 34,600 in the fall of 2024, but is projected to lose 39% over that same time, dropping to 21,100 survivors. Countries in the former Soviet Union had 25,500 survivors in October 2024, but are expected to be at 11,800 in five years, down 54 % by the start of 2030.",
      "\u201cThis report is a stark reminder that our time is almost up, our survivors are leaving us and this is the moment to hear their voices,\u201d said Gideon Taylor, the president of the Claims Conference.",
      "Albrecht Weinberg, a 100-year-old survivor from Germany who lost almost his entire family in the Holocaust, said that even today the horrendous memories are haunting him. \u201cI sleep with it, I wake up with it, I sweat, I have nightmares; that is my present.\u201d",

      "Negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program will move Wednesday to what\u2019s known as the \u201cexpert level\u201d \u2014 a sign analysts say shows that the talks are moving forward rapidly",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program will move Wednesday to what's known as the \u201cexpert level\u201d \u2014 a sign analysts say shows that the talks are moving forward rapidly.",
      "However, experts not involved in the talks who spoke with The Associated Press warn that this doesn't necessarily signal a deal is imminent. Instead, it means that the talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff haven't broken down at what likely is the top-level trade \u2014 Tehran limiting its atomic program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.",
      "\u201cAgreeing to technical talks suggests both sides are expressing pragmatic, realistic objectives for the negotiations and want to explore the details,\u201d said Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association who long has studied Iran's nuclear program.",
      "\u201cIf Witkoff was making maximalist demands during his talks with Araghchi, such as dismantlement of the enrichment program, Iran would have no incentive to meet at the technical level.\u201d",
      "That technical level, however, remains filled with possible landmines. Just how much enrichment by Iran would be comfortable for the United States? What about Tehran's ballistic missile program, which U.S. President Donald Trump first cited in pulling America unilaterally out of the accord in 2018? Which sanctions could be lifted and which would be remain in place on the Islamic Republic?",
      "\u201cThe most important determinant of expert talks\u2019 value lies in whether there is a political commitment to do something and experts just need to figure out what,\" said Richard Nephew, an adjunct fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who worked on Iran sanctions while at the U.S. State Department during negotiations over what became the 2015 nuclear deal.",
      "\"If the experts also have to discuss big concepts, without political agreement, it can just result in spun wheels.\u201d",
      "The 2015 nuclear deal saw senior experts involved in both sides of the deal. For the U.S. under President Barack Obama, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz reached an understanding working with Ali Akbar Salehi, then the leader of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. Both men's technical background proved key to nailing down the specifics of the deal.",
      "Under the 2015 agreement, Iran agreed to enrich uranium only to 3.67% purity and keep a stockpile of only 300 kilograms (661 pounds). Today, Iran enriches some uranium up to 60% purity \u2014 a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency put Iran's overall uranium stockpile in February at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds).",
      "The deal also limited the types of centrifuges Iran could spin, further slowing Tehran's ability to rush for a bomb, if it chose to do so. It also set out the provisions of how and when sanctions would be lifted, as well as time limits for the accord itself.",
      "Reaching limits, relief and timelines require the knowledge of experts, analysts say.",
      "\u201cA nonproliferation agreement is meaningless if it cannot be effectively implemented and verified,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cThe United States needs a strong technical team to negotiate the detailed restrictions and intrusive monitoring that will be necessary to ensure any move by Iran toward nuclear weapons is quickly detected and there is sufficient time to respond.\u201d",
      "It remains unclear who the two sides will be sending for those negotiations.",
      "Both the Americans and the Iranians have been tightlipped over exactly what's been discussed so far, though both sides have expressed optimism about the pace. However, there has been one noticeable dispute stemming from comments Witkoff made in a television interview, suggesting Tehran could be able to enrich up to 3.67% purity. However, analysts noted that was the level set by the 2015 deal under Obama.",
      "Witkoff hours later issued a statement suggesting that comparison struck a nerve: \u201cA deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cIran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program,\u201d Witkoff added.",
      "Araghchi responded by warning that Iran must be able to enrich.",
      "\"The core issue of enrichment itself is not negotiable,\u201d he said.",
      "Despite that, experts who spoke to the AP said they remained positive about the talks' trajectory so far.",
      "\u201cAlthough still early stages, I\u2019m encouraged so far,\u201d said Alan Eyre, a former U.S. diplomat once involved in past nuclear negotiations with Tehran. \u201cThe pace of negotiations \u2014 to include starting expert level meetings this Wednesday \u2014 is good.\u201d",
      "He added that so far, there didn't appear to be any \u201cmutually exclusive red lines\u201d for the talks as well \u2014 signaling there likely wasn't immediately any roadblocks to reaching a deal.",
      "Nephew similarly described reaching the expert level as a \u201cpositive sign.\u201d However, he cautioned that the hard work potentially was just beginning for the negotiations.",
      "\u201cThey imply the need to get into real details, to discuss concepts that senior (officials) might not understand and to answer questions. I also think too much can be read into them starting,\u201d Nephew said. \u201cExpert talks can sometimes be a fudge for seniors to avoid working on tough issues \u2014 \u2018let\u2019s have experts discuss it while we move on to other things\u2019 \u2014 or to sidestep big political decisions.\"",
      "Corey Hinderstein, the vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former U.S. government nuclear expert, described herself as feeling \u201ccautious optimism\u201d over the expert talks beginning.",
      "\u201cHeads of delegation are responsible for setting strategic goals and defining success,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if there is a deal to be made, the technical experts are the ones who will get it done.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The height of tax season was the height of turmoil at the IRS.",
      "The agency shuffled through three acting directors over the course of a week. It\u2019s preparing to lose tens of thousands of workers to layoffs and voluntary retirements. And President Donald Trump is weighing in on which nonprofits should lose their tax-exempt status, an incursion into the agency\u2019s typically apolitical stance that threatens to further erode trust in federal institutions and weaponize enforcement efforts.",
      "Just three months into Trump's second term, the government's fly-under-the-radar tax collector has become the latest platform for the Republican administration\u2019s vision to cut and control the federal bureaucracy. Tax policy experts fear that taxpayer services and collection efforts will face prolonged delays as a result of the rapid changes.",
      "The quick turnover in leadership and other changes are likely to dampen employee morale at the IRS and hurt the agency\u2019s ability to serve taxpayers in a timely manner, says Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.",
      "\u201cLeadership sets the tone, particularly in this environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Already, she notes, the agency has lost decades of institutional knowledge from nonpartisan career civil servants who have left over policy disagreements and layoffs.",
      "The upheaval unfolded as Americans dutifully filed their taxes ahead of the April 15 deadline and as a legion of IRS employees undertook work to process returns and dole out refunds. The latest filing season data shows the agency accepted more than 117 million returns this tax season and issued $228.7 billion in refunds.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re committed to improving the efficiency of the Internal Revenue Service,\" said the agency's newest acting commissioner, Michael Faulkender. \"For the last 35 years, we\u2019ve been five years away from the IRS being modernized. Under the direct leadership of Treasury, the modernization will be done in two years at a fraction of the cost.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS, like other federal agencies, is hemorrhaging employees over cuts spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, all while the agency churns through acting leaders as it awaits the installation of a permanent leader.",
      "Douglas O'Donnell, the Trump administration's first acting IRS commissioner, announced his retirement in February as furor spread over DOGE gaining access to IRS taxpayer data. Melanie Krause, the second acting commissioner, resigned early this month over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants\u2019 tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Gary Shapley, an IRS whistleblower who testified publicly about investigations into Hunter Biden\u2019s taxes, was acting commissioner for a matter of days before being replaced by Faulkender, who was elevated just last week. The New York Times reported that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had complained to Trump that Shapley had been installed without his knowledge and at the behest of Trump adviser Elon Musk.",
      "Trump's nominee for IRS commissioner, former U.S. Rep. Billy Long of Missouri, is still waiting for a confirmation hearing but faces controversies of his own. Most recently, Senate Democrats have called for a criminal investigation into Long's connections to alleged tax credit loopholes. The lawmakers allege that firms connected to Long duped investors into spending millions of dollars to purchase fake tax credits. Long did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment.",
      "Among other concerns at the agency are fears that Trump will weaponize the IRS against his enemies \u2014 and reward his friends.",
      "Some of the Democratic Party\u2019s core political institutions, including fundraising platform ActBlue and the protest group Indivisible, are preparing for the possibility that the federal government may soon launch criminal investigations against them.",
      "Trump said last week at the White House that the administration is looking at the tax-exempt status of Harvard University, which has defied the government's attempts to limit activism on campus, and environmental groups. He also mentioned the ethics watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a charitable organization,\u201d Trump said of CREW. \u201cThe only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. So we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at a lot of things.\u201d",
      "Jonathan S. Masur, an administrative law professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said it's unlawful for the president to unilaterally take away organizations' tax-exempt status.",
      "\u201cIt's illegal for starters. The Supreme Court has established that that step is not allowed,\u201d he said, adding that he anticipates that the court system will \u201cvery quickly block\u201d any such move from the president.",
      "The Trump administration is also watching out for allies of the president.",
      "Treasury official David Eisner sent an email in March to a top IRS official regarding Mike Lindell, the founder of MyPillow and one of the chief proponents of the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018My Pillow guy\u2019 and a high-profile friend of the President recently received an audit letter, from what I understand, his second in two years,\u201d Eisner wrote in the email, which was viewed by the AP. The president \u201cis concerned that he may have been inappropriately targeted,\" Eisner wrote.",
      "Among other changes in recent weeks are concerns about the IRS' engagement with the Department of Homeland Security over enforcing a new data-sharing agreement signed earlier this month by Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The agreement will allow ICE to submit names and addresses of immigrants inside the U.S. illegally to the IRS for cross-verification against tax records.",
      "That agreement is being litigated in federal court.",
      "U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich will soon decide whether to refuse or grant a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups. The groups argue that immigrants in the country illegally who pay taxes are entitled to the same privacy protections as U.S. citizens and immigrants who are legally in the country.",
      "The Treasury Department says the agreement will help carry out Trump\u2019s agenda to secure U.S. borders and is part of his larger nationwide immigration crackdown, which has resulted in deportations, workplace raids and the use of an 18th-century wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants.",
      "Holtzblatt said the agreement is indicative of the turmoil at the IRS.",

      "This year's show in the sprawling industrial outskirts of Shanghai comes at a pivotal moment. Three decades after Beijing set out to build a world-class auto industry, local manufacturers account for about two-thirds of sales inside China, and a growing share of global exports.",
      "But with U.S. President Donald Trump raising tariffs and the European Union slapping duties on Chinese electric vehicles, selling to some overseas markets is growing increasingly challenging.",
      "\u201cGeopolitics are very complex and the situation remains uncertain,\u201d Wei Jianjun, chairman of Great Wall Motors, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cBut Great Wall is always exploring investments in overseas markets.\u201d",
      "The exhibition is holding two media days and two trade days before it opens to the public on Sunday. It runs until May 2.",
      "Encouraged by government subsidies for scrapping older cars for the latest models, Chinese drivers have embraced the switch to electrics, with sales of battery powered and hybrid vehicles jumping 40% last year.",
      "A total of 31.4 million vehicles including buses and trucks were sold last year in the world\u2019s biggest market by sales, up 4.5% compared to a year earlier, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers reported.",
      "Growth in sales of EVs was offset by falling sales of traditional gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles, which still accounted for just over half of new car sales.",
      "Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD nudged past Tesla as the world\u2019s biggest maker of EVs by sales last year, reporting revenue of over $100 billion. It recently announced an ultra fast EV charging system that it says can provide a full charge for its latest EVs within five to eight minutes, about the time needed to fill up at the pump. It plans to build more than 4,000 of the new charging stations across China.",
      "To gain access to China's potentially huge market, foreign automakers like Volkswagen, General Motors, BMW and Ford set up joint ventures with state-owned local companies beginning in the 1980s and '90s, helping them build the capacity and technology to compete on a world scale.",
      "They also created sprawling supply chains in Shanghai and other major manufacturing hubs, helping to nurture other big names in Chinese automaking, such as BYD, Geely and Great Wall Motors.",
      "With growth at home limited by brutal competition, they're expanding rapidly especially in Southeast Asia and other developing economies with relatively affordable sedans, SUVs and pickup trucks.",
      "Shanghai\u2019s auto show is a gathering for the \u201csurvival of the fittest,\u201d said Zhou Lijun, director and chief researcher of the industry analysis group Yiche Research Institute.",
      "That doesn't mean all the EV makers go it alone. BYD teamed up with Daimler, now the Mercedes-Benz Group, to launch its Denza premium brand. It's also challenging Toyota and other top tier brands with its luxury Yangwang brand, priced at up to 2 million yuan ($280,000)",
      "Opening markets wider to foreign competition has given car buyers a choice of more affordable, innovative vehicles. That's a mixed blessing for older automakers like GM, Ford, Toyota and VW that are also fighting a battle of attrition in China.",
      "\u201cChina is still a market worth fighting for,\u201d said Oliver Zipse, chairman of the BMW Group, which like other automakers highlighted a \u201cIn China, for China,\u201d approach, at \u201cChina speed.\u201d",
      "Overhanging the upbeat talk in Shanghai by both Chinese and foreign automakers of manufacturing in China for the world are Trump's tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods, despite a 90-day pause that has spared many other countries, and 25% U.S. tax on imported cars and auto parts.",
      "Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co.'s head of China operations, Stephen Ma, said the company plans to make 10 new battery electric or hybrid models by 2027 in China, for China and for \u201cexport to the world, except one country \u2014 you can guess which one.\"",
      "Higher U.S. and European tariffs on foreign-made EVs are prompting Chinese newcomers to shift production closer to those markets as more Western consumers opt for the latest Chinese models.",
      "Just a few decades ago, Nissan, Toyota and other Japanese automakers were fighting trade friction with the United States over their own exports. Now, they employ hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers at their U.S. factories.",
      "\u201cThe trade war between China and the United States has blocked direct exports from China to the United States, but it hasn't blocked local production there or the establishment of global production bases in Europe or elsewhere,\" Zhou said.",
      "A report by the Rhodium Group shows that nearly half the world's markets are restricting imports from China, in part because of national security concerns linked to the advanced electronics in EVs and other high-tech vehicles. A minority of countries like Australia and South Africa remain relatively open, and Russia is a major market but is nearly saturated, it says.",
      "Chinese automakers lag behind global leaders like Toyota in conventional gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles, but they can sell EVs at roughly the same price, while also solving the problems of range and fast charging.",
      "China has become part of what geopolitical analyst Yanmei Xie described as a \u201ctechnological paradigm shift\u201d in a commentary in the Japanese financial publication Nikkei Asia. Automakers in China are going electric not just because of the green transition, but as a route to \u201ctechnological and industrial dominance,\u201d she wrote.",

      "A federal review of helicopter safety around some of the busiest U.S. airports has revealed dangerous flying conditions at the Las Vegas airport",
      "A federal review of helicopter safety around some of the busiest U.S. airports, prompted by the deadly midair collision in January between a passenger jet and Army helicopter in Washington, D.C., revealed dangerous flying conditions at the Las Vegas airport.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday the potential for a collision between air tour helicopters and planes at Harry Reid International Airport led the agency to make immediate changes to flying rules. In the first three weeks after implementation the number of collision alerts for planes dropped 30%.",
      "The FAA said after the collision between an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter in January, which killed 67 people, that it planned to use artificial intelligence to dig into the millions of reports it collects to assess other places with busy helicopter traffic, including Boston, New York, Baltimore-Washington, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and along the Gulf Coast.",
      "The FAA\u2019s acting administrator, Chris Rocheleau, said Las Vegas quickly became a concern once the agency dug into the data because agreements with helicopter operators there didn\u2019t clearly define vertical and lateral separation requirements when helicopters were approaching the airport. And air traffic controllers in the tower weren\u2019t issuing traffic advisories between returning helicopters and airplanes.",
      "\u201cWe took quick action including exercising positive control over the helicopters and issuing more traffic advisories to pilots,\u201d Rocheleau said. He promised to take additional actions in Las Vegas and at other airports where the FAA identifies concerns.",
      "Luke Nimmo, a spokesperson for Clark County Department of Aviation, referred all questions about the findings to the FAA.",
      "Following the crash of a New York City sightseeing helicopter into the Hudson River that killed six people April 10, the FAA said it was establishing a rulemaking committee to develop recommendations for improving commercial air tour safety.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former National Transportation Safety Board and FAA accident investigator, said the fact that collision alerts for planes dropped so quickly \u201cindicates a real hazard existed before the FAA looked at this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tough to characterize how significant the hazard was,\" he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s yet another hole in the Swiss cheese that can line up with other holes and cause an accident just like what happened in Washington, D.C.\u201d",
      "He said it made sense that the FAA first addressed the Las Vegas airport, given its large mix of helicopters and commercial traffic.",
      "\u201cI think that they will find issues at other airports, but maybe not to the degree that they found with this one,\u201d Guzzetti added.",
      "Former NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said there have long been safety issues with the helicopter tour industry, describing it as slipping in many cases into \u201cbecoming an attraction rather than a safe ride.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately in aviation, it is accidents that bring the attention of the regulators to their responsibilities,\" he added.",
      "The January midair collision near Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport was the deadliest aviation disaster in the United States since 2001. A series of other crashes and near misses in the months since have raised worries about air travel, even though it remains safe overall.",
      "Helicopters have been a key concern, but Rocheleau said the core safety issues remain operations and maintenance problems. He said the top causes of helicopter accidents include loss of control and striking an object during low-altitude operations.",
      "The FAA said its review of the safety data has expanded beyond helicopters to look at airports with a mix of many different planes and airports that are close together.",
      "The proximity between Hollywood Burbank Airport and Van Nuys Airport in the Los Angeles area emerged as a concern because they are less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) apart. Both airports serve a wide mix of aircraft and have arrival and departure paths that are close.",
      "A spokesperson for the Hollywood Burbank Airport referred questions to the FAA. The Van Nuys Airport didn't immediately respond to an email requesting comment.",
      "\u201cWhile flying remains the safest mode of transportation, we must always strive to do better,\u201d Rocheleau said. \u201cWe have to identify trends and get smarter about how we use data. And when we put corrective actions in place, we must execute them.\u201d",
      "Aviation lawyer Robert Clifford, who represents several families of victims of the D.C. plane crash, praised the FAA for taking action to make helicopter flights safer.",
      "\u201cAs a frequent critic of the FAA, I must say that the FAA deserves recognition for taking these steps to protect the traveling public,\" he said. \"Helicopters are known for being the most dangerous and potentially unsafe aircraft. The extra vigilance by the FAA may save many lives.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The outlook for the U.S. and global economies this year and next has significantly worsened in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and the uncertainty they have created",
      "WASHINGTON -- The outlooks for the U.S. and global economies have significantly worsened in the wake of President Donald Trump's tariffs and the uncertainty they have created, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday.",
      "The IMF said that the global economy will grow just 2.8% this year, down from its forecast in January of 3.3%, according to its latest World Economic Outlook. And in 2026, global growth will be 3%, the fund predicts, also below its previous 3.3% estimate.",
      "U.S. economic growth will come in at just 1.8% this year, down sharply from its previous forecast of 2.7% and a full percentage point below its 2024 expansion. The IMF doesn't expect a U.S. recession, though it has raised its odds of one this year from 25% to 37%.",
      "The forecasts are largely in line with many private-sector economists' expectations, though some do fear a recession is increasingly likely. Economists at JPMorgan say the chances of a U.S. recession are now 60%. The Federal Reserve has also forecast that growth will weaken this year, to 1.7%.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a new era,\u201d Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, chief economist at the IMF, said. \u201cThis global economic system that has operated for the last eighty years is being reset.\u201d",
      "The IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty.",
      "Gourinchas said that the heightened uncertainty around the import taxes led the IMF to take the unusual step of preparing several different scenarios for future growth. Its forecasts were finalized April 4, after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs on nearly 60 countries along with nearly-universal 10% duties.",
      "Those duties were paused April 9 for 90 days. Gourinchas said the pause didn\u2019t substantially change the IMF\u2019s forecasts because the U.S. and China have imposed such steep tariffs on each other since then.",
      "The uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s next moves will also likely weigh heavily on the U.S. and global economies, the IMF said. Companies may pull back on investment and expansion as they wait to see how the trade policies play out, which can slow growth.",
      "China is also forecast to grow more slowly because of U.S. tariffs. The IMF now expects it will expand 4% this year and next, down roughly half a point from its previous forecasts.",
      "While the U.S. economy will likely suffer a \u201csupply shock,\u201d similar to what hampered during the pandemic and which pushed up inflation in 2021 and 2022, Gourinchas said, China is expected to experience reduced demand as U.S. purchases of its exports fall.",
      "Inflation will likely worsen in the United States, rising to about 3% by the end of this year, while it will be little changed in China, the IMF forecast.",
      "The European Union is forecast to grow more slowly, but the hit from tariffs is not as large, in part because it is facing lower U.S. duties than China. In addition, some of the hit from tariffs will be offset by stronger government spending by Germany.",
      "The economies of the 27 countries that use the euro are forecast to expand 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year, down just 0.2% in both years from the IMF\u2019s January forecast.",
      "Japan\u2019s growth forecast has been marked down to 0.6% this year and next, 0.5% and 0.2% lower than in January, respectively.",

    "story": [
      "Plastic is everywhere \u2014 and yet some people may be surprised at how much they actually wear",
      "Bottles and bags, food wrappers and straws. Piping, packaging, toys and trays. Plastic is everywhere \u2014 and yet some people may be surprised at how much they actually wear.",
      "A typical closet is loaded with plastic, woven into polyester activewear, acrylic sweaters, nylon swimsuits and stretchy socks \u2014 and it\u2019s shedding into the environment nonstop.",
      "When garments are worn, washed and put through the dryer, they shed plastic fiber fragments. A single load of laundry can release millions that are so tiny wastewater treatment plants can\u2019t capture them all. They wind up in local waterways that connect to the ocean. Marine animals eat them, and that can pass plastic to larger animals and humans.",
      "Even natural fabrics shed fibers and have chemicals that can leach into the environment. But polyester is the most widely used fiber on Earth, and along with other synthetic fibers accounts for about two-thirds of production worldwide.",
      "Tuesday is Earth Day, when people worldwide contemplate ways to reduce their impact on the planet.",
      "\u201cEveryone who wears and launders clothing is part of this problem but everyone who wears and launders clothing can be part of the solutions,\u201d said Rachael Z. Miller, founder of Vermont-based Rozalia Project for a Clean Ocean.",
      "Simple changes like washing clothes less and using cold water instead of hot can help reduce the shedding of fibers. More challenging is that textiles need to be produced and used in a more sustainable way, said Elisa Tonda at the UN Environment Programme. For example, designing clothes that shed fewer microfibers and are high-quality to last longer, said Tonda, who leads the resources and markets branch.",
      "The easiest solution is to wash clothes less often, making for less of the friction that breaks fibers apart, said Anja Brandon, director of plastics policy at Ocean Conservancy.",
      "\u201cThey get tumbled and tossed around with a bunch of soaps, really designed to shake things up to get out dirt and stains,\u201d Brandon said.",
      "Miller uses a stain stick to spot-clean. Both say that when clothes are washed, they shed less when put in cold water in full loads to reduce friction, on a shorter cycle, then hung to dry.",
      "Inspired by the way coral filters the ocean, Miller invented the Cora Ball, a laundry ball that can be tossed into the washer to cut down on clothes banging into each other. It also catches microfibers. (A portion of the proceeds goes to the Rozalia Project.) Another option is to put synthetic fabrics in a washing bag that captures fibers.",
      "Which clothes shed the most? To find out, press a strip of clear packing tape to a garment, then stick it to white paper to check for fibers, Miller said. Garments that are loosely knit or woven tend to shed more, such as fleece.",
      "Miller said people don't need to rush to throw out clothing that's more likely to shed. She owns fleece jackets herself. Instead, she suggested such clothing can be worn indoors only or outside with a layer on top, and it's worth thinking twice about acquiring more garments like that.",
      "\u201cI try not to guilt or panic people because a lot of this information is very new,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd so we might as well just say, \u2018OK, I got it. How can I be strategic about what I\u2019ve got?\u2019\u201d",
      "Filters can be added to washers to capture microfibers. Samsung Electronics collaborated with Patagonia and the global conservation organization Ocean Wise to launch one in 2023. It's now sold in more than 20 countries for front-load washers. Bosch recently launched a microfiber filter in Europe for washers.",
      "France was first to adopt a law to mandate that new washing machines sold in the country have a microfiber filter, though implementation has been delayed.",
      "In the U.S., efforts to mandate filters in states have failed. California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill in 2023, saying he was concerned about the cost to consumers and he wants to incentivize, not mandate, technologies to remove microfibers in wastewater. In Oregon, state Sen. Deb Patterson proposed a bill this year requiring microfiber filters on new washers sold in that state after she came across the technology in Canada. Patterson said the bill doesn't have enough support yet but she'll keep trying.",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina's Republican-dominated Senate voted 33-8 on Monday to kick the Republican treasurer out of office over a $1.8 billion accounting error.",
      "It will now be up to the House, also dominated by the GOP, to decide whether to hold its own hearing. If at least two-thirds of its members vote against Treasurer Curtis Loftis, he will be removed from office.",
      "Monday's extraordinary hearing was the culmination of over two years of investigation by the Senate that began when state accountants unintentionally exaggerated money given to colleges and universities by $3.5 billion.",
      "That led to the discovery of an account error that started a decade ago when the state was changing from one accounting system to another. If accountants couldn't balance the entries in the two sets of books as they moved thousands of accounts with different definitions, they kept adding it to a special account year after year until it grew to $1.8 billion.",
      "It took forensic accountants, who were paid millions of dollars in fees, to finally unravel that nearly all of the money was not real cash but just an accumulation of errors.",
      "Two Republican senators led the call for Loftis to be kicked out of office, saying he can no longer be trusted to handle South Carolina's bank accounts. They charged that he is incompetent and never reported the mistakes to lawmakers as required by law while refusing to take accountability.",
      "\u201cHe's a liar that was so concerned with his public appearance that he would do and say anything to cover up his mistake,\u201d Sen. Stephen Goldfinch said.",
      "Senators followed the presentation with their own questions. Most of the eight senators asked Loftis directly why he didn't take responsibility for the error and why he let others inform the Senate. Loftis said that was the responsibility of other officials.",
      "\u201cIt's everybody but me. And maybe that's so, but it is so hard to defend ... in a \u2018can he do the job' (sense),\" Republican Sen. Luke Rankin told Loftis. \u201cHelp me, help us. Accept the responsibility.\"",
      "\u201cWould you tell me what you want me to take responsibility for, because it is complicated,\u201d Loftis replied.",
      "Loftis has called the Senate investigation a witch hunt. He repeatedly said no money went missing and the errors were not made in his office, although others have testified differently. The treasurer said continuing to focus on the mistakes threatens the state's strong credit rating.",
      "Loftis' lawyers opened the treasurer's case with a photo of Loftis and Republican President Donald Trump. They compared the hearing to coups in Zimbabwe and Myanmar that threw out elected officials and said Loftis' real judges should be the voters in the Republican primary in 14 months. Loftis said he is now running for reelection after testifying to senators this would be his last term.",
      "Fellow lawyer Johnny Gasser reminded the 34 Republicans in the 46-member Senate that nearly every vote cast for them also was a vote for Loftis.",
      "\u201cDo you really want to go down this path?\u201d Gasser asked.",
      "Eight Republicans voted against removing Loftis, with the rest of the Senate finding Loftis committed \u201cwillful neglect of duty.\" They sent the matter to the House, which must also hold its own two-thirds vote to remove the treasurer.",
      "No office holder has been removed in this way since South Carolina became a state 235 years ago.",
      "Republican leaders in the House have not indicated whether they will take up the matter.",
      "The state's books still haven't been fully straightened out, and accountants continue to struggle with Loftis' office and how they handle bank accounts, Sen. Larry Grooms said.",
      "The treasurer is trying anything to protect his 14 years in office and reputation as a competent conservative steward who is always looking out for taxpayers, Grooms said.",
      "\u201cBecause of his failures, the self-proclaimed best friend of the taxpayer is costing the taxpayers tens of millions in legal, auditing and oversight fees,\u201d Grooms said. \u201cWith friends like this, who needs tax-and-spend liberals.\u201d",
      "Lofits, without going into details, said he knew his actions fell short of expectations at times. He promised to do a better job in the future as he spoke for about 10 minutes on Monday from a temporary lectern in the back of their chamber",
      "He said the times he misspoke or slammed papers or accused senators of a witch hunt were just his passion for fighting an injustice.",
      "\u201cI hope all of us in this room agree that we should rise above the moment and return our focus to what matters \u2014 serving the people of South Carolina with honor, respect and purpose,\u201d Loftis said.",

      "The secondhand clothing market already was flourishing before the specter of tariffs bedeviled the U.S. fashion industry. Management consulting firm McKinsey and Co. predicted after the COVID-19 pandemic that global revenue from preowned fashion would grow 11 times faster than retail apparel sales by this year as shoppers looked to save money or spend it in a more environmentally conscious way.",
      "While millennials and members of Generation Z were known as the primary buyers of used clothing, data from market research firm Sensor Tower shows the audience may be expanding.",
      "The number of mobile app downloads for nine resale marketplaces the firm tracks \u2014 eBay, OfferUp, Poshmark, Mercari, Craigslist, Depop, ThredUp, TheRealReal and Vinted \u2014 increased by 3% between January and the end of March, the first quarterly gain in three years, Sensor Tower said.",
      "The firm estimates downloads of the apps for eBay, Depop, ThredUp and The RealReal also surged compared to a year earlier for the week of March 31, which was when Trump unveiled since-paused punitive tariffs on dozens of countries.",
      "Circana\u2019s Classi-Zummo said that while customers used to seek out collectible or unusual vintage pieces to supplement their wardrobes, she has noticed more shoppers turning to secondhand sites to replace regular fashion items.",
      "\"It's still a cheaper option\u201d than buying new, even though retailers offer discounts, she said.",
      "Poshmark, a digital platform where users buy and sell preowned clothing, has yet to see sales pick up under the tariff schedule Trump unveiled but is prepared to capitalize on the moment, CEO Manish Chandra said.",
      "Companies operating e-commerce marketplaces upgrade their technology to make it easier to find items. A visual search tool and other improvements to the Poshmark experience will \u201cpay long dividends in terms of disruption that happens in the market\u201d from the tariffs, Chandra said.",
      "Archive, a San Francisco-based technology company that builds and manages online and in-store resale programs for brands including Dr. Martens, The North Face and Lululemon, has noticed clothing labels expressing more urgency to team up, CEO Emily Gittins said.",
      "\"Tapping into all of the inventory that is already sitting in the U.S., either in people\u2019s closets or in warehouses not being used,\u201d offers a revenue source while brands limit or suspend orders from foreign manufacturers, she said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of uncertainty,\u201d Gittins said. \u201cEveryone believes that this is going to be hugely damaging to consumer goods brands that sell in the U.S. So resale is basically where everyone\u2019s head is going.\"",
      "Stock analysts have predicted off-price retailers like TJ Maxx and Burlington Stores will weather tariffs more easily than regular apparel chains and department stores because they carry leftover merchandise in the U.S.",
      "Still, resale vendors aren't immune from tariff-induced upheavals, said Rachel Kibbe, founder and CEO of Circular Services Group, a firm that advises brands and retailers on reducing the fashion industry's environmental impact.",
      "U.S. sellers that import secondhand inventory from European Union countries would have to pay a 20% duty if Trump moves forward with instituting \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on most trading partners and eliminates an import tax exception for parcels worth less than $800, Kibbe said.",
      "A circular fashion coalition she leads is seeking a tariff exemption for used and recycled goods that will be offered for resale, Kibbe said. Trump already ended the duty-free provision for low-value parcels from China, a move that may benefit sellers of secondhand clothing by making low-priced Chinese fashions pricier, she said.",
      "James Reinhart, co-founder and CEO of the online consignment marketplace ThredUp, said the removal of the \u201cde minimis\u201d provision and the 145% tariff Trump put on products made in China would benefit businesses like his. He doubts creating resale channels would make a big difference for individual brands.",
      "\u201cBrands will explore this and they may do more, but I don\u2019t see them massively changing their operations,\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to be figuring out how to survive. And I don\u2019t think resale helps you survive.\u201d",
      "Rebag, an online marketplace and retail chain that sells used designer handbags priced from $500 to tens of thousands of dollars, expects tariffs to help drive new customers and plans to open more physical stores, CEO Charles Gorra said.",
      "Gorra said the company would analyze prices for new luxury goods and adjust what Rebag charges accordingly. The two historically rose in tandem, but Rebag could not match Chanel's 10% price increase last year because of lower resale demand, Gorra said.",
      "\u201cThat has nothing to do with the tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers are feeling priced out.\u201d",
      "Norah Brotman, 22, a senior at the University of Minnesota, buys most of her own clothes on eBay. She also thrifts fashions from the 1990s and early 2000s at Goodwill stores and resells them on Depop.",
      "If tariffs upend the economics of fast fashion and discourage mindless consumption, Brotman would count that as a plus.",
      "\u201cI would love if this would steer people in a different direction,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Removing lanes to slow down speeding drivers is a long-embraced strategy for improving safety on city streets",
      "A stylist was just starting her shift at a salon in Kansas City, Missouri, when a car smashed through the storefront window and landed in the waiting area a few feet away.",
      "Such crashes were so common along 31st Street that business owners regularly texted one another photos showing the damage caused by vehicles speeding along the four-lane road lined with shops, bars and restaurants, which drivers used as a shortcut between major highways.",
      "\u201cA wide road makes people think, \u2018We\u2019ll just drive as fast as we want on it,'\" said Ryan Ferrell, who owns the property housing the salon, a bookstore and apartments above.",
      "When concrete sidewalk barriers didn\u2019t work, Ferrell and other business leaders campaigned to put the street on a \u201croad diet.\"",
      "Removing lanes has been a tool numerous cities have used for years to calm traffic, despite resistance from some Republican governors. President Donald Trump's administration doesn't like it either.",
      "Federal transportation officials once heralded road diets for cutting crashes by 19% to 47%, but criteria for an upcoming round of road safety grants say projects aimed at \u201creducing lane capacity\u201d should be considered \u201cless favorably,\" the administration said.",
      "Forcing travelers into more constrained spaces \u201ccan lead to crashes, erratic maneuvers, and a false sense of security that puts everyone at risk,\u201d the U.S. Department of Transportation said in an email statement to The Associated Press. \u201cThe update reflects the Department\u2019s concerns about the safety hazards associated with congestion.\u201d",
      "Kansas City saved some money when it converted 31st Street in 2022 because a gas line was going in anyway. It reopened with one lane in each direction instead of two, a shared turn lane near the signalized intersections, better pedestrian crossings and protected on-street parking spaces.",
      "Road diets are now an almost automatic part of the process in Kansas City whenever a street is up for repaving. For years, federal guidelines said lane reductions were usually appropriate on roads carrying fewer than 25,000 vehicles a day. Most of the city's four-lane roads don't meet that threshold.",
      "Bobby Evans, an urban planner at the Mid-America Regional Council who has worked on Kansas City's road diets, calls the strategy \"a smashing success\" and one of the most effective tools at reducing speed, crashes and injuries.",
      "\u201cIn the architectural world you\u2019d call it environmental determinism,\u201d Evans said. \u201cYou want to make it so they don\u2019t feel comfortable going too fast. You\u2019re really not slowing them down. You\u2019re bringing them back to the speed limit.\u201d",
      "Numerous other cities have credited road diets with improving safety.",
      "Philadelphia cited a 19% drop in injury crashes. Portland, Oregon, saw a more than 70% decline in vehicles traveling at least 10 mph (16 kph) over the speed limit. The average speed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, fell by 5 mph (8 kph) on some roads within months.",
      "But Jay Beeber, executive director for policy at the National Motorists Association, an advocacy organization for drivers, said most road diets represent an ill-advised effort to force vehicles off the road. The number of vehicles may decline on dieted roads, but then surrounding roads have to absorb the traffic, he said.",
      "\u201cThose cars have to go somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cCars are like water. They seek their own level.\u201d",
      "Leah Shahum, who directs the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit advocating for street safety, said road diets are inexpensive and supported by years of research. Cities in Republican-led states are among the converts and Shahum isn't sure if the Trump administration's new guidance will make them reconsider.",
      "\u201cI certainly hope that does not bleed over into indirectly discouraging communities from using this proven safety countermeasure,\u201d Shahum said. \u201cThat would be a real loss.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s transportation department cited delivery and emergency vehicles among its concerns.",
      "When University of Iowa researchers surveyed first-responders in Cedar Rapids, their study published last year found no noticeable difference in response time when a road diet was in place. There was, however, a perceived need to educate drivers about what to do when an ambulance uses a center turn lane to pass.",
      "Cara Hamann, an associate professor of epidemiology who co-authored the study, said she recalled no major examples of EMS or fire trucks being unable to get through.",
      "\u201cThe road diet didn\u2019t cause a level of congestion that slowed them down,\u201d she said.",
      "Even before Trump, skepticism was growing in some red states.",
      "San Antonio spent years planning to repurpose a formerly state-owned portion of its Broadway Street by removing vehicle lanes and improving a stretch for bikes and pedestrians. But Texas abruptly reclaimed the road in 2022 and nixed the project as GOP Gov. Greg Abbott ran for reelection and called for an end to anti-car policies.",
      "\u201cThey basically used Broadway as a political football,\u201d said Bryan Martin, owner of Bronko Bikes, an electric bike repair shop.",
      "Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill last year a 180-day review period and other numerous steps before a local government can eliminate a lane. He said it would prevent activists from intentionally clogging roads to slow vehicles.",
      "Not all the pushback has come from Republican-led states. During the pandemic, Culver City, California, implemented a road diet to prioritize walking, biking and transit. But when cars returned and traffic backed up for miles, the city reversed the plan.",
      "Some residents sued in Vancouver, Washington, saying the city should have put its road diets up for a public vote.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen people passing in the shoulder or the bike lane,\u201d said Justin Wood, one of the opponents. \u201cIt creates more opportunity for conflict.\u201d",
      "Evans, the planner in Kansas City, said road diets can't stop all reckless drivers.",
      "\u201cIf you are bound and determined to go 12 miles over the speed limit on a three-lane road, you\u2019re going to have to engage in some stupid, dangerous driving,\u201d Evans said.",

      "Those walls were possible through a federal program that pays rent for some 60,000 families and individuals fleeing homelessness or domestic violence. Espinal was fleeing both.",
      "But the program, Emergency Housing Vouchers, is running out of money \u2014 and quickly.",
      "Funding is expected to be used up by the end of next year, according to a letter from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and obtained by The Associated Press. That would leave tens of thousands across the country scrambling to pay their rent.",
      "It would be among the largest one-time losses of rental assistance in the U.S., analysts say, and the ensuing evictions could churn these people \u2014 after several years of rebuilding their lives \u2014 back onto the street or back into abusive relationships.",

      "Last month, HUD sent letters to groups dispersing the money, advising them to \"manage your EHV program with the expectation that no additional funding from HUD will be forthcoming.\"",
      "The program's future rests with Congress, which could decide to add money as it crafts the federal budget. But it's a relatively expensive prospect at a time when Republicans, who control Congress, are dead set on cutting federal spending to afford tax cuts.",

      "An Associated Press analysis of an aviation safety database reveals that drones last year accounted for nearly two-thirds of reported near midair collisions involving commercial aircraft taking off and landing at major U.S. airports",
      "WASHINGTON -- A commercial airliner was on final approach to San Francisco\u2019s international airport in November when the crew spotted a drone outside the cockpit window. By then it was too late \u201cto take evasive action,\u201d the pilots reported, and the quadcopter passed by their windshield, not 300 feet away.",
      "A month earlier, a jetliner was flying at an altitude of 4,000 feet near Miami\u2019s international airport when its pilots reported a \u201cclose encounter\u201d with a drone. In August, a drone came within 50 feet of clipping the left wing of a passenger jet as it departed Newark International Airport.",
      "The incidents were all classified as \u201cnear midair collisions\u201d \u2014 any one of which could have had catastrophic consequences, according to aviation safety experts. They were also not isolated encounters.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of an aviation safety database reveals that drones last year accounted for nearly two-thirds of reported near midair collisions involving commercial passenger planes taking off and landing at the country's top 30 busiest airports. That was the highest percentage of such near misses since 2020, when air traffic dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The first reports of near misses involving drones were logged in 2014, the AP found. The number of such encounters spiked the following year. Over the last decade, drones accounted for 51% \u2014 122 of 240 \u2014 of reported near misses, according to AP's analysis.",
      "Passenger jets have long been subject to risks around airports \u2014 whether from bird strikes or congested airspace \u2014 as was made clear by the January collision between a military helicopter and commercial jet near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people.",
      "The threat from drones has become more acute in the last decade as the use of quadcopters and remote-controlled planes has exploded in popularity. The FAA estimates that Americans are operating more than a million drones for recreational and commercial purposes.",
      "\u201cIf you have the money, you can go on the internet and buy a pretty sophisticated drone that can reach altitudes they really have no business being at,\u201d said William Waldock, a professor of safety science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.",
      "The risk is most acute near airports because that is where the flight paths of drones and airplanes most overlap, experts said.",
      "The incidents represent only a portion of such close calls because the database \u2014 NASA\u2019s Aviation Safety Reporting System \u2014 relies on voluntary submissions from pilots and other aviation workers. A separate FAA program, which includes reports from the public, tallied at least 160 sightings last month of drones flying near airports.",
      "\u201cThe FAA recognizes that urgency, and we all know additional changes need to be made to allow the airports to go out and detect and mitigate where necessary,\u201d said Hannah Thach, executive director of the partnership, known as Alliance for System Safety of UAS through Research Excellence.",
      "The FAA said it has taken steps to mitigate the risks of drones. It has prohibited nearly all drones from flying near airports without prior authorization, though such rules are difficult to enforce, and recreational users may not be aware of restrictions.",
      "The agency requires registrations for drones weighing more than 250 grams (0.55 pounds), and such drones are required to carry a radio transponder that identifies the drone\u2019s owner and broadcasts its position to help avert collisions. Additional rules govern commercial drone use.",
      "The agency has also been testing systems to detect and counter drones near airports. Among the methods being examined: Using radio signals to jam drones or force them to land. Authorities are also weighing whether to deploy high-powered microwaves or laser beams to disable the machines.",
      "Experts said the FAA and other authorities could do more. They suggested creating a system similar to speed cameras on roadways that could capture a drone\u2019s transponder code and send its pilots a ticket in the mail.",
      "They also said the FAA should consider regulations that require all manufacturers to program a drone\u2019s GPS unit to prevent it from flying near airports and other sensitive areas, a method called \u201cgeofencing.\u201d",
      "DJI, a leading drone maker, used such geofencing restrictions for years. However, it eliminated the feature in January, replacing it with an alert to drone pilots when they approach restricted areas.",
      "Adam Welsh, head of global policy at DJI, said managing requests from authorized users to temporarily disable the geofencing became an increasingly time-consuming task. More than one million such requests were processed last year.",
      "\u201cWe had around-the-clock service, but the number of applications coming in were becoming really hard to handle,\u201d Welsh said. \u201cThey all had to be reviewed individually.\u201d",
      "With no other manufacturers enabling geofencing, and without government rules requiring it, DJI decided to end the practice, he said.",
      "The FAA declined to say if it is considering whether to mandate geofencing.",
      "Experts said authorities should take more aggressive action to hold drone users accountable for violating restricted airspace \u2014 to highlight the problem and deter others from breaking the rules, pointing to recent arrests that they hoped might send such a message.",
      "In December, for example, Boston police arrested two men who operated a drone that flew dangerously close to Logan International Airport. Police reported that they were able to find the drone flyers, in part, by tracking the aircraft thanks to its FAA-mandated transponder signal.",
      "A month later, a small drone collided with a \u201cSuper Scooper\u201d plane that was fighting wildfires raging through Southern California. The drone punched a hole in the plane's left wing, causing enough damage that officials grounded the aircraft for several days to make repairs.",
      "Authorities tracked down the 56-year-old drone operator, who pleaded guilty to a federal charge of recklessly flying his aircraft. The man, who has yet to be sentenced, admitted he launched his DJI quadcopter to observe fire damage over the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, despite the FAA having restricted drone flying in the area, according to court records. The operator lost sight of the drone after it flew about 1.5 miles from where he had launched it. And that's when it struck the \u201cSuper Scooper.\"",

      "The Kansas City, Missouri, metropolitan area has long been a regional hub for the federal government, and the pain from the Trump administration's cuts can be seen everywhere",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- In her 28 years working for the federal government, Shea Giagnorio provided day care for the children of U.S. soldiers, training for employees and oversight for safety net programs.",
      "Public service took her from Germany to Alaska to Kansas City, Missouri, where she moved last year for a long-sought promotion.",
      "But when she reported to a downtown federal building for work one day last month, her access card did not work. After a co-worker let her into the building, she checked her email: Her entire office had been let go in the latest mass firing ordered by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "The 46-year-old single mom has canceled her apartment lease, is selling her new furniture and may have to pull her daughter out of college. She wonders what will happen to the at-risk populations her team helped serve at the Administration for Children and Families, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "\u201cNot only me, but all these peoples\u2019 lives are turned upside down,\u201d Giagnorio said.",
      "The impact of the cuts by Trump appointees and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency can be found everywhere in the Kansas City metropolitan area, which has long been a major hub for federal agencies about 1,000 miles away from Washington, D.C. Money once promised to the region for public health, environmental, diversity, food aid and an array of other programs has been axed, and thousands of local jobs are in jeopardy.",
      "With nearly 30,000 workers, the federal government is the largest employer in the region. One longtime Kansas City economic researcher said he believes the region could lose 6,000 good-paying federal jobs, which in turn would wipe out thousands of others in service industries.",
      "An IRS worker said thousands of her coworkers fear they will lose their jobs, even as they put in overtime processing tax refunds in a building so crowded that they struggle to find desks. Under pressure, hundreds more agreed this week to retire early or take a buyout.",
      "A U.S. Department of Agriculture grant revocation disrupted a historically Black neighborhood\u2019s plan to expand its program growing fresh produce in a food desert. A nearby pantry reduced its monthly grocery allotment for those in need after federal cuts left food banks shorthanded.",
      "The withdrawal of federal funding for new lab equipment and vaccines means the city may be less prepared for the next pandemic.",
      "A landlord may have to sell an office building for a loss after his federal tenants were among several that abruptly canceled local leases, adding a glut of real estate to the market.",
      "And the city's Tesla showroom has become a spot of weekly protest. Activists are seeking to have it closed by pushing a referendum intended to drive Musk\u2019s electric car company out of Missouri.",
      "The nation's health department is slashing its full-time national workforce from 82,000 to 62,000. Among them were Giagnorio and her colleagues in her agency's 10 regional offices around the country that helped deliver services through programs such as Head Start and emergency assistance for low-income families.",
      "\u201cThe poor will become even more poor now,\u201d Giagnorio said. \u201cIf we\u2019re taking away social safety nets, what is the end result? If we\u2019re not helping homeless people anymore, will they freeze to death in the winter? Is that what we want?\u201d",
      "Giagnorio, who spent most of her career as a U.S. Department of Defense civilian employee at bases in Germany and Alaska, is on paid leave until her June 2 termination. She wasted no time looking for another position after being locked out of her office, visiting a job fair hours later that Kansas City hosted for displaced federal workers.",
      "But she doubts she will be able to find a public sector salary anywhere near the $117,000 she made and doesn\u2019t know how her skills translate to the private sector. She worries about losing the health insurance that covers her family and having to pull her daughter out of Maastricht University in the Netherlands after her first year.",
      "For now, she can\u2019t get any answers from the agency to basic questions about her financial future. Does she still qualify for an early retirement buyout offer that had been extended? How much would she receive and when?",
      "The days leading up to the April 15 tax filing deadline were always going to be busy for workers at the IRS processing center near Union Station, but this year, they were particularly stressful.",
      "The IRS is considering a downsizing that could cut as many as 20,000 employees, or 25% of its workforce, in the coming weeks. The roughly 6,000 employees in Kansas City faced agonizing choices: decide whether to accept resignation or early retirement offers by April 14 or risk losing their jobs later.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a kick in the stomach to people that are doing everything they can to meet what\u2019s required of them,\u201d said Shannon Ellis, a longtime IRS customer service representative and president of the union representing local workers.",
      "By Thursday, at least 238 Kansas City workers had taken the buyout offers and were expected to leave the agency in coming weeks. Ellis noted many of those same workers had been told they were essential and required to work overtime during tax season, some seven days per week.",
      "Their building has been overcrowded since the IRS ordered remote employees back to the office in March. Workers sometimes struggle to find open desks. Some have to bring their own ink pens and share date stamps to perform basic job functions after budget cuts have depleted supplies.",
      "Ellis said IRS workers share the public\u2019s disdain for taxes but understand that collecting them is necessary to support important programs like Social Security. She said she\u2019s decided to take a \u201croll of the dice\u201d and stay in her job, spurning an early retirement offer.",
      "\u201cI love my job,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let the bully force me out.\u201d",
      "Urban farmer Rosie Warren grew 2,500 pounds of fruits and vegetables last year in community gardens to help feed the Ivanhoe neighborhood, where many Black families were concentrated under housing segregation policies of much of the 20th century.",
      "Warren harvested greens, potatoes and watermelons as part of an effort to address food insecurity and health concerns in a neighborhood challenged by blight, crime and poverty. She was ecstatic last fall when the USDA awarded the neighborhood council a three-year, $130,000 grant to expand the gardens and farmers\u2019 market serving the area.",
      "Plans called for hiring an assistant to help Warren with growing more food and to add another market day aimed at serving more low-income older adults, mothers and children.",
      "In February, the council received a notice terminating the grant. The USDA had determined the award \u201cno longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.\u201d",
      "On a recent morning, Warren took a break from preparing the soil for planting to ponder the USDA\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cWhat do you do if you don\u2019t support providing access to food to people who don\u2019t have it? Wouldn\u2019t this make your job easier?\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s absurd. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d",
      "Other food aid in the neighborhood has taken a hit at a time when demand is rising.",
      "At the Bishop Sullivan Center food pantry, hundreds of low-income families are getting fewer groceries in their monthly pickups after USDA halted $500 million worth of deliveries to food banks. That included a planned order for 41,000 cases of meat, dairy and other commodities to a bank serving Kansas City.",
      "\u201cIt just means giving families less food,\u201d said pantry director Christopher Lowrance, who said he\u2019s able to provide less chicken and other meat products. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",
      "The Kansas City Health Department\u2019s laboratory is badly in need of an upgrade, with equipment dating to when the building opened in the 1990s.",
      "One basement space is water damaged and rarely used. Another has equipment that is so inadequate that the city has to ship samples to a state laboratory 150 miles away, causing inefficiencies, agonizing waits for results and delayed response times.",
      "Kansas City\u2019s health director, Dr. Marvia Jones, made it a top priority to modernize the labs this year after studying their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her agency planned to use federal funding to purchase new microscopes and testing equipment.",
      "\u201cThat early disease detection allows you to do more rapid intervention, more rapid treatment, more rapid isolation,\u201d she said.",
      "But the funding for lab upgrades was abruptly eliminated last month as part of the Trump administration's $11.4 billion cancellation of federal grants to states for public health. That news \u201ccrushed\u201d the department's carefully laid plans, Jones said.",
      "Jones said the cuts, $3 million and counting for her department, mean the city will also have fewer vaccines to administer to low-income residents.",
      "\u201cIt would be a sad shame for us to be in a worse position than we were before the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had processed all of our lessons learned, and then now this happens.\u201d",
      "Amir Minoofar was surprised when two federal agencies notified him that they planned to vacate the office building he\u2019s owned for a decade in Overland Park, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City.",
      "Minoofar said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had recently agreed to extend its lease until 2029. The National Labor Relations Board, meanwhile, was paying month to month.",
      "Minoofar said the government initially notified him the agencies would be out of the building in August, part of a DOGE-led blitz of hundreds of lease cancellations that has been marked by errors and subsequent reversals.",
      "In the Kansas City metropolitan area, the government is moving to cancel 10 leases totaling 219,000 square feet that cost more than $4 million in annual rent, according to DOGE\u2019s online \u201cWall of Receipts.\u201d",
      "Minoofar said he was more recently told the agencies will likely have to stay past August and their departure date is now unclear. He said he may have to sell the building, which has an appraised value of $2.9 million, and take a loss because of the difficult office market.",
      "But he said he understands why the government would unload the space, which he said has often been sparsely used since the rise of telework during the pandemic.",
      "\u201cBusinesswise, it makes sense for government to cut costs,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people are going to be unhappy but it\u2019s a huge gigantic family and they need to take care of it. You cannot keep everybody happy.\u201d",
      "With liberal anger growing at Musk\u2019s role in the government, protesters have gathered Saturdays outside his Tesla dealership in Kansas City to denounce the cuts.",
      "State records show Tesla sales there have dropped amid calls for a boycott. Now, enough voter anger could even force the business to close.",
      "Organizers of a newly launched \u201cUnplug Musk\u201d initiative are seeking to use democracy to strike at the world\u2019s richest man by changing state law to ban car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers.",
      "They say they plan to soon begin gathering the 111,000 signatures of registered voters that they would need to put the change on the statewide ballot in November 2026. If approved by voters, it would force the closure of the Tesla showrooms in Kansas City and St. Louis.",
      "Missouri\u2019s governor, Republican Mike Kehoe, a former auto dealer himself, sponsored a 2014 bill when he was a state senator aimed at requiring manufacturers like Tesla to sell through local dealers. The bill passed the Senate but died in the House after Tesla lobbied against it. The referendum revives that plan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a soul in this country who\u2019s against trying to weed out government inefficiency but just taking a chain saw to people\u2019s lives and their health care is a ridiculous way to achieve that. And it is going to cause some devastating impacts,\u201d said organizer Brad Ketcher, a prominent Democrat and lawyer who helped draft the state\u2019s 2022 marijuana legalization referendum.",
      "An HHS spokesperson said the agency's downsizing, including cutting jobs and consolidating divisions, would save money and make the organization more efficient. As for the $11.4 billion in grant funding cuts, the spokesperson said, \u201cHHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a nonexistent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "The IRS has offered a similar rationale for its downsizing, saying it is making process improvements that will ultimately more efficiently serve the public.",
      "Musk said last year that Trump\u2019s budget cuts would cause a \u201ctemporary hardship\u201d that would soon put the economy on stronger footing.",
      "One local economic researcher said it remained unclear just how deep that hardship will be in Kansas City, including whether it will just slow growth or cause population losses.",
      "\u201cIt's a big burden that\u2019s being placed on a narrow group of people,\u201d said Frank Lenk, director of the Office of Economic Development at the Mid-America Regional Council, a nonprofit of city and county governments in the Kansas City region. \u201cIt will definitely take some of the steam out of the local economy.\"",
      "Trump has credited DOGE with helping end \u201cthe flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars,\u201d saving billions to help improve the nation\u2019s finances.",
      "The White House didn't respond to questions about Kansas City. But Trump said recently he would invite the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House to make up for a 2020 Super Bowl victory celebration that was canceled during the pandemic.",

      "Sam Rutledge and his wife have a baby due in mid-July, so they thought they had a few more months to research and buy the gear they\u2019ll need.",
      "But President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff announcement in early April turned the couple\u2019s slow walk into a sprint. In the past few weeks, they\u2019ve bought two strollers, a car seat, a nursery glider, a crib and a high chair. All of them are made overseas.",
      "\u201cThese are all pretty expensive under normal conditions, but when it became clear tariffs were coming we decided to buy them in case they became prohibitively expensive,\u201d said Rutledge, who is a high school physics teacher.",
      "Raising a child in America has never been cheap. In the first year alone, it costs an average of $20,384, according to Baby Center, a parenting website. But tariffs \u2013 ranging from 10% for imports from most countries to 145% for imports from China -- will make it many times more expensive for new parents.",
      "An estimated 90% of the core baby care products and the parts that go into making baby paraphernalia \u2013 from bottles and diaper pails to strollers and car seats \u2013 are made in Asia, according to the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, a U.S. trade group. The vast majority come from China.",
      "\u201cOverseas manufacturing has been the norm in our industry for decades,\u201d said Lisa Trofe, the association's executive director.",
      "It wasn\u2019t always this way. When Munchkin Inc. CEO Steven Dunn founded his company in 1991, it made baby bottles in California with tooling from New Jersey. But over the years, the manufacturers he used shut down and the cost of doing business in the U.S. skyrocketed. Now, about 60% of Munchkin\u2019s 500 products, from a $5 sippy cup to a $254 Night Owl Stroller with headlights, are made in China.",
      "In response to the tariffs, Dunn halted orders from China and instituted a hiring freeze at Munchkin\u2019s California headquarters, where 320 people are employed. Dunn expects Munchkin will run out of some products within three months.",
      "\u201cThere is no possibility of being able to pass on those tariffs\u201d to customers in the form of price increases, he said.",
      "Dunn said he tried to reduce his dependence on China in recent years, shifting some manufacturing to Vietnam and Mexico. He also spent a year communicating with American manufacturers to see if one could make Munchkin\u2019s new Flow Nipple Shield, which allows a breastfeeding mother to see if her milk is flowing. But most said they couldn\u2019t make the complex silicone product, Dunn said. It\u2019s now made in Vietnam.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not enough tool makers and manufacturing expertise and automation and skilled labor in the U.S. to make the thousands of products the juvenile industry needs,\u201d Dunn said.",
      "Multiple baby brands and companies contacted by The Associated Press didn\u2019t respond or said they weren\u2019t commenting on the tariffs, including Graco, Chicco, Britax, Nuna, Dorel Juvenile, UppaBaby, Evenflo and Bugaboo.",
      "The Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association said it asked the Trump administration for a tariff exemption, arguing that baby products are essential for children's well-being. Trump exempted some baby products, including car seats and high chairs, from import taxes during his first administration. But he hasn't said whether he would consider doing so again.",
      "The Associated Press left a message seeking comment with the White House.",
      "Nurture&, a company that makes a popular nursery glider and other baby furniture, said it\u2019s trying to be transparent about the impact of tariffs.",
      "In a recent email, the company told customers it started lowering prices on some items when the tariffs hit. The company, which was founded in 2020, said it would keep those lower prices in place until April 30, but after that it may not be able to absorb the full cost of the import duties.",
      "\u201cThese are large purchases, these are investments, and this is a very sensitive life stage,\u201d Nurture& Chief Merchant Jill Gruys said. \u201cWe want people to make the best decision for their budget and their family.\u201d",
      "Elizabeth Mahon, the owner of Three Littles, a baby store in Washington, said she\u2019s worried the tariffs will make essential products too expensive for some families.",
      "Mahon volunteers twice per month at the Department of Motor Vehicles, where she teaches people how to buckle their kids safely into car seats. Some families still must be persuaded to use car seats, she said. Mahon fears higher prices would be another deterrent.",
      "\u201cNo one is dying if they can\u2019t buy a toy, but if they don\u2019t have access to car seats, kids will get seriously injured,\u201d she said.",
      "At her own store, Mahon is getting notices that some manufacturers plan to introduce steep price increases in May. She feels lucky she could rent a storage facility and build up inventory ahead of the tariffs. For many small businesses, she said, the extra costs are \u201ca death sentence.\u201d",
      "At The Little Seedling baby shop in Ann Arbor, Michigan, owner Molly Ging said she would normally be putting in Christmas orders at this time of year. Instead, she\u2019s sorting through price increase notices from many of the vendors she works with.",

      "Fifteen years after the Deepwater Horizon disaster off the Gulf Coast, the effects of the largest oil spill in U.S. history are still being felt",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Fifteen years after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded off the Gulf Coast, killing 11 and sending 134 million gallons (500 million liters) of crude gushing into the ocean, the effects of the nation's worst offshore oil spill are still being felt.",
      "Oil company BP paid billions of dollars in damages, propelling ambitious coastal restoration projects across five states. Yet cleanup workers and local residents who suffered health impacts they attribute to the oil spill have struggled to have their cases heard in court and few have received significant compensation.",
      "Conservation groups say the spill catalyzed innovative restoration work across the Gulf Coast, but are alarmed at the recent halt of a flagship land-creation project in Louisiana. As the Trump administration expands offshore oil and gas, they are concerned the best opportunities for rebuilding the Gulf Coast are slipping away.",
      "In the coastal community of Lafitte in southeast Louisiana, Tammy Gremillion is celebrating Easter Sunday, the anniversary of the April 20 spill, without her daughter. She remembers warning Jennifer against joining a cleanup crew tasked with containing the spill for BP.",
      "\"But I couldn\u2019t stop her \u2014 they were offering these kids lots of money,\u201d Gremillion said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know the dangers. They didn\u2019t do what they should have to protect these young people.\u201d",
      "Jennifer worked knee-deep in oil for months, returning home reeking of fumes, covered in black splotches and breaking out in rashes and suffering headaches. She also was exposed to Corexit, an EPA-approved chemical applied on and below the water to disperse oil, which has been linked to health problems.",
      "In 2020, Jennifer died of leukemia, a blood cancer that can be caused by exposure to oil.",
      "Gremillion, who broke down in tears as she recounted her daughter's death, is \u201c1,000% confident\u201d that exposure to toxins during the cleanup caused the cancer.",
      "She filed a lawsuit against BP in 2022, although the allegations have been difficult to establish in court. Gremillion's suit is one of a small number of cases still pending.",
      "An investigation by The Associated Press previously found all but a handful of roughly 4,800 lawsuits seeking compensation for health problems linked to the oil spill have been dismissed and only one has been settled.",
      "In a 2012 settlement, BP paid ill workers and coastal residents $67 million, but this amounted to no more than $1,300 each for nearly 80% of those seeking compensation.",
      "Attorneys from the Downs Law Group, representing Gremillion and around 100 others in cases against BP, say the company leveraged procedural technicalities to block victims from getting their day in court.",
      "BP declined to comment on pending litigation. In court filings, BP denied allegations that oil exposure caused health problems and attacked the credibility of medical experts brought by plaintiffs.",
      "The environmental impact was devastating, recalled PJ Hahn, who served on the frontlines as a southeast Louisiana coastal management official. He watched the oil eat away at barrier islands and marsh around his community in Plaquemines Parish until \u201cit would just crumble like a cookie in hot coffee, just break apart.\u201d",
      "Oyster beds suffocated, reefs were blanketed in chemicals and the fishing industry tanked. Pelicans diving for dead fish emerged from the contaminated waters smeared in a black sheen. Tens of thousands of seabirds and sea turtles were killed, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Since then, \u201csignificant progress\u201d has been made restoring Gulf habitats and ecosystems, according to The\u200b Natural Resource Damage Assessment Trustee Council, a group of state and federal agencies tasked with managing restoration funded by penalties levied against BP.",
      "The council says more than 300 restoration projects worth $5.38 billion have been approved in the Gulf of Mexico, which President Donald Trump renamed the Gulf of America. The projects include acquiring wetlands in Mississippi to protect nesting areas for birds, rebuilding reefs along Pensacola Bay in Florida and restoring around 4 square miles (11 square kilometers) of marsh in Lake Borgne near New Orleans.",
      "While a tragedy, the spill \"galvanized a movement \u2014 one that continues to push for a healthier, more resilient coast,\u201d said Simone Maloz, campaign director for Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a conservation coalition.",
      "The influx of billions of dollars in penalties paid by BP \"allowed us to think bigger, act faster and rely on science to guide large-scale solutions,\u201d she added.",
      "Yet what many conservationists see as the flagship of the restoration projects funded by the Deepwater Horizon disaster payout \u2014 an approximately $3 billion effort to divert sediment from the Mississippi River to rebuild 21 square miles (54 square kilometers) of land in southeast Louisiana \u2014 has stalled over concerns of its impact on the livelihoods of local communities and dolphin populations.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has said the project would \u201cbreak our culture\" by harming local oyster and shrimp fisheries due to the influx of freshwater. Earlier this month, his administration paused the project for 90 days, citing its high costs, and its future remains uncertain.",

      "The Trump administration has called U.S. manufacturing an \u201ceconomic and national security\u201d priority and says tariffs will force companies to have more products made in the U.S. to avoid steep price increases on their imports, leading to \u201cbetter-paying ...",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Drew Greenblatt is fully on board with the Trump administration\u2019s use of tariffs to rebalance a global trading system that it says favors foreign companies over U.S. manufacturers.",
      "Greenblatt is the president and owner of Marlin Steel Wire Products in Baltimore, Maryland, which makes baskets and racks for medical device manufacturers, aerospace companies, food processing companies and others. It has 115 employees and makes its products in three locations in Maryland, Indiana and Michigan. The steel is sourced from Tennessee, Illinois and Michigan.",
      "Currently, it\u2019s hard to compete with baskets made overseas., Greenblatt says, because the countries he competes against have an \u201cunfair advantage.\u201d For example, due to European tariffs and taxes, it costs much more for a German consumer or company to buy Marlin wire baskets than it does for Americans to buy a German-made basket, creating an uneven playing field, Greenblatt said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wildly unfair to the American worker,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this has, by the way, been going on for decades.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has called U.S. manufacturing an \u201ceconomic and national security\u201d priority. U.S. manufacturing has been declining for decades. In June 1979, the number of manufacturing workers peaked at 19.6 million. By January of 2025, employment was down 35% to 12.8 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Small manufacturers, which make up 99% of all American manufacturing, have been hit particularly hard.",
      "The administration has implemented some tariffs against major U.S. trading partners, while putting a hold on other tariffs pending negotiations. The Trump administration says tariffs will force companies to have more products made in the U.S. to avoid steep price increases on their imports, which will mean \u201cbetter-paying American jobs,\u201d for people making cars, appliances and other goods.",
      "Greenblatt agrees, saying he could double his staff if \u201cparity\u201d in tariffs becomes a reality.",
      "While other small manufacturing businesses also support the tariffs, other owners have concerns. The Trump tariffs threaten to upend the existing economic order and possibly push the global economy into recession. And the uneven rollout of the policy has created uncertainty for businesses, financial markets and U.S. households.",
      "For Corry Blanc, the injection of uncertainty around the economy outstrips any potential benefit.",
      "He started his business, Blanc Creatives in Waynesboro, Virginia, in 2012. He makes handcrafted cookware such as skillets and other kitchenware and bakeware with American steel and wood and employs 12 staffers. He gets his steel from a plant in South Carolina and a distributor in Richmond. Wood comes from local regional sawmills near the company\u2019s headquarters in Waynesboro, Virginia.",
      "He said he\u2019s been fielding worried calls from customers in Canada and overseas. And he says the infrastructure isn\u2019t in place to increase production if more people do start buying American-made goods.",
      "Blanc said he survived the pandemic and other tough times, but conditions now are the hardest they\u2019ve ever been.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much uncertainty and not a lot of direction,\u201d he said.",
      "Michael Lyons is the founder of Rogue Industries, a company that makes wallets and other leather goods in a workshop in Standish, Maine, with a staff of nine. He uses leather from Maine and the Midwest. About 80% of his products are made in Maine and 20% are imported.",
      "He said the uncertainty around the tariffs is outweighing any potential long-term benefit. A long-time customer from Canada recently told Lyons that he would no longer be buying from Rogue Industries because of the friction between the two countries.",
      "\u201cHopefully this will pass, and he\u2019ll be able to come back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I did think that was kind of an interesting indicator for him to reach out.\u201d",
      "Lyons would like to expand his business, but says, \u201cat the time being, it\u2019s probably going to be, we hold with what we have.\u201d",
      "American Giant CEO Bayard Winthrop takes a more positive view. He founded his clothing company in 2011 after watching the textile industry go offshore, and seeing a lack of quality, affordable American-made clothing. He started by selling one sweatshirt, and now sells a wider range of clothing, mostly direct-to-consumer, but he also has a contract with Walmart.",
      "He sources cotton from Southeastern states like Georgia, Florida and North Carolina and has a factory in North Carolina and a joint partnership facility in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cPeople forget that in about 1985 that all the clothing that Americans bought was made in America,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is only in the last 40 years that that we really pursued as a country a very aggressive approach to globalization.\u201d",
      "In 1991, more than half of U.S. apparel, about 56%, was made in the U.S., according to statistics from the American Apparel and Footwear Association. By 2023 that number had shrunk to less than 4%.",
      "Winthrop hopes the tariffs will bring about a return to more American-made products.",
      "\u201cThe imbalances between our trading, in particularly with China, particularly the textiles, it\u2019s just shocking, to be honest with you,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes Trump's policies \"put domestic manufacturers on a bit more of a competitive footing.\u201d",
      "Winthrop understands people\u2019s concerns but said it\u2019s important to think longer term.",
      "\u201cAmericans are worried about tariffs, and I think there\u2019s a lot of justification for the worry because I think the administration can be volatile and unpredictable,\u201d he said. But he added that people should put that aside.",
      "\u201cThe idea that we\u2019re going to be more protective of our domestic marketplace and have an industrial policy that includes manufacturing jobs is, an old idea. It\u2019s not a new idea,\u201d he said.",

      "The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission held a meeting on Wednesday clarifying how it would treat new worker complaints of gender-identity discrimination in view of President Donald Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two \u201cimmutable\u201d sexes \u2014 male and female.",
      "Staff who handle incoming charges, or intakes, were directed to code them as \u201cC,\u201d the lowest categorization in the EEOC's system that is usually reserved for meritless charges, according to the agency employees who attended the Microsoft Teams meeting for intake supervisors, district directors and support staff that was led by the EEOC's national intake coordinator. The employees asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to reveal the meeting details.",
      "An EEOC spokesman declined to comment on the meeting, saying that \u201cper federal law, we cannot discuss investigatory practices.\u201d",
      "The decision is the latest step by the EEOC to back away from defending the rights of transgender and nonbinary workers in a major shift in civil rights enforcement under the Trump administration. In February, the EEOC moved to drop seven of its own pending lawsuits alleging discrimination against transgender and nonbinary people.",
      "EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, has said one of her priorities will be implementing Trump\u2019s executive order on gender and \u201cdefending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.\u201d She had previously ordered that any worker discrimination charge that \u201cimplicates\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order on gender should be elevated to headquarters for review.",
      "This latest decision to bury gender identity-related complaints leaves transgender and nonbinary people experiencing discrimination at work with limited recourse. U.S. workers must file discrimination complaints through the EEOC in most cases before they can seek other legal avenues.",
      "Giving gender identity-related cases the lowest priority essentially pre-determines that they are meritless, said Chai Feldblum, who was an EEOC commissioner from 2010-2019.",
      "\u201cIf they say they are bringing it to a central location to give them due consideration, they at least have the facade of doing something,\u201d Feldblum said of Lucas\u2019 previous directive on gender identity cases. \u201cIf they are sweeping them out the door as \u201cC\u201d charges, they are not doing their job.\u201d",
      "The EEOC has said that it will still issue \u201cright to sue\u201d notices in gender-identity related cases upon request, meaning workers can decide to pursue a lawsuit on their own. The agency will also honor requests for mediation, according to the employees who attended Wednesday's meeting. But if mediation fails, the EEOC will take no further action on the case, the employees said.",
      "The EEOC\u2019s new approach to gender-identity related discrimination has raised a debate over whether the agency is acting in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, a landmark case that established that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits workplace discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Civil rights activists have accused the EEOC of illegally defying the Supreme Court and abdicating its duty to enforce anti-discrimination laws by abandoning gender-identity related lawsuits. Lucas has previously told The AP that the EEOC has a duty to comply with Trump\u2019s executive orders but she has not directly addressed the criticism that the agency\u2019s handling of gender-identity cases are in tension with the Supreme Court.",
      "The EEOC in fiscal year 2024 received more than 3,000 charges alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and 3,000-plus in 2023, according to the agency\u2019s website.",

      "Cambodia and China have signed a $1.2 billion deal to finance an ambitious canal project that aims to boost trade efficiency by linking a branch of the Mekong River near Phnom Penh to a port on the Gulf of Thailand",
      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Cambodia and China have signed a $1.2 billion deal to finance an ambitious canal project that aims to boost trade efficiency by linking a branch of the Mekong River near Phnom Penh to a port on the Gulf of Thailand, the Cambodian government agency heading the project announced Friday.",
      "The deal to fund the Funan Techo Canal was signed Thursday during the state visit to Cambodia of Chinese President Xi Jinping, the agency said in a news release. Xi returned home Friday after a three-nation Southeast Asian tour that also included Vietnam and Malaysia.",
      "Construction of the 151.6-kilometer (94-mile) canal began last year but was halted shortly after the Aug. 5 groundbreaking ceremony for reasons that were not made clear. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said at the time that the canal will be built \u201cno matter what the cost,\u201d emphasizing that the project promotes \u201cnational prestige, the territorial integrity and the development of Cambodia.\u201d",
      "Described as a public-private partnership contract, the deal was signed by Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol on behalf of Cambodia\u2019s government, and by Ieng Sunly of the Funan Techo Coastal-Inland Waterways Company Ltd., the private sector partner. The project is being developed on a build-operate-transfer basis, with Cambodian investors holding a 51% stake, and Chinese investors holding 49%.",
      "\u201cThe canal will create a new inland waterway-maritime corridor capable of handling vessels up to 3,000 deadweight tons,\u201d according to Friday\u2019s announcement. It will encompass canal excavation and the construction of ship locks, navigation and logistics infrastructure.",
      "\u201cAs an inland waterway and important transport infrastructure in Cambodia, the FTC Project will become a new engine driving national economic growth,\" said Wang Tongzhou, chairman of China Communications Construction Company, in the announcement. He added that \"after completion, it will significantly reduce the comprehensive logistics costs in Cambodia, and promote Cambodia\u2019s industry to the middle-to-high end of the value chain.\u201d",
      "China Communications Construction Company is the parent company of China Road and Bridge Corporation, the contractor for the project's construction from the Bassac River to the coastal province of Kep. The massive state-owned firm has faced scrutiny for its alleged involvement in financial scandals. It is also blacklisted by the United States for its role in helping the Chinese military construct and militarize artificial islands in the South China Sea.",
      "According to Friday's announcement, the canal is expected to create \"up to 50,000 direct and indirect jobs in Cambodia.\u201d",
      "Critics have raised concerns that the canal could severely disrupt the Mekong Rive r\u2019s natural flood patterns. These disruptions could lead to worsening droughts and a reduction in the nutrient-rich silt essential for Vietnam\u2019s vital rice production in the Mekong Delta, a region that sustains millions and is a major global rice exporter.",
      "The signing announcement, however, stated that \u201cA rigorous Environmental Impact Assessment, conducted by 48 specialists, confirmed minimal environmental impact.\u201d",
      "It added that the Cambodian government has led efforts to minimize resettlement \u201cwith a route designed to avoid dense communities and cultural sites\" and that \"a responsible compensation and consultation process is underway.\u201d",

      "Legge became the first woman in seven years to start a Cup Series race earlier this year at Phoenix. But her debut in NASCAR's top series ended when Legge, who had already spun once, was involved in another spin and collected Daniel Suarez.",
      "Her next start was the lower-level Xfinity race in Rockingham, North Carolina, last Saturday. Legge was good enough to make the field on speed but was bumped off the starting grid because of ownership points. Ultimately, she was able to take J.J. Yeley's seat in the No. 53 car for Joey Gase Motorsports, which had to scramble at the last minute to prepare the car for her.",
      "Legge was well off the pace as the leaders were lapping her, and when she entered Turn 1, William Sawalich got into the back of her car. That sent Legge spinning, and Kahne had nowhere to go, running into her along the bottom of the track.",
      "\u201cI gave (Sawalich) a lane and the reason the closing pace looks so high isn\u2019t because I braked mid-corner. I didn\u2019t. I stayed on my line, stayed doing my speed, which obviously isn\u2019t the speed of the leaders because they\u2019re passing me,\u201d Legge said. \u201cHe charged in a bit too hard, which is the speed difference you see. He understeered up a lane and into me, which spun me around.\u201d",

      "She has dabbled in NASCAR in the past, too, starting four Xfinity races during the 2018 season and another two years ago.",

      "Many NFL fans spend the weeks leading up the draft poring over mock drafts to try to figure out which players their favorites teams are most likely to select.",
      "Those projections quickly become obsolete once the actual draft begins with some predicted targets inevitably coming off the board before a team even makes its pick.",
      "That was the motivation for the NFL's NextGen Stats team to create a new draft site that takes elements from the old draft preview magazines with the easily digestible information with the ability to adapt seamlessly with each move made before or during the draft.",
      "\u201cThe draft magazine was so efficient at displaying information in a easy to digest way,\u201d said Mike Band, the senior manager for research and analytics at NFL NextGen Stats. \u201cIn a lot of ways as we\u2019ve optimized for mobile experiences, we\u2019ve lost that art of a dashboard-like experience. That was the impetus for this project, creating a digital magazine that could be updated live and evolve in a dynamic way and hopefully have really fun and engaging live features.\u201d",
      "The NFL Draft IQ site launched earlier this month to preview the draft was designed to be the ideal second screen during the draft starting Thursday night. The site includes team-by-team pages that list each team's picks in the next two drafts, moves they had made in the offseason, potential draft targets for each day of the draft, a mock draft tracker and historic tendencies for each general manager.",
      "The site was created in less than three weeks from idea to the execution with help from Amazon QuickSight, building on the work the NextGen Stats team did in creating Combine IQ, which provided context and comparisons to the loads of data produced at the annual scouting combine.",
      "Band has been posting potential first-round targets for teams for the past six years and has had a high rate with about three-quarters of the teams taking one of his potential targets.",
      "That work used from looking at team needs, draft history, mock drafts, pre-draft meetings and other information leads to the potential targets on the Draft IQ site for each team for each day. Those will be updated throughout the draft based on who's left on the board and what needs have been met.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fun exercise to try to match these teams to players across different pre-draft interests, team needs,\u201d Band said. \u201cA lot of teams have a lot of smoke screens, so you almost have to read between the lines in a lot ways.\u201d",
      "The team pages include tendencies for general managers, including how often they have traded up or down, whether they target certain positions in the prime rounds and if the GM has had patterns based on size, age or other attributes when picking players.",
      "For example, Houston\u2019s Nick Caserio has used 31 of his 32 picks on players who came out of power conferences. The Bengals also tend to go that direction with all 22 of their picks in the first two rounds since 2014 coming from power conference schools.",
      "Philadelphia\u2019s Howie Roseman has used 10 of his 13 first-round picks when running the draft on the trenches, while Detroit\u2019s Brad Holmes\u2019 picks have the highest average athleticism score from NGS since he took over in 2021.",
      "\u201cIf you want to know who the last few picks were you can go to the draft tracker on NFL(dot)com,\u201d Band said. \u201cBut if you want to go deeper into every pick as it\u2019s happening and trying to anticipate the next pick and you want to sound smart at an NFL draft party and tip the pick without actually talking to Ian Rapoport, then follow along with Draft IQ.\u201d",

      "Duke star Cooper Flagg is headed to the NBA as the favorite to be the No. 1 overall draft pick",
      "Duke star Cooper Flagg is headed to the NBA as the favorite to be the No. 1 overall draft pick.",
      "The program announced Flagg's move in a social media post Monday following after a lone college season that saw the 18-year-old become only the fourth freshman named as The Associated Press national player of the year while leading the Blue Devils to the Final Four.",
      "Flagg had reclassified to get to Duke a year early, and his decision was expected all year, even as he generally declined to spell out plans about his professional future as the season pushed into March or mentioned how much fun he had playing in college.",
      "\u201cI mean, it's been an incredible year with a really great group of people,\" Flagg told the AP in March after winning national player of the year.",
      "The 6-foot-9, 205-pound forward from Newport, Maine, averaged 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.4 blocks and 1.4 steals to lead the Blue Devils in each category. He\u2019s a versatile threat who showed the ability to thrive as a scorer, playmaker and defender.",
      "\u201cHis highlights, his statistics, the ways he impacted the game on both ends of the floor, really in every category, was off the charts \u2014 as good of a freshman season that a guy has had here,\u201d Duke coach Jon Scheyer said in a social media video from the program about Flagg's NBA declaration.",
      "\u201cBut to me the separator and the joy of coaching Cooper is the person he was every day, the teammate that he was \u2014 never about statistics or anything other than creating an environment and helping his team to win.\u201d",
      "The statistical highlight came when Flagg scored 42 points to set an Atlantic Coast Conference freshman record against Notre Dame in January, along with having 30 points, six rebounds and seven assists to help Duke hold off Arizona in the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16. There were plenty of impressive single plays, too, that demanded highlight-reel placement like his transition dunk through a defender against Pittsburgh in January.",
      "Flagg closed with 27 points and seven rebounds in a loss to Houston in the national semifinals. The Blue Devils had led by 14 with about 8 1/2 minutes left but faltered late, with Houston scoring the game\u2019s last nine points in the final 33 seconds and Flagg missing a late shot for the lead.",
      "Still, he was an elite and hypercompetitive force for one of college basketball\u2019s top teams all season with a game far more advanced than his age, capable of making an impact from baseline to baseline and sideline to sideline. He won't turn 19 until December, which would be roughly two months into his rookie season.",
      "Flagg is the third Duke player to announce an early exit for the NBA in the past week, joining freshman wing Kon Knueppel and junior guard Tyrese Proctor.",

      "The Detroit Pistons could have sounded shaken, after a few miserable minutes against the New York Knicks ruined an otherwise solid return to the postseason",
      "NEW YORK -- The Detroit Pistons could have sounded shaken, after a few miserable minutes against the New York Knicks ruined an otherwise solid return to the postseason.",
      "Same with the Los Angeles Clippers, who played beautiful basketball down the stretch of the regular season but not in their series opener against Denver.",
      "Yet whether it's a team filled with playoff newcomers such as the Pistons, or a group of tested veterans such as the Clippers, everyone knows the rules at this time of the year. There's no time for hanging heads or dwelling on disappointments.",
      "The next game comes quickly and all that matters is being ready when it arrives.",
      "\u201cIt's even keel,\u201d Clippers All-Star said James Harden said. \u201cWe will come back in Game 2 and be even better.\u201d",
      "That comes Monday night in Denver, after the Knicks try to take a 2-0 lead over the Pistons in the opener of the doubleheader.",
      "Harden and Kawhi Leonard, the Clippers' leaders, along with coach Tyronn Lue, have been part of many deep playoff runs. So they were not going to let their 112-110 overtime loss on Saturday linger. They just figure they will clean up the 20 turnovers they committed and be fine.",
      "Most of the Pistons don't have that kind of experience to lean on. Detroit is in the playoffs for the first time since 2019, but the 21-0 run the Knicks hit them with in the fourth quarter of their 123-112 victory didn't have anyone fearing they weren't ready for the moment.",
      "Instead, the Pistons focused on the way they played in building an eight-point lead before then and said their confidence had only grown.",
      "\u201cAll-time high. We're in the playoffs, we know what time it is,\" forward Tobias Harris said. \"We don't have anybody in there pouting or holding their head down. We know what we're made of, we know we work so hard for every single day of the year of this season. We're ready for Game 2.\u201d",

      "Series: Knicks lead, 1-0.",
      "BetMGM says: Knicks by 6.5",
      "What to Know: The Pistons' NBA-record losing streak in the postseason is now at 15 games, with Detroit's last victory in Game 4 of the 2008 Eastern Conference finals. Star guard Cade Cunningham had 21 points, 12 assists and six rebounds in his first playoff game, but OG Anunoby and the Knicks defense limited him to 8-for-21 shooting. He averaged 30.8 points on 56.3% shooting against the Knicks this season, and had gone for 32 per game in his previous four visits to Madison Square Garden. Jalen Brunson appeared to be hobbling in the third quarter after tweaking his ankle, but said after scoring 34 points that he felt fine.",

      "Series: Nuggets lead, 1-0",
      "BetMGM says: Clippers by 1.5",
      "What to Know: Denver is 4-0 since firing Michael Malone and replacing him with interim coach David Adelman. The Clippers, meanwhile, had won eight in a row and 18 of 21 before blowing a 15-point lead in the opener. They will now try to avoid losing consecutive games for the first time since a three-game skid from Feb. 28 to March 4. The teams both went 50-32 in the regular season, when they split their four meetings, and was almost nothing between them in Game 1. The Clippers made two more field goals and had one more assist, while the Nuggets outrebounded them by one. Nikola Jokic, after averaging a triple-double during the regular season, just missed one with 29 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds.",

      "The days of running backs being the headliners at the NFL draft are long in the past with the league's shift to more passing leading to quarterbacks, pass rushers and pass blockers dominating the top of the draft each year.",
      "The ingredients could be in place for a bit of a change this year thanks to one of the deepest classes of running backs in years following a season when game-changing backs such as Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry became the biggest free agent hits.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a kid, running back was arguably the most important position on the field,\" Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said at the scouting combine. \u201cI grew up a Cowboys fan \u2014 Tony Dorsett, Emmitt Smith, guys like that were my idols. Then we went through this period over the last five, 10 years, where the analytics certainly de-emphasized the position. I think last year, you saw the impact that some of these guys had. ... I think (running backs) are looked at as probably replaceable by some people, but if you have a great one, you've got a historic one, you just can't replace those guys.\"",
      "The big question headed into the draft Thursday is whether teams view prospects such as Boise State's Ashton Jeanty and North Carolina's Omarion Hampton as those types of backs worthy of being taken with a premium pick.",
      "Jeanty was projected in the final AP mock draft to go sixth to Las Vegas, which would be the highest pick for a running back since Barkley was taken second overall in 2018 by the New York Giants.",
      "\u201cWe just saw Saquon Barkley just change the Eagles in one year,\u201d Raiders GM John Spytek said. \"Now they had a great team around him and it was adding an elite player. I think when you sit where we sit, I mean the idea is to add elite players at any position. I don\u2019t try to devalue any certain position. ... There\u2019s certain ways to build a team, and I don\u2019t know where we got to a place where we don\u2019t feel like running backs are valued. I come from the University of Michigan to my core, and those guys were certainly really valued there. So, it\u2019s hard for me to get away from that.\u201d",
      "Only one running back in the past six drafts was taken in the top 10 with Bijan Robinson going eighth to Atlanta in 2023. Five running backs were top-10 picks from 2015-18 with two being taken that high in 2017 when Leonard Fournette went fourth and Christian McCaffrey went eighth.",
      "It's a far cry from earlier eras when running backs were often the top overall pick, including four times in five seasons from 1977-81. No running back has gone first overall since Ki-Jana Carter in 1995.",
      "Teams have been waiting later and later to take running backs with Jonathan Brooks the first to go last year at No. 46 to Carolina. There has been just an average of two running backs taken in the top 50 in the past six drafts, down from a peak of 12 in 1990.",
      "This year's class of running backs is one of the deepest in recent memory with several players after Jeanty and Hampton projected to be picked either late in the first round or on day two of the draft including Ohio State's duo of TreVeyon Henderson and Quinshon Judkins; Iowa's Kaleb Johnson; Arizona State's Cam Skattebo, Tennessee's Dylan Sampson; Virginia Tech's Bhayshul Tuten; and Central Florida's RJ Harvey.",
      "The shift from a running to a passing league began with rule changes in 1978 that made passing easier and has continued for more than four decades.",
      "The rate of running dropped from a post-merger high of nearly 58% in 1977 to a low of just more than 40% in 2014 before undergoing a slight increase in recent years to 43.4% last season.",
      "But the bell-cow back had mostly disappeared as teams went to a backfield by committee. The league featured 13 players in 2003 who had at least 300 carries in a season \u2014 matching the nine-year combined total from 2015-23.",
      "Six players hit the 300-carry mark last season led by Barkley and Henry for the most in a season since 2010.",
      "\u201cFor a while, the market maybe was suppressed. People were not looking at them as weapons,\" Bills GM Brandon Beane said. \"I kind of look for them as anyone you add to your offense, what do they bring? What is their skill set? Is it a mismatched player? ... Someone asked, I think a year or two ago, what is your philosophy? Would you draft a running back in the first round? I probably wouldn\u2019t draft a running back that is 3 yards and a cloud of dust, but if it\u2019s a weapon like some of these guys were talking about, heck yeah I would.\u201d",
      "With the diminished role of the featured back, the pay at the position has also suffered with Josh Jacobs\u2019 running back-leading $48 million deal with Green Bay ranking tied for 159th among all players. The $13.6 million franchise tag number for running backs \u2014 determined by the highest-paid players at each position \u2014 is the lowest of any position outside of specialists.",
      "The rookie wage scale put in place in the 2011 collective bargaining agreement determines salaries for the first four seasons solely on draft position, leading teams to use premium picks on high-value positions such as quarterback, tackle, pass rushers and receivers in order to save money compared to veteran contracts.",
      "That\u2019s a big factor that is hard for some teams to overcome.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting conversation, because the draft pick is about potential ceiling, ability to play at a certain level, while you have those years under contract below free agency market level, your ability to sustain a second contract,\u201d Vikings general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah said. \u201cThere\u2019s all these questions that come into that answer before you pull the card.\u201d",

      "They\u2019re concerned about what happens if the ChatGPT maker fulfills its ambition to build AI that outperforms humans, but is no longer accountable to its public mission to safeguard that technology from causing grievous harms.",
      "\u201cUltimately, I\u2019m worried about who owns and controls this technology once it\u2019s created,\u201d said Page Hedley, a former policy and ethics adviser at OpenAI, in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Backed by three Nobel Prize winners and other advocates and experts, Hedley and nine other ex-OpenAI workers sent a letter this week to the two state attorneys general.",
      "The coalition is asking California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, both Democrats, to use their authority to protect OpenAI's charitable purpose and block its planned restructuring. OpenAI is incorporated in Delaware and operates out of San Francisco.",
      "OpenAI said in response that \u201cany changes to our existing structure would be in service of ensuring the broader public can benefit from AI.\u201d It said its for-profit will be a public benefit corporation, similar to other AI labs like Anthropic and tech billionaire Elon Musk's xAI, except that OpenAI will still preserve a nonprofit arm.",
      "\u201cThis structure will continue to ensure that as the for-profit succeeds and grows, so too does the nonprofit, enabling us to achieve the mission,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "The letter is the second petition to state officials this month. The last came from a group of labor leaders and nonprofits focused on protecting OpenAI's billions of dollars of charitable assets.",
      "Jennings said last fall she would \u201creview any such transaction to ensure that the public\u2019s interests are adequately protected.\" Bonta\u2019s office sought more information from OpenAI late last year but has said it can\u2019t comment, even to confirm or deny if it is investigating.",
      "OpenAI's co-founders, including current CEO Sam Altman and Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build what's known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for humanity's benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product.",
      "OpenAI already has a for-profit subsidiary but faces a number of challenges in converting its core governance structure. One is a lawsuit from Musk, who accuses the company and Altman of betraying the founding principles that led the Tesla CEO to invest in the charity.",
      "While some of the signatories of this week's letter support Musk's lawsuit, Hedley said others are \u201cunderstandably cynical\u201d because Musk also runs his own rival AI company.",
      "The signatories include two Nobel-winning economists, Oliver Hart and Joseph Stiglitz, as well as AI pioneers and computer scientists Geoffrey Hinton, who won last year's Nobel Prize in physics, and Stuart Russell.",
      "\u201cI like OpenAI\u2019s mission to \u2018ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity,\u2019 and I would like them to execute that mission instead of enriching their investors,\" Hinton said in a statement Wednesday. \"I\u2019m happy there is an effort to hold OpenAI to its mission that does not involve Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "Conflicts over OpenAI's purpose have long simmered at the San Francisco institute, contributing to Musk quitting in 2018, Altman's short-lived ouster in 2023 and other high-profile departures.",
      "Hedley, a lawyer by training, worked for OpenAI in 2017 and 2018, a time when the nonprofit was still navigating the best ways to steward the technology it wanted to build. As recently as 2023, Altman said advanced AI held promise but also warned of extraordinary risks, from drastic accidents to societal disruptions.",
      "In recent years, however, Hedley said he watched with concern as OpenAI, buoyed by the success of ChatGPT, was increasingly cutting corners on safety testing and rushing out new products to get ahead of business competitors.",
      "\u201cThe costs of those decisions will continue to go up as the technology becomes more powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that in the new structure that OpenAI wants, the incentives to rush to make those decisions will go up and there will no longer be anybody really who can tell them not to, tell them this is not OK.\u201d",
      "Software engineer Anish Tondwalkar, a former member of OpenAI\u2019s technical team until last year, said an important assurance in OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit charter is a \u201cstop-and-assist clause\u201d that directs OpenAI to stand down and help if another organization is nearing the achievement of better-than-human AI.",
      "\u201cIf OpenAI is allowed to become a for-profit, these safeguards, and OpenAI\u2019s duty to the public can vanish overnight,\u201d Tondwalkar said in a statement Wednesday.",

      "Harmful bleaching of the world\u2019s coral has now grown to include 84% of the ocean\u2019s reefs in the most intense event of its kind in recorded history",
      "Harmful bleaching of the world's coral has grown to include 84% of the ocean's reefs in the most intense event of its kind in recorded history, the International Coral Reef Initiative announced Wednesday.",
      "It's the fourth global bleaching event since 1998, and has now surpassed bleaching from 2014-17 that hit some two-thirds of reefs, said the ICRI, a mix of more than 100 governments, non-governmental organizations and others. And it's not clear when the current crisis, which began in 2023 and is blamed on warming oceans, will end.",
      "\u201cWe may never see the heat stress that causes bleaching dropping below the threshold that triggers a global event,\u201d said Mark Eakin, executive secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired coral monitoring chief for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at something that\u2019s completely changing the face of our planet and the ability of our oceans to sustain lives and livelihoods,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "Last year was Earth\u2019s hottest year on record, and much of that is going into oceans. The average annual sea surface temperature of oceans away from the poles was a record 20.87 degrees Celsius (69.57 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "That's deadly to corals, which are key to seafood production, tourism and protecting coastlines from erosion and storms. Coral reefs are sometimes dubbed \u201crainforests of the sea\u201d because they support high levels of biodiversity \u2014 approximately 25% of all marine species can be found in, on and around coral reefs.",
      "Coral get their bright colors from the colorful algae that live inside them and are a food source for the corals. Prolonged warmth causes the algae to release toxic compounds, and the coral eject them. A stark white skeleton is left behind, and the weakened coral is at heightened risk of dying.",
      "The bleaching event has been so severe that NOAA\u2019s Coral Reef Watch program has had to add levels to its bleaching alert scale to account for the growing risk of coral death.",
      "Efforts are underway to conserve and restore coral. One Dutch lab has worked with coral fragments, including some taken from off the coast of the Seychelles, to propagate them in a zoo so that they might be used someday to repopulate wild coral reefs if needed. Other projects, including one off Florida, have worked to rescue corals endangered by high heat and nurse them back to health before returning them to the ocean.",
      "But scientists say it's essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet, such as carbon dioxide and methane.",
      "\u201cThe best way to protect coral reefs is to address the root cause of climate change. And that means reducing the human emissions that are mostly from burning of fossil fuels \u2026 everything else is looking more like a Band-Aid rather than a solution,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "\u201cI think people really need to recognize what they\u2019re doing \u2026 inaction is the kiss of death for coral reefs,\u201d said Melanie McField, co-chair of the Caribbean Steering Committee for the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, a network of scientists that monitors reefs throughout the world.",
      "The group's update comes as President Donald Trump has moved aggressively in his second term to boost fossil fuels and roll back clean energy programs, which he says is necessary for economic growth.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a government right now that is working very hard to destroy all of these ecosystems ... removing these protections is going to have devastating consequences,\" Eakin said.",

      "Comet SWAN, hailing from the Oort Cloud beyond Pluto, has been visible through telescopes and binoculars over the past few weeks with its streaming tail, but experts said it may not have survived its recent trip past the sun and is fading fast.",
      "\u201cWe'll soon be left with just a dusty rubble pile,\u201d astrophysicist Karl Battams with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory said in an email.",
      "Comets are balls of frozen gas and dust from billions of years ago. Every so often, a comet passes through the inner solar system.",
      "\u201cThese are relics from when the solar system first formed,\u201d said Jason Ybarra, director of the West Virginia University Planetarium and Observatory.",
      "The newest comet was discovered by amateur astronomers, who spied it in photos taken by a camera on a spacecraft operated by NASA and the European Space Agency to study the sun.",
      "The comet won't swing close to Earth like Tsuchinshan-Atlas did last year. Other notable flybys included Neowise in 2020 and Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake in the 1990s.",
      "The comet, also designated C/2025 F2, would have been visible just after dark slightly north of where the sun set. Its green color would have been difficult to see with the naked eye.",
      "This might have been the object\u2019s first ever trip past the sun, making it particularly vulnerable to breaking apart, Battams said. After its flyby, what's left of the comet will disappear into the outer reaches of the solar system, past where scientists think it came from.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to go so far out that we have no idea if it\u2019s ever going to return,\u201d said Battams.",

      "As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry\u2019s bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn\u2019t anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House less than 100 days ago",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry's bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn't anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House nearly 100 days ago.",
      "Since President Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, Big Tech stocks have been on a see-sawing ride that has eviscerated trillions of dollars in shareholder wealth amid an onslaught of tariffs and other potentially detrimental actions.",
      "It's the polar opposite of what Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos hoped for when they assembled behind Trump as he was sworn in.",
      "That display of unity reflected a belief that Trump's second stint in the White House would be a refreshing change from the heavy-handed regulation of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration while unleashing even more lucrative opportunities in artificial intelligence and deal-making.",
      "But the Trump administration\u2019s policies so far have vexed Big Tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d companies \u2014 a group consisting of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value has plunged by $3.8 trillion, or 22%, as of April 20.",
      "The financial damage was even more severe a few days after Trump\u2019s April 2 unveiling of sweeping reciprocal tariffs that would have exacted a heavy toll on Big Tech's supply chains in China and other key markets around the globe. A temporary freeze on the majority of the most punitive tariffs and an exemption from most of the fees on electronics coming in from China has provided some relief, but Trump has made it clear the reprieve may be short-lived.",
      "That has left the specter of Trump's ongoing trade war hanging over Big Tech, whose influence extends around the world.",
      "\u201cThe mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said.",
      "Besides the upheaval triggered by Trump's tariffs, his administration is also in the midst of trying to prove regulators' allegations that Meta has been running an illegal monopoly in social networking, and working to persuade a federal judge to break up Google after its search engine last year was found to be illegally abusing its power. Trump also has given no indication of abandoning antitrust lawsuits filed by the Biden administration that could hobble Apple and Amazon.",
      "And Nvidia absorbed a significant setback last week when the Trump administration banned it from selling one of its popular AI chips to China, prompting the company to record a $5.5 billion charge to account for the stockpile of processors that it intended to export to that country.",
      "Tech CEOs will get a chance to discuss the fallout from the trade war and other challenges still ahead during analyst conference calls that will be held as part of their companies\u2019 financial reports for the January-March quarter.",
      "The ritual will kick off Tuesday when Tesla is scheduled to release its full financial report after already revealing that its first-quarter car sales dropped by 13% from the same time last year.",
      "The decline occurred against a backdrop of vandalism, widespread protests and calls for a consumer boycott amid a backlash to Musk\u2019s high-profile role in the White House overseeing a cost-cutting purge of U.S. government agencies.",
      "After Musk discusses his strategy for reversing a decrease in Tesla's market value since he joined Trump in the White House, Google parent Alphabet Inc. is scheduled to announce its results on Thursday. Then four of the Magnificent Seven will get their turn next week: Amazon on April 29; Meta and Microsoft on April 30; and Apple on May 1.",
      "Nvidia, which operates on a fiscal year ending in January, is scheduled to wrap things up on May 28 with the release of its quarterly results.",

      "The drama will unfold in a Washington courtroom during the next three weeks during hearings that will determine how the company should be penalized for operating an illegal monopoly in search. The proceedings, known in legal parlance as a \u201cremedy hearing,\u201d feature a parade of witnesses that includes Google CEO Sundar Pichai.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is asking a federal judge to order a radical shake-up that would ban Google from striking the multibillion dollar deals with Apple and other tech companies that shield its search engine from competition, share its repository of valuable user data with rivals and force a sale of its popular Chrome browser.",
      "The moment of reckoning comes four-and-half-years after the Justice Department filed a landmark lawsuit alleging Google\u2019s search engine had been abusing its power as the internet's main gateway to stifle competition and innovation for more than a decade.",
      "After the case finally went to trial in 2023, a federal judge last year ruled Google had been making anti-competitive deals to lock in its search engine as the go-to place for digital information on the iPhone, personal computers and other widely used devices, including those running on its own Android software.",
      "That landmark ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sets up a high-stakes drama that will determine the penalties for Google\u2019s misconduct in a search market that it has defined since Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded the company in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Since that austere start, Google has expanded far beyond search to become a powerhouse in email, digital mapping, online video, web browsing, smartphone software and data centers.",
      "Seizing upon its victory in the search case, the Justice Department is now setting out to prove that radical steps must be taken to rein in Google and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\u201cGoogle\u2019s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that \u2014 no matter what occurs \u2014 Google always wins,\u201d the Justice Department argued in documents outlining its proposed penalties. \u201cThe American people thus are forced to accept the unbridled demands and shifting, ideological preferences of an economic leviathan in return for a search engine the public may enjoy.\u201d",
      "Although the proposed penalties were originally made under President Joe Biden's term, they are still being embraced by the Justice Department under President Donald Trump, whose first administration filed the case against Google. Since the change in administrations, the Justice Department has also attempted to cast Google's immense power as a threat to freedom, too.",
      "\u201cThe American dream is about higher values than just cheap goods and \u2018free\u2019 online services,\" the Justice Department wrote in a March 7 filing with Mehta. \u201cThese values include freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom to innovate, and freedom to compete in a market undistorted by the controlling hand of a monopolist.\"",
      "Google is arguing the government's proposed changes are unwarranted under a ruling that its search engine popularity among consumers is one of the main reasons it has become so dominant.",
      "The \u201cunprecedented array of proposed remedies would harm consumers and innovation, as well as future competition in search and search ads in addition to numerous other adjacent markets,\u201d Google lawyers said in a filing leading up to hearings. \u201cThey bear little or no relationship to the conduct found anticompetitive, and are contrary to the law.\u201d",
      "Google also is sounding alarms about the proposed requirements to share online search data with rivals and the proposed sale of Chrome posing privacy and security risks. \u201cThe breadth and depth of the proposed remedies risks doing significant damage to a complex ecosystem. Some of the proposed remedies would imperil browser developers and jeopardize the digital security of millions of consumers.\"",
      "The showdown over Google's fate marks the climax of the biggest antitrust case in the U.S. since the Justice Department sued Microsoft in the late 1990s for leveraging its Windows software for personal computers to crush potential rivals.",
      "The Microsoft battle culminated in a federal judge declaring the company an illegal monopoly and ordering a partial breakup \u2014 a remedy that was eventually overturned by an appeals court.",
      "Google intends to file an appeal of Mehta's ruling from last year that branded its search engine as an illegal monopoly but can't do so until the remedy hearings are completed. After closing arguments are presented in late May, Mehta intends to make his decision on the remedies before Labor Day.",
      "The search case marked the first in a succession of antitrust cases that have been brought against a litany of tech giants that include Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, which is currently fighting allegations of running an illegal monopoly in social media in another Washington D.C. trial. Other antitrust cases have been brought against both Apple and Amazon, too.",
      "The Justice Department also targeted Google's digital advertising network in a separate antitrust case that resulted last week in another federal judge's decision that found the company was abusing its power in that market, too. That ruling means Google will be heading into another remedy hearing that could once again raise the specter of a breakup later this year or early next year.",

      "Nobody knows where whale sharks, the biggest fish in the sea, are mating",
      "JAMESTOWN, St. Helena -- Whale sharks shouldn't be hard for scientists to find. They are enormous \u2014 they are the biggest fish in the sea and perhaps the biggest fish to have ever lived. They are found in warm oceans all around the world. By shark standards, they are slow swimmers.",
      "But they somehow manage to also be very private: Scientists don't know where they mate, and they've never observed it before.",
      "They do finally have some clues, though. Scientists suspect the magic may be happening in the waters around St. Helena, a remote volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean where Napoleon Bonaparte was once exiled and died. It's the only place in the world where adult male and female whale sharks are known to regularly gather in roughly equal numbers \u2014 and food doesn\u2019t seem to be the main attraction.",
      "Kenickie Andrews, the marine conservation project manager at the St. Helena Trust says he\u2019s seen male sharks chasing females, nibbling on their pectoral fins and \u201cdisplaying themselves\u201d to the female sharks, akin to mating rituals observed in other sharks including great whites.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen here is classic shark courtship behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cTo this day we haven\u2019t seen successful copulation, but it is proof (whale sharks) are in our waters trying out these behaviors.\u201d",
      "Whale sharks typically measure from 12 to 18 meters (39 to 59 feet), weigh up to 14 tons and are plankton eaters; all sharks have a unique pattern of white spots on their upper side.",
      "Scientists say they need to know where the sharks are mating and giving birth so they can protect those areas, possibly by creating marine reserves where threats like fishing are banned. Whale sharks are designated as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature; the group says their population has been \u201clargely depleted.\u201d",
      "Simon Pierce, who has studied whale sharks globally, said he has photographed suspected mating scars on female sharks in St. Helena, probably from when male sharks bit their pectoral fins to hold onto them and get into mating position.",
      "Suspected whale shark mating behavior has also been reported in Australia and the sharks also gather in places like Mexico, the Arabian Sea and the Maldives, but that seems to amount to male harassment of immature females, explains Pierce, executive director and co-founder of the charity Marine Megafauna Foundation. That's not the case in St. Helena, where adult males and adult females are present.",
      "Fisheries experts in St. Helena have also provided eyewitness accounts of what they said were instances of whale sharks mating. Officials described a lot of thrashing at the water's surface by two enormous sharks touching belly to belly, but those sightings were not captured on video and are not considered sufficient proof by scientists.",
      "Cameron Perry, a research scientist at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, has been working with colleagues on the island to attach camera tags to investigate what the whale sharks are doing, but have run into some technical difficulties: the sharks dive deeper than 2,000 meters (6,561 feet) and the tags can\u2019t withstand the pressure.",
      "\u201cWe have some very tantalizing and teasing video,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWe have two sharks about to make contact, and then our camera falls off.\u201d",
      "Perry isn\u2019t sure what the sharks might be doing far below the surface, but hopes new technology being developed will help answer that question. \u201cIt\u2019s just a numbers game in terms of how often we can get in the water.\u201d",
      "Alistair Dove, who has previously conducted research in St. Helena, said he\u2019s seen male whale sharks soliciting contact from adult female sharks, including rotating their claspers, or sexual organs, in what he said was \u201cthe sharky equivalent of an erection.\u201d",
      "\"These sexual behaviors are very, very rare in whale sharks,\u201d said Dove, now CEO of the Museum of Science & History in Jacksonville, Florida.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the huge, unanswered questions about the biggest fish in the world,\u201d Dove said.",
      "Andrews, of the St. Helena Trust, said he was hopeful someone might be able to capture video evidence of whale shark mating, but acknowledged the researchers\u2019 presence and tagging efforts might inadvertently alter the sharks\u2019 mating practices.",
      "\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t want to be seen,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe, like everyone else, they need privacy.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "America\u2019s only rare earths mine has fielded calls from anxious companies since China responded to President Donald Trump's tariffs by limiting exports of seven heavy metals",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- America\u2019s only rare earths mine heard from anxious companies soon after China responded to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs this month by limiting exports of those minerals used for military applications and in many high-tech devices.",
      "\u201cBased on the number of phone calls we\u2019re receiving, the effects have been immediate,\u201d said Matt Sloustcher, a spokesperson for MP Materials, the company that runs the Mountain Pass mine in California's Mojave Desert.",
      "The trade war between the world's two biggest economies could lead to a critical shortage of rare earth elements if China maintains its export controls long-term or expands them to seek an advantage in any trade negotiations. The California mine can\u2019t meet all of the U.S. demand for rare earths, which is why Trump is trying to clear the way for new mines.",
      "Rare earth elements are important ingredients in electric vehicles, powerful magnets, advanced fighter jets, submarines, smartphones, television screens and many other products. Despite their name, the 17 elements aren't actually rare, but it's hard to find them in a high enough concentration to make a mine worth the investment.",
      "MP Materials, which acquired the idle Mountain Pass site in 2017, said Thursday it would stop sending its ore to China for processing because of the export restrictions and 125% tariffs on U.S. imports China imposed. The company said it would continue processing nearly half of what it mines on site and store the rest while it works to expand its processing capability.",
      "\u201cSelling our valuable critical minerals under 125% tariffs is neither commercially rational nor aligned with America's national interests,\u201d MP Materials said in a statement.",
      "Experts say the manufacturers that rely on rare earth elements and other critical minerals will see price increases, but there is likely enough of a global supply available to keep factories operating for now.",
      "The California mine yields neodymium and praseodymium, the light rare earths that are the main components of the permanent rare earth magnets in EVs and wind turbines. But small amounts of some of the heavy rare earths that China has restricted, such as terbium and dysprosium are key to helping the magnets withstand high temperatures.",
      "Already, the price of terbium has jumped 24% since the end of March to reach $933 per kilogram.",
      "\u201cOur estimate suggests that there is enough stockpile in the market to sustain demand for now,\u201d Benchmark Mineral Intelligence rare earths analyst Neha Mukherjee said, adding that shortages may emerge later this year.",
      "China has tremendous power over the rare earths market. The country has the biggest mines, producing 270,000 metric tons (297,624 tons) of minerals last year compared to the 45,000 tons (40,823 metric tons) mined in the U.S. China supplies nearly 90% of the world\u2019s rare earths because it also is home to most of the processing capacity.",
      "The restrictions Beijing put in place on April 4 require Chinese exporters of seven heavy rare earths and some magnets to obtain special licenses. The retaliatory controls reinforced what the Trump administration and manufacturers see as a dire need to build additional U.S. mines and reduce the nation's dependence on China.",
      "Trump has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to strong-arm Greenland and Ukraine into providing more of their rare earths and other critical materials to the United States. Last month, he signed an executive order calling for the federal government to streamline permit approvals for new mines and encourage investments in the projects.",
      "Two companies are trying to develop mines in Nebraska and Montana. Officials at NioCorp and U.S. Critical Minerals said they hoped the push from the White House would help them raise money and obtain the necessary approvals to start digging. NioCorp has worked for years to raise $1.1 billion to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.",
      "\u201cAs I sit and I think about how can we deal with this enormous leverage that China has over these minerals that nobody even knows how to pronounce for the most part, we have to deal with this leverage situation,\" NioCorp CEO Mark Smith said. \"And the best way, I think, is that we need to make our own heavy rare earths here in the United States. And we can do that.\"",
      "MP Materials is working to quickly expand its processing capability, partly with the help of some $45 million the company received coming out of the first Trump administration. But after investing nearly $1 billion since 2020, the company doesn't currently have the ability to process the heavy rare earths that China is restricting. MP Materials said it was working expeditiously to change that.",
      "Big U.S. automakers declined to comment about how dependent they are on rare earths and the impact of China's export curbs. Major defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which were specifically targeted in China's restrictions along with more than a dozen other defense and aerospace companies, also remained circumspect.",
      "Military technology is a smaller but important user of rare earths. Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday calling for an investigation into the national security implications of being so reliant on China for the elements.",
      "A spokesperson for Lockheed, which makes the F-22 fighter jet, said the company continuously assesses \u201cthe global rare earth supply chain to ensure access to critical materials that support our customers\u2019 missions.\u201d",
      "Some battery makers could start to run short of key elements within weeks, according to Steve Christensen, executive director of the Responsible Battery Coalition, an association representing battery and automakers and battery sellers.",
      "Already, manufacturers have seen the price of antimony, an element used to extend the life of traditional lead-acid batteries, more than double since China restricted exports of it last year. The element isn't one of the 17 rare earths but is among the critical minerals that Trump wants to see produced domestically.",
      "Initially, automakers will likely try to absorb any increase in the cost of their batteries without raising vehicle prices, but that may not be sustainable if China's restrictions remain in place, Christensen said. A 25% tariff Trump put on all imported automobiles and auto parts cars already was expected to increase costs, although the president hinted this week that he might give the industry a temporary reprieve.",
      "The U.S. fulfilled its rare earths needs with domestic sources until the late 1990s. Production largely ended after low-cost Chinese ores flooded global markets. Robots, drones and other new technologies have rapidly increased demand for the raw materials.",
      "NioCorp recently signed a contract to do more exploratory drilling on its site this summer to help prove to the Export-Import Bank that enough rare earth minerals rest underground near Elk Creek, Nebraska, to justify an $800 million loan to help finance the project.",
      "But a new rare earths mine is years away from operating in the U.S. NioCorp estimates if all goes well with its fundraising, the site where it hopes to mine and process niobium, scandium, titanium and an assortment of rare earths possibly might be running by the end of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "U.S. Critical Minerals plans to dig up several tons of ore in Montana this summer so it can test out processing methods it has been developing. The Sheep Creek project isn't as far along as the Nebraska project, but U.S. Critical Minerals Director Harvey Kaye said the site has promising ore deposits with high concentrations of rare earths.",

      "Independent scientists described the findings as interesting, but not nearly enough to show the existence of life on another planet.",
      "\u201cIt is the strongest sign to date of any possibility of biological activity outside the solar system,\" Cambridge astrophysicist Nikku Madhusudhan said during a livestream on Thursday.",
      "By analyzing data from NASA and the European Space Agency's Webb Space Telescope, the researchers found evidence of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in the atmosphere of the planet known as K2-18b. The planet is 124 light-years away; one light-year is equivalent to nearly 6 trillion miles.",
      "On Earth, those two compounds are produced primarily by microbial life, such as marine phytoplankton.",
      "The planet is more than double Earth\u2019s size and more than 8 times more massive. It's in the so-called habitable zone of its star. The study appeared in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "Madhusudhan stressed that further research is needed to rule out any errors or the possibility of other processes, besides living organisms, that could produce the compounds.",

      "\u201cMany of the turtle populations have come back, though some haven\u2019t,\u201d said Duke ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved with the research. \u201cOverall, the sea turtle story is one of the real conservation success stories.\"",
      "The study looked at 48 populations of sea turtles around the world. Scientists measured the impacts of threats such as hunting, pollution, coastal development and climate change to the marine animals. In more than half of the areas studied, threats are declining overall, the study found.",
      "But there are some exceptions. Sea turtle populations in the Atlantic Ocean are more likely to be recovering than those in Pacific waters. And leatherback turtles are not faring as well as other species.",
      "Globally, leatherbacks are considered vulnerable to extinction, but many groups are critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "All seven of the regions where leatherbacks are found face high environmental risks, said study co-author Bryan Wallace, a wildlife ecologist at Ecolibrium in Colorado.",
      "Leatherback turtles are famous for making the longest known marine migrations of any animal \u2013 with some individuals swimming as many as 3,700 miles (5,955 kilometers) each way. That feat moves them through a wide swath of regions and may expose them to unique risks, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, green turtles are still considered endangered globally, but their populations show signs of recovery in many regions of the world, researchers found.",
      "\u201cBy ending commercial harvests and allowing them time to rebound, their populations are now doing really well\u201d in coastal waters off many regions of Mexico and the U.S., said co-author Michelle Mar\u00eda Early Capistr\u00e1n, a Stanford University researcher who has conducted fieldwork in both countries.",
      "Sea turtles were protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973, and Mexico banned all captures of sea turtles in 1990. But it took a few decades for the results of these actions \u2013 alongside efforts to protect nesting beaches and reduce accidental bycatch in fishing \u2013 to show up in population trends, she said.",
      "Around the world, the problem of sea turtles dying after accidentally becoming entangled in fishing gear remains a major threat, said Wallace. New technologies are being developed to spare turtles, but they must be accepted and used regularly by diverse fishing communities to be effective, he added.",

      "HAVANA -- For Sonia P\u00e9rez, stepping into Havana\u2019s Do\u00f1a Alicia restaurant felt like entering a movie. Even as Cuba struggles with power outages and technological scarcity, this eatery has leaped into the 21st century with digital menus, Alexa-enabled assistance, touchless bathrooms and even a food-delivering robot.",
      "\u201cI thought I was in a cartoon movie!\u201d said the 64-year-old government employee, marvelling at the contrast with the technological realities outside. \u201cI wish there were more of these in Cuba... We are really very behind in technology.\u201d",
      "While commonplace globally, such automation is a complex feat in Cuba due to the island\u2019s frequent power cuts and a lack of modern technology.",
      "Opened seven years ago, the restaurant gradually embraced technology, starting with tablets at tables, followed by Alexa services and culminating in the arrival of Do\u00f1a Alicia \u2014 a food-delivering robot named after the owner\u2019s grandmother \u2014 who now assists human waiters in the dining room.",
      "Guests are greeted with digital menus on screens at their tables, allowing them to browse and order traditional Cuban dishes such as savory pork steak, pasta and sweet desserts. The bar further enhances the experience offering drinks such as mojitos or freshly made daiquiris. Human servers are on hand for those less tech-savvy.",
      "The prices align with those of other private restaurants, making them unaffordable for the average Cuban and reflecting the island's inflation.",
      "Despite the challenges of limited and often unreliable internet access in Cuba (mobile internet only became widespread in 2018, and outages are frequent due to the energy crisis), Do\u00f1a Alicia appears to be navigating these obstacles.",
      "Manager Yadiel Hern\u00e1ndez believes the technological advancements help attract customers by creating a unique and appealing dining experience in Havana.",

      "In all, some 42 million borrowers owe more than $1.6 trillion in student debt, according to the DOE.",
      "If the borrowers currently in late-stage delinquency were to default on their own loans, it would bring the share of borrowers in default to nearly 25%.",
      "The resumption of collections on defaulted student loans lifts a pause initiated in 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Within weeks, millions of borrowers will need to begin repayment.",
      "\u201cThe scale is quite large,\u201d Michael Jones, an economist at the University of Cincinnati, told ABC News. \u201cEvery dollar that goes to pay the loans is a dollar that won\u2019t be circulated into the economy.\u201d",
      "Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of U.S. economic activity. Potential downward pressure from student loan repayments comes as surveys show sour consumer sentiment in the face of potentially rising inflation and slowing growth.",
      "The debt collections could also damage the credit score of many borrowers, since scoring systems are typically alerted when collections ensue, experts said. In such cases, they added, borrowers will face greater difficulty making big-ticket purchases like homes and cars for which they will need to take out a loan.",
      "\u201cThose individuals will not qualify for the auto loan they otherwise would\u2019ve been able to purchase,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThat can cause a drop in vehicles being sold.\u201d",
      "Brent Evans, professor of public policy and higher education at Vanderbilt University, acknowledged a heightened level of economic uncertainty but cautioned against alarm over the added risk posed by the student loan collections.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty in the economy is near an all-time high,\u201d Evans said. \u201cThat\u2019s a broad concern and therefore it\u2019s very difficult to predict the impact of any one of these levers.\u201d",
      "Since the federal government will only claw back defaulted debt from wages or programs such as Social Security, the policy will not impact all defaulted borrowers, Evans noted.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that it means less money in people\u2019s pockets, but it might not be that much money for these borrowers,\u201d Evans said.",
      "Student-loan collection will be paid to the U.S. Treasury, adding to government revenue and potentially easing a fraction of the nation\u2019s $36 trillion debt.",
      "\u201cAmerican taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,\u201d U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement on Monday. \u201cThe Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear.\u201d",
      "While the policy may reduce income for some borrowers, it clarifies the path forward for loan payments after years of uncertainty surrounding the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to forgive loans, Jones said.",
      "\u201cIt is short-term pain but it actually brings certainty,\u201d Jones added. \u201cIt gives clarity for decisions these borrowers need to make about their future.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen the economy was booming a few years ago, these payments could\u2019ve been reintroduced then,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate timing now when the economy is looking at a potential recession. But it\u2019s probably time to rip the Band-Aid off.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The prosecutors said they would not express regret to get their jobs back.",
      "Three federal prosecutors who worked on the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams resigned Tuesday -- while they were on administrative leave -- instead of agreeing to \"preconditions\" on them returning to the office, sending a sharp letter to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and accusing him of pressuring them to falsely \"express regret and admit some wrongdoing\" in the case.",
      "\"The Department placed each of us on administrative leave ostensibly to review our, and the Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s, handling of the Adams case,\" the trio of prosecutors assigned to Adams' case, Celia V. Cohen, Andrew Rohrbach and Derek Wikstrom, wrote to Blanche. \"It is now clear that one of the preconditions you have placed on our returning to the Office is that we must express regret and admit some wrongdoing by the Office in connection with the refusal to move to dismiss the case. We will not confess wrongdoing when there was none.\"",
      "The three lawyers were part of a group in the Justice Department who refused to sign off on the dismissal of the bribery case against Adams in February. They were placed on administrative leave last month as an investigation played out.",
      "\"We have served under Presidents of both parties, advancing their priorities while pursuing justice without fear or favor,\" the three prosecutors wrote. \"The role of a career prosecutor is not to set policy. But a prosecutor must abide by the oath to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States and the rules of professional ethics set by the bar and the courts.\"",
      "They later added, \"Now, the Department has decided that obedience supersedes all else, requiring us to abdicate our legal and ethical obligations in favor of directions from Washington. That is wrong.\"",
      "The fallout from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove's request that the Southern District of New York dismiss charges without prejudice began in mid-February. Danielle Sassoon, then-acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, resigned from her position Feb. 13 after suggesting DOJ leadership, including Bove, were explicitly aware of a quid pro quo suggested by Adams' attorneys, saying Adams' vocal support of President Donald Trump's immigration policies would be boosted by dismissing the indictment against him.",
      "\"Rather than be rewarded, Adams's advocacy should be called out for what it is: an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of his case,\" Sassoon wrote at the time. \"Although Mr. Bove disclaimed any intention to exchange leniency in this case for Adams's assistance in enforcing federal law, that is the nature of the bargain laid bare in Mr. Bove's memo.\"",
      "Five other DOJ officials would join Sassoon in resigning from the office in protest, while at least six top Department of Justice officials refused to sign onto the case's dismissal, sources told ABC News last month.",
      "Adams was indicted last year in the Southern District of New York on five counts in an alleged long-standing conspiracy connected to improper benefits, illegal campaign contributions and an attempted cover-up. He had pleaded not guilty.",
      "The dismissal paperwork was later signed by an attorney in the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, leaving the decision to dismiss the case to a federal judge in New York.",
      "On April 2, Judge Dale Ho officially dismissed the case, however, he did so with prejudice, meaning the charges cannot be revived. The DOJ had asked for the charges to be dismissed without prejudice and said they could be brought against Adams again following the November mayoral election.",
      "But three weeks later, the fallout continued with Tuesday's letter.",
      "The three prosecutors ended their letter to Blanche: \"Serving in the Southern District of New York has been an honor. There is no greater privilege than to work for an institution whose mandate is to do the right thing, the right way, for the right reasons. We will not abandon this principle to keep our jobs. We resign.\"",

      "The agencies aim to remove the dyes by the end of next year.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration announced on Tuesday a series of measures to phase out eight artificial food dyes and colorings from America's food supply by the end of next year.",
      "Speaking at a news conference, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the agencies will work with food companies to remove dyes from products.",
      "\"I just want to urge all of you, it's not the time to stop; it's the time to redouble your efforts, because we have them on the run now, and we are going to win this battle,\" Kennedy told a crowd of \"Make America Healthy Again\" supporters during the news conference. \"And four years from now, we're going to have most of these products off the market, or you will know about them when you go to the grocery store.\"",
      "At the news conference, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said the agencies are looking to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and to work with the food industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic dyes used in cereal, ice cream, snacks, yogurts and more.",
      "\"Today, the FDA is taking action to remove petroleum-based food dyes from the U.S. food supply and from medications. For the last 50 years, American children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals,\" he told reporters.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration in January started the process to ban one artificial dye, Red No. 3, which will need to be removed from food by January 2027 and from medications by 2028 because it was shown to cause cancer in rats. The FDA said Tuesday it is requesting food companies to speed up the removal of Red. No. 3.",
      "Federal officials are taking steps to pull the authorization for two rarely used synthetic food colorings -- Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B -- within the coming months. In addition, the six other petroleum-based dyes that federal health agencies are seeking to eliminate by the end of next year are Green No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1 and Blue No. 2.",
      "The FDA is also taking steps to authorize four new natural color additives, officials announced Tuesday.",
      "Kennedy: 'We have an understanding' with food companies",
      "The plan, however, is contingent on an \"understanding\" with major food companies that they will voluntarily remove them to meet consumer demand, Kennedy said Tuesday.",
      "HHS and FDA are calling on the food industry to \"establish a national standard and timeline ... to transition from petrochemical-based dyes to natural alternatives,\" according to a press release sent out Tuesday afternoon.",
      "It is not yet clear what enforcement mechanism Kennedy will seek to implement the new changes.",
      "When asked if food companies, which were not present at the news conference, would follow the suggested changes, Kennedy said: \"We don't have an agreement; we have an understanding.\"",
      "Makary, the head of the FDA, went on to say that the agency plans to work with the food industry instead of having Congress step in. \"We've had wonderful meetings with the food industry,\" he said. \"They are eager to do it.\"",
      "Speaking with ABC News after the announcement, Makary maintained the administration would meet its \"bold goal\" despite no immediate plans for new regulations to force the move.",
      "\"There's no need to have a regulation or a statute when companies are volunteering to do it,\" Makary said. \"We are going to use every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done to the best of our abilities.\"",
      "But the International Association of Color Manufacturers, the trade association for the color additives industry, which includes both natural and synthetic dyes, issued a statement after the news conference questioning the proposed timeline.",
      "\"Requiring reformulation by the end of 2026 ignores scientific evidence and underestimates the complexity of food production. This process is neither simple nor immediate, and the resulting supply disruptions will limit access to familiar, affordable grocery items,\" the group said in the statement.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, however, which represents makers of packaged foods and beverages, indicated its members would work with the administration to take action on food dye priorities, citing the difficulty in adhering to a \"patchwork\" of differing state laws.",
      "\"Consumer Brands has long asked HHS and FDA to reestablish themselves as the country's leading regulatory authority and we appreciate that the administration has reasserted their leadership in response to the myriad of state activity in the food regulation space,\" said CBA President Melissa Hockstad in a statement following Tuesday's announcement.",
      "Memo reveals food companies willing to voluntarily remove dyes",
      "The proposed timeline to phase out synthetic dyes laid out Tuesday comes after Kennedy told food industry leaders at a meeting last month that he wanted their companies to remove artificial dyes from their products by the end of his four-year term, according to a memo describing the meeting, which was obtained by ABC News.",
      "Days after that meeting, which included executives from PepsiCo and General Mills, the Consumer Brands Association indicated its members would be willing to voluntarily make the changes sought by Kennedy, according to a March 20 memo sent to HHS officials obtained by ABC News.",
      "The two-page proposal lays out commitments the food companies were willing to make \u2014 including efforts within 30 days to start reformulating foods to remove artificial dyes.",
      "The memo did not contain an explicit commitment to remove all artificial dyes by the end of 2026, as Kennedy called for on Tuesday, but the proposal said CBA members were committed to \"supporting agency actions.\"",
      "The proposal also outlined a commitment for companies to supply food for school lunches that does not include artificial dyes or coloring.",
      "In return for working to remove dyes from food, the trade group asked the Trump administration to work against state legislation that has created a patchwork of laws around food dyes \u2014 which could lead to more restrictive bans on other chemicals -- not just food dyes -- in certain states.",
      "\"President Trump and Secretary Kennedy need to communicate with governors and state legislatures that the administration is taking bold, transformative actions and continued activity at the state level stands to undermine the President's leadership and to increase costs to consumers,\" the trade group wrote in the memo. \"A federal solution is meaningless under a state patchwork regime.\"",
      "Already, red and blue states alike have taken matters into their own hands in removing artificial food dyes from certain foods. Both West Virginia and California have passed laws to ban a handful of food dyes from school lunches, with plans to extend the ban to a broader, statewide level too.",
      "In West Virginia, the ban on artificial dyes in school lunch will go into effect in August, making it the first state in the country to implement such restraints. In California, it will take effect in 2028.",
      "Twenty-six other states, from Iowa to Washington and from to Texas to Vermont, are considering similar legislation around banning food dyes or other chemical additives in foods, according to a list compiled by the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that focuses on chemicals and toxins.",
      "What are the health risks?",
      "From candy to breakfast cereal to medication, synthetic food dyes are in a wide range of products that Americans consume. Studies suggest their vibrant color makes food more appealing and could even increase appetite.",
      "Makary claimed studies have found a link between petroleum-based synthetic dyes and health conditions, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obesity, diabetes, cancer and gastrointestinal issues.",
      "\"Why are we taking a gamble?\" he said. \"While America's children are sick and suffering, 41% of children have at least one health condition, and one in five are on medication. The answer is not more Ozempic, more ADHD medication and more antidepressants. There's a role for those medications, but we have to look at underlying root causes.\"",
      "But scientists caution the evidence for health risks are not that clear.",
      "\"There are animal studies that show that food dyes have been associated to outcomes such as cancer,\" said ABC New Medical Correspondent Dr. Darien Sutton. \"But the FDA maintains that these studies have not shown sufficient evidence that that harm could be effected in humans.\"",
      "All dyes have the potential to spark allergic reactions for a small minority. Several dyes have been linked to hyperactivity and behavioral problems in children or have been shown to cause cancer in mice or rats -- but none have shown to cause cancer in humans.",
      "\"When you look at the overall evidence it is difficult to see a clear cause and effect, but if there's no clear benefit when adding something like a food additive other than making food look better, then many argue let's just simply take it out,\" Sutton said.",
      "While the health effects of the dyes are not fully understood, many other countries have either banned the additives outright or required food packaging warning labels about the health risks.",

      "In an interview with independent journalist Tara Palmeri released on Monday, Loomer mocked the idea that the White House is \u201cone big happy family.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe advisers don\u2019t get along with each other,\u201d she said. \u201cThe heads of agencies don\u2019t get along with each other.\u201d",
      "Much of the tension is connected to Trump's determination to use tariffs to rebalance the global economy, with officials often contradicting each other and occasionally turning to insults. Trump adviser Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur whose companies could suffer from higher costs brought on by import taxes, sharply criticized Peter Navarro, Trump's top counselor on trade, as \u201cdumber than a sack of bricks.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed the idea of growing dissension within the administration, saying there are \u201cfar more examples of the president's team working together enthusiastically and collaboratively to advance the administration's goals.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe numbers and results of this administration speak for themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThe president and his team are getting work done.\u201d",
      "Trump has always had a high tolerance for chaos, shunning traditional policy deliberations to entertain divergent opinions and viewing unpredictability as a negotiating tool. He\u2019s spent years fostering a competitive atmosphere among his staff members, who are often chosen for their devotion and penchant for aggression.",
      "But now the increasing strife underscores the risks for more turmoil in the months ahead, as Trump presses forward with a dramatic overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, international trade, foreign policy and more.",
      "John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Trump\u2019s first term before writing a tell-all book critical of the president\u2019s inner circle, said the drama reflects the lack of a consistent ideology and the inexperience of many administration officials.",
      "\u201cThe only thing they have in common is the belief that they should show personal fealty to Trump,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cThat got them the job. That may in fact keep them in the job. But it shows how fundamentally unserious they are.\u201d",
      "The situation is a test for Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, who helped run Trump's presidential campaign last year. She earned a reputation for imposing an unusual level of order on Trump's chaotic orbit \u2014 though she carefully avoided trying to control Trump or his impulses \u2014 and he praised her as \u201cthe ice maiden.\u201d",
      "During Trump's first term, he had four chiefs of staff \u2014 one of them serving in an acting capacity for more than a year. The second, former U.S. Marine Gen. John Kelly, became a sharp critic of the president after he left the job, describing him as a fascist during the 2024 election.",
      "With his new administration, Trump has surrounded himself with loyalists, and he's been reluctant to throw anyone overboard in response to negative coverage from the mainstream media, which he considers to be an enemy. Allies say the hesitance to make personnel changes in this term is meant to deny giving a win to critics, even if it means leaving troubled officials in place.",
      "On Monday, the president brushed off reports that Hegseth participated in a second group chat to talk about pending airstrikes in Yemen last month. The first chat, which used the encrypted messaging application Signal, involved top administration officials as well as the editor of The Atlantic, who was accidentally included in the discussion.",
      "The second, first reported by The New York Times on Sunday, included Hegseth's wife, who does not have a government job, and his brother and his personal lawyer, both of whom work at the Pentagon.",
      "\u201cSame old stuff,\u201d Trump said when reporters questioned him about it during the White House Easter egg roll. He said Hegseth is \u201cdoing a great job\u201d and \"it\u2019s just fake news.\u201d",
      "Leavitt, in an appearance on Fox News Channel, defended Hegseth with a swipe at the people who work for him.",
      "\u201cThis is what happens when the entire Pentagon is working against you and against the monumental change that you are trying to implement,\" she said. Leavitt's comment was shared by an official Defense Department social media account.",
      "However, some of those speaking out were among Hegseth\u2019s top advisers.",
      "John Ullyot, who served as a Pentagon spokesperson until he was asked to resign, wrote in Politico that \u201cit\u2019s hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role for much longer.\u201d He added that \u201cthe president deserves better\u201d and \u201cmany in the secretary\u2019s own inner circle will applaud quietly\u201d if Hegseth is fired.",
      "The disorder extends through the Pentagon's senior ranks. Three officials \u2014 Dan Caldwell, Colin Carroll and Darin Selnick \u2014 were recently pushed out, and they issued a statement saying people \u201chave slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door.\u201d",
      "Hegseth did not deny the reports about his use of Signal. But he added: \u201cWhat a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff plans have also been a source of stress inside the administration, often leading to mixed messages and policy confusion. Navarro insisted there weren't going to be any negotiations, contradicting Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's insistence that import taxes were about strengthening the White House's negotiating position.",
      "The president partially retreated from his plans, but not before Navarro and Musk began openly feuding. Navarro said Musk was \u201cprotecting his own interests\u201d by opposing tariffs, and he described Musk's electric automaker Tesla as a \u201ccar assembler\u201d that\u2019s dependent on importing parts from overseas.",
      "Musk, who advises Trump on ways to downsize the federal bureaucracy, responded by saying that Navarro was \u201ctruly a moron.\u201d",
      "Leavitt downplayed the dispute by saying \u201cboys will be boys.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will let their public sparring continue,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cAnd you guys should all be very grateful that we have the most transparent administration in history.\u201d",
      "Trump often appears more interested in fealty than veracity. During part of last year's campaign, he traveled with Loomer, who has a history of making racist attacks on Trump's opponents and once claimed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were an inside job.",
      "After Trump won, Loomer became frustrated that she wasn't allowed to help vet administration personnel. She eventually secured an Oval Office meeting with the president, bringing research on national security officials whom she believed were disloyal.",
      "After Trump fired some of them, Loomer has continued her work. Last week, she accused Bessent of inviting a \u201cTrump hater\u201d to work with him on financial literacy efforts.",
      "\u201cI am going to personally tell President Trump and personally show him these receipts,\u201d Loomer wrote on social media, adding \u201cshame on\u201d Bessent.",
      "Musk shared her post and chimed in with his support \u2014 \u201ctroubling,\" he wrote.",

    "summary": "Some 5 million Americans with defaulted student loan payments will have their loans sent for collections on May 5, the Department of Education announced on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "The deadline comes as scores of student aid employees have been terminated.",
      "Some 5 million Americans with defaulted student loan payments will have their loans sent for collections on May 5, the Department of Education announced on Monday.",
      "Next month, for the first time since student loan payments were paused due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Education Department will collect the debts from borrowers who had defaulted -- which means they hadn\u2019t paid their debts for around nine months or 270 days -- before the pandemic.",
      "The announcement comes as scores of Federal Student Aid (FSA) employees have been terminated at the Department of Education as part of President Donald Trump's efforts to shutter the agency, which creates uncertainty for borrowers and the future of the student loan system, according to former Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal.",
      "\u201cThe concern is that the department is, you know, cutting the people who would help borrowers make this transition,\u201d Kvaal told ABC News. \u201cBorrowers who are trying to get help by getting into an affordable repayment plan or by applying for loan forgiveness, if they're eligible, you know, just don't have the same resources that they did before the department staff was cut in half.\u201d",
      "The pause -- started in 2020 in Trump's first administration -- for all 43 million student loan borrowers was implemented due to the economic hardship and disruption caused by COVID. This will be the first time in five years the repayments have begun.",
      "Kvaal said defaults can be \u201ctragic\u201d for borrowers. In some cases, Kvaal said, defaults can negatively impact credit scores and future student aid, and several states revoke driver\u2019s licenses over defaults.",
      "However, the department emphasized that its effort will protect taxpayers from shouldering the cost of federal student loans that borrowers \"willingly\" undertook. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon also said taxpayers will no longer be responsible for the \u201cirresponsible student loan policies\u201d of the previous administration.",
      "\u201cThe Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear,\u201d McMahon wrote in a department release. \u201cHundreds of billions have already been transferred to taxpayers. Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment -- both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation\u2019s economic outlook.\u201d",
      "A defaulted loan is a loan that a borrower hasn't made payments on for 270 days, according to the office of federal student aid. When the loan officially enters default, it becomes eligible for mandatory collections.",
      "The collections on loans are typically done through wage garnishments, a legal procedure in which a person's earnings are required by court order to be withheld by an employer for the payment of a debt, according to the Department of Labor.",
      "Student debt can also be collected through offsetting tax refunds or other federal benefits, which Kvaal said can include one\u2019s Social Security. The collections process starting in just two weeks is blocking these borrowers' path out of default, according to Student Borrower Protection Center Executive Director Mike Pierce. Pierce said the Trump administration is feeding them into the \u201cmaw of the government debt collection machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is cruel, unnecessary and will further fan the flames of economic chaos for working families across this country,\" Pierce told ABC News in a statement.",
      "But the administration's efforts to place borrowers into involuntary collections programs will be paired with a comprehensive communications and outreach campaign to ensure borrowers understand how to return to repayment or get out of default, according to the department release.",
      "The news also comes as the administration is working to rehome the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio to other agencies. Trump announced the loan system would be moved to the Small Business Administration \u201cimmediately\u201d during a White House event last month.",
      "After the announcement, Kvaal, who worked in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, told ABC News his higher education portfolio under Obama included moving some loan functions to the Department of Treasury. But he warned shifting the student loan portfolio again could lead to real world consequences.",
      "\u201cWe're at a point now where millions of borrowers are late on their student loans,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the department to be focused on laying off half its staff and going through a fundamental reorganization of how it administers these programs, you know, in really critical weeks for borrowers who are trying to get into repayment plans or get loan forgiveness, I think it's very dangerous and puts at risk millions of borrowers of going into default on their loans.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "On Fox News, he vigorously denied sharing classified airstrike details.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday strongly denied that what he shared over a second group chat on the Signal messaging app were classified war plans about imminent U.S. airstrikes targeting Houthi militants in Yemen, and blamed former staffers for leaking, accusing them of going to the news media with new information to \"sabotage\" Trump's agenda.",
      "Hegseth and other administration officials have insisted that the information about those airstrikes that was shared earlier with another Signal group established by national security adviser Mike Waltz was not classified.",
      "On Tuesday, Hegseth continued to make that case as questions have been raised about how he shared similar information with a smaller Signal group that sources told ABC News included his wife, brother, and personal attorney.",
      "\"I look at war plans every single day. What was shared over Signal then and now, however you characterize it, was informal unclassified coordination for media coordination other things. That's what I've said from the beginning,\" Hegseth said in a live interview from the Pentagon on \"Fox & Friends.\"",
      "Sources familiar with the chat had earlier told ABC News that Hegseth had established the Signal group with family and friends during his Senate confirmation process. Hegseth was not asked in the interview why he had shared the information with that group of close personal advisers that included his wife, who is not a U.S. government employee.",
      "U.S. officials confirmed to ABC News that the Information about the strikes in Yemen that Hegseth put in both Signal groups came from Gen. Erik Kurilla, the commander of U.S. Central Command, who used a secure U.S. government system to convey the information. NBC News was first to report that the airstrike information came from CENTCOM's Gen. Kurilla.",
      "In his interview with Fox News, the defense secretary also criticized former close advisers fired last week as part of what he said was leak investigation that followed news reports about military plans for the Panama Canal, Elon Musk's planned visit to the Pentagon and other developments.",
      "\"It led to some unfortunate places, people I have known for quite some time, but it's not my job to protect them,\" said Hegseth. \"It's my job to protect national security the president of the United States and let the investigation go where it is. So, when that evidence is gathered sufficiently, and this has all happened very quickly, it will be handed over to DOJ, and those people will be prosecuted if necessary.\"",
      "The former staffers include Dan Caldwell, a longtime close adviser to Hegseth, Darin Selnick, who was the Pentagon's deputy chief of staff, and Colin Carroll, who served as chief of staff for the deputy secretary of defense and on Tuesday Hegseth claimed, without evidence, that they were responsible for news leaks intended to \"sabotage\" the Trump administration's agenda for the Pentagon.",
      "\"Those folks who are leaking, who have been pushed out of the building, are now attempting to leak and sabotage the president's agenda and what we're doing, and that's unfortunate,\" said Hegseth.",
      "\"So, once a leaker, always a leaker, often a leaker, and so we look for leakers, because we take it very seriously, and we will do the investigation,\" said Hegseth.",
      "At the same time, Hegseth left open the possibility that the ongoing investigation might exonerate the very people he was accusing.",
      "\"If those people are exonerated, fantastic,\" said Hegseth. \"We don't think, based on what we understand, that it's going to be a good day for a number of those individuals because of what was found in the investigation.\"",
      "On Monday, in a video interview with Tucker Carlson, Caldwell vigorously denied that he had leaked information and said he and the other two officials did not know why they had been fired.",
      "\"At this time, we still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of 'leaks' to begin with,\" they said in a joint statement on X on April 19.",
      "Also on Monday, Hegseth blamed \"anonymous smears\" and President Donald Trump dismissed any concerns, said he has \"great confidence\" in Hegseth..",
      "\"Here we go again. Just a waste of time. He is doing a great job,\" Trump said of Hegseth.",
      "The recent disclosures of the new Signal group and the dismissal of top advisers have raised questions about Hegseth's judgment among a large number of congressional Democrats who have called for Hegseth to step down from his post.",
      "On Monday, Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, and a former Air Force general, became the first Republican to suggest that Hegseth should be removed as defense secretary.",
      "\"If it's true that he had another chat with his family, about the missions against the Houthis, it's totally unacceptable,\" he told Politico.",
      "\"It looks like there's a meltdown going on,\" Bacon said. \"There's a lot -- a lot -- of smoke coming out of the Pentagon, and I got to believe there's some fire there somewhere.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Hegseth claimed that critics of his Pentagon agenda have \"come after me from day one\" but said his focus would remain on carrying out his goals at the Pentagon.",
      "\"I'm here because President Trump asked me to bring warfighting back to the Pentagon every single day,\" said Hegseth.",
      "\"That is our focus, and if people don't like it, they can come after me. No worries. I'm standing right here,\" Hegseth said. \"The warfighters are behind us. Our enemies know they're on notice. Our allies know we're behind them, and that in this dangerous world for the American people is what it's all about.\"",
      "\"No, I haven't blinked, and I won't blink because this job is too big and too important for the American people,\" he said.",

      "VENICE, Italy -- Venice is charging day-trippers to the famed canal city an arrivals tax for the second year starting Friday, a measure to combat the overtourism that officials say is putting the city's UNESCO World Cultural Heritage status at risk.",
      "A UNESCO body decided against putting Venice on its list of cultural heritage sites deemed in danger after the tax was announced. But opponents of the day-tripper fee say it has done nothing to discourage visits.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at Venice\u2019s battle with overtourism by the numbers:",
      "The tax charged to visitors who are not overnighting in Venice to enter its historic center during the second year of the day-tripper tax. Visitors who download a QR code at least three days in advance will pay 5 euros \u2014 the same amount charged last year throughout the pilot program. But those who make last-minute plans will pay double. The QR code is required from 8:30 a.m. until 4 p.m. and is checked at entry points to the city, including the Santa Lucia train station, the Piazzale Roma bus depot and near St. Mark\u2019s Square.",
      "The number of days this year that day visitors to Venice will be charged a fee to enter the historic center. They include mostly weekends and holidays from April 18 to July 27. That is up from 29 last year. The new calendar covers entire weeks over key holidays and extends the weekend period to include Fridays.",
      "The amount in euros that the city of Venice took in during a 2024 pilot program for the tax. The city's top budget official, Michele Zuin, said last year the running costs for the new system ran to 2.7 million euros, overshooting the total fees collected. This year, Zuin projects a surplus of about 1 million euros to 1.5 million euros, which will be used to offset the cost of trash collection and other services for residents.",
      "The number of day-trippers who paid the tax in 2024. Officials say 8,000 day-trippers paid in advance to enter the city on Friday, among the 77,000 who have already registered so far to enter the city this year. Another 117,000 have registered for exemptions, which apply to anyone born in Venice, those paying property taxes in the city, studying or working in the historic center, or living in the wider Veneto region, among others.",
      "The average number of daily visitors on the first 11 days of 2024 that Venice charged day-trippers. That's about 10,000 people more than the number of tourists recorded on each of the three important holidays during the previous year. City council member Giovanni Andrea Martini, an opponent of the measure, said the figures show the project has not deterred visitors.",
      "The number of official residents in Venice\u2019s historic center composed of over 100 islands connected by footbridges and traversed by its famed canals. The population peaked at 174,000 in 1951, when Venice was home to thriving industries. The number shrank during Italy's postwar economic boom as residents moved to the mainland for more modern housing \u2014 including indoor plumbing which was lacking in Venice. It has been shrinking dramatically over recent decades as local industry lost traction, families sought mainland conveniences and housing prices rose. Activists also blame the \u201cmono-culture\u201d of tourism, which they say has emptied the city of basic services like shops for everyday goods and medical care.",
      "The number of beds for tourists in Venice\u2019s historic center, including 12,627 in the less regulated short-term rental market, according to April data from the Ocio housing activist group. The number of tourist beds surpassed the number of permanent residents in 2023, according to Ocio's monitor. Anyone staying in a hotel within the city limits, including on the mainland districts of Mestre and Marghera, pays a lodging tax and is therefore exempt from the day-tripper tax.",

      "An Indian company that spreads crushed rock on farmers' fields to help draw climate-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere has been awarded a $50 million grand prize in a global competition funded by Elon Musk's foundation.",
      "Mati Carbon was among more than 1,300 teams from 88 countries that participated in the four-year XPRIZE Carbon Removal competition, launched in 2021 to encourage deployment of carbon-removal technologies. Many scientists believe removing carbon is crucial in the fight against global warming, caused by the burning of fossil fuels like gasoline, coal and oil, which release carbon dioxide.",
      "\u201cIt's important that we not promote carbon dioxide removal as a replacement for emissions reduction,\u201d said Michael Leitch, the technical lead for the competition. \u201cBut the race is really on both to dramatically reduce our existing emissions (and) also ... deploy carbon dioxide removal solutions at very, very large scales globally.\u201d",
      "The prize is being awarded at a time when Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency are making steep cuts to federal funding and staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Weather Service and other science-based agencies that carry out important climate research. The Trump administration has also moved to roll back myriad environmental regulations, including some that regulate carbon emissions.",
      "While the Musk Foundation sponsored XPRIZE Carbon Removal, which distributed a total of $100 million, it is not formally affiliated with the California-based organization, XPRIZE officials said.",
      "XPRIZE runs other contests to try to solve societal challenges. Executive director Nikki Batchelor said the organization is considering more climate-related competitions addressing such issues as removal of the potent greenhouse gas methane, reforestation and climate adaptation and resilience.",
      "Mati Carbon CEO Shantanu Agarwal believes his company's relatively low-cost approach \u201chas a potential to really solve some planetary scale problems\u201d while helping small farmers who often bear the brunt of climate change, as extreme weather events like drought and floods destroy crops.",
      "The method, called enhanced rock weathering, is fairly straightforward, said Jake Jordan, the company's chief science officer: When it rains, water and carbon dioxide mix in the atmosphere, forming carbonic acid, which falls on rock and eventually breaks it down into small bits of silica.

      "Mati Carbon spreads already-crushed basalt rock \u2014 plentiful in many parts of the world \u2014 on the fields \u201cto speed up something that happens anyway,\u201d Jordan said. The crushed rock also releases nutrients that help regenerate soils and increase productivity.",
      "Smaller prizes were awarded in the competition\u2019s final year to several other teams that also successfully removed 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide, a threshold that demonstrates an ability to scale up to remove gigatons in the coming decades.",
      "That included $15 million to runner-up NetZero, which turns crop residues such as coffee husks into biochar, charcoal-like particles that can be used on fields to help store carbon in soils while also improving nutrient and water retention.",

      "Scientists have been exploring the gamut of so-called geoengineering solutions to climate change, from drying the upper atmosphere to pumping minerals into the ocean to absorb carbon.",

      "The Trump administration is quietly revoking the temporary legal status of people who entered the country via an online appointment app at U.S. border crossings with Mexico",
      "McALLEN, Texas -- Hubert Montoya burst out laughing when the U.S. Department of Homeland Security emailed to say he should leave the country immediately or risk consequences of being deported. He is a U.S. citizen.",
      "\u201cI just thought it was absurd,\u201d the Austin, Texas, immigration attorney said.",
      "It was an apparent glitch in the Trump administration's dismantling of another Biden-era policy that allowed people to live and work in the country temporarily. U.S. Customs and Border Protection is quietly revoking two-year permits of people who used an online appointment app at U.S. border crossings with Mexico called CBP One, which brought in more than 900,000 people starting in January 2023.",
      "The revocation of CBP One permits has lacked the fanfare and formality of canceling Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands whose homelands were previously deemed unsafe for return and humanitarian parole for others from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who came with financial sponsors. Those moves came with official notices in the Federal Register and press releases. Judges halted them from taking effect after advocacy groups sued.",
      "CBP One cancellation notices began landing in inboxes in late March without warning, some telling recipients to leave immediately and others giving them seven days. Targets included U.S. citizens.",
      "Timothy J. Brenner, a Connecticut-born lawyer in Houston, was told April 11 to leave the U.S. \u201cI became concerned that the administration has a list of immigration attorneys or a database that they\u2019re trying to target to harass,\u201d he said.",
      "CBP confirmed in a statement that it issued notices terminating temporary legal status under CBP One. It did not say how many, just that they weren't sent to all beneficiaries, which totaled 936,000 at the end of December.",
      "CBP said notices may have been sent to unintended recipients, including attorneys, if beneficiaries provided contact information for U.S. citizens. It is addressing those situations case-by-case.",
      "Online chat groups reflect fear and confusion, which, according to critics, is the administration's intended effect. Brenner said three clients who received the notices chose to return to El Salvador after being told to leave.",
      "\u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t know how many people got this notice is part of the problem. We\u2019re getting reports from attorneys and folks who don\u2019t know what to make of the notice,\u201d said Hillary Li, counsel for the Justice Action Center, an advocacy group.",
      "President Donald Trump suspended CBP One for new arrivals his first day in office but those already in the U.S. believed they could stay at least until their two-year permits expired. The cancellation notices that some received ended that sense of temporary stability. \u201cIt is time for you to leave the United States,\u201d the letters began.",
      "\u201cIt's really confusing,\u201d said Robyn Barnard, senior director for refugee advocacy at Human Rights First. \u201cImagine how people who entered through that process feel when they're hearing through their different community chats, rumors or screenshots that some friends have received notice and others didn't.\u201d",
      "Attorneys say some CBP One beneficiaries may still be within a one-year window to file an asylum claim or seek other relief.",
      "Notices have been sent to others whose removal orders are on hold under other forms of temporary protection. A federal judge in Massachusetts temporarily halted deportations for more than 500,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who came since late 2022 after applying online with a financial sponsor and flying to a U.S. airport at their own expense.",
      "Maria, a 48-year-old Nicaraguan woman who cheered Trump's election and arrived via that path, said the notice telling her to leave landed like \u201ca bomb. It paralyzed me.\u201d",

      "HOUSTON -- A Texas man is facing execution Wednesday for the strangling and stabbing death of a young North Texas mother more than 20 years ago.",
      "Moises Sandoval Mendoza was condemned for the March 2004 killing of 20-year-old Rachelle O\u2019Neil Tolleson. Prosecutors say Mendoza took Tolleson from her home in Farmersville, leaving her 6-month-old daughter alone. The infant was found cold and wet but safe the next day by Tolleson\u2019s mother. Tolleson\u2019s body was found six days later near a creek.",
      "Mendoza, 41, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection Wednesday evening at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.",
      "Evidence in Mendoza\u2019s case showed he also burned Tolleson\u2019s body to hide his fingerprints. Dental records were used to identify her, according to investigators.",
      "Mendoza\u2019s lawyers have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the scheduled execution after lower courts previously rejected his petitions for a stay. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Monday denied Mendoza\u2019s request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty.",
      "In their petition before the Supreme Court, Mendoza\u2019s attorneys said he was prevented by lower courts from arguing that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel earlier in the appeals process.",
      "Mendoza\u2019s lawyers allege that a previous appeals attorney, as well as his trial lawyer, had failed to challenge critical testimony by a detention officer, Robert Hinton. That testimony was used by prosecutors to persuade jurors that Mendoza would be a future danger to society \u2014 a legal finding needed to secure a death sentence in Texas.",
      "Mendoza\u2019s lawyers allege the officer, who worked in the county jail where the inmate was being held after his arrest, gave false testimony that Mendoza had started a fight with another inmate. Mendoza\u2019s lawyers say the other inmate now claims in an affidavit that he believed detention officers wanted him to start the fight, and he was later rewarded for it.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt the jury was listening. During its deliberations, the jury specifically asked about Mendoza\u2019s \u2018criminal acts while in jail,\u2019 including the \u2018assault on other inmate,\u2019\u201d Mendoza\u2019s lawyers said in their petition to the Supreme Court. \u201cAs evidenced by the jury\u2019s notes, there is a reasonable probability that trial counsel\u2019s error in failing to investigate Hinton\u2019s testimony affected the result.\u201d",
      "But the Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office told the Supreme Court that Mendoza\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has already been found by a lower federal court to be \u201cmeritless and insubstantial.\u201d",
      "Even if the detention officer\u2019s testimony were eliminated, the jury heard substantial evidence regarding Mendoza\u2019s future dangerousness and his long history of violence, especially against women, including physically attacking his mother and sister and sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, according to the attorney general\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cFinally, given the extreme delay in this two-decade-old case, the public interest weighs heavily against a stay. The State and crime victims have a \u2019powerful and legitimate interest in punishing the guilty,\u2019\u201d the attorney general\u2019s office said in its petition.",
      "Authorities said that in the days before the killing, Mendoza had attended a party at Tolleson\u2019s home in Farmersville, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) northeast of Dallas. On the day her body was found, Mendoza told a friend about the killing. The friend called police and Mendoza was arrested.",
      "Mendoza confessed to police but couldn\u2019t give detectives a reason for his actions, authorities said. He told investigators he repeatedly choked Tolleson, sexually assaulted her and dragged her body to a field, where he choked her again and then stabbed her in the throat. He later moved her body to a more remote location and burned it.",
      "If the execution is carried out, Mendoza would be the third inmate put to death this year in Texas, historically the nation\u2019s busiest capital punishment state, and the 13th in the U.S.",
      "On Thursday, Alabama planned to execute James Osgood for the 2010 rape and murder of a woman.",

      "Some international students in the U.S. who have had their legal status terminated in recent weeks have found a measure of success in court, with federal judges around the country issuing orders to restore students\u2019 status at least temporarily",
      "ATLANTA -- Anjan Roy was studying with friends at Missouri State University when he got an email that turned his world upside down. His legal status as an international student had been terminated, and he was suddenly at risk for deportation.",
      "\u201cI was in literal shock, like, what the hell is this?\u201d said Roy, a graduate student in computer science from Bangladesh.",
      "At first, he avoided going out in public, skipping classes and mostly keeping his phone turned off. A court ruling in his favor led to his status being restored this week, and he has returned to his apartment, but he is still asking his roommates to screen visitors.",
      "More than a thousand international students have faced similar disruptions in recent weeks, with their academic careers \u2014 and their lives in the U.S. \u2014 thrown into doubt in a widespread crackdown by the Trump administration. Some have found a measure of success in court, with federal judges around the country issuing orders to restore students' legal status at least temporarily.",
      "In addition to the case filed in Atlanta, where Roy is among 133 plaintiffs, judges have issued temporary restraining orders in states including New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Montana, Oregon and Washington. Judges have denied similar requests in some other cases, saying it was not clear the loss of status would cause irreparable harm.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month the State Department was revoking visas held by visitors who were acting counter to national interests, including some who protested Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and those who face criminal charges. But many affected students said they have been involved only in minor infractions, or it's unclear altogether why they were targeted.",
      "The attorney for Roy and his fellow plaintiffs, Charles Kuck, argued the government did not have legal grounds to terminate the students\u2019 status.",
      "He speculated in court last week the government is trying to encourage these students to self-deport, saying \u201cthe pressure on these students is overwhelming.\u201d He said some asked him if it was safe to leave their homes to get food, and others worried they wouldn't receive a degree after years of work or feared their chances of a career in the U.S. were shot.",
      "\u201cI think the hope is they\u2019ll just leave,\u201d Kuck said. \u201cThe reality is these kids are invested.\u201d",
      "An attorney for the government, R. David Powell, argued the students did not suffer significant harm because they could transfer their academic credits or find jobs in another country.",
      "At least 1,100 students at 174 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements, correspondence with school officials and court records. The AP is working to confirm reports of hundreds more students who are caught up in the crackdown.",
      "In a lawsuit filed Monday by four people on student visas at the University of Iowa, attorneys detail the \u201cmental and financial suffering\u201d they\u2019ve experienced. One graduate student, from India, \"cannot sleep and is having difficulty breathing and eating,\u201d the lawsuit reads. He has stopped going to school, doing research or working as a teaching assistant. Another student, a Chinese undergraduate who expected to graduate this December, said his revoked status has caused his depression to worsen to the point that his doctor increased his medication dosage. The student, the lawsuit says, has not left his apartment out of fear of detention.",
      "Roy, 23, began his academic career at Missouri State in August 2024 as an undergraduate computer science student. He was active in the chess club and a fraternity and has a broad circle of friends. After graduating in December, he began work on a master\u2019s degree in January and expects to finish in May 2026.",
      "When Roy received the university's April 10 email on his status termination, one of his friends offered to skip class to go with him to the school\u2019s international services office, even though they had a quiz in 45 minutes. The staff there said a database check showed his student status had been terminated, but they didn\u2019t know why.",
      "Roy said his only brush with the law came in 2021, when he was questioned by campus security after someone called in a dispute at a university housing building. But he said an officer determined there was no evidence of any crime and no charges were filed.",
      "Roy also got an email from the U.S. embassy in Bangladesh telling him his visa had been revoked and that he could be detained at any time. It warned that if he was deported, he could be sent to a country other than his own. Roy thought about leaving the U.S. but decided to stay after talking to a lawyer.",
      "Anxious about being in his own apartment, Roy went to stay with his second cousin and her husband nearby.",
      "\u201cThey were scared someone was going to pick me up from the street and take me somewhere that they wouldn\u2019t even know,\u201d Roy said.",
      "He mostly stayed inside, turned off his phone unless he needed to use it, and avoided internet browsers that track user data through cookies. His professors were understanding when he told them he wouldn\u2019t be able to come to classes for a while, he said.",
      "After the judge\u2019s order Friday, he moved back to his apartment. He learned Tuesday his status had been restored, and he plans to return to class. But he\u2019s still nervous. He asked his two roommates, both international students, to let him know before they open the door if someone they don\u2019t know knocks.",
      "The judge\u2019s restoration of his legal status is temporary. Another hearing scheduled for Thursday will determine whether he keeps that status while the litigation continues.",
      "Roy chose the U.S. over other options in Canada and Australia because of the research opportunities and potential for professional connections, and he ultimately wanted to teach at an American university. But now those plans are up in the air.",
      "His parents, back in Dhaka, have been watching the news and are \u201cfreaked out,\u201d he said. His father mentioned to him that they have family in Melbourne, Australia, including a cousin who\u2019s an assistant professor at a university there. ___",

      "NEW YORK -- The New York Times did not libel former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for an error in a 2017 editorial that she says damaged her reputation, a jury concluded Tuesday.",
      "The jury deliberated a little over two hours before reaching its verdict after lawyers for Palin and the newspaper delivered closing arguments at a Manhattan federal court civil trial that was in its second week.",
      "Palin was sullen immediately after the verdict was announced by a jury foreperson who said the Times was \u201cnot libel.\u201d",
      "She testified Monday that death threats against her increased and her spirits fell after an editorial about gun violence said her political action committee had contributed to political rhetoric that enabled an atmosphere of violence.",
      "The Times corrected the article less than 14 hours after it was published.",
      "Palin was subdued as she left the courthouse for the final time and made her way to a waiting car, telling reporters: \u201cI get to go home to a beautiful family of five kids and grandkids and a beautiful property and get on with life. And that\u2019s nice.\u201d",
      "Later, she posted on the social platform X that she \u201cdidn't prevail\u201d in her lawsuit but vowed to \u201ckeep asking the press to quit making things up.\u201d",
      "Kenneth Turkel, an attorney for Palin, said as he left the courthouse that the legal team will evaluate all posttrial and appellate options.",
      "Danielle Rhoades Ha, a Times spokesperson, said in a statement that the verdict \u201creaffirms an important tenet of American law: publishers are not liable for honest mistakes.\u201d",
      "In his closing argument, Turkel had urged the jury to find the Times liable for defamation on the grounds that its former editorial page editor, James Bennet, either knew what he was publishing was wrong or acted with \u201creckless disregard\u201d for the truth.",
      "He asked the jury to award Palin compensatory damages for the harm done to her reputation and private mental anguish, adding that they should \u201cfind a number and let her get some closure to this thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo this day, there been no accountability,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's why we're here.\u201d",

      "\u201cShe doesn't cry a lot,\u201d Turkel said. \u201cIt may have been to them an honest mistake. For her, it was a life changer.\u201d",
      "Palin, who earned a journalism degree in college, sued the Times for unspecified damages in 2017, about a decade after she burst onto the national stage as the Republican vice-presidential nominee.",
      "Her lawsuit stemmed from an editorial about gun control published after U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, was wounded in 2017 when a man with a history of anti-GOP activity opened fire on a Congressional baseball team practice in Washington.",
      "In the editorial, the Times wrote that before the 2011 mass shooting in Arizona that severely wounded former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords and killed six others, Palin\u2019s political action committee had contributed to an atmosphere of violence by circulating a map of electoral districts that put Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized crosshairs.",
      "In a correction, The Times said the editorial had \u201cincorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting\u201d and that it had \u201cincorrectly described\u201d the map.",
      "A tearful Bennet apologized to Palin from the witness stand when he testified last week, saying he was tormented by the error and worked urgently to correct it after readers complained to the newspaper.",
      "Felicia Ellsworth, an attorney for the Times, told jurors in her closing that there was not \"one shred of evidence showing anything other than an honest mistake.\u201d",
      "Ellsworth said Bennet and the Times \u201ccorrected the record loudly, clearly and quickly\u201d once the error was discovered.",
      "The lawyer pointed out that several Times editors testified consistently about the effort to correct the error and the importance they placed on accuracy while Palin's claims were \u201csupported by nothing other than her say so.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo Gov. Palin, this is just another opportunity to take on fake news. To James Bennet, the truth matters,\u201d Ellsworth said.",
      "In February 2022, Judge Jed S. Rakoff rejected Palin\u2019s claims in a ruling issued while a jury deliberated. The judge then let jurors deliver their verdict, which also went against Palin.",

      "The executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission has resigned in the latest shake-up at the state\u2019s retail gambling enterprise amid multiple investigations into large jackpots in 2023 and earlier this year and threats from some lawmakers to shut ...",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The executive director of the Texas Lottery Commission has resigned, the latest shake-up at the state's retail gambling enterprise amid multiple investigations into jackpots in 2023 and earlier this year totaling nearly $200 million, and calls from some lawmakers to shut it down.",
      "The lottery announced Ryan Mindell's resignation on Monday without comment. A former deputy director and operations director at the lottery, Mindell had held the top job for only about a year following the abrupt resignation of his predecessor.",
      "He leaves as the agency faces at least two investigations ordered by Gov. Greg Abbott and state Attorney General Ken Paxton into the integrity of the lottery prizes, and how the state handled the introduction of courier companies that buy and send tickets on behalf of customers online.",
      "The companies and lottery officials have denied wrongdoing. But Texas state lawmakers are considering forcing several changes, ranging from a legal ban on sales through courier companies to shutting down the agency by taking away all of its funding.",
      "The Texas lottery was established in 1991 and sends a portion of its annual revenue to public education. In 2024, that meant about $2 billion sent to the state's public school fund.",
      "But two of the biggest jackpots in agency history prompted flares of scrutiny and criticism from media, lawmakers and state officials who question whether they were fairly won and if courier companies should be allowed.",
      "First, a $95 million jackpot in 2023 was awarded when the winners bought nearly every possible number combination \u2014 more than 25 million of them. In February, an $83 million ticket was won with a ticket purchased at a courier store. The chain that operates the store has locations in six states.",
      "A Houston Chronicle investigation initially detailed the buying efforts behind the 2023 jackpot, but it was the second one that finally grabbed the attention of prominent state lawmakers, as well as the governor and the state attorney general. An agency that typically garners little attention beyond the millions it awards in jackpots and scratch-off ticket games was suddenly under fire.",
      "Abbott ordered the state's elite Texas Rangers law enforcement agency to open an investigation, and Paxton announced a probe by the state attorney general's office. Those remain ongoing.",
      "A Texas lottery spokesman declined further comment on Mindell\u2019s resignation. Abbott\u2019s office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "The Legislature, meanwhile, has held public hearings to scold lottery officials for allowing the use of courier companies to bypass state law that requires tickets to be purchased in person. Mindell had told state lawmakers in February that the agency had previously determined it did not have the authority to regulate courier companies, but said the agency would now move to ban them.",
      "State lawmakers are approaching the final month of their biennial session and have threatened action ranging from writing a courier ban into state law, or even more drastic measures such as shutting down the lottery altogether.",
      "The state Senate has already passed a ban on courier sales, but the measure has yet to get a vote in the House. The House and Senate will soon negotiate a final version of the two-year state budget. The House version currently includes no money for the agency, which would effectively close it down.",
      "But that effort is likely more of a message that lawmakers are serious about making changes than seriously thinking of closing down an agency that generates billions in sales and for public schools annually.",
      "State law allows Texas jackpots to be claimed anonymously, and the April 2023 jackpot was collected two months later in the form of a one-time payment of $57.8 million to a company called Rook TX.",
      "The payment for the February jackpot, however, is on hold pending the state investigations. An attorney for a woman who claims to hold the winning ticket has said it was legally purchased among a group of 10 she bought through the courier Jacketpocket.",

      "MILFORD, Conn. -- A Connecticut jury on Tuesday convicted a man of murder and evidence tampering in the 2019 killing of his girlfriend, while the disappearance of their young daughter remains a mystery.",
      "Jose Morales, 48, of New Haven, faces 25 to 65 years in prison when he is sentenced on July 8 for the beating death of Christine Holloway inside her home in Ansonia, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) west of New Haven.",
      "Morales testified at the trial in Milford that he did not kill Holloway. He said he, Holloway and their daughter, Vanessa, who was 14 months old at the time, were in Holloway's apartment when two intruders broke in. He said one of the intruders attacked Holloway with a crowbar and he was assaulted before they kidnapped Vanessa, who has never been found. Morales also said he was high on PCP at the time.",
      "Days after the killing, authorities issued an Amber Alert for Vanessa, whose missing person case remains posted on the websites of the FBI and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. Ansonia police said in late 2019 that Morales was a suspect in Vanessa's disappearance, but he was never charged.",
      "During closing arguments on Monday, Supervisory Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Howard Stein said the evidence showed that Morales repeatedly struck Holloway in the head with an object and tried to cover it up by cleaning up the crime scene.",
      "Morales' lawyer, Edward Gavin, declined to comment after the verdict. During his closing argument, he said there was no evidence that Morales had any intent to kill Holloway.",
      "The jury began deliberating Monday afternoon and reached a verdict Tuesday morning after about two total hours of discussion.",

      "NEW YORK -- George Santos is defending his recent social media tirade to a federal judge who will be sentencing the disgraced former New York congressman later this week on fraud charges.",
      "In a lengthy letter ahead of the Friday court date, Santos, 36, said he remains \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d for his crimes but protests that the seven-year prison sentence sought by prosecutors as \u201cridiculous\u201d and overly harsh.",
      "\u201cEvery sunrise since that plea has carried the same realization: I did this, me. I am responsible,\u201d wrote the former Republican lawmaker, who pleaded guilty last summer. \u201cBut saying I\u2019m sorry doesn\u2019t require me to sit quietly while these prosecutors try to drop an anvil on my head.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors, in a filing last week, argued Santos \u201cremains unrepentant\u201d and has not shown genuine remorse, as his lawyers have claimed in their own filing seeking a lighter, two-year prison stint.",
      "They cited a series of posts on X, formerly Twitter, in which he disparaged the U.S. Department of Justice as a \u201ccabal of pedophiles\u201d and cast himself as a victim of prosecutorial overreach.",
      "Santos, who admitted he deceived donors and stole the identities of nearly a dozen people to fund his congressional campaign, countered that his \u201ccolorful\u201d posts are being wrongly \u201crepurposed as a sword against me\u201d by prosecutors.",
      "\u201cContesting the severity of a proposed sentence is not the same as contesting guilt, and punishing protected speech because it questions punishment should trouble anyone who values fair prosecution over personal vindication,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Santos said calling himself the \u201cscapegoat\u201d in social media posts was in reference to prosecutors claiming he was the \u201corganizer/leader\u201d of his campaign\u2019s financial fraud and warranted a stiffer sentence. He argued his former campaign treasurer, Nancy Marks, who has also pleaded guilty and faces sentencing next month, shares equal part in the blame.",
      "\u201cIf I were the criminal mastermind they portray, I would be the clumsiest in modern memory: leaving a trail of screenshots pointing directly back to myself,\u201d he wrote in the Saturday letter.",
      "Santos also pushed back at prosecutors\u2019 claims that he has not made efforts to pay the roughly $580,000 owed as part of his plea deal, saying he\u2019s \u201cliquidated personal assets, reduced my living expenses, and tried as hard as I could to raise some money for restitution.\u201d",
      "He added that he has not asked any of his friends or family to write letters to the court on his behalf, nor did he expect any supporters to attend Friday\u2019s sentencing in Long Island federal court out of embarrassment and shame.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to bring anyone else in my life into this mess,\u201d Santos wrote. \u201cThis is mine to deal with and mine alone.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York\u2019s office, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment.",
      "Santos was elected in 2022 to represent parts of Queens and Long Island but served barely a year before being ousted by his House colleagues.",
      "Santos fabricated much of his life story, leading to questions about how the political unknown had funded his winning campaign.",

      "Mohsen Mahdawi, a legal permanent resident, was arrested April 14 in Colchester, Vermont. He met Monday with U.S. Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont, a Democrat, who posted it on X.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m staying positive by reassuring myself in the ability of justice and the deep belief of democracy,\u201d Madawi said in Welch's video. \"This is the reason I wanted to become a citizen of this country, because I believe in the principles of this country.\u201d",
      "Welch's office said Mahdawi was being detained at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans, Vermont. His case is scheduled for a status conference Wednesday. His lawyers have called for his release.",
      "The U.S. Justice Department has not said why he's being detained. The New York Times reported April 15 that Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote a memo that says Mahdawi's activities could \u201cpotentially undermine\u201d the Middle East peace process. A message seeking comment on the memo was emailed to the State Department on Tuesday.",
      "Rubio has cited a rarely used statute to justify the deportation of Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. It gives Rubio power to deport those who pose \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d",
      "An immigration judge ruled April 11 that Khalil can be forced out of the country as a national security risk, after lawyers argued the legality of deporting the activist who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations. His lawyers plan to appeal.",
      "Mahdawi said that in studying for his citizenship test, he learned \"that the freedom of speech and religion and assembly is guaranteed to everyone in the United States, which is part of the foundation of this country.\u201d",
      "Mahdawi said his work \u201chas been centered on peacemaking.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy empathy, as I mentioned before, extends beyond the Palestinian people and my empathy extends to the Jews and to the Israelis,\" he said. \"And my hope and my dream is to see this conflict, if one might say, to see an end to the war, an end to the killing, to see a peaceful resolution between Palestinians and Israelis. How could this be a threat to anybody, except the war machine that is feeding this?\u201d",
      "Welch responded, \u201cIt would be good for everybody for us to have peace.\u201d",
      "Madawi said, \u201cI want to tell everyone that I feel so loved and so supported. And I am here in good hands. I am centered, I am clear, I am grounded. And I don\u2019t want you to worry about me.\"",
      "According to the court filing, Mahdawi was born in a refugee camp in the West Bank and moved to the United States in 2014. He recently completed coursework at Columbia and was expected to graduate in May before beginning a master\u2019s degree program there in the fall.",
      "As a student, Mahdawi was an outspoken critic of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza and organized campus protests until March 2024.",

      "Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and the District of Columbia Council are scrambling to address a financial crisis created when the Republican-controlled House of Representatives recessed without voting to fix a hole in the city budget",
      "WASHINGTON -- Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser tried to keep the focus on a groundbreaking ceremony for a new mixed-used development. But she couldn't help fielding a string of questions about the budget crisis hanging over the nation's capital city.",
      "Asked Monday about the risk of layoffs and furloughs, she said: \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that we don\u2019t get to that stage. If it comes to that, I can assure employees that they will be treated fairly \u2026 and I want to emphasize to them that this is not something that the D.C. government has done wrong and is not a case where we don\u2019t have the money.\u201d",
      "Bowser and the District of Columbia Council are scrambling to address the crisis created by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. When Congress recessed April 10, it adjourned without addressing a $1.1 billion hole in the city's 2025 budget that was created when the House eliminated a little-known provision in a budget resolution.",
      "The Senate proposed a simple fix that was publicly endorsed by President Donald Trump. But the House failed for three weeks to bring the fix up for a vote.",
      "\u201cI can only tell you how frustrating it is right now,\u201d Bowser said last week. \u201cWe believed that the fix would happen, and we wouldn\u2019t be running around planning for cuts.\u201d",
      "The situation reflects the city's unique relationship with Congress. The Constitution gives federal lawmakers authority over the District of Columbia, while the Home Rule Act of 1973 lets residents elect a mayor, a council and neighborhood commissioners. But Congress maintains significant control, including approving the budget and all laws passed by the D.C. Council.",
      "The office of House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, did not respond to questions on the budget. The House returns Monday. A White House official contacted by The Associated Press reiterated that Trump's position has been made clear, publicly and privately, to House Republicans.",
      "Bowser's government is unveiling a series of preliminary belt-tightening steps. A mayoral order last week established a spending freeze that paused all new hires, promotions, bonuses and new contracts. A freeze on all overtime starts Sunday. That includes police officers, although the Metropolitan Police Department \u2014 which relies heavily on overtime hours \u2014 may apply for a waiver.",
      "Bowser also has invoked a 2009 law allowing the city to increase spending by 6%, shrinking the shortfall to $410 million. The office of the city administrator has been given a Friday deadline to present Bowser with a detailed plan for layoffs, furloughs and the closure of city facilities.",
      "Bowser has spent months walking a public tightrope between her elected responsibilities and the demands of Trump and congressional Republicans. It's a challenge observers say is unique in American urban governance.",
      "\u201cPeople say being mayor of New York City is the toughest job in the country, and I\u2019m like, hell no, it ain\u2019t,\u201d said Cliff Albright, executive director and co-founder of Black Voters Matter. \u201cThe toughest job is being mayor of D.C. because you\u2019ve got all the constraints that every other city has. But you\u2019ve got some extra constraints that no other city has to deal with.\u201d",
      "Bowser and Trump had a tense relationship during his first term. Now she is trying to work with the Republican leader, repeatedly emphasizing what she calls their \u201cshared priorities.\u201d She cleared homeless encampments after Trump's complaints and ordered the dismantling of Black Lives Matter Plaza amid pressure from congressional Republicans.",
      "Bowser acknowledged that her move on BLM Plaza would be unpopular among many voters. But she has publicly cast her current challenge in stark terms, suggesting that one of her biggest responsibilities is helping Washington maintain what autonomy it can while delivering residents the services they deserve.",
      "With hundreds of thousands of federal employees expected to lose their jobs, Bowser said her focus must be on \u201cmaking sure our residents and our economy survive.\u201d",
      "Bowser said she believed voters would trust her judgement as she navigated the second Trump administration. \u201cThey want us to be smart and strategic and get to the other side, and that\u2019s my job,\" she said.",
      "Phil Mendelson, D.C. Council chairman, said that while he would not have removed Black Lives Matter Plaza the way Bowser did, he sympathized with her position.",
      "\u201cThe mayor is trying to find ways to minimize conflict with the administration, and unfortunately there's a need for that,\u201d he said.",
      "At-large council member Christina Henderson said the mayor and city officials must consider wider impacts at a time when Republicans control Congress and the White House, leaving the city minimal leverage and few options. \u201cThey can always take away home rule,\" she said. \"Then where will we be?\u201d",
      "Unless the House restores the funding, Bowser has to come up with a supplemental budget to go into effect in the summer when the city \"is getting ready to host the FIFA Club World Cup games, World Pride, the Fourth of July, and president now wants his military parade,\u201d Henderson said. \"Who\u2019s staffing that if I don\u2019t have money to do overtime?\u201d",
      "The budget issue also has rekindled public calls for D.C. statehood. Anne Stauffer, vice president for issues and advocacy of the League of Women Voters of the District of Columbia, said the situation has placed the city's lack of basic autonomy in clear focus.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of empathy for all the choices that our elected leaders have to make given the sort of anti-democratic system that we\u2019re under,\" Stauffer said.",
      "The remedy, she said, is statehood: \"States control their budgets.\u201d",
      "Some Bowser critics contend that she's been too quick to surrender in the face of pressure from Trump and congressional Republicans. Bowser \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to be so complicit,\u201d said NeeNee Taylor, co-founder of Harriet\u2019s Wildest Dreams, an activist group against police overreach.",
      "Taylor also said that D.C. statehood has become a nonissue and that city leaders and activists should focus on more immediate forms of resistance against encroachments on local autonomy.",
      "\u201cRight now we have to stop the grabbing of the power,\" Taylor said. \"That\u2019s what should be the message now instead of just yelling out, \u2018Statehood.\u2019\u201d",

      "A new AP-NORC poll finds about three-quarters of U.S. adults say their household contributed at least some money to a charitable organization",
      "NEW YORK -- Fears of a \u201cgenerosity crisis\u201d have dogged nonprofit fundraisers for much of this century as they experienced precipitous drops in U.S. household donations. The results of a new poll suggest most Americans gave at least a little to some charities in the past year but offer mixed signals for those hoping to improve giving trends.",
      "The survey, released Tuesday by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, found that about three-quarters of U.S. adults say their household contributed money to a charitable organization. But about one-quarter of respondents said their household had donated $0 to charitable organizations. Most Americans who donated said they gave $500 or less, far below \u201cmajor gift\" territory for even the smallest nonprofits.",
      "The suggestion that many Americans gave anything, even if the totals were low, could be considered a promising sign looking ahead for a sector whipsawed by federal aid cuts and major funders' relatively muted response. After all, the past year saw pocketbooks squeezed by the rising cost of living and everyday donor attention split by the persistent small-dollar fundraising appeals of a high-stakes presidential election.",
      "But adults under age 45 were also more likely to say they donated no money in the last year \u2014 regardless of their level of income \u2014 raising the possibility that some younger generations may be less inclined to give to charity generally.",
      "U.S. adults were likeliest to say they donated to religious organizations or groups that help with bare necessities in the past year.",
      "About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they\u2019ve donated to an organization that helps people in the U.S. who need food, shelter or other basic needs. A similar share say they\u2019ve donated to a religious institution such as a church, mosque or synagogue.",
      "Some people say they trust their church best to use their money as intended. Florida resident Daniel Valdes said he donates whenever he has enough funds because \u201cit's just goodwill to help the disadvantaged.\u201d He reported giving between $101 and $500 over the past year \u2014 including tithes while attending services at a local Catholic church.",
      "\u201cSo, I feel I know where my contributions go,\" said Valdes, 50. \"They don't go to a big corporation. I know they're held locally and within the community.\u201d",
      "About 3 in 10 say they have donated to disaster relief organizations, and about one-quarter donated to animal care groups. Bethany Berry, 37, said donating became more important to her after she lost pets in the 2018 Camp Fire, which destroyed most of the homes in Paradise, California.",
      "Berry reported donating between $51 and $100 over the past year. Some goes to pet rescue organizations. The rest goes to small-dollar requests in a mutual aid group on Facebook where she said members can ask for \u201canything, wants or needs.\u201d",
      "People like her who have experienced disasters understand how easy it is to \u201cbe in that position,\u201d she said, and don't want to watch others suffer.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure you can ever put enough back into the universe to compensate,\" Berry said. \u201cSo, all you can do is try.\u201d",
      "Generational differences also emerged throughout the poll.",
      "Younger adults were more likely than older adults to say they didn\u2019t donate any money. About 3 in 10 adults under age 45 said they donated $0 over the past year, compared with about 2 in 10 adults age 45 or older.",
      "That gap extended to other charitable behavior. About 8 in 10 adults age 60 or older said they donated food, clothing or household items in the past year, compared with about 6 in 10 adults under age 30.",
      "The persistence of those differences as younger adults come into more money \u2014 either by making the difficult climb up the income ladder or through wealth transfers from Baby Boomers to their heirs \u2014 would spell trouble for nonprofits hoping to tap into the next generations\u2019 bank accounts.",
      "Household finances were likely playing at least a partial role. Low-income adults were more likely than higher-income adults to say they didn\u2019t donate, and older adults are more likely to have the highest household incomes overall.",
      "But there were hints that younger generations think differently about their personal obligation to give. Adults under age 45 were more likely than older adults to say that \u201cpeople like them\u201d have only a little responsibility or no responsibility at all to help people in the U.S. who are in need.",
      "And even in higher-income brackets, younger adults were more likely to report donating no money, compared with older adults. That suggests younger adults may be less likely to make charitable gifts, regardless of their financial situation.",
      "Georgia retiree Regina Evans, 68, said she's just \u201can old lady that's lived life\u201d and learned that \u201cwhat you give comes back to you.\u201d She falls in the roughly 1 in 10 U.S. adults who reported donating more than $5,000.",
      "Still, she said, she couldn't give as much as she wanted because Hurricane Helene knocked two pine trees onto the house where she and her husband have lived for more than a decade.",
      "Evans gives to her faith community \u2014 Augusta's Tabernacle Baptist Church \u2014 and a local homeless shelter, like many respondents. Her household stepped up its contributions to Golden Harvest Food Bank when she said inflation left the pantry low on funds. Outside of monetary donations, she\u2019s part of a network that provides secondhand professional attire and winter coats for young women and children.",
      "Donations of food and clothing are also common, according to the poll, although volunteering is less widespread. The survey found that about 7 in 10 U.S. adults said they donated food, clothing or household items in the past year, while about 3 in 10 volunteered their time to a religious or secular charitable organization.",
      "Evans said she keeps giving even when it \"hurts\u201d because she has relied on others for food and shelter during hardships, such as last fall's storm, which still has her living in an apartment.",
      "Such charitable behavior is \u201cnormal\u201d to Evans \u2014 and she believes there are more likeminded people who are \u201cgenerous of spirit.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a requirement for me. If you live in this place, you live in this world, you should give if you expect to receive,\" Evans said. \u201cIt never comes back in the way that you expect, and it doesn\u2019t come back dollar for dollar. But I can say with complete surety that every dollar that I\u2019ve ever donated came back to me in a way that I could not count.\u201d",

      "The Anti-Defamation League says the number of antisemitic incidents in the United States reached a record high last year",
      "NEW YORK -- The Anti-Defamation League says the number of antisemitic incidents in the United States reached a record high last year and notes that 58% of the 9,354 incidents related to Israel, notably chants, speeches and signs at rallies protesting Israeli policies.",
      "In a report released Tuesday, the ADL, which has produced annual tallies for 46 years, said it's the first time Israel-related incidents \u2014 5,422 of them in 2024 \u2014 comprised more than half the total. A key reason is the widespread opposition to Israel\u2019s military response in Gaza after the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The ADL\u2019s findings add grist to an intense, divisive debate among American Jews \u2014 and others \u2014 over the extent to which vehement criticism of Israeli policies and of Zionism should be considered antisemitic.",
      "The debate has broadened as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration makes punitive moves against universities it considers too lax in combating antisemitism and seeks to deport some pro-Palestinian campus activists.",
      "The upshot, for numerous Jewish leaders, is a balancing act: Decrying flagrant acts of antisemitism as well as what they consider to be the administration\u2019s exploitation of the issue to target individuals and institutions it dislikes.",
      "\u201cThe fears of antisemitism are legitimate and real \u2014 and we don\u2019t want to see those real fears exploited to undermine democracy,\u201d said Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs. \"I feel that a majority of American Jews can believe that two things are true at the same time.\u201d",
      "The ADL said in its new report it is \"careful to not conflate general criticism of Israel or anti-Israel activism with antisemitism.\u201d But there are gray areas. For example, the ADL contends that vilification of Zionism \u2014 the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel \u2014 is a form of antisemitism, yet some Jews are among the critics of Zionism and of the ADL itself.",
      "Incidents at anti-Israel rallies that counted as antisemitism in the new ADL tally include \u201cjustification or glorification of antisemitic violence, promotion of classic antisemitic tropes ... and signage equating Judaism or Zionism with Nazism.\u201d Also counted were celebrations of the Hamas attack on Israel and \u201cunapologetic support for terrorism.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn 2024, hatred toward Israel was a driving force behind antisemitism across the U.S.,\u201d said Oren Segal, who leads the ADL\u2019s efforts to combat extremism and terrorism.",
      "The report depicted university campuses as common venues for antisemitic incidents, saying many Jewish students \u201cface hostility, exclusion and sometimes physical danger because of their identity or their beliefs.\u201d",
      "The experience of those students was evoked by Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism \u2014 an umbrella group for more than 800 Reform congregations in North America \u2014 as he discussed the complexities arising from current antisemitism-related developments.",
      "\u201cWe have an obligation to our students on campus,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cCan they go to Seder? Can they feel safe wearing a yarmulke?\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the same time, this current administration has weaponized the fight against antisemitism by weakening core democratic institutions,\u201d Jacobs added.",
      "He referred to the detention and threatened deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old graduate student who served as a negotiator and spokesperson for pro-Palestinian activists at Columbia University. Khalil has been detained since March 8 despite facing no criminal charges.",
      "\u201cThere has to be a legal case \u2014 not just you don\u2019t like what he says,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cWhat has kept Jewish people safe is the rule of law, due process. If it is undermined for Palestinians, it will be undermined for all of us.\u201d",
      "The ADL dismayed some progressive Jewish leaders by welcoming Columbia's acquiescence in March to Trump administration demands and by initially commending the campaign targeting pro-Palestinian activists such as Khalil.",
      "Recent critics of the ADL include Michael Roth, the first Jewish president of Wesleyan University; political commentator Peter Beinart; and Columbia professor James Schamus, who has been urging his fellow Jews on the faculty to oppose the university\u2019s compliance with administration demands.",
      "Washington Post columnist Matt Bai wrote a scathing column about the ADL on April 1.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t call yourself a civil rights organization in the United States right now \u2014 let alone a civil rights organization for a minority that has been brutally evicted all over the world \u2014 and not loudly oppose the cruel and unlawful removal of foreigners whose views happen to be out of fashion,\u201d Bai wrote.",
      "Two days later, the ADL's CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, wrote an opinion piece for eJewishPhilanthropy seeking to distance the ADL from aspects of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on pro-Palestinian activists.",
      "\u201cAs an organization that has fought for a minority community for more than 100 years, ADL is incredibly sensitive to the importance of allowing all views to be expressed \u2014 even those that we or the majority of Americans disagree with,\u201d Greenblatt wrote. \u201cWe should be holding people accountable for actual crimes, not Orwellian thoughtcrimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can protect the civil liberties of Jewish students even as we preserve the civil liberties of those who protest, harass or attack them because they are innocent until proven guilty,\u201d he added. \u201cIf we sacrifice our constitutional freedoms in the pursuit of security, we undermine the very foundation of the diverse, pluralistic society we seek to defend.\u201d",
      "Beyond the Israel-related incidents, these were among the other findings in the new ADL report:",
      "\u2014 The total number of antisemitic incidents in 2024 was up by 344% from five years ago.",
      "\u2014 196 incidents, targeting more than 250 people, were categorized as assault; none of these assaults were fatal.",
      "\u2014 2,606 incidents were categorized as vandalism. Swastikas were present in 37% of these cases.",
      "\u2014 There were 647 bomb threats, most of them targeting synagogues.",
      "\u2014 Antisemitic incidents occurred in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. More than 10% of the incidents occurred in New York City.",
      "\u2014 There were 962 \u201cantisemitic propaganda incidents\u201d linked to white supremacist groups. Three groups \u2014 Patriot Front, Goyim Defense League, and the White Lives Matter network \u2014 were responsible for 94% of this activity.",
      "The ADL says its annual report tallies criminal and noncriminal acts of harassment, vandalism and assault against individuals and groups as reported to the ADL by victims, law enforcement, the media and partner organizations, and then evaluated by ADL experts.",

      "The former Tennessee House speaker and his onetime chief of staff are facing a federal criminal trial this week",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The former Tennessee House speaker and his onetime chief of staff are facing a federal criminal trial this week, where some old colleagues will be less friendly on the witness stand than others.",
      "The trial of former Republican Rep. Glen Casada and his former aide, Cade Cothren, promises to include testimony from current and former lawmakers and staffers, some for the government, others for the defense. Jury selection begins Tuesday and the trial could take weeks.",
      "The case accuses the two of running a political mailing group that House Republicans hired with taxpayer money without knowing Cothren was behind the firm. Casada and Cothren hid Cothren's involvement to land the business after the two had been pressured out of their leadership roles in a preceding political scandal, according to prosecutors.",
      "Prosecutors say Cothren created an alter ego to run the company \u2014 Matthew Phoenix, of Phoenix Solutions.",
      "The two face a 20-count indictment for charges including bribery, kickbacks and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, they each face up to 20 years in prison. After multiple delays, the trial comes three years after they were charged and almost six years after they resigned from their top statehouse posts.",
      "Federal prosecutors plan to call about 15 witnesses, including House Speaker Cameron Sexton. Sexton, who succeeded Casada, helped federal authorities in their investigation and is expected to testify. So is former Rep. Robin Smith, who took a plea deal in the scheme. Some lawmakers have been subpoenaed for the defense, according to news reports.",
      "Attorneys for Casada and Cothren have said that lawmakers got the political services they paid for, so the secrecy about the firm's ownership isn't a crime.",
      "Casada, a Republican from Williamson County south of Nashville, became House speaker in January 2019. Cothren rose through the legislative staff ranks to become his chief of staff.",
      "Casada notably left the voting board open during a key vote to pass a school voucher program, waiting until one vote flipped so the bill would pass. The discussions to try to convince lawmakers to switch to \u201cyes\u201d created wide speculation about what was promised.",
      "Casada resigned from the top leadership post in August 2019 after a no-confidence vote from fellow House Republicans due to swirling scandals, including revelations he exchanged sexually explicit text messages about women years ago with Cothren. Not long before that, Cothren also left his post over those texts and racist texts, coupled with an admission he used cocaine inside a legislative office building when he held a previous job.",
      "In January 2021, FBI agents searched the homes, legislative offices or both of Casada, Cothren, Smith and other statehouse figures. Casada remained a state representative until 2022, when he didn't seek reelection.",
      "Casada and Cothren were indicted in August 2022, a few months after Smith pleaded guilty.",
      "The charging documents say Cothren launched Phoenix Solutions with Smith\u2019s and Casada\u2019s \u201cknowledge and support\u201d to offer mail and consulting services to lawmakers. Cothren registered the company in New Mexico because the state allows anonymous registration of LLCs, and rebuffed requests for in-person meetings with Casada\u2019s fellow lawmakers, saying the company representatives were out of state, prosecutors allege.",
      "All three claimed the firm was run by a \u201cMatthew Phoenix,\" as Phoenix Solutions and companies controlled by Casada and Smith received roughly $52,000 in 2020 from the state in payments associated with the taxpayer funded mailer program for lawmakers, the indictment says.",
      "Smith resigned and pleaded guilty to a federal wire fraud charge in the Phoenix Solutions scheme in March 2022. Smith, who had served as a Republican House member from Hixson since 2018, \u201cwill testify about her unlawful agreement\" with Casada and Cothren, prosecutors said. She will be sentenced after the trial.",
      "Smith told multiple Republican lawmakers in 2020 that \u201cMatthew Phoenix and his associate, Candice, got tired of living in the Washington, D.C. area and decided to move back home to New Mexico, where Phoenix started Phoenix Solutions,\" prosecutors wrote. Candice was portrayed by Casada's then-girlfriend, they said.",
      "Cothren paid Casada and Smith more than $35,000 in bribes and kickbacks, the indictment says. Prosecutors have text messages between Smith and Cothren about his use of the Matthew Phoenix alias.",
      "Sexton has said he has assisted federal authorities in the investigation since becoming speaker in 2019. Sexton was among the lawmakers and staffers who testified to the grand jury. Prosecutors say he will testify at trial about the requirements of the postage and printing allowance of $3,000 per House lawmaker.",
      "Cothren's attorneys have claimed that he helped Sexton in multiple ways after Cothren resigned, including in Sexton's 2019 bid for speaker, an attempt to undermine the premise that House Republicans opposed using Cothren's services due to his prior scandals. The judge approved subpoenas for Sexton's phone records related to the claim.",

      "The much-anticipated retrial of Karen Read is set to begin",
      "DEDHAM, Mass. -- The second murder trial of Karen Read, whose case has sparked a national debate on police accountability and won her legions of devoted fans, will begin Tuesday with both sides laying out conflicting theories of how her Boston police officer boyfriend ended up dead.",
      "Read is accused of striking John O\u2019Keefe with her SUV in 2022 and leaving him to die alone in the snow outside of a house party in the town of Canton, a suburb about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Boston. She has been charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating a vehicle under the influence and leaving the scene.",
      "During the first trial last year, prosecutors said Read intentionally backed into O'Keefe after she dropped him off at a house party and returned hours later to find him dead. The defense said she was a victim of a vast police conspiracy and that O'Keefe was fatally beaten by another law enforcement officer at the party.",
      "A mistrial was declared last year after jurors said they were at an impasse and deliberating further would be futile.",
      "After the trial, the defense unsuccessful moved to have two of the charges dismissed after they said several jurors came forward to say the group was unanimous in finding Read not guilty of second-degree murder and leaving the scene. The U.S. Supreme Court denied a request from Read to delay her trial on double jeopardy grounds",
      "Many of the factors that made the first trial must-see television will be featured in the second.",
      "Many of the same witnesses are back as are Read's aggressive defense team and dozens of her supporters camped out near the courthouse \u2014 many carrying \u201cFree Karen Read\u201d signs and wearing pink. Read, who has been featured in several documentaries about her case, has become a minor celebrity.",
      "The biggest difference will be the lead prosecutor, Hank Brennan. Brought in as a special prosecutor after the mistrial, the former defense attorney has represented a number of prominent clients, including notorious Boston gangster James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger.",
      "Brennan stands to benefit from a pretrial ruling from Judge Beverly Cannone that defense attorneys can\u2019t mention potential third-party culprits in their opening statements. They can develop a case against two law enforcement officers but cannot implicate Albert\u2019s nephew, Colin Albert, as they did in the first trial.",
      "\u201cI view it as a blow to the defense strategy but not a knockout punch,\u201d Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University, said of the ruling. \u201cAll the defense needs to do is create reasonable doubt about Karen (Read's) guilt, and that doesn\u2019t require pointing to an alternative perpetrator as a matter of law.\u201d",
      "Legal experts expect prosecutors to focus on Read's behavior as they did during the first trial \u2014 her volatile relationship with O'Keefe and their night of heavy drinking. They also predict the prosecution will lay out a stronger and more coherent case that Read clipped O'Keefe with the back of her SUV and sent him tumbling to the ground \u2014 using data from her car, video and stronger expert testimony.",
      "\u201cThe Commonwealth will focus on the theme drilled into us since middle school \u2014 Drinking, Driving, Deadly Consequences,\u201d Michael Coyne, the dean of Massachusetts School of Law at Andover, said in an email, adding that he expects prosecutors to avoid mistakes of the first trial, where several of their early witnesses appeared to help the defense more than the state.",
      "The defense is expected to offer evidence that what they see as a sloppy police investigation was biased and that law enforcement officers set Read up to protect the real killers. They could be helped by an audit of the Canton Police Department released last month that found several mistakes with the investigation \u2014 although no evidence of a cover-up.",
      "One of the key witnesses will be former State Trooper Michael Proctor. He led the investigation but has since been fired after a disciplinary board found that he sent sexist and crude texts about Read to his family and colleagues.",
      "\u201cMichael Proctor and his dismissal from the force may very well serve as the elephant in the courtroom throughout the proceedings,\" Medwed said.",

      "Arborists are hoping to transform vacant land on Detroit\u2019s eastside by planting giant sequoias, the world\u2019s largest trees",
      "DETROIT -- Arborists are turning vacant land on Detroit's eastside into a small urban forest, not of elms, oaks and red maples indigenous to the city but giant sequoias, the world's largest trees that can live for thousands of years.",
      "The project on four lots will not only replace long-standing blight with majestic trees, but could also improve air quality and help preserve the trees that are native to California\u2019s Sierra Nevada, where they are threatened by ever-hotter wildfires.",
      "Detroit is the pilot city for the Giant Sequoia Filter Forest. The nonprofit Archangel Ancient Tree Archive is donating dozens of sequoia saplings that will be planted by staff and volunteers from Arboretum Detroit, another nonprofit, to mark Earth Day on April 22.",
      "Co-founder David Milarch says Archangel also plans to plant sequoias in Los Angeles, Oakland, California, and London.",
      "The massive conifers can grow to more than 300 feet (90 meters) tall with a more than 30-foot (9-meter) circumference at the base. They can live for more than 3,000 years.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s a tree that is bigger than your house when it\u2019s mature, taller than your buildings, and lives longer than you can comprehend,\u201d said Andrew \u201cBirch\u201d Kemp, Arboretum Detroit's executive director.",
      "The sequoias will eventually provide a full canopy that protects everything beneath, he said.",
      "\u201cIt may be sad to call these .5- and 1-acre treescapes forests,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cWe are expanding on this and shading our neighborhood in the only way possible, planting lots of trees.\u201d",
      "Giant sequoias are resilient against disease and insects, and are usually well-adapted to fire. Thick bark protects their trunks and their canopies tend to be too high for flames to reach. But climate change is making the big trees more vulnerable to wildfires out West, Kemp said.",
      "\u201cThe fires are getting so hot that its even threatening them,\u201d he said.",
      "Archangel, based in Copemish, Michigan, preserves the genetics of old-growth trees for research and reforestation.",
      "The sequoia saplings destined for Detroit are clones of two giants known as Stagg \u2014 the world's fifth-largest tree \u2014 and Waterfall, of the Alder Creek grove, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of Los Angeles.",
      "In 2010, Archangel began gathering cones and climbers scaled high into the trees to gather new-growth clippings from which they were able to develop and grow saplings.",
      "A decade later, a wildfire burned through the grove. Waterfall was destroyed but Stagg survived. They will both live on in the Motor City.",
      "Sequoias need space, and metropolitan Detroit has plenty of it.",
      "In the 1950s, 1.8 million people called Detroit home, but the city's population has since shrunk to about one-third of that number. Tens of thousands of homes were left empty and neglected.",
      "While the city has demolished at least 24,000 vacant structures since it emerged from bankruptcy in 2014, thousands of empty lots remain. Kemp estimates that only about 10-15% of the original houses remain in the neighborhood where the sequoias will grow.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not another urban area I know of that has the kind of potential that we do to reforest,\" he said. \u201cWe could all live in shady, fresh air beauty. It's like no reason we can\u2019t be the greenest city in the world.\u201d",
      "Within the last decade, 11 sequoias were planted on vacant lots owned by Arboretum Detroit and nine others were planted on private properties around the neighborhood. Each now reaches 12 to 15 feet (3.6 to 4.5 meters) tall. Arboretum Detroit has another 200 in its nursery. Kemp believes the trees will thrive in Detroit.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re safer here ... we don\u2019t have wildfires like (California). The soil stays pretty moist, even in the summer,\u201d he said. \u201cThey like to have that winter irrigation, so when the snow melts they can get a good drink.\u201d",
      "Caring for the sequoias will fall to future generations, so Milarch has instigated what he calls \u201ctree school\u201d to teach Detroit\u2019s youth how and why to look after the new trees.",
      "\u201cWe empower our kids to teach them how to do this and give them the materials and the way to do this themselves,\u201d Milarch said. \u201cThey take ownership. They grow them in the classrooms and plant them around the schools. They know we\u2019re in environmental trouble.\u201d",
      "Some of them may never have even walked in a forest, Kemp said.",
      "\u201cHow can we expect children who have never seen a forest to care about deforestation on the other side of the world?\" Kemp said. \"It is our responsibility to offer them their birthright.\u201d",
      "City residents are exposed to extreme air pollution and have high rates of asthma. The Detroit sequoias will grow near a heavily industrial area, a former incinerator and two interstates, he said.",
      "Kemp\u2019s nonprofit has already planted about 650 trees \u2014 comprising around 80 species \u2014 in some 40 lots in the area. But he believes the sequoias will have the greatest impact.",

      "President Donald Trump has added another endorsement in next year\u2019s Republican primary for Arizona governor",
      "PHOENIX, Ariz. -- President Donald Trump added another endorsement in next year\u2019s Republican primary for Arizona governor, saying Monday that he was backing U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs in addition to his previously announced endorsement of housing developer Karrin Taylor Robson.",
      "Trump\u2019s endorsement of Robson late last year angered some of his biggest allies in the state, who are suspicious of her longstanding ties to the Republican business establishment and preferred a candidate with deep roots in Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement.",
      "A former chair of the U.S. House\u2019s hard-right Freedom Caucus and former state Senate president, Biggs has long been a close ally to Trump and supported his false claims about the 2020 presidential election being stolen. Biggs represents a deep red district including cities like Queen Creek and Gilbert, and has ties to the party\u2019s grassroots.",
      "Biggs has had no problem with defying party leadership \u2014 such as when he and seven other House Republicans helped oust Kevin McCarthy as House Speaker in 2023.",
      "\u201cWhen Andy Biggs decided to run for Governor, quite unexpectedly, I had a problem \u2014 Two fantastic candidates, two terrific people, two wonderful champions, and it is therefore my Great Honor TO GIVE MY COMPLETE AND TOTAL ENDORSEMENT TO BOTH,\u201d Trump said Monday in a post on Truth Social.",
      "In a failed 2022 race for governor, Robson was closely aligned with old guard Arizona conservatives. She campaigned with Republicans who had fallen from Trump\u2019s good graces, including former Gov. Doug Ducey and former Vice President Mike Pence, while Trump campaigned for former television news anchor Kari Lake. Lake won the GOP primary and lost to current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs.",
      "This time around, Robson has been looking to eliminate daylight between herself and the president, eagerly embracing him and his policies while touting herself as the Trump-endorsed candidate.",
      "In reaction to the dual endorsement, Robson expressed her gratitude to Trump for his support.",
      "\u201cI cannot wait to be in the Governor\u2019s Office as a partner to his conservative, America First agenda,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cOnward!\u201d",
      "Sean Noble, general consultant with Biggs' campaign, said the campaign is \u201cthrilled\u201d for the endorsement but also expected it to be for both candidates given Trump's earlier support of Robson.",
      "\u201cGiven that Robson had leaned so heavily on the endorsement as her very premise for being in the race, it does call into question whether she should stay in the race,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump is no stranger to dual endorsements. Since 2017, he\u2019s supported multiple candidates vying for the same post in six races, including Robson and Biggs, according to analysis by The Associated Press. In the 2022 U.S. Senate race in Missouri, he endorsed \u201cEric,\u201d the first name of two GOP candidates vying for the nomination. A triple endorsement came in 2024 in the Missouri governor\u2019s race when Trump backed Jay Ashcroft, Mike Kehoe and Bill Eigel.",
      "The Democratic Governors Association called the dual endorsement as a \u201chuge blow\u201d to Robson. The winner of the GOP primary will face likely face Hobbs, who has no serious challenger for the Democratic nomination.",

    "story": [
      "Herbert Gans, an eminent sociologist and media analyst, has died at age 97",
      "NEW YORK -- Herbert Gans, a groundbreaking sociologist and media analyst who advocated for greater diversity and public participation in everything from the suburbs and the arts to the voices that shape the news, died Monday at age 97.",
      "His death was confirmed by his son, David Gans, who said he died at his Manhattan home after a lengthy illness.",
      "Author of such influential works as \u201cThe Urban Villagers\u201d and \u201cThe Levittowners,\u201d Herbert Gans was a refugee from Nazi Germany who liked to say he viewed his adopted country through the eyes of an outsider. He called himself a \u201cparticipant-observer,\u201d combining research and direct experience and lending crucial perspective on municipal planning, attitudes toward race and poverty, mass communication and cultural tastes.",
      "A professor emeritus at Columbia University and former president of the American Sociological Association, he believed in making scholarly work accessible, and was a popular commentator and prolific essay writer. He served on the committee that prepared the Kerner Report, the 1968 government study that warned the country was \u201cmoving toward two societies, one Black, one white \u2014 separate and unequal.\u201d In 1964, he testified on behalf of Lenny Bruce when the comedian was on trial for obscenity.",
      "Gans wrote often about the local impact of government policy. In \u201cThe Urban Villagers,\u201d released in 1962, he chronicled (and lived in) a blue-collar Italian-American section of Boston\u2019s West End that would soon be torn down in favor of more expensive housing. The sociologist Nathan Glazer would praise the book\u2019s critique of \u201curban renewal\u201d and detailed portrait of those displaced for describing \u201ctruthfully and without damaging preconceptions a part of American reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Levittowners,\u201d published in 1967, countered the prevalent feeling of the time that suburbs bred conformity and despair. Gans lived for two years in a New Jersey suburb designed by William Levitt, whose \u201cLevittowns\u201d helped define the modern bedroom community. Gans didn\u2019t dispute that boredom and homogeneity existed in the suburbs, but concluded that most of the residents were satisfied; the suburbs were less likely to change the people who moved there than to provide what they had been looking for.",
      "\u201cI should like to emphasize once more that whatever its imperfections, Levittown is a good place to live,\u201d Gans wrote. \u201d(T)he most urgent priority is to make the benefits of suburban living available to the poor and nonwhite families, now condemned to slum ghettos, who want to give their children and themselves a better life beyond the city limits.\u201d",
      "Gans\u2019 \u201cDeciding What\u2019s News,\u201d which came out in 1979, was a snapshot of the peak of print journalism and network power. Focusing on the evening broadcasts of NBC and CBS and the news magazines Time and Newsweek, he spent extensive time with reporters in the 1960s and \u201970s and noted what they covered, what they didn\u2019t cover and the thinking behind their choices, whether the pressures of executives, concerns about objectivity or changes in public concerns.",
      "He found the newsgathering process to be honest and well intended. But Gans worried that organizations were more invested in stability and the status quo than in fully informing the public, with journalists drawing upon familiar sources in government and business and spending much of their private time with those of their social class. As a solution, Gans proposed \u201cMultiperspectivism,\u201d allowing everyone from radical leftists to religious fundamentalists to express their views.",
      "\u201cFor those who feel, as I do, that the interests of diverse groups have priority over the needs of nation and society, multiperspectival news and some decentralization of the national media are preferable,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt would be a good deal more effective if it coincided with widespread public demand for greater popular representation in the economy and the polity.\u201d",
      "Gans\u2019 other books included \u201cMiddle American Individualism,\u201d \u201cThe War Against the Poor\u201d and \u201cPeople, Plans and Policies.\u201d In \u201cImagining America in 2033,\u201d published in 2009, he outlined his hopes for a \u201cfairer economy, a more democratic polity, and institutions that cater to a greater extent to the people they are supposed to serve.\u201d",
      "Born in Cologne, Germany to middle-class Jewish parents, Gans and has family fled the Nazis in 1939, moving first to England and settling in Chicago in 1940. Gans became a naturalized citizen in 1945 and served in the Army in 1945-46. He had already liked reading sociology in high school and studied it as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, where he became close to such faculty members as the social scientist Martin Meyerson and David Reisman, the future author of \u201cThe Lonely Crowd,\u201d the classic portrait of social anxiety in 1950s America. Gans received a master\u2019s in sociology from the University of Chicago and a Ph.D., in 1957, from the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "He taught at the University of Pennsylvania and Teachers College before joining Columbia in 1971 and remaining until 2007. He also worked in local government, as an assistant planner for the Chicago Housing Authority, and at the federal level with the predecessor to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He was married twice, most recently to Louise Gruner.",
      "Gans was a highly educated, liberal Democrat whose belief in diversity meant he resisted imposing his tastes, whether upon his neighbors in Levittown or upon his readers. In the 1974 book \u201cPopular Culture and High Culture,\u201d he disputed the idea that so-called elite tastes were superior to those of the masses and criticized scholars who followed \u201ctheir own standard of the good life.\u201d",
      "He wrote, \u201call people have a right to the culture they prefer, regardless of whether it is high or popular. The book is thus an argument for cultural democracy and an argument against the idea that only the cultural expert knows what is good for people and for society.\u201d",

      "Mar\u00eda Isabel Salvador warned that \u201cHaiti could face total chaos\u201d without increased funding and support for the operation of the Kenya-led multinational force helping Haiti\u2019s police to tackle the gangs\u2019 expanding violence into areas beyond the capital, Port-Au-Prince.",
      "Most recently, she said, gangs seized the city of Mirebalais in central Haiti and during the attack over 500 prisoners were freed. It was the fifth prison break in under a year, \u201cpart of a deliberate effort to entrench dominance, dismantle institutions and instill fear.\u201d",
      "Haiti\u2019s police, supported by the armed forces and the Kenya-led force, were overwhelmed by the scale and duration of the violence, the U.N. special representative said..",
      "The gangs have grown in power since the July 7, 2021, assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse and are now estimated to control 85% of the capital and are moving into surrounding areas. Haiti has not had a president since then.",
      "The U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police arrived in Haiti last year to help local authorities quell gang violence, but the mission remains understaffed and underfunded, with only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel originally envisioned.",
      "Salvador said that in February and March alone, 1,086 people were killed and 383 injured. In addition, according to the U.N. migration office, over 60,000 Haitians were displaced in the past two months, adding to 1 million already displaced by December. \u201cThese figures are expected to rise,\u201d she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the leader of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council, Fritz Alphonse Jean, tried to allay surging alarm among Haitians over the rampant gang violence by acknowledging that the country has \u201cbecome hell for everyone.\u201d He promised new measures to stop the bloodshed.",
      "But Salvador, who heads the U.N. political mission in the country, said the Haitian government\u2019s efforts alone will be insufficient to significantly reduce the intensity of the violence perpetrated by criminal groups.",

      "Kenya\u2019s national security adviser, Monica Juma, told the council in a video briefing from Nairobi that the force has entered \u201ca decisive phase of its operation\u201d where gangs are coordinating operations and attacking people and strategic installations, and targeting the political establishment.",
      "While the Haitian police and the multinational force have launched intensive anti-gang operations and achieved some notable progress, especially in securing critical infrastructure, she said a significant gap exists.",
      "Juma said 261 Kenyan police officers are trained and ready to deploy to Haiti, but they can\u2019t get there because of a lack of equipment and logistical support.",
      "She urged the council to take a \u201cmore assertive and proactive role\u201d in helping to stabilize Haiti, saying time is of the essence.",
      "Juma said critical to stabilizing the country is stopping the flow of guns and ammunition to the gangs and implementing sanctions against gang leaders. U.N. experts say most arms come from the United States, specifically the Miami area.",

      "The ultrasound requirement did not significantly affect clinic operations but Wellspring Health Access also suspended offering pill abortions to avoid legal complications. The law stands to add to the cost and complications for women getting pill abortions.",
      "Opponents call laws like Wyoming\u2019s requirements \u201ctargeted restrictions on abortion providers\u201d because they can regulate clinics and abortion access out of existence even if abortion remains legal.",
      "In blocking the laws while the lawsuit proceeds, District Judge Thomas Campbell in Casper ruled that they too stand to violate the constitution.",
      "Despite the new restrictions, Wellspring Health Access has remained open to consult with patients and provide hormone replacement therapy for transgender patients. The clinic opened in 2023, almost a year late after heavy damage from an arson attack.",

      "But some worry the proposal could hinder a defendant's rights in court.",
      "The Iowa House approved the measure last week, and it passed the Senate in March, though it would take years and several more votes \u2014 by lawmakers and the public \u2014 before the state constitution could be changed.",
      "The issue stems from a state Supreme Court decision last year that said the Iowa Constitution requires people accused of a crime and the trial witnesses testifying against them to see each other. The decision broke with decades of how the U.S. Supreme Court and other states handle the issue, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird argues.",
      "\u201cWe are the only state that has come to that conclusion,\u201d said Bird, a Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we can protect kids in court, that kids who have been traumatized can have the opportunity to testify outside the presence of the person they may be very, very afraid of.\u201d",
      "The amendment would say that constitutional right \u201cmay be limited by law\u201d for certain witnesses: those under 18 and those with mental illness, intellectual disability or other developmental disability.",
      "Both legislative chambers would need to approve the measure again in 2027 or 2028 to put it before voters in November 2028.",
      "The Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution lays out the rights of the accused in criminal prosecutions, specifying the right to a speedy trial, an impartial jury, and, among other things, \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d",
      "The Iowa Constitution, adopted in 1857, also defines the rights of persons accused, including the same confrontation clause.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court said in a 1990 decision, Maryland v. Craig, that \u201cthe right to confront accusatory witnesses may be satisfied absent a physical, face-to-face confrontation\u201d when remote testimony is necessary and can be provided reliably.",
      "\u201cMaryland\u2019s interest in protecting child witnesses from the trauma of testifying in a child abuse case is sufficiently important to justify the use of its special procedure,\u201d the decision said.",
      "The majority of courts across the country have aligned with that Supreme Court decision, according to Colin Miller, a University of South Carolina law professor.",
      "The most common exception is when the state's confrontation clause includes the words \u201cface to face.\" That explicit text led the New Hampshire Supreme Court this year, for example, to say a 9-year-old girl\u2019s remote testimony violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right.",
      "\u201cUp until Iowa, our \u2014 as practitioners and as a national agency \u2014 operating assumption was that if it did not say \u2018face to face\u2019 in the state constitution, they would abide Maryland v. Craig,\u201d said Meg Garvin, executive director of the National Crime Victim Law Institute at Lewis & Clark Law School.",
      "Garvin was referencing the Iowa Supreme Court\u2019s decision last year that reversed the convictions for a man accused of neglect or abuse of a child and child endangerment causing bodily injury. Two of his other children testified against him from outside the courtroom, where they could not see the defendant.",
      "A 1998 state law carved out that exception for a minor needing protection \u201cfrom trauma caused by testifying in the physical presence of the defendant where it would impair the minor\u2019s ability to communicate.\u201d If the judge allows, a minor\u2019s testimony could be televised to the jury and defendant in the courtroom.",
      "Iowa's confrontation clause does not specify \u201cface to face,\u201d but the court said that violated his constitutional right to confrontation, declaring the state constitution affords more protection to criminal defendants than the federal constitution.",
      "\"When our constitution was adopted, a \u2018confrontation\u2019 was understood to involve a \u2018face to face\u2019 encounter,\u201d the court said.",
      "Bird said her office wanted to ensure the solution they proposed to protect kids \u201cstands the test of time.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s supported by law enforcement and county attorneys, as well as various victim advocacy organizations, many of whom told lawmakers that justice isn\u2019t being served in Iowa if children are forced to face an abuser again or are too afraid to tell their stories.",
      "\u201cThe thing that I sit almost daily, definitely weekly, and grapple with with parents is when they have to decide: \u2018Is the price of justice worth it for my child?\u2019\u201d Wendy Berkey, a family advocate at a Des Moines-area child protection center, told lawmakers in January. \u201cUnfortunately, right now in Iowa the answer they often have is no.\u201d",
      "The public opposition to the proposal has been concentrated among defense attorneys who cite examples of people wrongly accused and say these allowances for certain witnesses signal to the jury that the defendant is guilty.",
      "The existing law looks similar to the approach in many states, said Chris Wellborn, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. But Wellborn suggested that changing the constitution is a slippery slope.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re basically futzing around with the Sixth Amendment,\u201d he said. \u201cI would argue that\u2019s a very dangerous road to go down because when you start saying we carve out exceptions for someone\u2019s confrontational rights, do we also carve out exceptions for their right to present a defense?\u201d",
      "Bird said the current law has \u201cworked for years without controversy,\" and she is not seeking additional legislation.",
      "But Wellborn's concern was echoed by Republican state Rep. Charley Thomson, who said the provisions \u201copen the door wide to mischief by future legislatures.\u201d",
      "State Rep. Steven Holt acknowledged the constitutionality concerns but said the Iowa Supreme Court didn't offer many options.",
      "\u201cThey struck it down but didn't really give any guidance as to what we should do,\u201d said Holt, a Republican. \u201cThey've left us with an interesting conundrum as we try to protect children in the courts against ... having to be traumatized again.\u201d",

      "The official figures come as Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to push for potential trade deal with the US in Washington later to avoid import taxes hitting UK exports.",
      "The higher levels of borrowing has added to growing expectations that Reeves could cut public spending or raise taxes later this year in order to stick to her self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "In response to the figures, Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, reiterated that the chancellor's rules on borrowing were \"non-negotiable\", adding that the government would \"never play fast and loose with the public finances\".",
      "Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the borrowing overshoot \"even before the influence from the tariff chaos is felt\" raised the chances of \"more tax hikes\".",
      "\"Reeves may not be too far away from having to raise money again in the Autumn Budget, by cutting spending and/or raising taxes, to meet her fiscal rules,\" she added.",
      "One of Reeves's main rules for the UK economy is not to borrow money to fund day-to-day spending.",

      "But Reeves is aiming to avoid the import taxes hitting UK exporters by agreeing a trade deal with the US. US Vice-President JD Vance has said there was a \"good chance\" of a trade deal.",
      "On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund, an influential global organisation, forecast that UK growth would be lower than previously expected for 2025 at 1.1%, down from 1.6%.",
      "Governments like to see economic growth as it leads to more jobs and businesses being created, better living standards on average, and ultimately higher income through taxation.",
      "The UK government has made growth its top priority, but the IMF said it would be stifled in part by tariffs on goods entering the US along with rising inflation and borrowing costs.",
      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the government borrowed almost \u00a315bn more than the \u00a3137.3bn expected in the year to March due to increased spending on pay and benefits.",
      "Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said the rise in borrowing was despite the government receiving a \"substantial boost in income\" from taxation.",

      "A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe.",
      "Running for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel.",
      "It's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together.",
      "The project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark.",
      "The facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\".",
      "\"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel.",
      "To make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete.",
      "Most underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France \u2013 burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks.",
      "\"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\"",
      "With a price-tag around \u20ac7.4bn ($8.1bn; \u00a36.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with \u20ac1.3bn from the European Commission.",
      "It's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying.",
      "Once completed, the journey between R\u00f8dbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage.",
      "Bypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers.",
      "\"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\"",
      "Towered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead.",
      "\"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element.",
      "There are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor.",
      "At the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\"",
      "Not only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats.",
      "Next it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision.",
      "\"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\"",
      "Denmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes.",
      "With layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark.",
      "A bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration.",
      "\"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\"",
      "So, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\"",
      "Denmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact.",
      "One such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise.",
      "However in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead.",
      "\"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock.",
      "When the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day.",
      "According to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says.",
      "It's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions.",
      "\"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\""

    "summary": "Why movements in the US dollar have a massive impact internationally - and how it could affect you.",
    "story": [
      "The US dollar has seen big declines in recent months.",
      "Currencies rise and fall all the time but the recent drop in the dollar has been particularly dramatic.",
      "So why has the dollar been falling and why does it matter?",
      "What has happened to the dollar since Trump was elected?",
      "The dollar was rising in the autumn in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election off the back of relatively strong US economic growth, and continued to strengthen after Trump's victory in November on hopes he might extend that trend.",
      "Talk of his trade policy also had an effect, as many investors thought the tariffs that he promised to bring in would push up inflation, forcing the US central bank, the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, or at least not cut them as fast as expected.",
      "The prospect of higher rates in the US makes the dollar more attractive as it means investors will make more money on their cash in dollars compared to other currencies.",
      "But the calculus has shifted in recent months as the details of his tariffs have emerged - often followed by pauses or, in the case of China, extensions - leaving much uncertainty surrounding the impact they will have.",
      "US growth is now widely expected to weaken.",
      "That has had a knock-on impact on the dollar, which has seen steep falls. Trump's attacks on Fed chief Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates also appear to have added pressure to the greenback.",
      "The value of all currencies goes up and down influenced by many factors such as inflation expectations and central bank policies.",
      "But the dollar index, which measures its strength against a set of currencies, has fallen to its lowest level for three years.",
      "US stocks and dollar plunge as Trump attacks Fed chair Powell",
      "Is this unusual?",
      "The dollar is usually seen as a safe investment in troubled times.",
      "So the sharp drops in the currency - as well as the recent sell-off in US government bonds, also generally considered a safe US asset - are unusual.",
      "The fall in the dollar after Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement was \"quite shocking\", says Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange (FX) strategy at Rabobank.",
      "\"For several years, the market's been buying this US growth story, the US stock market's been outperforming other stock markets, and suddenly you had economists thinking tariffs would push the US into recession,\" she says, pointing to the massive sell-off of US stocks, US bonds and the dollar.",
      "That has raised speculation about whether the drop might signal a more far-reaching turn away from the US, as well as away from the dollar.",
      "What does a weaker dollar mean?",
      "The first time ordinary Americans might notice a weaker dollar is when they go abroad, as their money will not go as far. While foreign tourists in the US will find their currency will buy them more.",
      "But movements in the dollar also have a massive impact internationally, more so than swings in other currencies do.",
      "That's because it is the world's primary reserve currency, meaning it is held by central banks around the world in large quantities as part of their foreign exchange reserves. Central banks use US dollars in international transactions, to pay for international debt, or to support domestic exchange rates.",
      "The dollar is also the main currency used in international trade, with around half of world trade invoices done in US dollars, says Jane Foley.",
      "A fall in the dollar means US goods exports become cheaper. But imported goods may become more expensive due to the weaker currency, as well as any direct impact from tariffs.",
      "Many commodities that trade internationally, such as oil and gas, are also priced in dollars. A weaker dollar makes crude oil cheaper for countries that hold other currencies.",
      "What happens if the dollar keeps falling?",
      "In the US a strong dollar has been seen as a symbol of American political might.",
      "The very idea that it might lose its status as the world's reserve currency has been unthinkable.",
      "Ms Foley says that while other currencies may become more important, the dollar won't lose its number one status any time soon, although one Federal Reserve official suggested last year that the US can no longer take this for granted.",
      "Ms Foley thinks the dollar will win back some ground over the next few weeks but will not get back to where it was.",
      "That's because with very significant market moves, there's always the possibility of profit taking. For instance, if investors decide to sell euros while they're trading strongly, that could lead to the euro falling and the dollar rising.",
      "The markets will be watching this week to see if Trump continues his attack on the head of the Federal Reserve. He has called Mr Powell \"a major loser\" and has publicly called for his \"termination\".",
      "If there is pressure on Powell to leave office, the markets will start to wonder about the Fed's credibility, something which is seen as crucial.",
      "\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" says Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown."

      "Growth is now expected to be 1.8% this year, down from the IMF's estimate of 2.7% for the US in January.",
      "The sharp increase in tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a \"significant slowdown\" in global growth, the Fund predicts.",
      "The forecast for the UK has also been cut, with the economy now expected to grow by 1.1% this year.",
      "But the IMF has predicted UK economic growth will be stronger than Germany, France, and Italy.",
      "Inflation in the UK, however, will be the highest in the world's advanced economies, at 3.1% this year, largely due to higher bills, including for energy and water.",
      "The predictions come as top economic policymakers gather in Washington for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank.",
      "IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said the global economy \"still bears significant scars\" from the \"severe shocks of the past four years\".",
      "\"It is now being severely tested once again,\" he added.",
      "On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump said he had \"no intention of firing\" Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell after heavily criticising him.",
      "Concerns that Trump may try to sack Powell sparked a sell-off in markets in recent days.",
      "Trump has made a flurry of announcements on tariffs this year - taxes charged on goods brought into the US from other countries.",
      "In a growing trade war, the US has placed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods, while China has hit back with 125% levies on US products.",
      "The US has also introduced a 10% tax rate on goods from the vast majority of other countries, while pausing much higher rates for dozens of nations for 90 days.",
      "Trump says tariffs will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised, and lead to huge levels of investment in the country.",
      "However, the IMF highlighted the potential negative impact on global trade given that modern supply chains are so interlinked.",
      "Uncertainty around trade policy was a \"major factor\" behind the growth downgrades, Mr Gourinchas said.",
      "\"Faced with increased uncertainty... many firms' initial reaction will be to pause, reduce investment and cut purchases.\"",
      "The IMF predicts the global economy will grow by 2.8% this year, down from its previous forecast of 3.3%, and by 3.0% in 2026.",
      "The downgrade to the US growth forecast was due to greater policy uncertainty, trade tensions and slower than expected consumer spending, the IMF said. Tariffs are also expected to hit growth in 2026.",
      "The IMF said there was now a 40% probability of a US recession this year, higher than its estimate of 25% in October last year.",
      "Earlier on Tuesday, banking group the Institute of International Finance said it expected \"a shallow recession\" in the US later this year, with negative growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2025.",
      "China is expected to grow by 4% this year, down from the IMF's previous estimate of 4.6%.",
      "In the UK, the downward revision reflects the impact of tariffs, higher government borrowing costs, and weaker consumer spending as a result of higher bills and energy costs.",
      "However, the IMF's 2025 prediction for the UK is now close to the 1% growth forecast by the government's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) last month. The IMF expects the UK to grow by 1.4% next year.",
      "Responding to the forecast, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said it showed the UK was still the fastest growing European G7 country due to \"reform which will drive up long-term growth in the UK\".",
      "Reeves added that \"the world has changed\" and she would be in Washington this week \"defending British interests and making the case for free and fair trade\".",
      "However, Mel Stride, the Conservative shadow chancellor, said the IMF outlook was \"a worrying indictment of Labour's economic approach\".",
      "\"The IMF has downgraded the UK's growth forecast, raising serious concerns about the lack of confidence and direction under Labour. They have also revised up significantly their forecast for inflation,\" he said.",

      "Trading cryptocurrency was just a bit of fun for Tzoni Raykov, but losing $1,500 worth to an administrative error has left him with serious concerns about his treatment by the industry.",
      "The oil engineer has held an account with Revolut for several years - using its app to split bills with friends after going out for dinner or drinks. They would pay each other using traditional currency, like the pound sterling or US dollar.",
      "But after seeing the e-money firm advertise its cryptocurrency services, he decided to give it a try.",
      "What Tzoni thought would be a straightforward transfer of cryptocurrency coins has left the Bulgarian national angry and out of pocket.",
      "His experience highlights some of the frustrations people have had using cryptocurrency where many of the customer safeguards which underpin standard online banking transactions, some mandated by law, do not apply.",
      "\"When they treat you like this, it makes you feel like you can't do anything,\" he told BBC News. \"Like you are powerless.\"",
      "What is Bitcoin? Key crypto terms and what they mean",
      "What next for Bitcoin after bursting $100k barrier?",
      "While the cryptocurrency market is dominated by Bitcoin, there is a plethora of other digital currencies, including USDC - which Tzoni had already amassed in a separate crypto account.",
      "His frustrations began in February when he decided to transfer some of his USDC coins to his Revolut account.",
      "As a precaution - which Revolut suggests doing - he first sent 10 of the coins, worth $10. It was a success and the funds were credited to his Revolut account.",
      "Days later he tried to make a larger transfer of what he thought was 1,500 USDC. The transfer was completed but, this time, the funds were not credited to his account.",
      "Tzoni says the problem occurred because Revolut's deposit instructions were unclear.",
      "When you transfer cryptocurrency from one account to another, you have to select a network to send it through - like choosing which courier service to use when sending a parcel.",
      "Revolut's deposit instructions say to transfer USDC to it, you have to use a network called Polygon. In his first, successful, deposit Tzoni selected one called \"Polygon PoS\".",
      "In the second deposit, when he tried to transfer 1,500 USDC, he selected a different network - \"Polygon (bridged)\".",
      "He thought it would work just as well but says instead it caused the coins to be converted into USDC.e - a different cryptocurrency.",
      "This is what Revolut received. The company does not handle USDC.e coins.",
      "After seeing his Revolut account had not been credited with the 1,500 coins, Tzoni contacted the Revolut support team.",
      "In messages seen by BBC News, they told him the issue seemed to be with \"the specific type of Polygon network used, which led to the conversion\".",
      "In another, he was told: \"The app currently specifies 'Polygon' without differentiating between standard and bridged options. I'll note your feedback for future improvements.\"",
      "Tzoni thinks if Revolut's deposit instructions had been more specific, his problem would have been avoided.",
      "When approached by BBC News about this case, Revolut gave a different answer.",
      "The firm said the problem was not because Tzoni had used the wrong Polygon network - which he claimed turned his coins into USDC.e.",
      "The deposit failure was \"not because the network itself had 'converted' the token\", it said, without explaining why its support team had suggested to Tzoni that it was.",
      "Revolut told us the deposit ultimately failed because the USDC.e coins it received were not supported by the company's technology.",
      "It said: \"As is standard industry practice due to the significant technical challenges involved in supporting every combination of token and chain, the recovery of these unsupported assets does not sit within Revolut's scope.\"",
      "It means the 1,500 USDC.e coins have not been credited to Tzoni's account or sent back to him.",
      "'They are waiting for me to give up'",
      "To Tzoni's mind, this isn't acceptable treatment from a company of Revolut's size and reputation, which handles normal banking deposits as well as cryptocurrency, stocks and commodities.",
      "Revolut says it has 10 million users in the UK while last year it was granted a provisional banking licence, paving the way for it to become a fully fledged UK bank.",
      "When using a High Street bank, a mistaken transfer of traditional currency would usually be resolved with the money being reverted back to the customer.",
      "This was established in 2014 in a voluntary code of practice that most UK banks signed up to. There is no such equivalent in the cryptocurrency industry.",
      "After contacting Revolut several times in recent weeks, Tzoni has been told the coins are effectively lost.",
      "\"They are waiting for me to get bored and give up, to accept the money is gone. But I won't,\" Tzoni said, pointing out the coins are in the Revolut system. \"It is ridiculous that they can behave like this.\"",
      "While Tzoni's loss of cryptocurrency is significant to him, the sum is tiny compared with the size of the industry, which has risen sharply in value over the past 18 months.",
      "The global market peaked in value at $3.9tn last December, following the re-election of Donald Trump. Since then it has fallen by $1.1tn, according to tracking website CoinGecko.",
      "Government policies in the US and other countries are also changing to favour the cryptocurrency industry, even though it has suffered several scandals.",
      "FTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency firms, went bankrupt in 2022. Sam Bankman-Fried, its chief executive, was sentenced to 25 years in prison last year for defrauding customers of billions of dollars.",
      "Investigators also found FTX was using QuickBooks, a popular accounting software designed for individuals and small businesses, to manage the money.",
      "John Ray III, a lawyer tasked with recovering funds from FTX for defrauded customers, told a bankruptcy court: \"Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.\"",
      "He later told a congressional hearing: \"Nothing against QuickBooks. It's a very nice tool, just not for a multibillion-dollar company.\"",
      "'More regulation is needed'",
      "A couple of months ago Bybit, the world's second largest cryptocurrency exchange by some estimates, was tricked out of $1.5bn worth of coins by hackers thought to be working for North Korea.",
      "The firm had been using Safe, a free digital storage software popular with individuals who want to store cryptocurrency on their own devices, as part of their business operations.",
      "Following the theft, Bybit's chief executive said they \"should have upgraded and moved away from Safe\" earlier.",
      "One of the problems with cryptocurrency firms, says Prof Mark Button, who researches cybercrime, is they can grow very quickly, which means they don't always keep up with the accounting and security challenges of managing so much money.",
      "\"For me it illustrates that if we are going to be serious about cryptocurrencies in the future\u2026 there needs to be some kind of regulation.\"",
      "In Tzoni's case, it might have been easier for him to get his cryptocurrency back or be compensated if there were laws stating what firms need to do if they are sent a coin they don't handle.",

    "summary": "What is happening with US bonds, why Donald Trump cares and how ordinary Americans could be affected.",
    "story": [
      "Stock markets around the world have been relatively settled this week after a period of chaos, sparked by US trade tariffs.",
      "But investors are still closely watching a part of the market which rarely moves dramatically - the US bond market.",
      "Governments sell bonds - essentially an IOU - to raise money for public spending and in return they pay interest.",
      "Recently, in an extremely rare move the rate the US government had to pay on its bonds rose sharply, while the price of bonds themselves fell.",
      "The volatility suggests investors were losing confidence in the world's biggest economy.",
      "You may think it's too esoteric to bother you, but here's why it matters and how it may change President Trump's mind on tariffs.",
      "What is a government bond?",
      "When a government wants to borrow money, it usually does so by selling bonds - known as \"Treasuries\" in the US -  to investors on financial markets.",
      "Such payments are made over a number of pre-agreed years before a full and final payment is made when the bond \"matures\" - in other words, expires.",
      "Investors who buy bonds are mainly made up of financial institutions, ranging from pension funds to central banks like the Bank of England.",
      "What is happening with US bonds?",
      "Investors buy government bonds because they are seen as a safe place to invest their money. There is little risk a government will not repay the money, especially an economic superpower like the US.",
      "So when the economy is turbulent and investors want to take money out of volatile stocks and shares markets, they usually place that cash in US bonds.",
      "But recently that hasn't happened.",
      "Initially, following the so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement on 2 April when shares fell, investors did appear to flock to US bonds.",
      "However, when the first of these tariffs kicked in on 5 April and Trump doubled down on his policies that weekend, investors began dumping government bonds, sending the interest rate the US government would have to pay to borrow money up sharply.",
      "The so-called yield for US government borrowing over 10 years shot up from 3.9% to 4.5%, while the 30-year yield spiked at almost 5%. Movements of 0.2% in either direction are considered a big deal.",
      "Why the dramatic sell-off? In short, the uncertainty over the impact of tariffs on the US economy led to investors no longer seeing government bonds as such a safe bet, so demanded bigger returns to buy them.",
      "The higher the perceived risk, the higher the yield investors want to compensate for taking it.",
      "How does this affect ordinary Americans?",
      "If the US government is spending more on debt interest repayments, it can affect budgets and public spending as it becomes more costly for the government to sustain itself.",
      "But it can also have a direct impact on households and even more so on businesses.",
      "John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, says when investors charge higher rates to lend the government money, other rates for lending that have more risk attached, such as mortgages, credit cards and car loans, also tend to rise.",
      "Businesses, especially small ones, are likely to be hardest hit by any immediate change in borrowing rates, as most homeowners in the US have fixed-rate deals of between 15 and 30 years. If businesses can't get access to credit, that can halt economic growth and lead to job losses over time.",
      "Mr Canavan adds that banks can become more cautious in lending money, which could impact the US economy.",
      "First-time buyers and those wishing to move home could also face higher costs, he says, which could impact the housing market in the longer term. It's common in the US for small business owners starting out to use the equity in their home as collateral.",
      "Why does Trump care?",
      "Following the introduction of tariffs, Trump urged his nation to \"hang tough\", but it appears the potential threat to jobs and the US economy stopped the president in his tracks.",
      "Following the ructions in the bond markets, he introduced a 90-day pause for the higher tariffs on every country except China. The 10% blanket tariff, however, on all countries remains.",
      "It proved a pressure point for Trump - and now the world knows it.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market sell-off, once the bond market began to weaken too, it was only a matter of time before he folded,\" says Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "According to US media reports, it was Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, inundated with calls from business leaders, who played a key part in swaying Trump.",
      "Is this similar to Liz Truss's mini-Budget?",
      "The bond market reaction has led to comparisons with former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss's infamous mini-Budget of September 2022. The unfunded tax cuts announced then spooked investors, who dumped UK government bonds, resulting in the Bank of England stepping in to buy bonds to save pension funds from collapse.",
      "Some analysts suggested that America's central bank, the US Federal Reserve, might have been forced to step in if the sell-off had worsened.",
      "While bond yields have settled, some might argue the damage has already been done as they remain higher than before the blanket tariffs kicked in.",
      "\"Arguably the most worrying aspect of the [recent] turmoil... is an emerging risk premium in US Treasury bonds and the dollar, akin to what the UK experienced in 2022,\" according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics.",
      "But unless you're a first-time buyer or selling your home, Americans are unlikely to be immediately hit by higher mortgage costs, unlike Brits who were securing new shorter-term fixed deals.",
      "How is China being linked to US bonds?",
      "Since 2010, foreign ownership of US bonds has almost doubled, rising by $3 trillion, according to Deutsche Bank.",
      "Japan holds the most US Treasuries, but China, the US's arch enemy in this global trade war, is the second biggest holder of US government debt globally.",
      "Questions were raised about whether it sparked the debt sell-off in response to being hit with huge tariffs.",
      "However, this is unlikely as any fire sale \"would impoverish China more than it would hurt the US\", according to Capital Economics.",

    "summary": "China sits at the heart of Apple's supply chain - and has benefited hugely from it. Can they break up?",
    "story": [
      "Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.",
      "While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.",
      "Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.",
      "Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.",
      "But the comfort is short-lived.",
      "The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\".",
      "The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.",
      "The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?",
      "How a lifeline became a threat",
      "China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.",
      "Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.",
      "Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.",
      "It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.",
      "As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.",
      "Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.",
      "He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.",
      "Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.",
      "As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".",
      "For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.",
      "Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.",
      "Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.",
      "\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.",
      "The tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?",
      "In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.",
      "But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.",
      "\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"",
      "She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "But many are sceptical of that.",
      "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.",
      "He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.",
      "Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.",
      "\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"",
      "Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".",
      "Challenges ahead",
      "Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.",
      "Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.",
      "\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.",
      "It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.",
      "There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.",
      "And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.",
      "\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.",
      "So what does Apple do now?",
      "The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.",
      "Now that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.",
      "Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.",
      "And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.",
      "Apple has announced a $500bn (\u00a3378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.",
      "Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.",
      "Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.",
      "\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:36:45 GMT",
    "summary": "The temporary measure by the government is aimed at stopping the spread of foot and mouth disease.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government has temporarily banned people from bringing cheese and some meats from the European Union (EU) into the country to stop the spread of foot and mouth disease.",
      "But what does that actually mean in practice - and should you be concerned?",
      "What has been banned?",
      "Pork, beef, lamb, mutton, goat, venison and any other products made from these meats - such as sausages - from the EU have been banned. It also applies to pet food.",
      "In addition, milk and dairy products - like butter, cheese and yoghurt - from the EU have also been prohibited.",
      "It covers items such as sandwiches and cured meats as well as raw meats and milk \"regardless of whether it is packed or packaged or whether it has been bought at duty free\".",
      "However, there are exceptions such as chicken, duck, goose and any other products made from these.",
      "Who does the ban apply to?",
      "The measure is only directed at people arriving in Great Britain - as in, England, Wales or Scotland - from the EU.",
      "It does not apply to Northern Ireland, which has its own measures in place to contain foot and mouth disease.",
      "The ban covers anyone travelling by any mode of transport - whether that's by plane, train, bus or by car.",
      "But it will not be imposed on those arriving to Great Britain from Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, or the Isle of Man.",
      "Are commercially imported cheeses and meats banned too?",
      "The ban only applies to travellers bringing in items personally - not commercial importers such as farmers or shops.",
      "The reason, according to the UK government, is that commercial meat and cheese imports face higher standards than individuals are subjected to.",
      "They must go through heat treatment, which is meant to kill germs, and come with health certificates signed by vets.",
      "How can animals get foot and mouth disease from meat and dairy products?",
      "The disease typically spreads between animals through direct contact. But they can also catch it by eating contaminated meat or dairy products.",
      "Any products of animal origin, like meat and dairy, could be contaminated with foot and mouth disease.",
      "Even if they are for human consumption, if they are thrown away in a way that could come into contact with foraging wildlife or domestic livestock, that presents a risk.",
      "Should I be worried?",
      "Foot and mouth disease is harmless to humans and there are no cases in the UK -  but it is highly contagious for animals.",
      "It affects cattle, sheep, pigs and, according to the government, \"other cloven-hoofed animals such as wild boar, deer, llamas and alpacas\".",
      "Animals that catch it typically come down with a high temperature before developing blisters, usually around the mouth or feet. It can make animals lame and, for the very young, result in fatalities.",
      "How long will the ban last?",
      "The Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs introduced the measure on Saturday, 12 April and did not give an end date.",
      "The BBC understands the ban will stay in place until the government believes there is no significant risk from travellers bringing banned meat and dairy into Great Britain.",
      "Why didn't I know about this?",
      "The government put out a release last Friday ahead of the ban coming into force on Saturday.",
      "It told border control and airlines to make passengers aware of the rules and has rolled out a digital and social media campaign.",
      "Eurostar has also been sending out emails to passengers letting them know about the UK rules.",
      "However, many people who have travelled from the EU to Great Britain since the weekend told the BBC they were unaware of the measure and were not told - with no signs in the airport and no checks carried out.",
      "Anyone travelling should follow the rules.",
      "The government says items could be seized and destroyed at the border and, in serious cases, offenders could be fined up to \u00a35,000 in England.",
      "Can I take meat and milk products from the UK into the EU?",
      "No, travellers are not normally allowed to bring meat and milk products into the EU from the UK for personal use.",
      "This has nothing to do with the latest announcement though - it has been the case since Brexit, with the UK facing the same rules as every other non-EU country.",
      "But there is an exemption for powdered baby milk, baby food, or special foods for humans or animals where there is a medical need.",

      "The retailer said it expects income to dip to \u00a31bn as it continues to invest in lowering grocery prices.",

      "Sainsbury's predicts underlying retail profit will tick down by around \u00a336m over the year.",
      "This, said Bernstein analyst William Woods, gives the supermarket \"wiggle room\" to fight with Tesco and Asda if needed.",

    "summary": "Mortgage experts share their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
    "story": [
      "Mortgage rates are expected to come down over the next year, which could make owning a home a possibility for millions more people.",
      "Thinking about where to start can be a daunting prospect, but there are an increasing number of ways to save up for a deposit, and get a foothold in the housing market.",
      "We spoke to some leading mortgage experts to get their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
      "1. Start saving as soon as you can",
      "The average deposit paid for a first-time buyer is \u00a334,500, according to UK Finance. So the sooner you start saving, the better.",
      "A Lifetime ISA (individual savings account) offers 25% bonuses for those who are saving for a first home. For each \u00a34,000 saved in any given tax year, the government will top it up with an extra \u00a31,000.",
      "Digital mortgage broker Tembo specialises in helping first-time buyers, and has seen a rise in savers starting young.",
      "\"If you maxed out your savings allowance from the age of 18 to 30, you could pick up \u00a322,000 in free bonuses,\" says Tembo chief executive Richard Dana.",
      "\"Family members can contribute too. But beware that the money can only be withdrawn to fund a first-time home purchase up to the value of \u00a3450,000.\"",
      "2. Look at low-deposit mortgage options",
      "Those struggling to raise a deposit have now got a broad range of 95% loan-to-value (LTV) deals available, says David Hollingworth from mortgage brokers London & Country.",
      "In fact, more low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures.",
      "\"Yorkshire Building Society offers a \u00a35,000 deposit mortgage which does what it says on the tin and could offer a mortgage equivalent to as much as 99% of the purchase price,\" says Mr Hollingsworth.",
      "\"Skipton's Track Record mortgage can offer as much as 100% lending for those that can demonstrate a track record of paying rent that exceeds the mortgage payment.\"",
      "However, small deposit mortgages typically offer higher rates, and may not be suitable for many self-employed homebuyers who may struggle to meet the strict eligibility criteria.",
      "3. Explore shared ownership",
      "Shared ownership has been available in England since the 1980s and enables a first-time buyer to own a \"share\" in their home of between 25% and 75% of the value. There are similar schemes available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "You need a small deposit and can take out a mortgage to buy your share and then pay rent to the landlord for the rest.",
      "Over time you can increase the amount of the property you own and reduce rental payments. It's known as \"staircasing\" and the aim is to eventually own your home outright.",
      "\"Although shared ownership is usually seen as an option for younger, first-time buyers, that is not always the case,\" says Laura Gaskell, sales manager at shared ownership specialists Snugg Homes.",
      "\"The average age of a buyer with us is now 48 and we have people who have been homeowners previously. Our advice is to register your interest and regularly check the eligibility criteria.\"",
      "4. Consider an 'income boost' mortgage",
      "The \"Bank of Mum and Dad\" might not be an option for some, but there are ways to get help from family members without borrowing any money at all.",
      "An \"income boost\" mortgage (otherwise known as a Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor mortgage) allows a homebuyer to add up to three family members (or in some cases friends) to their mortgage to increase the amount they can borrow from a lender.",
      "While the \"boosters\" are on the mortgage, they are not owners of the home and therefore the buyer's first-time buyer status is not affected.",
      "\"This is increasingly popular amongst younger first-time buyers who are earlier in their careers and are earning less,\" says Richard Dana from Tembo.",
      "\"It's the primary option for families who want to support their children, but might not have the cash available to gift as a deposit, or want to keep hold of cash savings for their retirement or a rainy day.\"",
      "As buyers will be borrowing more than they would qualify for on their own, they should make sure they can afford the repayments.",
      "The risk for the \"boosters\" is that they are jointly liable for the mortgage in the event the buyer is unable to make repayments.",
      "5. 'Professional' mortgages are available",
      "Many lenders offer \"professional\" mortgages which could enable a buyer working in a regulated or accredited profession - such as doctors, architects and accountants - to borrow up to six times their income.",
      "Specialist lenders also offer deals to particular professions.",
      "For instance, Teachers Building Society works with those in the teaching profession, while Kensington offers a better earnings calculation to NHS staff, police officers, firefighters and teachers.",
      "\"Given that these career profiles are often more secure, Kensington felt it could be more generous in its approach as long as the mortgage will be affordable,\" says David Hollingworth.",
      "\"It can also take account of overtime and income from a second job to help improve the borrowing amount.\"",
      "But he adds: \"It's always still important to shop around. Rates on these mortgages can be a little higher, so taking advice on the best overall fit is important.\"",
      "Stamp duty changes 'will motivate first-time buyers'",
      "'Buying a first home is harder when you're single'",
      "When will interest rates go down again?"

    "summary": "As the trade war continues to escalate, China has hit back at Trump by suspending exports of rare earth minerals.",
    "story": [
      "As the trade war between China and the US escalates, attention has been focused on the increasingly high levels of tit-for-tat tariffs the two countries are imposing on one another.",
      "But slapping reciprocal tariffs on Washington is not the only way Beijing has been able to retaliate.",
      "China has now also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, dealing a major blow to the US.",
      "The move has laid bare how reliant America is on these minerals.",
      "This week, Trump ordered the commerce department to come up with ways to boost US production of critical minerals and cut reliance on imports - an attempt by Washington to reclaim this critical industry.  But why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war?",
      "What are rare earths and what are they used for?",
      "\"Rare earths\" are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.",
      "Most are abundant in nature, but they are known as \"rare\" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.",
      "Although you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like Neodymium, Yttrium and Europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.",
      "For instance, Neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.",
      "Yttrium and Europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours.",
      "\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment.",
      "Rare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies.",
      "What does China control?",
      "China has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals.",
      "The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.",
      "That means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths.",
      "Both the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting.",
      "All rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them.",
      "\"Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,\" says Mr Kruemmer.",
      "But China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn't take place overnight - but rather, is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment.",
      "In a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China's economic reform, famously said: \"The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths\".",
      "\"Beginning in the late 20th century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,\" said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near-monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets.\"",
      "How has China restricted exports of these minerals?",
      "In response to tariffs imposed by Washington, China earlier this month began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as \"heavy\" rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector.",
      "These are less common and are harder to process than \"light\" rare earths, which also makes them more valuable.",
      "From 4 April, all companies now have to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country.",
      "That is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of \"dual use products\".",
      "According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths.",
      "How could this impact the US?",
      "A US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals.",
      "This means that the new restrictions have the ability to hit the US hard.",
      "Heavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets.",
      "A CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals.",
      "It adds that this comes as China \"expands its munitions production and acquires advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States\".",
      "\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial,\" said Mr Kroemmer.",
      "And it's not only in the field of defence.",
      "US manufacturing, which Trump has said he hopes to revive through the imposition of his tariffs, stand to be severely impacted.",
      "\"Manufacturers, particularly in defence and high-tech, face potential shortages and production delays due to halted shipments and limited inventories,\" said Dr Harper.",
      "\"Prices for critical rare earth materials are expected to surge, increasing the immediate costs of components used in a wide range of products, from smartphones to military hardware,\" he says, adding that this could result in potential production slowdowns for affected US companies.",
      "If such a shortage from China persists in the long-run, the US could potentially begin diversifying its supply chains and scaling up its domestic and processing capabilities, though this would still require \"substantial and sustained investment, technological advancements and potentially higher overall costs compared to the previous dependence on China\".",
      "And it's clear this is something already on Trump's mind. This week, he ordered an investigation into the national security risks posed by the US' reliance on such  critical minerals.",
      "\"President Trump recognises that an overreliance on foreign critical minerals and their derivative products could jeopardise US defence capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,\" said the order.",
      "\"Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are essential for national security and economic resilience.\"",
      "China's precious metals the US can't do without",
      "What are 'rare earths' used for?",
      "Can't the US produce its own rare earths?",
      "The US has one operational rare earths mine, but it does not have the capacity to separate heavy rare earths and has to send its ore to China for processing.",
      "There used to be US companies that manufactured rare earth magnets - until the 1980s, the US was in fact the largest producer of rare earths.",
      "But these companies exited the market as China began to dominate in terms of scale and cost.",
      "This is largely believed to be part of why US president Donald Trump is so keen to sign a minerals deal with Ukraine - it wants to reduce dependency on China.",
      "Another place Trump has had his eye on is Greenland - which is endowed with the eighth largest reserves of rare earth elements.",
      "Trump has repeatedly showed interest in taking control of the autonomous Danish dependent territory and has refused to rule out economic or military force to take control of it.",
      "These might have been places that the US could have sourced some of its rare earth exports from, but the adversarial tone Trump has struck with them means the US could be left with very few alternative suppliers.",
      "\"The challenge the U.S. faces is two-fold, on the one hand it has alienated China who provides the monopoly supply of rare earths, and on the other hand it is also antagonising many nations that have previously been friendly collaborators through tariffs and other hostile actions,\" said Dr Harper.",
      "\"Whether they will still prioritise collaboration with America remains to be seen in the turbulent policy environment of this new administration.\""

      "To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest.",
      "Why does the government borrow money?",
      "The government gets most of its income from taxes. For example, workers pay income tax and national insurance, everyone pays VAT on certain goods, and companies pay tax on profits.",
      "It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and that sometimes happens.",
      "But, if it can't, the government covers the gap by raising taxes, cutting spending or borrowing.",
      "Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax.",

      "The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds.",
      "A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.",
      "Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies.",
      "The government sells short and long-term gilts to allow it to borrow money over different time periods, with varying interest rates.",
      "How much is the UK government borrowing?",
      "The amount the government borrows fluctuates from month to month.",
      "For instance, it tends to borrow less in January, when many people pay a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go.",
      "So, it is more helpful to look across a whole year, or the year-to-date.",

      "Borrowing in March alone stood at \u00a316.4bn, which was \u00a32.8bn less than a year earlier.",
      "In the previous full financial year to March 2024, the government borrowed \u00a3131.2bn.",
      "The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently about \u00a32.8 trillion - or \u00a32,800,000,000,000.",
      "That is roughly the same as the value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP.",

      "How much money does the government pay in interest?",
      "The larger the national debt, the more interest the government pays.",
      "That cost was not as great when interest rates were low during the 2010s, but became more noticeable after the Bank of England started raising interest rates in 2021.",
      "The amount of interest the government pays on national debt also varies from month to month.",
      "It was \u00a34.3 billion in March 2025. This was \u00a31.3 billion more than in March 2024, and is the highest March figure since monthly records began in 1997, though only \u00a30.2 billion above the previous record in March 2023.",

      "The increase in long-term interest rates seen in January prompted some economists to warn that the government was \"on course\" to miss its own borrowing targets.",
      "Labour decided to stick to a rule followed by the previous government that the total amount of money owed must have fallen as a proportion of the UK economy in five years' time.",
      "In October's Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves changed the definition of debt that the government would use in the target to enable her to raise more money for investment.",

    "summary": "Mortgage experts share their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
    "story": [
      "Mortgage rates are expected to come down over the next year, which could make owning a home a possibility for millions more people.",
      "Thinking about where to start can be a daunting prospect, but there are an increasing number of ways to save up for a deposit, and get a foothold in the housing market.",
      "We spoke to some leading mortgage experts to get their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
      "1. Start saving as soon as you can",
      "The average deposit paid for a first-time buyer is \u00a334,500, according to UK Finance. So the sooner you start saving, the better.",
      "A Lifetime ISA (individual savings account) offers 25% bonuses for those who are saving for a first home. For each \u00a34,000 saved in any given tax year, the government will top it up with an extra \u00a31,000.",
      "Digital mortgage broker Tembo specialises in helping first-time buyers, and has seen a rise in savers starting young.",
      "\"If you maxed out your savings allowance from the age of 18 to 30, you could pick up \u00a322,000 in free bonuses,\" says Tembo chief executive Richard Dana.",
      "\"Family members can contribute too. But beware that the money can only be withdrawn to fund a first-time home purchase up to the value of \u00a3450,000.\"",
      "2. Look at low-deposit mortgage options",
      "Those struggling to raise a deposit have now got a broad range of 95% loan-to-value (LTV) deals available, says David Hollingworth from mortgage brokers London & Country.",
      "In fact, more low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures.",
      "\"Yorkshire Building Society offers a \u00a35,000 deposit mortgage which does what it says on the tin and could offer a mortgage equivalent to as much as 99% of the purchase price,\" says Mr Hollingsworth.",
      "\"Skipton's Track Record mortgage can offer as much as 100% lending for those that can demonstrate a track record of paying rent that exceeds the mortgage payment.\"",
      "However, small deposit mortgages typically offer higher rates, and may not be suitable for many self-employed homebuyers who may struggle to meet the strict eligibility criteria.",
      "3. Explore shared ownership",
      "Shared ownership has been available in England since the 1980s and enables a first-time buyer to own a \"share\" in their home of between 25% and 75% of the value. There are similar schemes available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "You need a small deposit and can take out a mortgage to buy your share and then pay rent to the landlord for the rest.",
      "Over time you can increase the amount of the property you own and reduce rental payments. It's known as \"staircasing\" and the aim is to eventually own your home outright.",
      "\"Although shared ownership is usually seen as an option for younger, first-time buyers, that is not always the case,\" says Laura Gaskell, sales manager at shared ownership specialists Snugg Homes.",
      "\"The average age of a buyer with us is now 48 and we have people who have been homeowners previously. Our advice is to register your interest and regularly check the eligibility criteria.\"",
      "4. Consider an 'income boost' mortgage",
      "The \"Bank of Mum and Dad\" might not be an option for some, but there are ways to get help from family members without borrowing any money at all.",
      "An \"income boost\" mortgage (otherwise known as a Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor mortgage) allows a homebuyer to add up to three family members (or in some cases friends) to their mortgage to increase the amount they can borrow from a lender.",
      "While the \"boosters\" are on the mortgage, they are not owners of the home and therefore the buyer's first-time buyer status is not affected.",
      "\"This is increasingly popular amongst younger first-time buyers who are earlier in their careers and are earning less,\" says Richard Dana from Tembo.",
      "\"It's the primary option for families who want to support their children, but might not have the cash available to gift as a deposit, or want to keep hold of cash savings for their retirement or a rainy day.\"",
      "As buyers will be borrowing more than they would qualify for on their own, they should make sure they can afford the repayments.",
      "The risk for the \"boosters\" is that they are jointly liable for the mortgage in the event the buyer is unable to make repayments.",
      "5. 'Professional' mortgages are available",
      "Many lenders offer \"professional\" mortgages which could enable a buyer working in a regulated or accredited profession - such as doctors, architects and accountants - to borrow up to six times their income.",
      "Specialist lenders also offer deals to particular professions.",
      "For instance, Teachers Building Society works with those in the teaching profession, while Kensington offers a better earnings calculation to NHS staff, police officers, firefighters and teachers.",
      "\"Given that these career profiles are often more secure, Kensington felt it could be more generous in its approach as long as the mortgage will be affordable,\" says David Hollingworth.",
      "\"It can also take account of overtime and income from a second job to help improve the borrowing amount.\"",
      "But he adds: \"It's always still important to shop around. Rates on these mortgages can be a little higher, so taking advice on the best overall fit is important.\"",

From September, eligible working parents will be able to access 30 hours of childcare per week during term-time (for 38 weeks), paid for by the government, for their children from the age of nine months to four.",
      "Only it hasn't been the panacea that many had hoped, and there are a number of hurdles still to overcome.",
      "Parents say nursery places are increasingly difficult to find. And experts are concerned that a gap is widening between those who are eligible for the funded hours, and those who are missing out on the childcare revolution. So why has this challenge been too great for successive governments to solve?",
      "England's childcare deserts",
      "Over the last five years, access to childcare in England has declined. At the same time demand is increasing.",
      "The government estimates that by September, an additional 70,000 extra places and 35,000 staff will be needed to cope with the influx of families wanting spaces and more hours.",
      "A report by the regulator and inspector of early years, Ofsted, found that deprived areas that have lower than average incomes are disproportionately affected by persistently low access to childcare.",
      "Doncaster is a \"childcare desert\", defined as an area where parents have faced low childcare accessibility over time. There are 17 childcare places there for every 100 children.",
      "For Jordan Parker from Doncaster, the funded hours have been an \"absolute godsend\". Her two-year-old daughter Riley goes to nursery one day a week. Finding a place however has been increasing tricky.",
      "\"I have to set off at 5am for work and her Dad steps in for some mornings but he's a farmer so he works long hours, seven days a week, so I don't think we'd manage without family help.\"",
      "Olena Mykhaylyk says she put her daughter on the nursery list the moment she found out she was pregnant. \"It's crazy you have to be thinking that far ahead,\" she says.",
      "\"It's great the government offers these hours but if you can't use them, they become negligible.\"",
      "Childcare places increased by 44,400 between 2023 and 2024, but from September, many families will look to increase nursery hours as the number they are eligible for doubles.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has conceded that parents in some areas may not be able to get their first choice childcare place in September. \"It is no secret that childcare in England has often been expensive and hard to find,\" Phillipson has previously said.",
      "\"This issue is historic, and in some places it is far worse than in others.\"",
      "Are school-based nurseries the solution?",
      "One of Labour's lead pledges last year was to create 100,000 additional childcare places and more than 3,000 new nurseries in schools.",
      "Analysis by think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), says it will increase the share of school-based provision from around 22% to 27% of the market, which is \"not nothing\", says the IFS's associate director Christine Farquharson. But she adds that is \"not going to be transformational\".",
      "It will also apply more to older children because it is easier for school-based settings to cater for three-year-olds, she adds.",
      "The Department for Education (DfE) said 1,200 schools had approached them about opening one. But that is still short of the number needed.",
      "Some 300 nursery schools were approved for funding in this first round, which the government says will create 6,000 new places in total. Of these, 4,000 will open in September.",
      "Avnee Morjaria, associate director at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), who worked for the DfE when the expansion programme was being developed, says the school-based nursery programme is a \"glimmer of hope\".",
      "\"If they are delivered and delivered well, I think that has got a lot of potential. It just makes sense in terms of communities and schools and nurseries being the hub of their communities to have that kind of policy.\"",
      "But for now, the system is still heavily reliant on private nurseries.",
      "Private nurseries are facing 'huge increases'",
      "There are more than 20,000 private and voluntary nurseries in the UK, which provide most early years places, but many are unhappy with the current situation and some are struggling to make the funded hours scheme work.",
      "Purnima Tanuku, executive chair of National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), says most providers are facing \"huge increases\" in their operating costs from April, including statutory wage increases, changes to national insurance contributions and rising utility bills.",
      "The government says it is increasing its funding for all pre-school children to reflect the wage increases and is providing an additional \u00a375 million grant for nurseries to expand.",
      "But some nurseries say the money they receive for three-and-four-year olds is not enough and they can no longer subsidise it with the money parents pay for younger children - as from September the state will be paying for 80% of childcare in England.",
      "The DfE is also clamping down on nurseries charging for extras, such as meals, snacks and nappies. Its updated guidance says that nurseries are entitled to ask parents to pay for such extras - but these charges must be clear and are voluntary.",
      "This is causing \"enormous stress,\" claims Ms Tanuku.",
      "\"We can't give out meals for free\" one nursery owner told me, \"we just don't know how this is going to work\".",
      "Some nurseries have threatened to pull out of the scheme altogether.",
      "But Phillipson says that \"despite the inherited challenges\", they are pressing ahead \"with the investment and leadership needed to support families and make sure that every child, regardless of background, can access the high-quality early education they deserve\".",
      "In the meantime, local authority-run nurseries are continuing their long term decline. The BBC has found that 23 council-run nurseries, 16 Sure Start centres and 12 maintained nursery schools, which offer funded hours, are either under review, being privatised or in the process of closing across England.",
      "Staffing was one of the main reasons given. Finding suitable trained staff remains a real problem for the sector.",
      "Working families and eligibility",
      "The cost of childcare in the UK remains one of the highest in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, for many parents who cannot access the free hours.",
      "To qualify for the new hours, all adults in a household must be working and earn more than \u00a39,518 but less than \u00a3100,000 per year.",
      "David from London was devastated to find out that he and his wife were not eligible for the free hours. His wife is retraining to be an occupational therapist so they aren't classed as a \"working family\". And London and the East of England have the highest childcare costs in England.",
      "\"We just assumed we were eligible and didn't think for a second we wouldn't be,\" he says. \"It's just the unfairness of it\u2026 it seems to be a huge oversight.",
      "\"The NHS does offer a bursary but we are having to use our savings and are paying \u00a320,000 a year now on childcare. It's a huge disincentive to retraining and to a lot of people it would be prohibitive.\"",
      "The government says there is a range of support for students in further or higher education.",
      "Coram Family and Childcare's annual report, which looks at the cost of childcare, warned that families who aren't eligible, are not in work, or who do not earn enough to be eligible are now paying an average of around \u00a35,000 a year more than families who do have access, for a part-time place for a child under two.",
      "This raises questions, according to the report, about whether disadvantaged children have the same opportunities as their more affluent peers.",
      "Research by IPPR with Save the Children found that the childcare expansion is at risk of not delivering for those families. Only a third of the poorest families use formal childcare, compared to almost three quarters of the highest earning households.",
      "\"The government is in a really tough spot,\" says Ms Morjaria. \"They have this kind of legacy policy that the Conservative government have chosen to fund and it clearly leaves out a section of young children and gives access to those with working families.",
      "\"Is it a gap widening policy? Of course it is, particularly where you think about early childcare as early education, because there is a really substantial proportion of young children not receiving that.\"",
      "Question of child development",
      "The government's other ambition is for 75% of children to reach a \"good level of development\" at the end of reception, by 2028. (This includes skills like being able to follow instructions in maths and literacy.)",
      "The figure was 67.7% in 2023 to 2024. Phillipson has said \"giving every child the best start in life is my top priority, and integral to our mission to ensure tens of thousands more children are school ready every year\".",
      "The poorest children have access to 15 hours a week of free childcare during term-time when they are two, but children of working parents will have access to 30 hours from nine months.",
      "\"That's quite difficult\", says Ms Farquharson. \"It is that disadvantaged group that's precisely those most vulnerable children [who] you want to target and support.\"",
      "In the Shirecliffe area of Sheffield, Meadows Nursery opened during the pandemic in joint venture with the local school, Sheffield Hallam University and charity, Save the Children.",
      "The idea was to help children who were already behind and give parents access to spaces. \"A private nursery would not have opened here in a million years\", claims Claire Carroll, who is head of nurseries at the university.",
      "Most of the children in the 40-place setting are two and three, and receive 15 hours a week of free childcare. \"We find many of them haven't reached their physical milestones,\" she says.",
      "\"They might live in a one bedroom flat with six people in it and no balcony, they haven't got a garden to run around in and the local parks are run down and not necessarily safe.\"",
      "She believes that it is vital to give this group of children more access to free childcare.",
      "The Dfe has announced \"the largest ever uplift to the early years pupil premium, increasing the rate by over 45%\", so the most disadvantaged children are accessing the high-quality early years education they need, a spokesperson said.",
      "A system under strain",
      "The government is doubling the amount it spends on childcare to help parents back into the workplace. By 2026, it will cost around \u00a38bn. But the system is under strain.",
      "What it needs is the right staff and enough places to make it work. Helping children reach a good level of development is also vital, according to many of those experts.",
      "Phillipson has been clear: \"every child, regardless of background\" should be able to access high-quality early education.",
      "It remains to be seen how the system will cope from September.",
      "However Farquharson believes the government's dual aims \u2013 around growth and child development - are trying to solve different problems.",
      "\"We're doubling the amount that we spend on free childcare in England,\" she warns, \"[and] when you make that kind of a policy commitment, there's always going to be a risk of unintended consequences.\"",

      "\"At a time when school budgets are already stretched, most can ill-afford to subsidise this shortfall.\"",

      "Exam season is around the corner for GCSE, BTec and A-level students, as well as those sitting National 5s, Highers and Advanced Highers in Scotland.",
      "It's a time of life that is remembered forever, and the run-up to it can bring stress and strain to students and families up and down the country.",
      "So how do you get through it, and what can parents and carers to do help?",
      "Meet the Jolleys, a family-of-five from Essex.",
      "Dad Steve, 48, is head of sixth form at The FitzWimarc school in Rayleigh, where he helped me through my own A-levels back in 2010.",
      "Eldest daughter Emma is 19 and studying criminology at Bristol University, but says she found A-level revision overwhelming.",
      "Brother Ben, 18, loves maths and physics and says he found studying for his GCSE exams came more easily than for his sister - but he says he's working harder for his A-levels this summer.",
      "Then there's younger sister Jess, who's 15. She loves PE and art, and wants to go to basketball college in September after doing her GCSEs.",
      "One family, three very different children. So how do they manage exam stress? And does having a teacher as a parent help?",
      "1. Open up the conversation",
      "\"I was very overwhelmed and I didn't want to do it,\" says Emma, thinking back to her A-level revision last year.",
      "She recently got diagnosed with ADHD - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder - which has helped her understand why she found her A-level revision period so difficult.",
      "Emma says she sometimes finds it hard to focus until a deadline is drawing closer.",
      "\"I need the pressure - but I also hate it because I get so stressed and so burnt out so easily,\" she says.",
      "Emma also says she sometimes struggled to get started with revision - even though she wanted to do it - because of how her ADHD affects her ability to start tasks, and organise revision sessions into manageable chunks.",
      "\"I think there's a lot of shame and guilt, because I thought I was being lazy,\" she says. \"You feel really rubbish about yourself. Then when I get really overwhelmed I get headaches.\"",
      "Emma says her dad helped her to draw up a study plan, and to keep her on track when she didn't want to revise.",
      "\"I have very strong memories of Emma sitting at this kitchen table crying her eyes out, getting really, really stressed about revision,\" says dad Steve.",
      "\"And us kind of saying: 'OK that's fine, you need to take a break. But tomorrow you need to go again'.\"",
      "Developing resilience, digging deep and trying again after a bad day are things Steve says Emma did brilliantly while finding A-level revision overwhelming.",
      "\"As a parent, you don't want your kids to go through things that upset them,\" he adds. \"But actually where this is concerned, you kind of have to keep going.\"",
      "So what can parents and carers do?",
      "Talking about your feelings can be tough, but parenting expert Stevie Goulding, from the charity Young Minds, suggests keeping the lines of communication open all the way through the exam period, and making sure you're ready to listen when they're ready to talk.",
      "\"Anxiety gets magnified when young people are under further strain and stress,\" she says.",
      "\"Really recognise and reflect: 'I've noticed you've not been sleeping or eating as much', speaking observations into existence, and making sure there's a lot of reassurance.\"",
      "Listen here to 5 Minute On how to deal with revision stress on BBC Sounds",
      "2. Be creative",
      "There's no escaping it, revision can be really boring.",
      "\"I absolutely hate just sitting down with a laptop or book and just working,\" says Ben. \"But I think it's the best way for information to get into me.\"",
      "His GCSE results comprised mostly of the top grades of 7s, 8s and 9s. He loves maths and physics - something his sisters find hard to understand.",
      "He's sitting A-levels this summer, before taking a year out to decide between an apprenticeship or university.",
      "He and older sister Emma both say that doing past papers and applying their revision to the questions has really helped with their study in the past.",
      "\"If I'm not doing questions to apply it, it just doesn't go in,\" Ben says.",
      "But what works for one student may not work for others, and expert Stevie suggests that thinking creatively about how your child can revise is a good idea - think flashcards, mind maps or even YouTube videos.",
      "\"I love flash cards - they're so easy and quick,\" says youngest daughter Jess.",
      "\"It also means we can get involved as well,\" adds dad Steve, explaining that parents can help to test their children on them.",
      "3. Stay connected to what you love",
      "When we're stressed, it can be tempting to push aside time for fun and relaxation - but it's actually really important in helping us to perform well in exams, Stevie says.",
      "\"We really need to look after our brains. It's really important to get the balance.\"",
      "For Emma, reading or walks with her mum, dad and their dog Maisie was important time to carve out during A-levels.",
      "It's basketball for Jess, who is worried that her current knee injury means she won't be able to play to relax during her GCSE exams.",
      "\"Now I just come home and nap,\" she says.",
      "She says she's feeling the pressure with her GCSE grades, as not only does she need them for basketball college here, but her dreams of basketball college in the US for university afterwards rely on them too.",
      "Their brother Ben enjoys playing on his Xbox with friends, but says he drags himself back downstairs to do work when he realises he has been ignoring his revision a little too long.",
      "As a lot of exams rely on memory, expert Stevie says that staying hydrated, eating healthily, exercising, and having time to do the things we love can help us look after our brains.",
      "Time with your favourite TV show or even a scroll through TikTok can also help to find that balance.",
      "4. Avoid distractions",
      "You can't have too much of a good thing.",
      "Phones can help us to stay connected to friends and family during tough times, but they can also be distracting.",
      "\"I have to hide my phone underneath books or behind my laptop,\" says Emma. \"If I see it, I'll just go on it.\"",
      "When asked how she will avoid the distraction of her phone during her GCSE exams, younger sister Jess says she \"hasn't worked that one out yet\".",
      "Dad Steve has offered to take it away - if Jess wants him to - in order to help her focus.",
      "\"I don't think anyone is going to learn if they're being forced to sit in a room with someone standing over them, or with the threat of: 'We're going to take your phone away,'\" he says.",

      "5. Validate worries and be reassuring",
      "Sometimes it can be tempting to say to people: \"Don't worry, it'll be fine.\"",
      "But that can invalidate their feelings, says expert Stevie.",
      "\"We're all guilty of saying it and it comes often from a very good place,\" she says.",
      "\"But for that young person there is a very valid worry there.\"",
      "Instead, she suggests acknowledging the worry, and saying something like: \"I can absolutely hear that you are worried, and it's completely natural in exams, but you've put so much time and energy into revision.",
      "\"You've worked so hard and whatever happens, we'll be here to support you.\"",
      "What about when it all goes wrong?",
      "\"I think when things are getting tough, just step away from it,\" says teacher and dad Steve.",
      "\"Staying healthy - mentally healthy and physically healthy - has to be the most important thing.\"",
      "When tensions are high at home around revision and exams, arguments may happen. Stevie from Young Minds says that walking away and having a cooling off period is essential.",
      "\"Once people have cooled down, you can reflect, say that you understand why they are feeling so frustrated, and ask if there's anything you can do to support them.\"",
      "And when it's all over?",
      "\"I think something we'd definitely say as teachers is that it's not a good idea to come out of an exam and stand in a big group of people and hear what everyone else wrote,\" says Steve.",
      "And his daughter Emma agrees.",
      "\"I just walked out by myself, got my bag and went home,\" she says. \"I was like, 'I'm not ruining this, goodbye!'\"",
      "\"It's just a great feeling of relief after you've done the exam,\" adds Ben.",
      "With exams around the corner, the Jolleys are also keeping an eye on what they have to look forward to after it's all finished.",
      "Trips to Malta, Croatia and Magaluf are on the horizon, as well as a school prom.",
      "They just need to get through those exams first.",

      "\"I hated having to talk about it in conjunction with the Grammys. It didn't deserve anything and I never want to think about him again.\"",

      "Their work looks at themes including \"the constructed self through the lens of rudeness\" and rudeboy culture, a Jamaican subculture.",
      "The jury said they were \"struck by the artist's ability to express concerns around belonging and identity\".",
      "Mohammed Sami hails from Baghdad and his work draws on his life and experiences during the Iraq war and as a refugee in Sweden.",
      "The artist is recognised for solo exhibition After the Storm at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, and the jury were impressed by his \"powerful representation\" of war and exile.",
      "His large-scale paintings explore memory and loss, layering patterns and colours to create \"haunting, dreamlike scenes\".",
      "Zadie Xa comes from Vancouver, Canada, and her work is inspired by her Korean heritage and the importance of shamanic beliefs.",
      "Interweaving paintings, murals, traditional patchwork textiles and 650 brass bells that make harmonised sounds inspired by Korean shamanic ritual bells, Xa's art focuses on the sea as \"a spiritual realm to explore traditions and folklore, speaking to a multitude of cultures\".",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 23:04:10 GMT",
    "summary": "The presenter is stepping down from the football show, but will still host World Cup and FA Cup coverage.",
    "story": [
      "Gary Lineker has said he believes the BBC wanted him to leave Match of the Day as he was negotiating a new contract last year.",
      "The presenter and the BBC jointly announced in November that he would be stepping down from the flagship football programme, although he will still host World Cup and FA Cup coverage.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Amol Rajan why he would choose to leave given his successful tenure, Lineker said: \"Well, perhaps they want me to leave. There was the sense of that.\"",
      "The BBC didn't comment on that suggestion, but at the time Lineker's exit was announced, the corporation's director of sport described him as a \"world-class presenter\".",
      "However, the BBC noted in the same statement that Match of the Day \"continually evolves for changing viewing habits\".",
      "A new trio of presenters - Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan - was announced in January.",
      "Reflecting on his departure from Match of the Day, Lineker told Rajan: \"It's time. I've done it for a long time, it's been brilliant.\"",
      "However, asked why he'd want to leave when the ratings were still high and it was a job Lineker still enjoyed, the former footballer said he \"had the sense\" the BBC had wanted him to step down.",
      "\"I always wanted one more contract, and I was umm-ing and ahh-ing about whether to do three years [more],\" Lineker explained.",
      "But, he continued, the matter of how long to sign for was complicated by the cycle of broadcasting rights for matches.",
      "\"In the end, I think there was a feeling that, because it was a new rights period, it was a chance to change the programme,\" he said.",
      "\"I think it was their preference that I didn't do Match of the Day for one more year, so they could bring in new people. So it's slightly unusual that I would do the FA Cup and the World Cup, but to be honest, it's a scenario that suits me perfectly.\"",
      "Lineker added that he was pleased his football podcasts had been picked up by BBC Sounds as part of a deal with the corporation.",
      "BBC suspension",
      "Lineker was also asked about comments he posted on social media in March 2023, criticising the then-government's immigration policy.",
      "The remarks led to his suspension from the BBC, prompting other sports presenters to down tools in solidarity, something Lineker said he felt \"moved\" by.",
      "Reflecting on his tweets, Lineker said he did not regret taking the position he did, but that he would not do it again because of the \"damage\" it did to the BBC.",
      "\"I don't regret saying them publicly, because I was right - what I said, it was accurate - so not at all in that sense.",
      "\"Would I, in hindsight, do it again? No I wouldn't, because of all the nonsense that came with it... It was a ridiculous overreaction that was just a reply to someone that was being very rude. And I wasn't particularly rude back.\"",
      "He continued: \"But I wouldn't do it again because of all the kerfuffle that followed, and I love the BBC, and I didn't like the damage that it did to the BBC... But do I regret it and do I think it was the wrong thing to do? No.\"",
      "The row erupted when Lineker called a government asylum policy \"immeasurably cruel\", and said a video promoting it used language that was \"not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\".",
      "The home secretary at the time, Suella Braverman, who appeared in the video, called his criticism \"offensive\" and \"lazy\", while Downing Street said it was \"not acceptable\".",
      "Lineker's post reignited the debate about the BBC's impartiality guidance on social media and how it applied to presenters.",
      "While staff working in news and current affairs are expected to remain impartial on social platforms, there had been questions over how much the rules extended to BBC personalities in other areas such as entertainment and sport.",
      "Lineker argued that the previous set of rules \"were for people in news and current affairs\".",
      "\"They have subsequently changed,\" he acknowledged. \"But that left people like me, who has always given his honest opinions about things, then they suddenly changed them and you have to go, 'Oh, I've got to be impartial now'. It doesn't make any sense.\"",
      "He added: \"I've always been strong on humanitarian issues and always will be, and that's me.\"",
      "Lineker said that, following his tweets, \"the goalposts were massively moved because it was never an issue until, suddenly, this point\".",
      "The BBC updated its social media guidance in 2023 following a review that was commissioned in the wake of the fallout over Lineker's tweets.",
      "The corporation said presenters of flagship programmes, such as Match of the Day, \"carry a particular responsibility to respect the BBC's impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC\".",
      "Asked if he understood that his comments gave ammunition to the BBC's critics, Lineker said: \"Yes of course, I understand that, but does it make it wrong what I did? I don't think so. Would I do it if I knew what would've happened and transpired? Of course I wouldn't.\"",
      "Gaza doc",
      "Lineker hit the headlines again recently when he, along with 500 other high-profile figures, signed an open later urging the BBC to reinstate a documentary about Gaza to iPlayer.",
      "The documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, was pulled from the streaming service in February after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "Lineker told Rajan he would \"100%\" support the documentary being made available again, arguing: \"I think you let people make their own minds up. We're adults. We're allowed to see things like that. It's incredibly moving.\"",
      "He added that, although the 13-year-old was narrating the programme, the script had \"not been written by [the child], it's been written by the people who produced the show\".",
      "\"I think [the BBC] just capitulated to lobbying that they get a lot,\" he said.",
      "After concerns were raised, the BBC took down the programme while it carried out further due diligence. The matter is currently still being investigated by the corporation.",
      "The BBC said it had identified serious flaws in the making of the documentary. The BBC board said the mistakes were \"significant and damaging\".",
      "Gambling in sport",
      "In the wide-ranging interview, which will be broadcast on Tuesday, Lineker also discussed his footballing career, his son's leukemia battle as a baby, and his views on gambling sponsorship in sports.",
      "Lineker said the football industry should rethink its responsibility when it comes to taking money from gambling firms.",
      "\"I know people [for whom] it becomes an addiction, it can completely destroy their lives,\" he said.",
      "\"There's talk about taking [logos] off the shirts, but you see it on the boards around the ground everywhere.",
      "\"I think football needs a long, hard look at itself about that, I really do.\"",
      "On top of his presenting roles, Lineker is also the co-founder of Goalhanger Podcasts, which make the successful The Rest is History series and its spin-offs about Politics, Football, Entertainment and Money.",
      "The 64-year-old indicated to Rajan his next career move \"won't be more telly\", adding: \"I think I'll step back from that now.",
      "\"I think I'll probably focus more on the podcast world, because it's such a fun business and it's just been so incredible.\"",

      "The 32-year-old died in January, with the family later announcing the cause of death as a cardiac arrest caused by taking ketamine.",

      "Police confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death, and a post-mortem examination revealed an \"unnatural cause of death.\"",
      "A full inquest is scheduled for June 30. But in March, the family told BBC News that the star died from cardiac arrest caused by the effects of taking ketamine.",
      "Since making the announcement, they've been working with substance abuse charity Adferiad to raise awareness and tackle stigma around the drug, something Chanel says is an \"important step\" in those facing addiction.",
      "\"It's hard for me because I think if that stigma wasn't there, would my brother have sought the help he needed?\" she says.",
      "\"To think that if we'd known, or if he'd have felt able to talk and really reach out for the help that was needed, the outcome could've been different.",
      "\"That's why we've shared James's story.\"",
      "Chanel and her family are also campaigning for the government to re-classify ketamine from its current status as a Class B drug to Class A, which would put it in the same category as heroin and cocaine.",
      "\"There's a portion of younger people that maybe look at that classification and think it's less harmful than other drugs,\" she says.",

      "\"We will not hesitate to act when the ACMD reports back, and in the meantime, we will continue to work across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use and stop those who profit from its supply.\"",
      "Chanel said it had been difficult to share the information about how James had passed away but that the family \"talked about what we can do\".",

      "By Tom Richardson, Newsbeat reporter",
      "Dark fantasy Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, out Thursday for PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Game Pass, quite literally caught people's eyes when it was first revealed at last year's Summer Game Fest.",
      "As video games go, it's a stunner, with gorgeous art direction heavily inspired by France's 19th century Belle \u00c9poque era.",
      "Players control a crew of characters on a quest to destroy the Paintress \u2013 a being who emerges once a year and scrawls a number onto a monolith. If someone's age matches the digits, they die (hence the 33 in the title).",
      "Somehow, the 30-person team at French developer Sandfall Interactive has also managed to attract some top-tier acting talent to the role-playing game (RPG) project, including Daredevil's Charlie Cox, Gollum actor Andy Serkis, Final Fantasy XVI's Ben Starr and Baldur's Gate 3's Jennifer English.",
      "But the thing that's arguably generated most excitement is the game's focus on old-school turn-based combat. It was a staple of classic 1990s and early 2000s RPG series such as Final Fantasy that's fallen out of fashion in the blockbuster space of late. If the studio sticks the landing with their debut title, expect to hear about Expedition 33 when Game of the Year season rolls around.",
      "If that doesn't take your fancy, video game adaptation Until Dawn is out in cinemas on Friday. Passionate fans of the 2015 \"interactive horror movie\" were concerned when the first trailer revealed the film's makers had swapped the game's trademark choose-your-own-adventure device for a Happy Death Day-style time loop.",

      "It was the brainchild of Mike Taylor, a manager at the Forestry Commission, now  Forestry England, who had a \"strong passion\" for music and the outdoors.",
      "In the 24 years since, Forest Live has become a mainstay of the music scene, with stars like Ed Sheeran, Massive Attack, Blondie, Madness and the Beach Boys performing among the nation's trees.",
      "This year's gigs will be held in June at Cannock Chase Forest in Staffordshire, Delamere Forest in Cheshire, Westonbirt Arboretum in Gloucestershire and High Lodge, Thetford Forest in Suffolk.",
      "Among the 2025 performers, which vary from venue to venue, are Sting, Snow Patrol, Gary Barlow, Nile Rodgers & CHIC, Rag'n'Bone Man and James.",

      "\"It's a really challenging environment and requires a big transformation,\" he said.",
      "\"The strengths and uniqueness of our sites are also what brings the greatest challenges.\"",
      "Getting people to the sites quickly and safely presented difficulties, Mr Jones said, as well as transporting and setting up the \"considerable\" infrastructure needed.",
      "\"It requires an enormous amount of planning by an incredibly skilled team to pull it all off,\" Mr Jones said.",
      "Then there's the impact on the forests themselves \u2013 home to a vast array of animal and plant life, described by Mr Jones as a \"constant consideration\" for Forestry England.",
      "He said the organisation made use of its in-house experts, who advise the teams on how to minimise impact on the environment.",
      "\"It would be counter-intuitive to present these concerts to protect and preserve the forest environments but do damage to them with the presentations themselves,\" he said.",
      "\"Our sites are home to incredible wildlife and plant life and the concerts are presented to raise funds for the protection and conservation of the nation's forests, so we must ensure that the concert operation does nothing to disturb the natural surroundings.\"",
      "Constructing the stages takes a team of about 50 people, which will grow to roughly 250 during show days.",
      "With capacities at the venues ranging from 8,000 to 10,000 concert-goers, Mr Jones said working out entry and exit points for traffic, as well as emergency access, can prove challenging.",
      "\"We must ensure everyone can get to and from the rural settings, so we set our capacities in line with that,\" he said.",
      "Then there's the English weather, with forests particularly vulnerable to extreme conditions like high winds and thunderstorms.",
      "Mr Jones said Forestry England was always \"alive to the dangers\" of natural challenges and aware of what it needed to do to protect the public.",
      "\"High structures along with the trees are susceptible to extreme weather events, so we must be reactive to forecasts and be prepared to cancel a show and issue refunds if there is any danger to the public,\" he said.",
      "Tickets for the concerts start at between \u00a350 and \u00a360, with all money raised going towards maintaining forests across the country, contributing towards Forestry England's efforts to plant 7m trees a year.",
      "\"The experience is one of complete disconnect from the pace and noise of modern life - and connection with music, nature and a sea of like-minded concert-goers,\" Mr Jones said.",
      "\"By attending a concert, you are also investing in the future of these incredible spaces, as the funds raised go towards preserving the nation's forests for generations to come.\"",

      "\"The whole experience [on the show] kind of opened my eyes to real travel,\" Watts tells us over a video call from Portugal, while taking a break from refereeing a football match.",
      "\"I think there are definitely two different types of travel that we're used to in the UK; shallow travel, as I'd call it, where you go on holiday and you see what you want to see and you stay within your comfort zone or hotel.",
      "\"And then I'd say there's real authentic travel whereby you see the world as it actually is.",
      "\"And I've just learned that I actually much prefer the authenticity of places... rather than the weather.\"",
      "Watts's main advice for readers with a similar wanderlust is to consider travelling \"further afield\".",
      "\"Flights to Spain in the summer might be \u00a3300 return, but you are going to be paying extremely high prices for food, accommodation and things like that,\" he notes.",
      "\"Whereas, actually, if you go a little bit further afield, if you try Malaysia, Thailand, even Brazil, for sure the flights might be \u00a3600-700 but when you're actually there, you're spending \u00a320-25 a day maximum.\"",
      "He adds: \"You're helping local people and you're trying something new.\"",

      "He acknowledges that it's not for everyone, and that some people prefer to be away with friends and family, but he wants to encourage would-be travellers to \"throw yourself in\", responsibly.",
      "\"I don't do things that would put me in danger because I think I have a responsibility to the people that follow me,\" he says.",

      "\"That was about as wacky as it got.\"",
      "Bucket list",

      "\"It's the least visited country in the world,\" he explains.",
      "\"Only 1,500 people go there every year. It's very difficult to get to, very expensive to get to.\"",
      "As well as becoming far better travelled (and able to offer visa guidance to his followers), the past year has also seen him expand his horizons in other ways; acting as an ambassador for Young Minds UK - a mental health charity for young people - and Winston's Wish - a children and young people's grief charity.",
      "One of the most heart-rending moments of series four was when it was revealed that Watts's mum had died of cancer when he was just a child.",

      "His \"number one piece of advice\" for anyone taking part is to learn from his mistakes and take a calculator and a whiteboard. \"We had to borrow notebooks and God knows what else\".",

      "Throughout the series, the women battled it out in boxing matches, basketball contests and even a bizarre task where they had to devise a TV advert for a mattress, \u00e0 la The Apprentice.",
      "Broadcast on YouTube, Latey is a rare dating programme in a country where courtship is traditionally a private affair.",
      "Winning such a ground-breaking show felt \"surreal\", 25-year-old Ms Bethel told the BBC's Focus on Africa podcast. Weeks on from the finale, which racked up more than 620,000 views, her victory still \"feels like a badge of honour\".",
      "Of course, not everyone feels the same way.",
      "\"The concept of a dating show is entirely [a] Western idea,\" says Ethiopian vlogger Semere Kassaye.",
      "\"Dating in Ethiopia has always been a private matter, something that is nurtured carefully and only brought to the attention of family or society when it reaches a level of maturity.\"",
      "Mr Semere, 41, also feels that the show devalues women, treating them as objects to be acquired.",
      "Several viewers voiced the same opinion - one commenter on YouTube wrote: \"Ladies, you are not an object that the one with money can easily pick you up.\"",
      "Another asked: \"Lots of creativity on the production but if it is against the culture, what is the point?\"",
      "Ms Bethel agrees that the concept of women openly competing for a man clashes with Ethiopian traditions, but insists that the show is more than its central premise.",
      "\"The whole point of the show is to represent different kinds of women,\" she says.",
      "\"If you have seen the episodes, you can see every woman in that episode has a lot of different struggles, backgrounds, and all different kinds of stuff that hasn't really been expressed or represented in media in Ethiopia.\"",
      "Arguably, Latey succeeds in this respect. The women - who include hotel managers, flight attendants and accountants - swiftly bond, sharing their personal stories with each other and the viewers.",
      "In one of the more heart-breaking scenes, actress Vivian divulges that she fled to Ethiopia from Eritrea, a neighbouring country that enforces indefinite military conscription for all able-bodied citizens. It has also been widely accused of human rights violations.",
      "Vivian travelled alone to Ethiopia and has not seen her mother in five years.",
      "\"I miss her so much,\" she says tearfully.",
      "Elsewhere, Rahel, a model, explains that she dropped out of school to take on multiple jobs and provide for her siblings, while other women have emotional conversations about grief and their reverence for those who raised them.",
      "By baring these women's realities - and their romantic desires - Latey cemented its place as the \"content of its times\", producer Metasebia Yoseph tells the BBC.",
      "Ms Metasebia, co-founder of D!nkTV, Latey's production company, says the show \"rocked the boat\", but is far from an affront to Ethiopian culture.",
      "\"Number one - it is not hyper-sexualised,\" she says.",
      "\"We leave it on the more innocent, get-to-know-you, stages of dating.\"",
      "She says the show also asks its viewers to interrogate the concept of culture, \"sparking dialogue about 'What is our culture? Are we a monolith?'\"",
      "Adapting a universal reality TV formula to Ethiopia has delighted many, with one fan commenting: \"I totally love the risk-taking, considering how reserved we are as a society... I have always wanted to see other shows in Ethiopian version. This is a ground-breaking moment.\"",
      "A second viewer wrote: \"I never imagined watching The Bachelor in Ethiopia, but you have done an excellent job bringing it to life.\"",
      "Off the back of this success, D!nk TV is planning a second series.",
      "This time, Ms Metasebia says, a single woman could be the one picking her match from 10 male hopefuls.",
      "\"We're getting a lot of feedback from the audience, people want to see the roles reversed,\" she explains.",
      "As for Ms Bethel and Mr Messiah? Sadly, their love story has come to a halt.",
      "\"It is long distance because he's in America right now with his son. So it's really difficult... I don't know where it's going to go, basically,\" she says.",
      "But Ms Bethel is still close to some of her fellow contestants, who she fondly refers to as her \"sorority\".",
      "She is proud that Latey showcased \"the romantic side of Ethiopia\" and believes the show will lead to better representations of women in Ethiopian media.",
      "\"It is a new way of showcasing women and how they express themselves,\" she says.",
      "\"It is a new way of seeing.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 19 Apr 2025 00:58:11 GMT",
    "summary": "The singer describes the troubled gestation of her third album, as she launches it on the West End.",
    "story": [
      "\"Please be upstanding for the world's most confusing House of Games contestant and Bake Off failure, Self Esteem!\"",
      "This is how Rebecca Lucy Taylor \u2013 aka celebrated pop singer Self Esteem \u2013 is introduced to the stage at London's Duke of York's Theatre.",
      "It's a typically irreverent comment, an example of the dry wit she uses to sweeten the sincerity and anger of her music.",
      "\"You can take piccies and videos,\" the off-stage voice continues, \"because she needs all the help she can get.\"",
      "That, too, is strictly tongue-in-cheek.",
      "Three years ago, Taylor released her second album, Prioritise Pleasure, a body-shaking manifesto for female self-worth that bristled at society's expectations while acknowledging her own shortcomings (\"Sexting you at the mental health talk seems counterproductive,\" she observed on Moody).",
      "After 10 years in mid-ranking indie band Slow Club, the album propelled her into uncharted realms.",
      "There were magazine covers, nominations for the Mercury Prize and Brit Awards, a starring role on stage in Cabaret, a support slot with Adele and, yes, an appearance on Celebrity Bake Off \u2013 where, unfortunately, she burned her crumpets.",
      "\"The week that Prioritise Pleasure came out, my whole life changed,\" she reflects.",
      "\"Not financially or in terms of fame, but it's like there was a knot in my stomach that untied.",
      "\"Then everyone was like, 'Right, can you do that again, please?'\"",
      "Taylor tore herself in two to make the follow-up, A Complicated Woman, which comes out on Friday.",
      "After playing it live for the first time in the West End on Wednesday, she describes the album's gestation process as \"horrible\", \"lonely\", and \"painful\".",
      "\"It just felt really stressful to execute what was in my head,\" she explains in a phone interview the next morning.",
      "\"I was thinking so big, but I still don't have access to the resources I need to make it as big as I wanted.\"",
      "Part of the problem was a punishing, but self-imposed, time limit.",
      "\"The music industry is like, 'You've got 10 minutes, then you're over and someone else is going to take your place',\" she explains.",
      "\"So I felt like I had no choice [but to commit to another record] if I wanted to build on what I'd done.",
      "\"But as painful as it was and as dark as it got, the second I'm back on stage performing it, I'm like, 'Oh, this is why I love it'.\"",
      "It all unravels",
      "She hasn't just made a new album - she has also created a daring, jaw-dropping theatrical experience to go with it.",
      "It's set in a sparse recreation of the community centre where eight-year-old Becky from Rotherham learned to tap dance.",
      "\"You just wanted to sing / You didn't know what that would bring,\" recalls an older, more cynical version of that child \u2013 as she assesses her life at the age of 38.",
      "\"This really is all there is, and that's what you've got to get comfortable with.\"",
      "As the show opens, 10 dancers line up on either side of her, dressed in austere outfits that recall The Handmaid's Tale.",
      "Initially, their movements are stiff and restricted but, as Taylor describes suffocating relationships with emotionally-stunted men, they start to thrash and jerk their bodies.",
      "\"We start in that world where we're shackled, and then we exorcise it,\" Taylor explains.",
      "\"Over the course of the show, it all unravels and everyone ends up being themselves instead of conforming to these societal norms.\"",
      "A four-night theatre residency is an unusual way to launch an album. The audience is unfamiliar with most of the songs, and no-one's sure whether to absorb the performance attentively, or sing along and dance.",
      "Several times, laughter ripples through the theatre as the singer's more acerbic observations hit home. The following morning, she's not quite sure what to make of the reaction.",
      "\"Every time people laugh, my heart sinks,\" she says. \"But then I'm like, the lyrics are funny, aren't they?",
      "\"And I love changing the laughter into emotion. It feels like people are laughing because it's uncomfortable.\"",
      "In the end, the audience members mirror the on-stage narrative. Shaking off their discomfort, they rise out of their seats and start making an almighty racket.",
      "The music becomes a soundtrack to solidarity - which, it transpires, was Taylor's intention.",
      "A Complicated Woman might be as cutting and powerful as its predecessor, but the melodies were designed for stadiums.",
      "\"Do you remember the Elbow song One Day Like This?\" she asks. \"The one that goes, 'Throw those curtains wii-iide'?",
      "\"I went mad for that song when it came out and, honestly, I played it over and over in the studio and said, 'I want to do this'.\"",
      "\"I was very inspired by trying to make it onto World Cup montages. That's a genre of music that I really, really enjoy.\"",
      "That's only half the story, though. The album is all about capturing the complex and contradictory impulses of a woman in her mid-30s.",
      "Recent single 69, for example, is a thumping house track on which Taylor talks with withering candour about her sex life. Imagine Madonna's Justify My Love, if she was really being honest.",
      "\"It's an idea I had for ages, of listing sex positions and scoring them so that there's no grey area [for prospective partners],\" the singer laughs.",
      "\"But there's a more political element, which is that women still aren't saying what they want in the bedroom. And I'm like, I can't bear this any more. Please let us just enjoy having sex.",
      "\"It's not exactly going to win an Ivor Novello Award for lyrics, but I think it stands on the album with moments that are more emotional and deep.\"",
      "Those moments include The Curse, a rousing ballad about using alcohol to dull her anxiety, which is possibly the best song Self Esteem's ever written.",
      "Her personal favourite, however, is called In Plain Sight. A collaboration with South African musician Moonchild Sanelly, it's a response to the criticism they've both received for speaking their minds.",
      "\"The world is saying who I am, but I thought I knew myself all these years,\" says Sanelly in a semi-improvised rap.",
      "\"I shrink to keep the peace, hoping I don't shake my purpose.\"",
      "It's a feeling Taylor immediately recognised.",
      "As excitement built around Prioritise Pleasure in 2021, she started getting \"nasty messages\" on social media, which shook her up.",
      "\"I was really shocked the first time I got grief, because no-one's ever been that bothered about what I'm doing,\" she says.",
      "\"People say you should ignore it, but if you went to a wedding and had a nice day and one person called you an [expletive], who would you go home thinking about? It's just human nature.\"",
      "Eventually, the criticism took its toll.",
      "\"There were moments where I considered giving up, which shocked me because I've been this defiant, angry thing for so long,\" she says.",
      "\"But over the last few years, especially with the world being like it is, I've definitely had feelings of protecting myself and shutting up.",
      "\"That's the saddest part of the album, really. But I found a way through.",
      "\"And if I can, then I hope the rest of the world can too, you know?\"",
      "That realisation is the connecting tissue of A Complicated Woman.",
      "Life is never easy, she says. No-one is ever truly satisfied. Relationships are hard work. You can't please everyone. But that's OK. You're OK. Trust your gut.",
      "She sums it up on Focus Is Power, held aloft by the sound of a gospel choir: \"And now I see it clear with every passing of each year / I deserve to be here.\"",
      "On stage in London, she sings those final lines a capella with her dancers and backing singers, arms wrapped around each other in a display of female solidarity.",
      "It's a cathartic moment after the bruising process of putting the album together.",
      "\"There's so much joy in being a woman and just being yourself can be beautiful,\" she says. \"You've just got to find a way to do it.\"",
      "With that, she's off to make tweaks for the show's second night. After that, she has to find a way to scale down the West End production for a UK tour.",
      "\"I'll do what I can to make it continue, but it's a huge risk because there's so little revenue from anything else,\" she says.",
      "Ultimately, though, her ambition is undimmed.",
      "\"I want to make 20 albums, I want to do bigger theatre shows,\" she says.",
      "\"Of course it'd be useful if I could 'cross over' because everything gets easier when you've got more resources.",
      "\"But last night I was like, 'Bloody hell, you did what you set out to do'. So I'm good.\"",

      "Labubus are furry snaggletoothed gremlins, which are designed by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung and sold by Chinese toy company Pop Mart.",
      "They're almost always sold out online and long queues often form outside the selected shops that stock them.",
      "Labubus are also primarily sold in the blind box format, meaning customers never know what version they'll get until they open them - a fact collectors have said adds to their appeal.",
      "While it's difficult to pin their recent rise in popularity to one particular ingredient, celebrity endorsement, social media unboxing videos and their ability to stir up nostalgia are all contributing factors.",
      "James Welsh, from Hampshire, sees his Labubu collectable as an investment, which he tells the BBC \"could probably earn a fair bit of money two or three years down the line\".",
      "He has just shy of 30 Labubus which retail at around \u00a325 for an individual toy or \u00a3153 for a box of six.",
      "He says he has \"spent hundreds and hundreds but not quite thousands\" on the dolls.",
      "Labubu maker Pop Mart has doubled its profits in the last year and is eying up global expansion in 2025.",
      "The company, which started 15 years ago, has been described as \"elevating toy buying to an act of trendy connoisseurship\" and praised for embracing non-traditional designs, which have made them a hit with collectors.",
      "Artist Kasing Lung is behind some of their popular toys including The Monsters series and Labubu.",
      "He credits living in The Netherlands as the inspiration behind the dolls and told Hypbeast \"I liked to read storybooks and was influenced by ancient European elf legends\".",
      "Lung added that during his childhood, \"there were no game consoles or computers, so I had to draw dolls with a pen, so I had the idea of painting fairy tales since I was a child\".",
      "He first came up with the designs in 2015 and signed a licensing agreement with Pop Mart in 2019 to make them into toys.",
      "Labubu as a name has no specific meaning, it is a fictional character based around an elf-like creature.",
      "James says his first thought when he saw the one of the toys was, \"they're creepy but they're also really cute and I need as many of them as I can get, I need them in every colour\".",
      "The 36-year-old adds, \"I think they [provide] some real escapism for millennials as it's like reverting back to your youth with these toys and collectables.\"",
      "A former stylist, he now primarily creates beauty and skincare content, but has recently gained thousands of views on his channel from Labubu unboxing videos.",
      "He tells the BBC: \"there is a strong link between these plush pendants and the fashion community as well.\"",
      "\"They're a way to express who you are, you can show that through the different characters, which add a pop of colour and fashion is fun, it's not serious at the end of the day, it's reflective of who you are.\"",
      "There are several iterations of Labubu - from vinyl figures to plush toys - but the keychain versions have become most popular recently.",
      "Labubu's ascent into mainstream culture has been steady - but was elevated last year by BLACKPINK star Lisa.",

      "Rihanna was also spotted with one of the toys attached to her bag in recent weeks, which has led to fashion fans replicating her look.",
      "But for collectors such as 22-year-old Chulie, who shares her purchases on TikTok, she says Labubu becoming a \"fashion trend\" misses the point of why they're so loved.",
      "\"For me, it's all about the nostalgia and the surprise aspect,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "One of Pop Mart's biggest selling points for collectors is the way their toys are packaged in what's known as blind boxes, which make the experience of getting one like a lucky dip.",
      "You don't know what character you are getting until you unseal the package, so it's always a gamble for collectors.",
      "\"You know it's fun, it's a dopamine hit\", James says.",
      "\"It's gambling for some of us - kind of like a happy meal, you don't know what toy you're getting until you open it up.\"",
      "It also makes the toy perfect for the world of social media, as creators can catch their genuine surprise on camera and share it with other fans - something James says provides comfort and \"escapism from the real world\".",
      "Chulie says, as a child, she would collect Pokemon trading cards, so collecting another surprise item \"triggered memories for me\".",
      "\"When you're having a rough time, especially for me personally, it's a big serotonin boost to not only buy a collectable and keep it, but share the experience with other people as well,\" she adds.",
      "Others have compared Labubus to Beanie Babies, which were popular in the 1990s and 2000s, and say collecting Labubus evokes feelings of childhood nostalgia.",
      "For some fans, just documenting the experience of getting a Labubu is a talking point, with many showing the long queues and hours of research required to find out where new collections are being stocked.",
      "It's prompted backlash on some social media channels, with users criticising collectors that have bought large numbers of items.",
      "\"Just because you don't understand someone's hobby, doesn't mean it's not valid in any way,\" James says.",

      "The move paid off, says Thurston, as prices for pay-per-view events dropped significantly to around $10 (\u00a37.50), creating \"a larger audience than ever\".",
      "The Netflix deal is, according to Thurston, part of WWE's plans to recruit globally, create bigger international stars, and amplify its live tournaments such as Raw, WrestleMania and Smackdown across different markets.",
      "As WWE's Levesque told the Ankler podcast, Netflix's universal \"simplicity\" felt game-changing: \"No matter where you are in the globe, there it is right in front of you. It's one click, and you're on and you're in\".",
      "Good thing too, as Levesque says younger audiences have \"no concept\" of traditional television, and increasingly view on-demand streaming as the norm, alongside video platforms like YouTube and TikTok.",
      "It's certainly made Oliver a megafan, and he is now able to watch the weekly Smackdown and Raw shows with his dad. Previously, without a TNT sport subscription, his options were limited to the monthly events available on the WWE network.",
      "\"Now that WWE is on Netflix, he watches it probably four times a week. It's his go-to programme,\" says Paul.",
      "\"It's really opened up a huge door for him. What's great for me as a dad is I used to be into wrestling when I was his age as well, so it's nice to share that journey with him\".",
      "And he's far from alone. On Thursday, industry magazine Broadcast reported that the move to Netflix had significantly increased UK engagement with both shows, with Raw ranked among the platform's top 10 shows in nine of its first 10 weeks.",
      "The picture is less clear in the US. Back in February, Mark Shapiro, a chief at WWE parent company TKO, told investors that Raw viewership was up 13% for the year to date compared to its previous home on USA Network - rising to 38% if the heavily promoted opening night is included.",
      "However, Thurston's research suggests that Raw and Smackdown viewership has since levelled off to numbers seen on USA.",
      "And figures are continuing to fall, not to an alarming amount, but certainly indicating that, potentially, weekly events on the streamer may not be as much of a growth area as major live events.",
      "Regardless, he sees the trade-off as worth it for Netflix in the long run - particularly looking ahead to WrestleMania's global debut tonight, which is expected to break streaming records.",
      "'Boots on the ground'",
      "When former longtime WWE CEO Vince McMahon dreamt up WrestleMania more than 40 years ago, he envisaged a Superbowl-style set piece event to unite the franchise's commercial partnerships and burrow it deeper within popular culture.",
      "That's why 1985's first WrestleMania was heavily promoted through MTV and held at New York's Madison Square Garden - featuring everyone from wrestler Hulk Hogan to A-team actor Mr T, popstar Cyndi Lauper and Muhammad Ali as a referee.",
      "\"We were trying to make a statement as to what our business is,\" McMahon told Netflix's 2024 docuseries, \"all forms of entertainment rolled into one\".",
      "And yet despite turning WWE into a media empire, McMahon departed in disgrace - first in 2022 and then again in 2024, amid various controversies - including an ongoing sexual harassment lawsuit. McMahon's attorney, Jessica Rosenberg, denied the claims.",
      "Thurston feels McMahon's tight grip on creative business decisions also stifled WWE's storytelling in later years. Under Levesque, Thurston says that's changed in favour of collaboration. He says stories feel fresher, gender representation has improved and US event attendance is up.",
      "For Jonny Pivaral, who grew up watching during what he calls McMahon's \"bra and panties match\" era of the 2000s, the evolution is welcome. \"Back then, women were just eye candy,\" he says. \"Now they're being showcased on the same level as the men.\"",
      "This shift will be on full display when women's wrestling storylines take centre stage at WrestleMania. Top stars Rhea Ripley, Bianca Belair, and IYO SKY are to face off in a triple-threat match, while women's champion Tiffany Stratton will fight the legendary Charlotte Flair - in a battle that underlines the division's growing value.",
      "Attracting new audiences matters, Thurston says, because WWE's global strategy now hinges on fees paid by cities hosting these events (including WrestleMania), both inside and outside the USA.",
      "\"They want WrestleMania to become like the World Cup or Olympics, where there's a bidding war,\" he explains. \"Las Vegas is paying them $5 million for this year's event,\" he adds, noting that London has been heavily touted as a potential WrestleMania host city.",
      "Netflix's 'Sportainment' bet",
      "Finding a home on a streaming giant may be great news for WWE - but what does Netflix stand to gain from the partnership?",
      "According to James English, managing partner at sports and entertainment marketing agency Fuse, Netflix is \"stating loud and clear that it wants to dominate 'sportainment'\".",
      "Netflix has no input into making of WWE, says Triple H",
      "The WWE streaming deal is, he says, a major reason why Netflix beat expectations with its financial figures on Thursday, delivering 13% revenue growth for the first quarter of 2025.",
      "English sees WrestleMania as the natural progression in their drive to use sport to attract viewers to \"cultural moments\".",
      "This began last November with Mike Tyson taking on YouTuber Jake Paul in an influencer-boxing hybrid bout that drew in 60 million households - perhaps benefitting from cross-generational appeal.",
      "This first foray into live sports attracted complaints of crashing and buffering but the issues were largely fixed for Netflix's two NFL matches on Christmas Day a month later, part of a new three-year deal to show Christmas Day fixtures.",
      "English says that unlike Apple or Amazon Prime, which bought packages to the Major League Soccer (MLS) and the Premier League, Netflix's focus on \"event\" viewing allows them to make best use of their personalised advert and interface data.",
      "WrestleMania exemplifies this strategy. As a \"live, global, fan-driven deal that blends sports, entertainment and storytelling\", English says Netflix could stand to make huge profits from its WWE partnership.",
      "The big question, of course, is whether wider Netflix audience interest will last the rounds.",
      "But it may be a gamble worth taking - for all involved. Just ask Oliver and his Dad at midnight."

    "story": [
      "After British actress Aimee Lou Wood called a Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketch that impersonated her using exaggerated prosthetic teeth \"mean and unfunny,\" impressionists have told BBC News how they tread the line between being funny and offensive.",
      "It all began with five minutes on NBC last Saturday night.",
      "Titled The White Potus - a spin on hit HBO dark comedy The White Lotus - a SNL sketch depicted US president Donald Trump, his family and top team spending time at a fictional tropical hotel.",
      "After jokes showing Eric Trump blending a gold Rolex watch and Ivanka Trump rejecting a spiritual call to give up material wealth, Wood's White Lotus character Chelsea is portrayed by cast member Sarah Sherman using a pronounced accent and large teeth.",
      "In response to a comment made by a character playing US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, she asks: \"Fluoride? What's that?\"",
      "The mineral is added to some water supplies and brands of toothpaste to help prevent tooth decay.",
      "'Bit of a cheap shot'",
      "For BBC Radio 4's Dead Ringers star Jan Ravens, the first misstep of the writers behind the SNL sketch was \"not reading the room\".",
      "It was a bad idea to joke about someone's appearance in a sketch about The White Lotus, Ravens says, given Wood's casting has been praised for a character lacking \"those all-American, fake-looking teeth\".",
      "\"In the wake of all that, she's been talking about how she was bullied at school and the butt of jokes. So then you think, 'why would you do that joke'?\"",
      "It meant that in making fun of Wood's appearance, the sketch \"punched down,\" says Ravens.",
      "\"You might make a joke about Donald Trump's appearance because you're definitely not punching down on the most powerful man in the western world.\"",
      "Ronni Ancona, co-writer and star of the early 2000s TV series The Big Impression, said she \"could see\" that the writers were also trying to make a point about US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's pledge to remove fluoride from US drinking water.",
      "But in doing so, \"they would have made this tenuous link between fluoride and Aimee Lou's teeth. It's a bit of a cheap shot,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",
      "After the show aired, Wood, 31, said she was \"not thin skinned\" and understood that SNL was about \"caricature\".",
      "\"But the whole joke was about fluoride,\" she wrote on Sunday. \"I have big gap teeth not bad teeth.\"",
      "Later on, in a post on social media, she said: \"I've had apologies from SNL.\"",
      "However, Francine Lewis, a comedian whose impersonations have earned her a large following on social media, says the whole purpose of the US show is to \"take the mick\".",
      "While she can sympathise with someone being \"embarrassed\" by being the target of a sketch, Lewis adds that she thinks Wood's response was \"too sensitive\".",
      "In her own impressions of celebrities, which include TV stars Gemma Collins and Stacey Solomon, Lewis has stuffed a pillow up her top to appear to be physically larger and put cotton wool on her teeth \"to make them really white and jut out a bit\".",
      "In recent times, both fans and some of her targets have taken offence.",
      "\"I don't know if it's just the new generation of young people that just take offence to every little thing,\" she says.",
      "\"People that say you're a troll, you're a bully... I find myself hiding at celebrity events because I think 'oh I do their impression, they might not like me'.\"",
      "But she believes that being impersonated is actually a marker of someone's popularity and fame, saying that \"it means you've arrived\".",
      "Rather than adapting her impressions, Lewis is steadfast in her belief that \"to make comedy funny, unfortunately you have to overstep the mark.\"",
      "'Got to have the mickey taken'",
      "It's a view shared by Steve Nallon, known for impersonating former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on satirical TV programme Spitting Image.",
      "\"What caricaturists do by nature... is exaggerate the physicality. If a caricaturist is stopped from doing that, there's no point in him being a caricaturist,\" he says.",
      "During the 1980s, one of his targets - former Labour minister Roy Hattersley - was mocked for a slight speech impediment, with water spurting out of his mouth as he spoke.",
      "\"The joke was Roy Hattersley spits,\" says Nallon, who adds that Hattesley allegedly got on board with the joke after initially taking offence.",
      "For Nallon, those in the public eye will always be fair game. \"Maybe it's not a bad lesson to learn that you've got to have the mickey taken out of you occasionally,\" he says.",
      "But times have changed. Ravens says that \"people are much more sensitive\" about targeting certain aspects of people's appearances and mannerisms \"than they used to be earlier on in my career, for example, and I think rightly so\".",
      "This is not the first time SNL has received criticism of their portrayals.",
      "It doesn't mean the comedy is lost, says Ravens. In political satire - which was the main thrust of the SNL sketch - a really good impression satirises what the person is saying, rather than just fixating on how they look or how they deliver it, she adds.",
      "During our phone interview, she seamlessly breaks into an impression of former UK Prime Minister Theresa May, but notes that just speaking in a tense, clipped way, \"is only good for one line really\".",
      "\"You're pricking pomposity and you're exposing hypocrisy. That's the point of satire.\"",

    "summary": "Portraying some of the most famous people on the planet has its challenges, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Playing any well-known figure from recent history is a challenge, but the challenge of finding four actors to put in convincing portrayals of four of the most famous people in popular culture is one not many directors have attempted.",
      "Earlier this month, director Sam Mendes announced the cast for his four-part Beatles biopic, with each member of the band set to be the subject of their own feature-length films set for release in 2028.",
      "Actors Harris Dickinson, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn and Barry Keoghan will play John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr respectively.",
      "Their performances \u2013 and particularly their efforts at the Beatles' distinctive accents \u2013 will be closely watched by fans the world over. And if previous actors' attempts are anything to go by, they should brace themselves for some serious scrutiny.",
      "'Suspend disbelief'",
      "Perhaps one of the most famous and successful Beatles biopics is 1994's Backbeat, set in the band's 1960-1962 Hamburg era.",
      "On the one hand, it had Liverpool actor Ian Hart turning in a convincing Lennon (even if he was not exactly Lennon's double).",
      "But on the other, Hollywood actor Stephen Dorff, playing the film's lead character of original Beatles bass player and artist Stuart Sutcliffe, who died of a brain haemorrhage aged just 21, provided an uncanny likeness. But his attempt at the Liverpool accent has received, over the years since, reviews from \"decent\" to \"variable\" to \"awful\".",
      "So should any actor taking on a Beatle role be wary?",
      "Beatles historian Paul Du Noyer, who wrote The Beatles: The Complete Illustrated Story and Conversations With Paul McCartney, said: \"The Beatles are so well known to us all, not just their faces but every nuance of the way they talk, every mannerism.",
      "\"Many of us know the Beatles as well as we know our own families. It can be difficult for us to suspend the disbelief.",
      "\"Even when I've seen performances that were very good, for example Ian Hart in Backbeat, that got around the problem of the familiarity by dwelling on a lesser-known period of their story.\"",
      "Du Noyer added that some Beatles might seem easier to take off than others.",
      "\"In some ways, you stick a wig and a beard on someone, little round granny glasses and a white suit and everyone goes, 'It's John Lennon'\"",
      "But he said McCartney was a tougher portrayal to nail \u2013 especially when the man himself is a tough critic.",
      "\"Paul has been very critical of films like [Sam Taylor-Wood's early years biopic of John Lennon] Nowhere Boy, and Backbeat, because they tend to fall into a pastiche of McCartney that he doesn't recognise \u2013 he doesn't like the stereotype of him being the cute one, the manipulative one.\"",
      "So does Sam Mendes have a job on his hands?",
      "Du Noyer added: \"He's got bankable stars, who won't let themselves down. I know there's been some disappointment among Liverpudlians because non-Liverpudlians have been cast in the roles, but even as a loyal Liverpudlian I can't condemn Sam Mendes on the casting, because he is making films for the whole world to watch.",
      "\"I think the accuracy of the Liverpool accent will be pretty low down the list of things he needs to cover.\"",
      "'Don't hear it any more'",
      "Edda Sharpe, a voice and dialect coach who has worked with actors at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre, said there were some specific challenges to taking on the voice of a Beatle.",
      "Among them is the fact that the accent with which John, Paul, George and Ringo spoke is much less pronounced than the one many might associate with Liverpool today.",
      "Beatles aficionados will know that on the Let It Be album version of the old Liverpool folk tune Maggie May, Lennon deliberately exaggerated the Liverpool accent, elongating his vowels and adding a much more nasal quality to it.",
      "The performance has more in common with today's Scouse accent than it did with the one the Beatles spoke with.",
      "\"And the challenge is, the way the Beatles spoke, you just don't hear that any more. It's a completely different tone to the Liverpool accent we are currently exposed to,\" Sharpe said.",
      "\"And you are not just trying to create the sound of someone from Liverpool in the 1960s, you are trying to create the sound of people that everyone is familiar with.\"",
      "She said there might be advantages for Irish actors Mescal and Keoghan, as there are certain common traits to both Liverpool and Irish accents.",
      "But she said similarities in accent could also prove problematic for actors.",
      "\"The northern Irish accent, particularly, has this sort of down-and-then-up quality, and when you listen to early recordings of the Beatles you hear what sounds like a familiar Irish pattern.",
      "\"But sometimes accents that are closer to your own are harder to do than ones that are completely different.\"",
      "'More Scouse'",
      "Dr Paul Cooper, a senior lecturer in English Language at the University of Liverpool, said there was academic research to back up the idea that \"Scouse was getting more Scouse\" than it used to be in the time of the Beatles.",
      "He said research by linguistics expert Marten Juskan into the changing sound of the Scouse accent supported the claim.",
      "\"Also,\" said Cooper, \"I think younger people are now looking at the accent more favourably than maybe it was looked at 30 or 40 years ago.",
      "\"There's always been a strong sense of pride in the accent, but I think in the 1980s and 1990s you got the Harry Enfield Scousers stuff and it maybe became viewed a bit more negatively.",
      "\"I think now it's viewed a bit more favourably again. Plus, Liverpool is much more of a tourist destination now, and the accent is thought of as very welcoming and very friendly.\"",
      "But what does an actor who has taken on not one but two Beatle roles think the challenge will be for the actors taking on the Fab Four in Mendes' films?",
      "Michael Hawkins played John Lennon in the successful stage show Cilla: The Musical based on the life and career of Liverpool entertainer Cilla Black, and, in his first TV role, George Harrison in the 2014 ITV serial biopic Cilla, with Sheridan Smith taking the title role.",
      "Hawkins said: \"You've got to do your research, watch as much stuff as you can.",
      "\"Obviously in the films like Hard Days Night they're sort of playing a version of themselves, but with the Get Back film, you see more of them as how they were.",
      "\"So many people feel like they know them so well that if you get something a little off, it'll make people wince.",
      "\"It's about getting the authenticity, and not doing a caricature.\"",
      "The 35-year-old, a member of \"parody band\" Ugly Baby, said even as a born-and-bred Scouser he was not immune from scrutiny for his portrayal of Harrison in Cilla.",
      "He added: \"I didn't really change my accent much for playing George. And then one of my mates sent me a review, from the Mirror, I think it was, where they were saying George's accent was just a general northern one, with no hint of the 'Pool.",
      "\"And I was the only Scouser out of the four of us.\"",

      "Chanel is now hoping to continue that legacy by campaigning to encourage people to talk openly about substance abuse.",
      "She believes the stigma around addiction, and her brother's successful career on stage and TV, meant James didn't seek professional help.",
      "\"He'd spoken openly on Drag Race about the battles he'd had with addiction, and he'd come through the other side of that,\" she says.",
      "\"He was at the height of everything he was doing and I think because he'd said it in such a open platform, it's really difficult to come back and say you're struggling again.\"",
      "Chanel says she's concerned about the rise in young people taking ketamine, which she believes is in part because the drug is cheap and easily accessible.",
      "James's body was found in Chorlton-by-Backford, near Chester, on 5 January.",
      "Police confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death, and a post-mortem examination revealed an \"unnatural cause of death.\"",
      "A full inquest is scheduled for June 30. But in March, the family told BBC News that the star died from cardiac arrest caused by the effects of taking ketamine.",
      "Since making the announcement, they've been working with substance abuse charity Adferiad to raise awareness and tackle stigma around the drug, something Chanel says is an \"important step\" in those facing addiction.",
      "\"It's hard for me because I think if that stigma wasn't there, would my brother have sought the help he needed?\" she says.",
      "\"To think that if we'd known, or if he'd have felt able to talk and really reach out for the help that was needed, the outcome could've been different.",
      "\"That's why we've shared James's story.\"",
      "Chanel and her family are also campaigning for the government to re-classify ketamine from its current status as a Class B drug to Class A, which would put it in the same category as heroin and cocaine.",
      "\"There's a portion of younger people that maybe look at that classification and think it's less harmful than other drugs,\" she says.",
      "\"But it's not just about reclassification [\u2026] it needs to include education, police, health, to really raise awareness. We need a strategy around drug usage and drug deaths in the UK.\"",

      "A spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"Our thoughts are with James's family and friends, and all those affected by this tragic death, which has sadly reinforced once again the serious dangers of taking ketamine.",
      "\"We will not hesitate to act when the ACMD reports back, and in the meantime, we will continue to work across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use and stop those who profit from its supply.\"",
      "Chanel said it had been difficult to share the information about how James had passed away but that the family \"talked about what we can do\".",
      "\"The Vivienne left a legacy as a trailblazing icon and this, I feel, is James's legacy. To help other people,\" she says.",

    "summary": "In an NHS survey, 48% of men said they felt pressure to \"tough it out\" when it came to potential health issues.",
    "story": [
      "Two years ago, Dan Somers started to experience a series of strange and unexplained symptoms. He had severe chest pain, was unable to keep food or even water down and kept \"chucking up bile\".",
      "Though he had a sense that something might be wrong, Dan was reluctant to seek medical help. \"I'm really stubborn when it comes down to going to the doctors,\" the 43-year-old from Ipswich tells the BBC. \"I didn't want to be a burden.\"",
      "Dan's pain continued to get worse, until he was \"near enough screaming on the floor in pain\" and had to take time off work. It was the worst pain he's ever experienced, he says upon reflection.",
      "But \"I honestly thought I could try and fix it,\" Dan recalls.",
      "It was his wife who finally managed to push Dan to see the doctor.",
      "His GP sent him straight to hospital, where he was diagnosed with a gallbladder infection and spent a week recovering. He was told he had been close to getting sepsis.",
      "Dan's story mirrors those of other men who've told the BBC they've also put off seeking medical treatment - often until their symptoms became unbearable or until a loved one pushed them to get help.",
      "It's well known that men go to the doctors less than women, and data backs this up.",
      "The NHS told the BBC it doesn't release demographic data about GP appointments. But according to the ONS Health Insight Survey from February, commissioned by NHS England, 45.8% of women compared to just 33.5% of men had attempted to make contact with their GP practice for themselves or someone else in their household in the last 28 days.",
      "Men were more likely to say they weren't registered at a dental practice and \"rarely or never\" used a pharmacy, too.",
      "They also make up considerably fewer hospital outpatient appointments than women, even when pregnancy-related appointments are discounted.",
      "Men are \"less likely to attend routine appointments and more likely to delay help-seeking until symptoms interfere with daily function,\" says Paul Galdas, professor of men's health at the University of York.",
      "This all affects men's health outcomes.",
      "Experts say there's a long list of reasons why men might put off seeking medical help, and new survey data from the NHS suggests that concerns about how they are perceived come into play.",
      "In the survey, 48% of male respondents agreed they felt a degree of pressure to \"tough it out\" when it came to potential health issues, while a third agreed they felt talking about potential health concerns might make others see them as weak. The poll heard from almost 1,000 men in England in November and December 2024.",
      "Society associates masculinity with traits like self-reliance, independence and not showing vulnerability, says social psychologist Prof Brendan Gough of Leeds Beckett University. \"Men are traditionally supposed to sort things out themselves\".",
      "\"It's worrying to see just how many men still feel unable to talk about their health concerns,\" says Dr Claire Fuller, NHS medical director for primary care. She notes that men can be reluctant to seek medical support for mental health and for changes in their bodies that could be signs of cancer.",
      "\"GPs are often the best way to access the help they need,\" she adds.",
      "'Men are inherent problem-solvers'",
      "Kevin McMullan says he's learned from working for men's mental health charity ManHealth that men want to solve their own problems. He says he struggled with his mental health for years before he finally got help.",
      "\"You want to fix it yourself. Men are inherent problem-solvers and how you are feeling is a problem in the same way that having a flat tyre is a problem,\" says Kevin, 44, from Sedgefield in County Durham.",
      "This is something that the Health Insights Survey indicates, too. The data suggests that when people were unable to contact their GP practice, men were significantly more likely than women to report \"self-managing\" their condition, while women were more likely than men to go to a pharmacy or call 111.",
      "\"Many men feel that help-seeking threatens their sense of independence or competence,\" Prof Galdas says.",
      "Prof Galdas points to other factors deterring men from going to the doctors, like appointment systems that don't fit around their working patterns.",
      "Services also rely on talking openly about problems, he suggests, which doesn't reflect how men speak about health concerns - and there are no fixed check-ups targeting younger men.",
      "Women, in contrast, are \"sort of forced to engage in the health system\" because they might seek appointments related to menstruation, contraception, cervical screenings or pregnancy, says Seb Pillon, a GP in Bolton.",
      "And they're largely in control of organising their family's healthcare, too. For example, roughly 90% of the people who contacted the children's sleep charity Sleep Action for help in the last six months were mums, grandmothers and other women in the children's lives, its head of service Alyson O'Brien says.",
      "Because women are more integrated in the healthcare system - through seeking support for both themselves and their children - they're more health-literate and are often the driving force behind their partners seeking medical help, according to Prof Galdas.",
      "And men just have a different attitude towards healthcare, Dr Pillon says. He believes many see it solely as treatment - solving their problems - rather than preventative. Men are, for example, less likely to take part in the NHS's bowel cancer screening programme. As Prof Galdas says: \"men often seek help when symptoms disrupt their ability to function.\"",
      "'Massive waste of time'",
      "For Jonathan Anstee, 54, from Surrey, it took his symptoms getting drastically worse for him to book a doctors appointment, after months of stomach aches and blood in his stool.",
      "\"The pain got a lot worse and the blood got a lot worse,\" Jonathan says. \"But even when I went to the doctors, I was sat in the waiting room thinking 'this is a massive waste of time'.\"",
      "He was diagnosed with bowel cancer in September 2022.",
      "Throughout his life he'd generally avoided doctors appointments, Jonathan says. And as a father, \"you're used to worrying about your kids and not yourself,\" he says. Going to the doctors for himself, not his children, seemed \"a bit sort of indulgent\", he says.",
      "Last year, Jonathan was told his bowel cancer was stage four.",
      "Having blood in his stool had felt too embarrassing to talk to his friends and family about at the time. Jonathan's advice to other men is: \"There is absolutely no need to be embarrassed. The alternative could kill you - literally.\"",
      "'Connection can make a big difference'",
      "In recent years, support groups for men with cancer and mental health conditions have sprung up.",
      "Matthew Wiltshire started the men's charity the Cancer Club after being diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2015. He died in 2023.",
      "Matthew felt there wasn't a space \"where men were openly talking about what it's like to go through cancer,\" his son, Oliver Wiltshire, says. \"He also noticed how much of the emotional load was being carried by the women around him.\"",
      "Through the Cancer Club, men can message online and attend sports events together.",
      "\"Whether it's practical advice, honest chat or just knowing someone else gets it, that connection can make a big difference,\" Oliver adds.",
      "Experts say that while men's attitudes towards healthcare are gradually changing for the better, more work still needs to be done.",
      "Prof Galdas believes men will engage more if services are redesigned to meet their needs - proactively offering support, having flexible access and focusing on practical action to improve mental health issues.",
      "\"There's good evidence from gender-responsive programmes in mental health, cancer care, and health checks showing this consistently,\" he says.",
      "For Dr Pillon, it's adding general health checks for men in their 20s to get them more used to accessing medical care.",
      "They're already available through the NHS for people aged 40 to 74, but introducing them for younger men who might not otherwise go to the doctors would \"embed the idea that you can come and use health services\", he says.",

    "summary": "Blind influencer Lucy Edwards on choosing IVF which will screen out the gene that made her who she is.",
    "story": [
      "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.",
      "\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.",
      "Lucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.",
      "Lucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.",
      "The condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.",
      "Lucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.",
      "The abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.",
      "\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.",
      "This is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.",
      "Without medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.",
      "She pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"",
      "And that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.",
      "It is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.",
      "In 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.",
      "It is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.",
      "\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\"",
      "Lucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.",
      "She says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.",
      "\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"",
      "IP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.",
      "\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"",
      "In response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.",
      "But Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling.",
      "\"I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,\" she says. \"I know that I'm going to get a lot of abuse, but I'm just going to block them.",
      "\"I'm going to be OK. All I think about is the other mothers that have come before me who are competent, capable and resilient.\"",
      "Lucy, who is known for her How Does A Blind Girl... series of videos, is overjoyed by the prospect of IVF but she has also been frank about the fact she currently does not qualify, owing to her current weight, a sensitive element of IVF treatment that many keep to themselves.",
      "NHS guidelines specify your Body Mass Index (BMI) must be 30 or under to qualify - a healthy BMI is considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9.",
      "\"I need to be a BMI of 30 and I'm very open that I need to lose 9kg,\" Lucy says. \"I've already lost 15kg.\"",
      "Her health journey has involved swimming, lifting weights and many runs with Ollie tethered to her as her sighted guide. She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook.",
      "\"I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it's all about this blinking jab,\" she says, referring to weight loss injections. \"I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run.\"",
      "Once she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.",
      "She will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.",
      "Over a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.",
      "Meanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.",
      "The embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be \"shuffled about\" so Lucy and Ollie don't know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term.",
      "Lucy can't wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms.",
      "\"It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,\" she admits. \"But I am very happy in my decision.\"",
      "A few days ago Lucy posted on Instagram, her cardigan tightened at the back with a hairband to make it smaller and fit.",
      "\"I've lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,\" she tells her followers.",
      "\"Fingers crossed [we're] only a few weeks away from ringing the clinic.\"",

      "The official figures come as Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to push for potential trade deal with the US in Washington later to avoid import taxes hitting UK exports.",

    "story": [
      "In nearly 25 years in daily journalism, I have never known another issue quite like it.",
      "The arguments over sex and gender, trans and women's rights have a passion, an anger and often a toxicity on both sides greater in their intensity than those over the Iraq war two decades ago, or Brexit in more recent years.",
      "The abuse and vitriol that fly into my inbox every time I report on it are really quite something.",
      "Last week's decision by the Supreme Court was a landmark moment in this debate, providing the prism through which arguments will now be conducted.",
      "But it won't mark an end to those arguments, as a debate in the Commons on Tuesday evening proved.",
      "The Conservative benches were packed and the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, took the unusual decision to answer for her party herself, something she would normally do in response to a statement from the prime minister rather than any other minister.",

      "Some of her own MPs have grumbled privately that she has lacked oomph and cut-through in her opening months in the job.",
      "She wasn't lacking oomph this time, arguing the Supreme Court had vindicated what she had long argued, and pretty much saying \"I told you so\" to the Labour Party.",
      "And yes, Labour in recent years, from Sir Keir Starmer down, have been in something of a bind on this issue, frequently tangled in anguish when confronted by questions such as \"Can a woman have a penis?\"",
      "Many senior Labour figures regarded such questions as reductive and trivialising and wanted to be openly thoughtful about the rights of trans people.",
      "They maintain, as do the Conservatives, that they still are, but it is also true that the Labour leadership's position is the opposite of what it was.",

      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer does not believe transgender women are women, his official spokesman has said.",
      "It comes after the UK Supreme Court ruled last week that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.",
      "In March 2022, when he was leader of the opposition, Sir Keir told the Times that \"a woman is a female adult, and in addition to that transwomen are women, and that is not just my view - that is actually the law\".",

      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the government of having U-turned in reaction to the judgement, accusing Labour ministers of needing the Supreme Court to tell them what to think on the issue.",
      "Pressed over when the PM had changed his mind earlier, his spokesman insisted the Labour government had been consistent that single-sex spaces \"are protected in law\".",
      "The ruling also makes it clear that a person who was born male but identifies as a woman does not have the right to use spaces or services designated as for women only.",

      "The Supreme Court ruling gives clarity - but now comes the difficult part",
      "Supreme Court's ruling on the definition of a woman... in 65 seconds",
      "The spokesman stressed the PM had repeatedly said \"a woman is an adult female\" before the court judgment.",
      "In 2023, Sir Keir told The Sunday Times that for \"99.9%\" of women \"of course they haven't got a penis\".",
      "Later that year he told BBC Radio 5 Live \"a woman is an adult female\".",
      "And in April 2024 he said Rosie Duffield, who quit the party last year, was right to say \"only women have a cervix\", telling ITV: \"Biologically, she of course is right about that.\"",
      "Sir Keir had previously been critical of Duffield's views on trans people when she was a Labour MP, saying in 2021 that she was \"not right\" to say only women have a cervix.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir would now use a trans woman's preferred pronouns, the spokesman declined to comment on \"hypotheticals\" but insisted the PM had \"been clear that trans women should be treated with the same dignity and respect as anyone else\".",
      "Earlier on Tuesday Sir Keir welcomed the court's decision, saying it had given \"much-needed clarity\" for those drawing up guidance.",
      "In his first public comments since the ruling last week, the PM told ITV West Country: \"We need to move and make sure that we now ensure that all guidance is in the right place according to that judgment.\"",
      "Asked if he does not believe a transwoman is a woman, he said: \"A woman is an adult female, and the court has made that absolutely clear.\"",
      "During a Commons debate on the ruling on Monday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson welcomed the \"added clarity\" of the ruling and said the government would work to \"protect single-sex spaces based on biological sex\".",
      "But Badenoch attacked Labour ministers' previous record, accusing them of being \"so desperate to jump on a bandwagon that they abandoned common sense\".",
      "\"I know what a woman is and I always have,\" she said. \"The people of this country know what a woman is.",
      "\"We didn't need the Supreme Court to tell us that - but this government did.\"",
      "Badenoch added: \"The idea that they have supported this all along is for the birds... They have never said this before, this is a U-turn, but we welcome it.\"",
      "Earlier, Phillipson was pressed over whether a trans woman should use a women's toilet or a men's toilet.",
      "\"That should be on the basis of biological sex - that would apply right across the board to all single-sex provision,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"But the EHRC [Equality and Human Rights Commission] will be setting out additional guidance and a statutory code of practice because we need to make sure that everyone has the ability to access services that are safe and appropriate and respect their privacy and dignity.\"",
      "Phillipson added that \"many businesses have moved towards unisex provision or separate cubicles that can be used by anyone\".",
      "Asked whether there was unity in the Labour Party about this issue, she replied: \"I speak for the government on this matter and I can be crystal clear with you that we welcome the ruling.\"",
      "Many Labour MPs will be uneasy about the comments from Sir Keir and Phillipson, although frustration did not seem to extend to being willing to criticise the government, but instead expressing concern about anxieties within the trans, non-binary and intersex community.",
      "In the debate following Phillipson's statement, Labour's Emily Thornberry said LGBT helpline calls had \"skyrocketed in recent days\" and highlighted that \"the overwhelming threat to women and to all of the trans community is the violence that we suffer from cis men\".",
      "Nadia Whittome pointed out that a ban on trans women using women's toilets, or trans men using men's toilets, would leave them using facilities they \"would not feel comfortable or safe in\".",
      "Liberal Democrat women and equalities spokeswoman Christine Jardine warned the ruling threatened the human rights and security \"of another vulnerable group in society\" and questioned where trans people should now seek refuge.",
      "Women and Equalities select committee chair, Labour's Sarah Owen, said the judges made their decision \"without a single contribution from trans people\" and won a commitment from Phillipson that trans \"stakeholders\" would be involved in the creation of upcoming guidance.",
      "Some MPs who have campaigned in support of trans rights pointed to commitments in Labour's general election manifesto to introduce a \"trans-inclusive ban on conversion practices\" as well as to \"modernise, simplify, and reform\" gender recognition law.",
      "Those are still Labour Party policies, as far as we are aware, but any sign of backsliding on that and this debate may again become a tense one within Labour's ranks.",
      "Correction: This article originally said that the ruling means that transgender women with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) can be excluded from single-sex spaces if \"proportionate\". However this is inaccurate and so this line has been removed from the story.",

      "The recording of non-crime hate incidents by police forces in England and Wales should be scrapped in all but a few cases, the Conservatives have said.",
      "The party will try to amend the government's Crime and Policing Bill to ban forces from logging such incidents, except in limited circumstances.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said non-crime hate incidents (NCHIs) had \"wasted police time chasing ideology and grievance instead of justice\".",
      "But Policing Minister Diana Johnson said the plan was \"unworkable\" and \"would prevent the police monitoring serious antisemitism and other racist incidents\".",
      "NCHIs are defined as alleged acts perceived to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards people with certain characteristics, such as race or gender.",
      "They are recorded to collect data on \"hate incidents that could escalate into more serious harm\" but do not amount to a criminal offence, according to Home Office guidance.",
      "Police guidance on the recording of NCHIs was first published in 2005, following recommendations by an inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence.",
      "Tuesday marks 32 years since he was murdered in a racially motivated attack in south-east London.",
      "The Tories said it was not intentional that their announcement came on the anniversary.",
      "NCHIs are not recorded nationally by a single source and not all police forces publish data on the number of incidents they log.",
      "Last year, the Telegraph newspaper reported that 43 forces in England and Wales had recorded more than 133,000 non-crime hate incidents (NCHI) since 2014.",
      "In 2023, the Conservative government changed the guidance on the recording of NCHIs in England and Wales.",

      "But the Conservatives under Badenoch's leadership are saying the \"use of NCHIs has spiralled out of control\".",
      "Badenoch said police forces did not follow the updated guidelines on the use of NCHIs \"so it's time to get rid of them completely\".",
      "The party said under its plans, only senior officers would be allowed to record NCHIs in clearly defined circumstances, such as the prevention or investigation or actual crimes.",
      "\"The British public want police on the streets - fighting crime and protecting families - not trawling social media for things someone might find offensive,\" Badenoch said.",
      "She said Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"stand up, show some courage, and back real policing over political correctness\".",
      "Policing minister Diana Johnson said the Tories had \"14 years in charge of policing to set priorities or make policy changes in this area, and failed to do so\".",
      "She added: \"Instead of introducing unworkable and half-baked measures which would prevent the police monitoring serious antisemitism and other racist incidents, the Tories should support the Labour government's prioritisation of neighbourhood policing and serious violence.\"",
      "A Reform UK spokesman said: \"The Tories had 14 years in government to do this, instead we saw non-crime hate incidents surge under their watch.",
      "\"Reform are clear, we want to get more bobbies on the beat and put an end to two-tier policing in Britain. Police forces across the country should be focussed on solving real crimes, not policing social media posts.\"",

      "Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"While we welcome the intentions behind the programme, the initial feedback we are hearing from many school leaders participating in the pilot is that the funding just isn't sufficient.",
      "\"At a time when school budgets are already stretched, most can ill-afford to subsidise this shortfall.\"",
      "He added it was \"absolutely crucial\" the funding is addressed before the scheme is rolled out nationally and it has received assurance from the government the funding would be looked at carefully during the trial.",
      "Teaching union NASUWT said the scheme would make a \"significant contribution\" to tackling child hunger but it needed to be closely monitored to ensure funding issues can be addressed without it impacting other provisions within schools.",
      "Announcing the first 750 schools to join the pilot scheme, the Department for Education said breakfast clubs had \"an important role to play in the government's commitment to remove the stain of child poverty\".",
      "Education Secretary Phillipson said: \"Free breakfast clubs are at the heart of our Plan for Change, making working parents' lives easier and more affordable, while breaking down barriers to opportunity for every child.\"",
      "Reacting to the upcoming launch of the scheme, shadow education minister Neil O'Brien said the Conservative government supported more than 2,000 schools through its national school breakfast club programme and he criticised Labour for scrapping planned reforms to child benefit.",
      "''Children and their families deserve better,\" he added.",
      "Devon tops the list with 25 schools in the programme, followed by England's largest local authority, Birmingham, with 24.",
      "Both Wales and Scotland have programmes to provide free breakfasts to children in some primary schools.",
      "Guidance sent to schools taking part in the pilot scheme says they will receive a set-up payment to cover equipment and material.",
      "Under the scheme, schools will then be reimbursed by the government based on attendance at the clubs - a school with 50% participation in the pilot scheme could get \u00a323,000 a year, the government said."

    "story": [
      "Most fire services in England are facing a shortfall in funding after the government failed to give them the same level of compensation for tax increases as the police.",
      "The government is giving police forces an extra \u00a3230m which it says will fully cover the cost of the rise in employers' National Insurance contributions (Nics) which came into force last week.",
      "Fire services face a similar rise in their wages bill \u2013 but the 31 that are directly funded by the government will only get top-up funds that cover 50% of the increase on average, according to BBC research.",
      "One fire service said the 50% shortfall was the same cost as \"a fully-staffed fire engine\".",
      "Tax hike could push surgeries \u2018over the edge' - GP",
      "Warning 'pain' of tax hikes to hit jobs and pay rises",
      "A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) declined to comment on the discrepancy but did thank firefighters for their \"dedication\".",
      "The government faced a backlash from business and charities after Chancellor Rachel Reeves used her first Budget to increase Nics made by employers from 13.8% to 15%.",
      "The Treasury says it will cover the extra costs faced by government departments and public sector employers.",
      "In February, the then minister for policing, Dame Diana Johnson, told MPs the national insurance increases would be \"fully funded\" in the police settlement \u2013 the annual funding agreement for forces in England and Wales.",
      "The government also provided \u00a3502m in top-up funds for fire authorities and councils in their annual settlement grant to cover Nics rises.",
      "But the National Fire Chiefs Council says that even with the extra money fire services will be \u00a320m short of the \u00a340m needed to cover national insurance increases.",
      "The BBC contacted all 43 fire authority in England to ask how much the NICs increase is set to cost and cross-referenced that with the size of the grant they are getting to compensate for it.",
      "The data obtained shows the average shortfall to be 50%.",
      "It covers three quarters of the fire services in England and Wales, because 10 fire authorities do not separate out grant money from the money given to the whole county council.",
      "But the Home Office's own estimate is that the cost of the Nics rise to all fire authorities is \u00a340m, which also lends weight to the fire chiefs' claims of a 50% shortfall.",
      "NFCC chair Phil Garrigan said: \"Bridging this gap in funding and making sure there is sustained investment in fire and rescue will be crucial for ensuring we can continue to keep communities safe.",
      "\"What we would have reasonably expected to see is fire treated in the same way as our colleagues in the police, with the whole shortfall covered.\"",
      "Biggest shortfall",
      "Fire Brigades Union general secretary Steve Wright said fire services had already had more than a decade of cuts and the Nics shortfall was coming on top of \" yet another below inflation funding settlement\".",
      "\"If national insurance contributions are not covered fully by central funds, this will further eat into fire service budgets,\" he said.",
      "\"When compared to the police, the cost of covering the rise in national insurance contributions for the fire service is very small, so we urge the government to do the right thing and to avoid another de-facto cut.\"",
      "Funding for fire services is complex because there are several different types of fire authority split into two funding models - but nearly three-quarters of fire authorities have received direct grants from the government, worth \u00a311.9m overall.",
      "Those direct grants were provided to 31 fire authorities - five authorities run by metro mayors and 26 combined fire authorities (CFAs), five of which have Police, Fire and Crime Commissioners (PFCCs).",
      "The biggest shortfall was 67% in West Yorkshire, followed by 60% in Humberside, and the smallest was 17% in Essex, followed by 32% in Cumbria.",
      "There are 10 more fire authorities where a county council runs the fire service, and Nics grants for the fire service were mixed in with the Nics top-ups for council staff, making the total for just the fire service difficult to untangle.",
      "London and Greater Manchester also have their own structures, where the mayor has overall responsibility for Fire and Rescue services, and funding is again not separated out from Nics grants for council staff.",
      "Budget papers from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Services confirmed estimates suggested they could see a 50% shortfall in funding, which \"would equate to the cost of one fully-staffed fire engine\".",
      "A spokesman for London Fire Brigade said the mayor of London had provided an additional \u00a32.5m top-up funding to cover the \u00a34.4m (36%) shortfall left by the government grant.",

    "story": [
      "Steak, mashed potatoes and desserts for astronauts could soon be grown from individual cells in space if an experiment launched into orbit today is successful.",
      "A European Space Agency (ESA) project is assessing the viability of growing so-called lab-grown food in the low gravity and higher radiation in orbit and on other worlds.",
      "ESA is funding the research to explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut, which can cost up to \u00a320,000 per day.",
      "The team involved say the experiment is a first step to developing a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station in two years' time.",
      "Lab-grown food will be essential if Nasa's objective of making humanity a multi-planetary species were to be realised, claims Dr Aqeel Shamsul, CEO and founder of Bedford-based Frontier Space, which is developing the concept with researchers at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"Our dream is to have factories in orbit and on the Moon,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We need to build manufacturing facilities off world if we are to provide the infrastructure to enable humans to live and work in space\".",
      "Lab-grown food involves growing food ingredients, such as protein, fat and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats and then processing them to make them look and taste like normal food.",
      "Lab-grown chicken is already on sale in the US and Singapore and lab grown steak is awaiting approval in the UK and Israel. On Earth, there are claimed environmental benefits for the technology over traditional agricultural food production methods, such as less land use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. But in space the primary driver is to reduce costs.",
      "The researchers are doing the experiment because it costs so much to send astronauts food on the ISS - up to \u00a320,000 per astronaut per day, they estimate.",
      "Nasa, other space agencies and private sector firms plan to have a long-term presence on the Moon, in orbiting space stations and maybe one day on Mars. That will mean sending up food for tens and eventually hundreds of astronauts living and working in space \u2013 something that would be prohibitively expensive if it were sent up by rockets, according to Dr Shamsul.",
      "Growing food in space would make much more sense, he suggests.",
      "\"We could start off simply with protein-enhanced mashed potatoes on to more complex foods which we could put together in space,\" he tells me.",
      "\"But in the longer term we could put the lab-grown ingredients into a 3D printer and print off whatever you want on the space station, such as a steak!\"",
      "This sounds like the replicator machines on Star Trek, which are able to produce food and drink from pure energy. But it is no longer the stuff of science fiction, says Dr Shamsul.",
      "He showed me a set-up, called a bioreactor, at Imperial College's Bezos Centre for Sustainable Proteins in west London. It comprised a brick-coloured concoction bubbling away in a test tube. The process is known as precision fermentation, which is like the fermentation used to make beer, but different: \"precision\" is a rebranding word for genetically engineered.",
      "In this case a gene has been added to yeast to produce extra vitamins, but all sorts of ingredients can be produced in this way, according to Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro, Director of the Bezos Centre.",
      "\"We can make all the elements to make food,\" says Dr Ledesma-Amaro proudly.",
      "\"We can make proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibres and they can be combined to make different dishes.\"",
      "A much smaller, simpler version of the biorector has been sent into space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of the ESA mission. There is plenty of evidence that foods can be successfully grown from cells on Earth, but can the process be repeated in the weightlessness and higher radiation of space?",
      "Drs Ledesma-Amaro and Shamsul have sent small amounts of the yeast concoction to orbit the Earth in a small cube satellite on board Europe's first commercial returnable spacecraft, Phoenix. If all goes to plan, it will orbit the Earth for around three hours before falling back to Earth off the coast of Portugal. The experiment will be retrieved by a recovery vessel and sent back to the lab in London to be examined.",
      "The data they gather will inform the construction of a larger, better bioreactor which the scientists will send into space next year, according to Dr Ledesma-Amaro.",
      "The problem, though, is that the brick-coloured goo, which is dried into a powder, looks distinctly unappetising \u2013 even less appetising than the freeze-dried fare that astronauts currently have to put up with.",
      "That is where Imperial College's master chef comes in. Jakub Radzikowski is the culinary education designer tasked with turning chemistry into cuisine.",
      "He isn't allowed to use lab grown ingredients to make dishes for people just yet, because regulatory approval is still pending. But he's getting a head start. For now, instead of lab-grown ingredients, Jakub is using starches and proteins from naturally occurring fungi to develop his recipes. He tells me all sorts of dishes will be possible, once he gets the go-ahead to use lab-grown ingredients.",
      "\"We want to create food that is familiar to astronauts who are from different parts of the world so that it can provide comfort.",
      "\"We can create anything from French, Chinese, Indian. It will be possible to replicate any kind of cuisine in space.\"",
      "Today, Jakub is trying out a new recipe of spicy dumplings and dipping sauce. He tells me that I am allowed to try them out, but taster-in-chief is someone far more qualified: Helen Sharman, the UK's first astronaut, who also has a PhD in chemistry.",
      "We tasted the steaming dumplings together.",
      "My view: \"They are absolutely gorgeous!\"",
      "Dr Sharman's expert view, not dissimilar: \"You get a really strong blast from the flavour. It is really delicious and very moreish,\" she beamed.",
      "\"I would love to have had something like this. When I was in space, I had really long-life stuff: tins, freeze dried packets, tubes of stuff. It was fine, but not tasty.\"",
      "Dr Sharman's more important observation was about the science. Lab-grown food, she said, could potentially be better for astronauts, as well as reduce costs to the levels required to make long-term off-world habitation viable.",
      "Research on the ISS has shown that the biochemistry of astronauts' bodies changes during long duration space missions: their hormone balance and iron levels alter, and they lose calcium from their bones. Astronauts take supplements to compensate, but lab-grown food could in principle be tweaked with the extra ingredients already built in, says Dr Sharman.",
      "\"Astronauts tend to lose weight because they are not eating as much because they don't have the variety and interest in their diet,\" she told me.",
      "\"So, astronauts might be more open to having something that has been cooked from scratch and a feeling that you are really eating wholesome food.\"",

      "It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.",
      "In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.",

      "However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.",
      "The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.",
      "It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as \"Carbon Tax Carney\".",

      "\"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\"",
      "Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into \"a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy\".",

      "There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.",
      "Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.",

      "Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.",
      "That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.",

      "A huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim.",
      "Now scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be.",
      "BBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues.",
      "Just weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes.",
      "It was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust.",
      "Prof Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored.",
      "\"It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,\" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side.",
      "This work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent.",
      "Santorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a \"period of unrest\", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands \"swelled up\".",
      "\"Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,\" she says.",
      "\"We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,\" she says.",
      "The Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned.",
      "Beneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds.",
      "\"We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,\" Isobel says.",
      "The robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock.",
      "Those vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes.",
      "They are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month.",
      "So far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma.",
      "\"We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,\" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. \"We have to look inside the earth,\" she says.",
      "The Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island.",
      "The two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time.",
      "The expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis.",
      "She is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist.",
      "\"This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,\" she says.",
      "It will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds.",
      "These missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts.",
      "John Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents.",
      "\"Don't pick that one up,\" he warns. \"It's full of arsenic.\"",
      "Pointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: \"This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.\"",
      "These rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. \"This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,\" he says.",
      "But the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall.",
      "Using a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found.",
      "They have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.",
      "They identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.",
      "This is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated.",
      "\"We are doing science for the people, not science for the scientists. We are here to make people feel safe,\" Paraskevi says.",
      "The recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism.",
      "Back on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter.",

      "Once we're back down the mountain, Asif pulls up his computer and shows me a dashboard. There I am, in a series of GIFs. It correctly detects I'm a human. But as we scroll down the list, I come up again, and this time I'm listed as both a human and an animal. I'm wearing a thick white fleece, so I forgive the programme.",
      "Then, Asif shows me the money shot. It's a snow leopard, recorded a few nights prior, in night-vision. He pulls up another one from the week before. It's a snow leopard raising its tail against a nearby rock. \"It's a mother leopard, looks like she's marking her territory,\" Asif says.",
      "Setting up the cameras in rocky, high-altitude areas took a lot of trial and error. The WWF went through several types of batteries until it found one that could withstand the harsh winters. A specific paint was chosen to avoid reflecting light as animals pass by.",
      "If the cellular service fails in the mountains, the device continues recording and capturing data locally. But the team has had to accept there are some problems they simply cannot solve.",
      "While the camera lens is protected by a metallic box, they've had to replace solar panels damaged by landslides.",
      "Doubt in the community",
      "It is not just the technology that has caused problems. Getting the local community's buy-in has also been a challenge. At first, some were suspicious and doubted whether the project could help them or the snow leopards.",
      "\"We noticed some of the wires had been cut,\" Asif says. \"People had thrown blankets over the cameras.\"",
      "The team also had to be mindful of the local culture and the emphasis on women's privacy. Cameras had to be moved because women were walking by too often.",
      "Some villages still have yet to sign consent and privacy forms, which means the technology cannot be rolled out in their area just yet. The WWF wants a binding promise that local farmers will not give poachers access to the footage.",
      "Sitara lost all six of her sheep in January. She says she had taken them to graze on land above her home but that a snow leopard attacked them.",
      "\"It was three to four years of hard work raising those animals, and it all ended in one day,\" she says.",
      "The loss of her livelihood left her bedridden for several days. When asked if she is hopeful the AI cameras could help in the future, she replies: \"My phone barely gets any service during the day, how can a text help?\"",
      "At a gathering of village elders, leaders of the Khyber village explain how attitudes have changed over the years, and that a growing proportion of their village understands the importance of snow leopards and their impact on the ecosystem.",
      "According to the WWF, snow leopards hunt ibex and blue sheep, which stops these animals from overgrazing and helps to preserve grasslands so villagers can feed their livestock.",
      "But not all are convinced. One local farmer questions the benefits of the animals.",
      "\"We used to have 40 to 50 sheep, now we've only got four or five, and the reason is the threat from snow leopards and from ibex eating the grass,\" he says.",
      "Climate change also has a part to play in why some feel threatened by snow leopards. Scientists say warming temperatures have led villagers to move their crops and livestock to higher areas in the mountains, encroaching on snow leopards' own habitat, making livestock more of a target.",
      "Whether the villagers are convinced by the conservation message or not, the WWF tells us legal penalties have served as a strong deterrent in recent years. Three men were jailed in 2020 after killing a snow leopard in Hoper valley, about a two-hour drive from Khyber. One of them had posted photos of himself with the dead animal on social media.",
      "While those involved in the camera project are hopeful their AI devices can have an impact, they know they cannot be the sole solution.",
      "In September, they are going to start trialling smells, sounds and lights at the camera sites to try to deter snow leopards from moving onto nearby villages, putting themselves and livestock in jeopardy.",

    "summary": "A pilot project will test whether it is a useful way of fighting climate change.",
    "story": [
      "A ground-breaking project to suck carbon out of the sea has started operating on England's south coast.",
      "The small pilot scheme, known as SeaCURE, is funded by the UK government as part of its search for technologies that fight climate change.",
      "There's broad consensus among climate scientists that the overwhelming priority is to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the chief cause of global warming.",
      "But many scientists also believe that part of the solution will have to involve capturing some of the gases that have already been released.",
      "These projects, known as carbon capture, usually focus either on capturing emissions at source or pulling them from the air.",
      "What makes SeaCure interesting is that it is testing whether it might be more efficient to pull planet-warming carbon from the sea, since it is present in greater concentrations in water than in the air.",
      "To reach the project's entrance you have to go round the back of the Weymouth Sealife Centre and walk past a sign that says \"Caution: Moray Eels may Bite\".",
      "There's a reason this ground-breaking project has been placed here.",
      "It's a pipe that snakes under the stony beach and out into the English Channel, sucking up seawater and bringing it onshore.",
      "The project is trying to find whether removing carbon from the water might be a cost effective way of reducing the amount of the climate warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere.",
      "SeaCURE processes the seawater to remove the carbon before pumping it back out to sea where it absorbs more CO2.",
      "We're the first broadcast journalists to visit and Professor Tom Bell from Plymouth Marine Laboratory is tasked with showing us around.",
      "He explains that the process begins by treating some of the seawater to make it more acidic. This encourages the carbon that's dissolved in the seawater to turn into a gas and be released into the atmosphere as CO2.",
      "\"This is the seawater stripper\" Prof Bell says with a smile as we turn a corner.",
      "The \"stripper\" is a large stainless steel tank which maximises the amount of contact between the acidic seawater and the air.",
      "\"When you open a fizzy drink it froths, that's the CO2 coming out.\" Prof Bell says. \"What we're doing by spreading the seawater on a large surface area. It's a bit like pouring a drink on the floor and allowing the CO2 to come out of the seawater really quickly.\"",
      "The CO2 that emerges into the air is sucked away and then concentrated using charred coconut husks ready to be stored.",
      "The low-carbon seawater then has alkali added to it \u2013 to neutralise the acid that was added \u2013 and is then pumped back out into a stream that flows into the sea.",
      "Once back in the sea it immediately starts to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere contributing in a very small way to reducing greenhouse gases.",
      "There are already much more developed carbon capture technologies which take carbon directly out of the air \u2013 but Dr Paul Halloran who leads the SeaCURE project tells me that using water instead has its advantages.",
      "\"Seawater has got loads of carbon in it compared to the air, about 150 times more,\" says Dr Halloran.",
      "\"But it has got different challenges, the energy requirements to generate the products that we require to do this from seawater are huge.\"",
      "At present the amount of CO2 this pilot project is removing is tiny \u2013 at most 100 metric tonnes per year \u2013 that's less CO2 than a commercial plane emits crossing the Atlantic. But given the size of the world's oceans those behind SeaCURE think it has potential.",
      "In its submission to the UK government SeaCURE said the technology had the potential to be massively scaled up to remove 14 billion tonnes of CO2 a year if 1% of the world's seawater on the ocean's surface was processed.",
      "For that to be plausible the entire process for stripping the carbon \u2013 would have to be powered by renewable energy. Possibly by solar panels in a floating installation at sea.",
      "\"Carbon removal is necessary. If you want to reach net zero emissions and net zero emissions is needed to halt further warming,\" says Dr Oliver Geden who's part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and an expert in carbon capture.",
      "\"Capturing directly from seawater is one of the options. Directly capturing it from the air is another one. There are basically 15 to 20 options, and in the end the question of what to use, of course, will depend on the cost.\"",
      "The Seacure project has \u00a33m of funding from the government and is one of 15 pilot projects being backed in the UK as part of efforts to develop technologies that capture and store greenhouse gases.",
      "\"Removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere is essential in helping us achieve net zero,\" says energy minister Kerry McCarthy. \"Innovative projects like SeaCURE at the University of Exeter play an important role in creating the green technologies needed to make this happen, while supporting skilled jobs and boosting growth.\"",
      "'Some impact on environment'",
      "There's also the question of what a large quantity of low-carbon water would do to the sea and the things that live in it. In Weymouth it dribbles out of a pipe in such small quantities it is unlikely to have any impact.",
      "Guy Hooper is a PhD student at Exeter University and is researching the possible impacts of the project. He's been exposing marine creatures to low-carbon water under laboratory conditions.",
      "\"Marine organisms rely on carbon to do certain things,\" he says. \"So phytoplankton use carbon to photosynthesize while things like mussels also use carbon to build their shells.\"",
      "Hooper says early indications are that massively increasing the amount of low-carbon water could have some impact on the environment.",
      "\"It might be damaging but there might be ways to mitigate that \u2013 for example through pre-diluting the low-carbon water. It's important this is included in the discussion early on.\"",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have found new but tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star may be home to life.",
      "A Cambridge team studying the atmosphere of a planet called K2-18b has detected signs of molecules which on Earth are only produced by simple organisms.",
      "This is the second, and more promising, time chemicals associated with life have been detected in the planet's atmosphere by Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).",
      "But the team and independent astronomers stress that more data is needed to confirm these results.",
      "The lead researcher, Prof Nikku Madhusudhan, told me at his lab at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.",
      "\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there. I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"",
      "K2-18b is two-and-a-half times the size of Earth and is 700 trillion miles, or 124 light years, away from us - a distance far beyond what any human could travel in a lifetime.",
      "JWST is so powerful that it can analyse the chemical composition of the planet's atmosphere from the light that passes through from the small red Sun it orbits.",
      "The Cambridge group has found that the atmosphere seems to contain the chemical signature of at least one of two molecules that are associated with life: dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). On Earth, these gases are produced by marine phytoplankton and bacteria.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan said he was surprised by how much gas was apparently detected during a single observation window.",
      "\"The amount we estimate of this gas in the atmosphere is thousands of times higher than what we have on Earth,\" he said.",
      "\"So, if the association with life is real, then this planet will be teeming with life,\" he added.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan went further: \"If we confirm that there is life on K2-18b, it should basically confirm that life is very common in the galaxy.\"",
      "He told BBC Radio 5Live on Thursday: \"This is a very important moment in science, but also very important to us as a species.",
      "\"If there is one example, and the universe being infinite, there is a chance for life on many more planets.\"",
      "Dr Subir Sarkar, a lecturer in astrophysics at Cardiff University and part of the research team, said the research suggests K2-18b could have an ocean which could be potentially full of life - though he cautioned scientists \"don't know for sure\".",
      "He added that the research team's work will continue to focus on looking for life on other planets: \"Keep watching this space.\"",
      "The truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans",
      "There are lots of \"ifs\" and \"buts\" at this stage, as Prof Madhusudhan's team freely admits.",
      "Firstly, this latest detection is not at the standard required to claim a discovery.",
      "For that, the researchers need to be about 99.99999% sure that their results are correct and not a fluke reading. In scientific jargon, that is a five sigma result.",
      "These latest results are only three sigma, or 99.7%. Which sounds like a lot, but it is not enough to convince the scientific community. However, it is much more than the one sigma result of 68% the team obtained 18 months ago, which was greeted with much scepticism at the time.",
      "But even if the Cambridge team obtains a five sigma result, that won't be conclusive proof that life exists on the planet, according to Prof Catherine Heymans of Edinburgh University and Scotland's Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team.",
      "\"Even with that certainty, there is still the question of what is the origin of this gas,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"On Earth it is produced by microorganisms in the ocean, but even with perfect data we can't say for sure that this is of a biological origin on an alien world because loads of strange things happen in the Universe and we don't know what other geological activity could be happening on this planet that might produce the molecules.\"",
      "That view is one the Cambridge team agree with. They are working with other groups to see if DMS and DMDS can be produced by non-living means in the lab.",
      "\"There is still a 0.3% chance that it might be a statistical fluke,\" Prof Madhusudhan said.",
      "Suggesting life may exist on another planet was \"a big claim if true\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding: \"So we want to be really, really thorough, and make more observations, and get the evidence to the level that there is less than a one-in-a-million chance of it being a fluke.\"",
      "He said this should be possible in \"maybe one or two years\".",
      "Other research groups have put forward alternative, lifeless, explanations for the data obtained from K2-18b. There is a strong scientific debate not only about whether DMS and DMDS are present but also the planet's composition.",
      "The reason many researchers infer that the planet has a vast liquid ocean is the absence of the gas ammonia in K2-18b's atmosphere. Their theory is that the ammonia is absorbed by a vast body of water below.",
      "But it could equally be explained by an ocean of molten rock, which would preclude life, according to Prof Oliver Shorttle of Cambridge University.",
      "\"Everything we know about planets orbiting other stars comes from the tiny amounts of light that glance off their atmospheres. So it is an incredibly tenuous signal that we are having to read, not only for signs of life, but everything else,\" he said.",
      "\"With K2-18b part of the scientific debate is still about the structure of the planet.\"",
      "Dr Nicolas Wogan at Nasa's Ames Research Center has yet another interpretation of the data. He published research suggesting that K2-18b is a mini gas giant with no surface.",
      "Both these alternative interpretations have also been challenged by other groups on the grounds that they are inconsistent with the data from JWST, compounding the strong scientific debate surrounding K2-18b.",
      "Prof Chris Lintott, presenter of the BBC's The Sky at Night, said he had \"great admiration\" for Prof Madhusudhan's team, but was treating the research with caution.",
      "\"I think we've got to be very careful about claiming that this is 'a moment' on the search to life. We've [had] such moments before,\" he told Today.",
      "He said the research should be seen instead as \"part of a huge effort to try and understand what's out there in the cosmos\".",
      "Prof Madhusudhan acknowledges that there is still a scientific mountain to climb if he is to answer one of the biggest questions in science. But he believes he and his team are on the right track.",
      "\"Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach,\" he said.",
      "\"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering.\"",

      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",

    "summary": "Amid tariff threats from the US, energy and economic security are key issues in Canada's federal election.",
    "story": [
      "As the threat posed by US President Donald Trump tops Canada's federal election agenda, the issue of the country's contribution to global warming has been largely overshadowed.",
      "The two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US.",
      "Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax.",
      "It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.",
      "In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.",
      "That sense of unity is now long gone.",
      "Carney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change.",
      "As well as being a governor of the Bank of England, he was a UN Special Envoy on climate action and finance and was co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, one of the big outcomes of COP26.",
      "However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.",
      "The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.",
      "It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as \"Carbon Tax Carney\".",

      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "Some observers believe that cancelling the tax was a smart political move, others feel it was a mistake.",
      "\"By making one of your first moves the removal of the carbon price, you're accepting this narrative that climate change policy costs us too much money and isn't good for us, when, in fact, that is not the case,\" said Catherine Abreu, who is director of the International Climate Politics Hub and a member of Canada's Net Zero Advisory Body.",
      "\"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\"",
      "Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into \"a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy\".",
      "He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.",
      "There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.",
      "Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.",
      "The war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals.",
      "\"We have had a parade of geopolitical allies turning up on our doorstep saying, we want your rocks, we want Canada to be the geopolitically secure primary resource commodity provider, in place of Russia,\" said Mark Winfield, a professor in the faculty of environmental and urban change at Toronto's York University.",
      "\"And that's created another sort of dynamic in all of this, which was not present in previous elections.\"",
      "Pierre Poilievre is the man seeking to replace Carney as PM.",
      "He is running on cost of living issues, and advocating for tougher policies on law and order and what he considers \"woke\" cultural issues.",
      "Poilievre, whose party has a strong voter base in energy-rich regions of the country, is pushing for a major expansion of the oil and gas industries and the removal of the carbon tax on industry.",
      "While he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace \"dirty coal\" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas.",
      "According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.",
      "He told the BBC it's more \"at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable\".",
      "Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.",
      "That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.",
      "\"Our relationship with the US has completely changed,\" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates.",
      "\"The pipelines are a national security problem for us.\"",
      "That concern over US dependence has revived interest in pipelines that would move oil and gas from the western provinces, where they are mainly produced, to the east, where they could be exported to new overseas markets.",
      "A previous attempt called the Energy East pipeline was shelved in 2017 due to a number of factors, including fierce opposition from some regions of the country and regulatory hurdles.",
      "In this campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised to fast track \"energy corridors\",  though Carney has flip-flopped on his support for pipelines, knowing they are deeply unpopular with environmentalists.",
      "He is trying to walk a fine line between defending Canada as a nation under threat from Trump, and taking action on a warming climate.",
      "The Insurance Bureau of Canada reported that in 2024, there were C$8.5bn ($6.1bn;  \u00a34.6bn) in weather-related insured losses, triple the figure for 2023.",
      "And while the two election frontrunners are advocating a major role for fossil fuels in Canada's economy, this approach will clash head on with the country's climate commitments.",
      "Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a federal party based in Quebec, has accused the pair of being in a \"denial situation about climate change\".",
      "\"I'm sorry to crash your party guys, but you are telling fairy tales\" about clean oil and gas, he said in last week's debates.",
      "Canada has promised on the international stage to curb carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 based on the levels in 2005.",
      "As of 2023, carbon output was only down 8.5%.",
      "Whoever wins the election will have a real challenge to square that circle.",
      "Canadians go to the polls on 28 April."

    "story": [
      "A medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport is continuing to confound archaeologists, as the mysteries surrounding it are multiplying.",
      "The discovery of the site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century, was announced last year, with dozens of skeletons found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts.",
      "Now researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women, and while their bones show signs of wear and tear - indicating they carried out heavy manual work - there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury.",
      "Another unexpected find has been a woman tossed in a ditch, in stark contrast to all  the other people who were buried with great care.",
      "\"Every time we think we understand something, something else crops up and the picture gets more intriguing,\" said Andy Seaman from Cardiff University, who is leading the project.",
      "About half the site, which lies in an unremarkable field in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, has now been excavated.",
      "So far researchers have found 39 adult skeletons lying in graves carved out of the thick limestone bedrock. A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female.",
      "\"I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery.\"",
      "The skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features.",
      "\"The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,\" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University.",
      "\"It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery.\"",
      "Artefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were.",
      "Shards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead.",
      "\"Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels.\"",
      "The presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west.",
      "The team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal.",
      "They have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her.",
      "Osteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s.",
      "Her skeleton shows a healed fracture to her arm, while her tooth was infected and had an abscess, which exposed the roots and must have been painful.",
      "Ten of the skeletons are also now undergoing more detailed analysis.",
      "The results show the people buried in the cemetery aren't all from the immediate area - they come from all over Wales and possibly from the south-west of England too.",
      "Further DNA analysis will also reveal whether any of them were related.",
      "The team are particularly interested in the skeletons' teeth.",
      "Because of the way teeth grow, they provide a unique record of everything someone has eaten from the time they are weaned right through to their death.",
      "\"They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs - but not a lot of meat,\" said Dr Faillace. \"And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood, and that's something we're seeing across the population.",
      "\"But there was no fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries.\"",
      "The dig is continuing this summer and the archaeologists will start to unearth the other half of the cemetery.",
      "Andy Seaman is hoping to be able to answer the questions the site has thrown up.",
      "\"We're hoping to tell the story of the individuals within the cemetery, but also the broader community,\" he said.",
      "\"We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but much less about everyday people. And never before really have we been able to explore a single community in so much detail and all the interesting inter-relationships.\"",

    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",

    "story": [
      "The European Union has ordered Apple and Meta to pay a combined \u20ac700m (\u00a3599m) in the first fines it has issued under recent legislation intended to curb the power of big tech.",
      "It has issued a \u20ac500m (\u00a3428m) fine to Apple over its App Store, while Meta has been fined \u20ac200m (\u00a3171m) over the way it handled user data.",
      "\"We have a duty to protect the rights of citizens and innovative businesses in Europe,\" Commissioner Henna Virkkunen said in a statement.",
      "The two tech firms have reacted angrily, with Meta accusing the EU of \"attempting to handicap successful American businesses\" and Apple saying it was being \"unfairly targeted\" and forced to \"give away our technology for free.\"",
      "The fines are lower than some of those issued by the EU in the past but - given the heightened economic tensions with America - still risk angering US President Donald Trump.",
      "The US has levied a 10% tariff on imports from the EU, which Trump has accused of \"taking advantage\" of America.",
      "EU spokesperson Arianna Podesta insisted the matters were \"completely separate\", telling the BBC: \"This is about enforcement, it's not about trade negotiations.\"",

      "Cookies and apps",
      "The European Commission - the EU's executive - started both investigations last year under a new law brought in to promote fairness in the tech sector called the Digital Markets Act (DMA).",
      "The case against Apple was over its App Store.",
      "The Commission says it must freely offer alternative app marketplaces to users and app developers - and says Apple was in breach of this.",
      "Meanwhile, Meta's fine was over the way it handled cookies - the bits of code embedded into websites which gather information about users.",
      "Meta introduced a \"consent or pay\" model on Facebook and Instagram, which meant users had to choose between allowing cookies to track them, or pay a monthly subscription.",
      "The Commission says this model did not allow users to freely consent to how their data was used.",
      "In both cases, the Commission says the size of the fine takes into account \"the gravity and duration of the non-compliance\".",
      "Both companies have 60 days to comply or risk further fines.",
      "\"Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the DMA by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms,\" said Commissioner Teresa Ribera.",
      "\"As a result, we have taken firm but balanced enforcement action against both companies, based on clear and predictable rules.\"",
      "Apple said the Commission had made \"a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free.\"",
      "It also accused the Commission of \"[moving] the goal posts\" during their meetings.",
      "Meta said the ruling means Chinese and European companies are allowed to operate to different standards compared to American businesses.",
      "\"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Epic dispute",
      "The fines are relatively small given the tech companies' huge worldwide revenues - and are a fraction of Google's \u20ac2.4bn fine from last September.",
      "But they are significant in the context of the current global economic situation.",
      "In February, Donald Trump's White House issued a memorandum complaining about EU and UK regulation of American tech firms.",

      "They had a long-running dispute over the distribution of their apps on Apple devices.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla boss Elon Musk has pledged to \"significantly\" cut back his role in the US government after the electric car firm reported a huge drop in profit and sales for the start of this year.",
      "Musk has led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - since last year, putting the world's richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs.",
      "But Musk said his \"time allocation to Doge\" would \"drop significantly\" from next month, adding he would spend only one to two days per week on it after accusations he has taken his focus off Tesla.",
      "His political involvement has sparked protests and boycotts of Tesla cars around the world.",
      "Temporary government employees, such as Musk, are normally limited to working 130 days a year which, if counted from the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration, is set to expire late next month.",
      "But it is unclear when Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election, will step down completely.",
      "Trump said earlier this month he would keep Musk \"as long as I could keep him\".",

    "story": [
      "Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.",
      "While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.",
      "Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.",
      "Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.",
      "But the comfort is short-lived.",
      "The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\".",
      "The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.",
      "The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?",
      "How a lifeline became a threat",
      "China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.",
      "Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.",
      "Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.",
      "It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.",
      "As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.",
      "Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.",
      "He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.",
      "Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.",
      "As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".",
      "For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.",
      "Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.",
      "Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.",
      "\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.",
      "The tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?",
      "In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.",
      "But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.",
      "\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"",
      "She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "But many are sceptical of that.",
      "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.",
      "He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.",
      "Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.",
      "\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"",
      "Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".",
      "Challenges ahead",
      "Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.",
      "Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.",
      "\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.",
      "It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.",
      "There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.",
      "And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.",
      "\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.",
      "So what does Apple do now?",
      "The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.",
      "Now that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.",
      "Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.",
      "And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.",
      "Apple has announced a $500bn (\u00a3378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.",
      "Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.",
      "Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.",
      "\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.",

      "Computer chip giant Nvidia has once again found itself at the centre of US-China tensions over trade and technology.",
      "On Thursday Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang flew to Beijing to meet senior Chinese officials, just after the US imposed new export controls on its chips.",
      "The California-based company will require licenses to export its H20 AI chip to China, a move which the US Commerce Department said was designed to safeguard \"national and economic security\". Nvidia said federal officials had told them the requirement will be in force for the \"indefinite future\".",
      "But why is the company so pivotal in the race for AI supremacy between the US and China?",
      "What is Nvidia?",
      "Nvidia designs advanced chips, or semiconductors, that are used in generative artificial intelligence. Generative AI can produce new content from a user's prompt, like ChatGPT.",
      "In recent years, a surge in global demand for AI chips led Nvidia to become one of the world's most valuable companies. In November, Nvidia briefly unseated Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalisation.",
      "Because its chips are seen as so essential to advancements in generative AI, successive US administrations have scrutinised Nvidia's relationship with China.",
      "Washington hopes the new export controls will slow China's development of advanced AI chips - especially their use by the Chinese military - and secure an advantage in AI competition with Beijing.",
      "Why is Trump targeting Nvidia's H20 chips?",
      "US restrictions on Nvidia selling chips to China are not new.",
      "In 2022, Joe Biden's administration imposed separate export controls on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip to comply with those existing restrictions.",
      "A more powerful Nvidia chip, the H100, was already banned for sale in China.",
      "However, the recent emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI company, has prompted fresh concerns in the US that even less powerful chips could lead to significant technological breakthroughs.",
      "DeepSeek claimed it could operate as effectively as other applications like ChatGPT using less advanced chips.",
      "Now, there is increasing demand for Nvidia's H20 chips among Chinese technology companies such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.",
      "Those companies have outstanding orders for the chips. But because there is no grace period on the imposition of the new curbs, Nvidia expects to be hit by losses of $5.5bn (\u00a34.15bn) from these orders that it can no longer fulfil.",
      "Chim Lee, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, told the BBC that there are alternative AI chips being developed in China, by companies like Huawei.",
      "Although they are currently viewed as inferior to Nvidia's, Mr Lee said the US curbs could prompt China to focus on developing better chips.",
      "\"It will introduce challenges to China's AI scene, but it won't massively slow down China's AI development and deployment,\" Mr Lee added.",
      "Why is Nvidia's CEO in China?",
      "China is a critical market for Nvidia. The world's second-largest economy accounted for 13% of its total sales last year,  though that is still far less than the United States, which accounted for nearly half.",
      "The timing of Mr Huang's trip is being seen as an effort to shore up Nvidia's business in China despite the latest curbs.",
      "In his Beijing meeting with Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Mr Huang said he hoped \"to continue to cooperate with China\", according to state broadcaster CCTV.",
      "On Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Mr Huang's trip to China also included a meeting with DeepSeek's founder, Liang Wenfeng.",
      "Separately, top Chinese official He Lifeng told Mr Huang that \"China's market investment and consumption potential is huge\", according to state news agency Xinhua.",
      "During talks with Shanghai's mayor on Friday, Mr Huang said he was committed to the Chinese market, according to a Shanghai government statement.",
      "How will the export controls impact US-China competition?",
      "The controls are part of Washington's broader goal to de-risk supply chains for advanced technology away from China, and bring more semiconductor production back to the US.",
      "Nvidia this week announced plans to build up AI servers in the US worth up to $500bn. US president Donald Trump later claimed his re-election drove Nvidia's decision.",
      "And in March, Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC, which manufactures Nvidia's chips, announced it would invest an additional $100bn in advanced manufacturing facilities in Arizona.",
      "Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, told the BBC the latest developments show that global technology is becoming increasingly polarised between \"two systems\", one dominated by the US and the other by China.",

      "Engineer Cristina Balan lost her job after she raised a safety concern in 2014 about a design flaw which could affect the cars' braking.",
      "Her defamation claim against the firm seemed to have run out of road when a judge confirmed an arbitration decision dismissing her case - but a panel of appeal judges in California has reversed this decision in her favour.",
      "She told BBC News she now wants to face Elon Musk and Tesla in open court.",
      "Tesla has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "Ms Balan said she believes the case will now in effect go back to square one, and new proceedings can be launched.",
      "\"We are hoping we will start a new lawsuit and we will have the chance to take on Elon Musk in front of a jury and judge,\" she said.",
      "The engineer was once so prominent at Tesla that her initials were engraved on the batteries inside Model S vehicles.",

      "She also revealed she was in remission from stage-3B breast cancer, and her biggest worry was she may not live to see her final day in court.",
      "Ms Balan claimed she was worried the carpets were curling underneath some pedals in Tesla models, creating a safety hazard.",
      "She said managers rebuffed her concerns, became hostile, and she lost her job.",
      "She then won a wrongful dismissal case - but this turned out to be the start of a long journey through the courts.",
      "Ms Balan was publicly accused by Tesla of using its resources for a \"secret project\" - accusations which amount to embezzlement, a crime under US law.",
      "She has consistently denied the accusation, and decided to bring a defamation case against the firm in 2019.",
      "\"I want to clear my name,\" she told BBC News last year.",
      "\"I wish Elon Musk had the decency to apologise.\"",
      "A court then decided Ms Balan's case should be subject to arbitration per a contract she signed while working for Tesla.",
      "The arbitrator found in favour of the firm and Musk, dismissing her claims, due to California's statute of limitations - meaning too much time had passed since the alleged defamatory statements were made.",
      "Tesla brought the case back to a district court in California to have the decision confirmed.",
      "However, Ms Balan appealed this decision, and judges from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found in her favour - in effect deciding the California court did not have the jurisdiction to make its judgement.",
      "They have ordered for the confirmation of the arbitration award to be cancelled, and for the district court to dismiss the action due to its lack of jurisdiction.",
      "What could happen next?",
      "The majority of legal experts the BBC has spoken to believe the case has some way to go before there will be any conclusion.",
      "\"Tesla is among the many corporations that force employees and customers into opaque arbitration processes and deploy aggressive strategies to retaliate against employees who voice criticism of corporate practices,\" said Stanford professor Anat Admati.",
      "And Bill Moran, Ms Balan's attorney, agreed the legal process is far from over.",
      "But he said the case was \"revived\" by the latest ruling.",
      "\"We are confident we can secure her either a new arbitration or alternatively a trial in court so that her case can be heard on the merits after so many years,\" he said.",
      "\"She has fought cancer while waging this case... she is the epitome of strength and resolve, and she is now one step closer to getting the justice she deserves.\"",

    "story": [
      "Who will be the next pope? The decision could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics.",
      "It also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons.",
      "The College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.",
      "With 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.",
      "For the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European.",
      "And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".",
      "For those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next pope.",
      "Could the cardinals elect an African or an Asian pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?",
      "Here are some of the names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor.",
      "Pietro Parolin",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 70",
      "Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.",
      "Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.",
      "He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.",
      "But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".",
      "The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"",
      "Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.",
      "Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle",
      "Nationality: Filipino",
      "Age: 67",
      "Could the next pope come from Asia?",
      "Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience \u2013 meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.",
      "The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals \u2013 which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.",
      "He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.",
      "He has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" \u2013 a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.",
      "But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.",
      "The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.",
      "Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"",
      "Fridolin Ambongo Besungu",
      "Nationality: Congolese",
      "Age: 65",
      "It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).",
      "He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.",
      "He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.",
      "But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"",
      "Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.",
      "Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson",
      "Nationality: Ghanaian",
      "Age: 76",
      "If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.",
      "Like Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.",
      "Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".",
      "He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.",
      "Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.",
      "A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.",
      "Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.",
      "In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.",
      "In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.",
      "Peter Erdo",
      "Nationality: Hungarian",
      "Age: 72",
      "A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.",
      "He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.",
      "The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.",
      "Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.",
      "His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.",
      "Angelo Scola",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 83",
      "Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.",
      "The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.",
      "His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".",
      "Francis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.",
      "Reinhard Marx",
      "Nationality: German",
      "Age: 71",
      "Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.",
      "The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.",
      "He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.",
      "But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.",
      "Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.",
      "Marc Ouellet",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 80",
      "Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.",
      "For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.",
      "Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.",
      "He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".",
      "Robert Prevost",
      "Nationality: American",
      "Age: 69",
      "Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?",
      "Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.",
      "Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.",
      "He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.",
      "Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.",
      "He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.",
      "Robert Sarah",
      "Nationality: Guinean",
      "Age: 79",
      "Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings.",
      "The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.",
      "He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.",
      "While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.",
      "Michael Czerny",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 78",
      "Cardinal Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world.",
      "Although he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two.",
      "He has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya.",
      "Czerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development.",
      "Although a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession."

      "Musk has led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - since last year, putting the world's richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs.",
      "But Musk said his \"time allocation to Doge\" would \"drop significantly\" from next month, adding he would spend only one to two days per week on it after accusations he has taken his focus off Tesla.",
      "His political involvement has sparked protests and boycotts of Tesla cars around the world.",
      "Temporary government employees, such as Musk, are normally limited to working 130 days a year which, if counted from the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration, is set to expire late next month.",
      "But it is unclear when Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election, will step down completely.",
      "Trump said earlier this month he would keep Musk \"as long as I could keep him\".",

      "Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk",
      "The tech boss said he would now \"be allocating far more of my time to Tesla\", but suggested he would not leave the Trump administration completely, calling the work \"critical\" and pledging to stay on \"as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it's useful\".",
      "On Tuesday, Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales for the first three months of the year, compared with the same period last year, while profits fell more than 70%.",
      "The company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying \"changing political sentiment\" could meaningfully hurt demand.",
      "Musk blamed the boycott of Tesla cars on people who would \"try to attack me and the Doge team\".",
      "Shares in the company had shed about 37% of their value this year as of market close on Tuesday. They rose by more than 5% in after-hours trading following the results.",
      "Trump's tariffs on China also weighed heavily on Tesla. Although the vehicles Tesla sells in its home market are assembled in the US, it depends on many parts made in China. \"Rapidly evolving trade policy\" could hurt its supply chain and raise costs, according to the company.",
      "\"This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,\" Tesla's quarterly update said.",
      "Musk has clashed on trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro.",
      "On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were \"still tough on a company where margins are low\".",
      "\"I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,\" he said.",
      "'Problems mounting'",
      "Earlier this month, he called Navarro a \"moron\" over comments he had made about Tesla. Navarro had said Musk was \"not a car manufacturer\" but a \"car assembler, in many cases\".",
      "Georg Ell, who knew Musk and was director for Western Europe at Tesla, told the BBC's Today programme that if the multi-billionaire \"focuses on the companies where he is extraordinary, I think people will focus once again on the quality of the product and experiences\".",
      "\"I think Elon is not someone who surrounds himself with a great diversity of opinion to challenge his thinking, he's a pretty single-minded individual,\" added Mr Ell, who is now chief executive of translation software firm Phrase.",
      "Tesla said artificial intelligence would contribute to future growth, though investors have been unconvinced by such arguments in the past.",
      "Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called expectations \"rock-bottom\" after the company said earlier this month that the number of cars sold in the quarter had fallen 13% to the lowest level in three years.",
      "The firm faces fierce competition, Mr Coatsworth said, warning that potential disruption to global supply chains as a result of Trump's trade war also created risks.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has appeared to soften his recent comments on China and the head of the US Federal Reserve after recent clashes as he pursues his economic agenda.",
      "He said he has \"no intention of firing\" Jerome Powell after repeatedly criticising the head of the central bank, but he added that he would like Powell to be \"a little more active\" on cutting interest rates.",
      "Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump also said he was optimistic about improving trade relations with China.",
      "He said the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "The president's tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US. This is a pillar of his economic agenda - as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans.",
      "Trump has ratcheted the rate on Chinese goods up to 145% - sparking reciprocal measures from Beijing and warnings from economists about the global impact of a trade war.",
      "In his comments to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said he would be \"very nice\" in negotiations with Beijing - in the hope of securing a trade deal.",
      "Earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly said he expected a de-escalation of the trade war, which he said was unsustainable. Responding to comments from China, he said the current situation was \"not a joke\".",
      "The trade war has led to turbulence in financial markets around the world - to which Trump's comments on Powell have also contributed.",
      "The Fed has not cut rates so far this year, after lowering them by a percentage point late last year, a stance Trump has heavily criticised.",
      "Last week, the president intensified his attacks on the Fed chief, calling him \"a major loser\". The comments sparked a selloff of stocks, bonds and the US dollar - though markets have since been recovering from those losses.",
      "National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Friday that Trump was looking into whether it would be possible to sack Powell - who he first nominated to lead the central bank in 2017. Powell was then renewed in 2021 by Joe Biden.",
      "It is unclear whether Trump has the authority to fire the Fed chair. No other US president has tried to do so.",
      "Why should I care if the US dollar falls?",
      "US sets tariffs of up to 3,521% on South East Asia solar panels",
      "Most major Asian stock markets were higher on Wednesday as investors appeared to welcome the latest remarks.",
      "Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose about 1.9%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed by around 2.2%, while mainland China's Shanghai Composite was down less than 0.1%.",
      "That came after US shares made gains on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 ending Tuesday's session up 2.5% and the Nasdaq rose 2.7%.",
      "US futures were also trading higher overnight. Futures markets give an indication of how financial markets will perform when they open for trading.",

    "summary": "Three thousand names were removed from an official list of those killed in Israel's offensive.",
    "story": [
      "At al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, Alam Hirzallah resigns himself to a grim task: registering the deaths of the wife and two children of his grieving cousin.",
      "His family brought the bodies here on an electric rickshaw or tuk-tuk. They found them in their house in eastern Gaza City after Israeli shelling hit the family home. Asma Hirzallah, Mayar, 5, and Abdullah, 3, were killed.",
      "\"The hospital asked for their full names and ID numbers,\" explains Alam, referring to the numbers all Palestinians are given in a population registry administered by Israel.",
      "\"They gave us a paper to confirm they were martyred and told us to come back for the death certificate. Now we don't know where to go to bury them as the cemeteries are in areas under Israeli control.\"",
      "At least 51,266 people have been killed in the 18 months since the Gaza war began, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, with nearly a third of the dead aged under 18.",
      "Israel has repeatedly challenged the accuracy of the Palestinian fatalities list - in terms of overall numbers, and in particular, the demographic breakdown - claiming it is used as Hamas propaganda. The figures are cited with attribution, by UN agencies and widely in the media.",
      "The list does not distinguish between civilians and members of Palestinian armed groups who are killed in the war, and Israel has accused Hamas of inflating the percentages of women and children.",
      "Recently, several media reports have raised questions about the reliability of the statistics by highlighting anomalies between the August and October 2024 and March 2025 lists of fatalities.  The reports focus on how some 3,000 names of people originally identified as fatalities were removed from later revised lists.",
      "A Gazan health official, Zaher al-Wahidi, denied to the BBC that victims had vanished or that there was a lack of transparency, insisting: \"The health ministry works towards having accurate data with high credibility.",
      "\"In every list that gets shared, there is a greater verification and revision of the list.  We cannot say that the health ministry removes names.  It's not a removal process, rather it is a revision and verification process.\"",
      "Verifying data",
      "So how are the statistics gathered and how accurate are they?",
      "Until the first months of this war, the number of people killed in Gaza was calculated from counting bodies that arrived in hospitals - like those of Asma Hirzallah and her children.",
      "Medics could log data for all deaths into a centralised computer system, which was based at a Ministry of Health office at al-Shifa hospital, with a back-up at al-Rantissi hospital.",
      "However, as conditions became more chaotic and medical sites repeatedly came under attack, this method became less reliable. During the war, Israel says it has targeted hospitals \u2013 which have protected status under international law \u2013 because Hamas has used them to hide its fighters and infrastructure \u2013 something the armed group denies.",
      "From the start of 2024, Gazan health officials introduced online forms which relatives could use to report their loved ones dead or missing.",
      "According to Mr Wahidi, the head of statistics at the health ministry, most of the names which were recently removed from the official list as part of a new checking process had originally been submitted using these forms.  He says that names which are taken off may later be added back",
      "\"A judicial committee was set up and it looks into all of the cases received,\" Mr Wahidi says. \"To ensure credibility we verify the data so that it will be accurate.\"",
      "During investigations by the judicial committee, some people were found to have died of natural causes \u2013 not directly because of the war.  When Gazans die from lack of medical treatment, malnutrition or hypothermia, Mr Wahidi clarifies \"these cases are indirect and do not get added to the lists.\"",
      "Other individuals were wrongly listed as dead but then found to have been among thousands of Gazans imprisoned by Israel.",
      "Mr Wahidi confirms that in August and then October, a total of more than 3,000 names were removed from the list, saying this was a precautionary measure pending full checks.",
      "For some pro-Israel groups, such as media watchdog HonestReporting, this was strong indication of \"deliberate manipulation, not honest error\".",
      "There had been a widespread presumption that only checked names were included on the online lists published.",
      "\"It seems like they're actually updating the lists more in real time, as more information appears,\" says Professor Mike Spagat of Royal Holloway College, chair of Every Casualty Counts, an independent civilian casualty monitoring organisation. \"We should have regarded the previous lists as a little bit more provisional than I had assumed.\"",
      "However, he says he detects no attempt by health officials to mislead and sees the changes as \"a big clean-up operation\".",
      "He points out that the latest modifications to the list led to a small increase in the percentage of adult males among those killed, countering the idea that the original inclusion of the 3,000-plus names was done in an attempt to exaggerate the proportion of women and children.",
      "Bodies under rubble",
      "The Gaza health ministry says it has also recently audited data in its official fatalities list from hospital mortuaries for errors and omissions.",
      "When deaths were registered by friends or neighbours, it says, they often did not know the ID numbers of those killed or their full names - which include the father and grandfather's names. In some cases, this resulted in the wrong people being marked as dead.",
      "Thousands of bodies that are still under the rubble left by Israeli air strikes, as well as about 900 which are unidentified, are not currently included in the health ministry list, the ministry says.",
      "However, the recent two-month ceasefire - which allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced Gazans to return to what was left of their homes - saw nearly 800 corpses being retrieved, identified and registered.",
      "In late January, the BBC filmed workers from the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency as they set about retrieving human remains which had been left for months in Wadi Gaza - also known as the Netzarim Corridor \u2013 after a pullout by Israeli forces.",
      "With no DNA testing available in Gaza, each corpse was given a serial number. Long forms were filled in to log the bones and clothing collected to try to identify the dead.",
      "\"We look for distinctive personal belongings: a watch, a necklace or an earring. When we search the bodies, it's very possible that we'll find a driver's licence or ID card,\" said Sameh Khalifa, who led the team.",
      "\"Even a broken tooth can be a distinguishing mark that will help a family recognise a missing loved one.\"",
      "Combatant death tolls",
      "Since the resumption of Israel's military offensive in Gaza on 18 March, the numbers killed have risen daily.",
      "Israel periodically estimates the number of Palestinian fighters killed. At the start of this year, it assessed that 20,000 members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were among the dead. In mid-April it said there had been \"more than 100 targeted eliminations\" in the past month.",
      "Israel does not provide its figures for civilian deaths in Gaza and has not officially challenged any of the names on the local health ministry casualty list.",
      "The war began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas led a cross-border attack on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 250 people into captivity in Gaza. Since then, the Israeli military says that 408 of its soldiers have been killed in combat.",
      "International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.",
      "We rely heavily on local Palestinian journalists working with us to access information about deadly attacks - interviewing witnesses as well as visiting bomb sites and hospital mortuaries to film footage, which is shared with us.",
      "Overall, the numbers killed in the past year and a half dwarf those from previous rounds of fighting in the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict and yet, for the moment, there is no end in sight to the war.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 23:04:17 GMT",
    "summary": "The rail and road link will slash journey times between much of Scandinavia and continental Europe.",
    "story": [
      "A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe.",
      "Running for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel.",
      "It's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together.",
      "The project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark.",
      "The facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\".",
      "\"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel.",
      "To make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete.",
      "Most underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France \u2013 burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks.",
      "\"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\"",
      "With a price-tag around \u20ac7.4bn ($8.1bn; \u00a36.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with \u20ac1.3bn from the European Commission.",
      "It's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying.",
      "Once completed, the journey between R\u00f8dbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage.",
      "Bypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers.",
      "\"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\"",
      "Towered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead.",
      "\"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element.",
      "There are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor.",
      "At the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\"",
      "Not only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats.",
      "Next it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision.",
      "\"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\"",
      "Denmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes.",
      "With layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark.",
      "A bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration.",
      "\"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\"",
      "So, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\"",
      "Denmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact.",
      "One such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise.",
      "However in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead.",
      "\"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock.",
      "When the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day.",
      "According to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says.",
      "It's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions.",
      "\"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\""

    "summary": "Despite having the world's fastest-growing Catholic population, odds are against Africa producing the next pontiff.",
    "story": [
      "If the sole predictor of who would become the next pope was where the Catholic Church is growing fastest, then it is almost certain he would hail from Africa.",
      "The continent's Catholic population is expanding more rapidly than anywhere else, representing more than half of the global increase.",
      "While there have been at least three pontiffs from Africa, the last - Pope Gelasius I - died more than 1,500 years ago, many would argue it is high time for another.",
      "When the cardinals who vote for the leader of the Roman Catholic Church - known as the cardinal-electors - meet at the Vatican to choose Pope Francis' successor, will these facts influence their decision making?",
      "\"I think that it will be great to have an African pope,\" Father Stan Chu Ilo, a Nigerian Catholic priest and associate professor at DePaul University in Chicago, told the BBC, arguing that the leadership of the Church should better reflect the make-up of the global congregation.",
      "But the cleric admitted it was more likely that the cardinals would pick someone who already had a high profile - \"someone who is already an influential voice\".",
      "\"The challenge is that you don't have any senior African clergy holding any important position today at the Vatican, and that poses a problem,\" he said.",
      "However, he also said that: \"Cardinal Sarah of Guinea and Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo of DRC have become prominent voices in global Catholicism within the last two years.\"",
      "And he noted that Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson had held different roles at the Vatican, endearing him to many people around the world.",
      "He remains a strong contender for the position, while in 2005 Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze was also a potential candidate in the conclave that led to the election of Pope Benedict XVI.",
      "This is despite Pope Francis increasing the proportion of cardinals from sub-Saharan Africa from 8% when he was elected in 2013 to 12% a decade later, according to US-based Pew Research Center.",
      "\"How it has come to this point for the continent of Africa and the Catholic Church is still something that surprises many of us, given Pope Francis's openness to Africa,\" Fr Chu Ilo said.",
      "Francis visited 10 countries in Africa during his pontificate - a time that marked a dramatic increase in the number of Catholics on the continent. The latest figures show there were 281 million Catholics in Africa in 2023, making up 20% of the worldwide congregation.",
      "But some African Catholics do not like this emphasis on origin - like Father Paulinus Ikechukwu Odozor, a professor at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.",
      "For the Nigerian-born Catholic priest it just smacks of tokenism.",
      "\"It's like people are saying, 'OK, so Africans are growing in these numbers, so why don't we give them a pope,'\" he told me.",
      "\"I have never been one to think that just because you come from Africa, or because you come from Europe, therefore you are prime candidate.",
      "\"No matter where you come from, as soon as you are elected, everybody's issues become your issue.  You have one concern, to build up the body of Christ, no matter where the people are, no matter how many they are, in whatever context they are.\"",
      "The most important thing, he told the BBC, was for the pope to be \"the chief theologian of the Church\".",
      "\"The pope must be somebody who knows tradition very well\" and was able to use that to give people direction, he said.",
      "In his view, more needs to be done to ensure that matters affecting the faithful in Africa are taken seriously by those in positions of power at the Vatican.",
      "He admitted that at times it felt \"as if Africans don't matter, or it's as if their faith is seen as a little bit below par, or counterfeit, and should not be taken seriously\".",
      "\"When Africans feel that their issues are not on the table as they should be, then people begin to ask, well, maybe we can only get ourselves heard or seen if we have our own man there.\"",
      "Pope Francis has been praised for his understanding of the poor and marginalised - which made him particularly loved in Africa.",
      "For example, he spoke out against what he saw as the plundering of natural resources in places such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, a vast country which is home to Africa's largest Catholic community with almost 55 million believers.",
      "His role as peacemaker has also been commended - he went to great lengths to heal divisions following the brutal civil war in the Central African Republic, famously giving a ride on his popemobile to the imam who invited him to pray at a mosque in Bangui in 2015. He also kissed the feet of South Sudan's rival leaders four years later in an attempt to end that country's civil war.",
      "But Pope Francis did face a backlash from the African Church for his stance on LGBT issues.",
      "Africa bishops rejected his 2023 declaration allowing priests to offer blessings to same-sex couples.",
      "The Vatican clarified that the blessings \"neither approve nor justify the situation in which these people find themselves\", and that \"in several countries there are strong cultural and even legal issues that require time and pastoral strategies that go beyond the short term\".",
      "It is an issue that seems to unite the continent, where homosexual relationships are outlawed in many countries.",
      "The three African cardinals, mentioned by observers as possible, if not top, contenders - Turkson, Robert Sarah of Guinea and DR Congo's Fridolin Ambongo Besungu - are all clear in their rejection of a change on this issue.",
      "The Congolese cardinal has said \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Cardinal Sarah, an arch traditionalist, has been damning about the West's liberal attitudes, telling a Synod in 2015: \"What Nazi-Fascism and Communism were in the 20th Century, Western homosexual and abortion ideologies and Islamic fanaticism are today.\"",
      "And while Cardinal Turkson has been critical of Ghana's move to impose harsh penalties on LGBT people, he toes the line that same-sex relationships are \"objectively sinful\".",
      "Nonetheless Fr Odozor agreed that despite an increase in the number of cardinals from the African continent, they lack real power in the Church.",
      "And both clerics interviewed by the BBC pointed to an issue that could hinder efforts that Pope Francis had made to make the leadership of the Church more representative - and the possibility of getting a pontiff from Africa.",
      "\"There is still that question of racism in the Church that we never even talk about,\" Fr Odozor said.",
      "\"That could undermine someone, no matter how papal he is or what he does, he will be seen simply as an African pope.\"",
      "As Pope Francis appointed 108 of the 135 cardinals eligible to vote in the conclave, there is a good chance they will choose someone whose emphasis is also on reaching out to the poor and disenfranchised.",
      "It is an approach Fr Chu Ilo called a \"poor-first\" outlook, with a focus on being \"a listening Church\".",
      "But, as when Pope Francis was elected, he said the outcome would be unpredictable.",
      "\"I will answer like a good priest,\" he told me chuckling, when asked for his prediction.",
      "\"I would pray that God will give us a pope who will continue with the outlook of Francis, and I'll pray that such a person comes from Africa.\"",

    "summary": "A total of 370 out of 882 Indian laws criminalise 7,305 acts - from missed dog walks to murder.",
    "story": [
      "In India, you can face criminal charges for tethering an animal on the street, flying a kite in a manner that causes alarm, skipping a school attendance order or handing a feeding bottle to a mother who can't breastfeed.",
      "Of the 882 federal laws on the books, 370 contain criminal provisions - together criminalising 7,305 acts and omissions. These range from the absurd to the serious: failing to give a month's notice before quitting your job or not walking your dog enough, to offences like illegal arms possession, murder and sexual assault.",
      "Delhi-based think-tank Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy calls it \"India's crisis of over-criminalisation\".",
      "In a new report, The State of the System: Understanding the Scale of Crime and Punishment in India, the think-tank has produced the country's first comprehensive database of crimes, mapping the extent of criminalisation across 370 federal laws.",
      "The report flags India's habit of reaching for criminal law to solve just about everything - even the mundane. It notes that many laws criminalise \"routine, everyday actions\".",
      "You could, for instance, be charged for tethering your goat on a public street, fixing a leaky tap without a licence or not naming the owner of a building when asked.",
      "Then there are the truly obscure offences - like a parent ignoring a school attendance order, applying for a driver's licence when banned or littering in a zoo. Basically, there's a criminal penalty waiting around every corner of daily life.",
      "Let your pigs wander on to a field or road and you could be fined 10 rupees (12 cents). Disturb an animal or litter in a zoo? Six months in jail or a 2,000-rupee fine. And failing to exercise your dog can cost you up to 100 rupees and three months in jail.",
      "Promoting infant milk substitutes or feeding bottles to pregnant women or mothers can lead to up to three years in jail or a 5,000-rupee fine. (This was meant to curb aggressive marketing by formula food companies, but the law also applies to individuals, which makes it controversial.)",
      "Jail is the go-to punishment in India - 73% of crimes carry prison terms ranging from a single day to 20 years.",
      "More than 250 offences across 117 laws penalise delays in filing documents - everything from wealth and property tax returns to gift declarations, the report finds.",
      "Some 124 crimes across 80 laws criminalise obstructing a public officer, often without clearly defining what causes \"obstruction\".",
      "Even the death penalty isn't off the table - not just for murder or mutiny, but for damaging an oil or gas pipeline or a sentry caught sleeping on duty. In all, a staggering 301 offences in India can legally cost you your life.",
      "Out of 7,305 offences under central laws, nearly 80% come with fines - from as low as two rupees to a staggering 50m rupees.",
      "To be fair, many of these provisions are rarely used - India's crime records bureau tracks around 50 laws, even though 370 carry criminal penalties.",
      "\"They're not heavily enforced, but they create ample opportunities for rent-seeking,\" Naveed Mehmood Ahmad, co-author of the study at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, told me.",
      "\"There's enough in the books to jail almost anyone for some technical non-compliance. It's less about actual use and more about the potential for misuse.\"",
      "This \"excessive use of criminal law not only disrupts the daily lives of ordinary citizens but also creates significant barriers for business operations\", the report says.",
      "Businesses in India face a maze of regulations, but using criminal law as the default for non-compliance is excessive, disproportionate and often counter-productive, experts say.",
      "The report also talks about some glaring inconsistencies in crime and punishment.",
      "Rioting - the use of force or violence by an unlawful assembly - is punishable with up to two years of imprisonment. Meanwhile, falsely reporting a birth or death for official records can lead to three years of imprisonment.",
      "The irony? Violence in public gets a lighter sentence than a lie on paper.",
      "Even more striking: crimes of vastly different severity carry the same penalty - like practicing homoeopathy without a licence, jumping a red light, or forcing someone into labour - all punishable with a one-year sentence.",
      "The sheer number of crimes tied to everyday life and business shows how heavily the state leans on criminalisation to enforce compliance, the report says.",
      "\"This over-reliance has significant costs, not just for citizens and businesses, but also for state machinery.\"",
      "Over 34 million criminal cases are pending in India's courts, with 72% stuck for more than a year. Prisons are overcrowded, running at 131% capacity, while courts and police forces continue to grapple with chronic staff shortages",
      "Even the law-and-order machinery is stretched. As of 1 January 2023, India had just 154 police personnel per 100,000 people - well below the sanctioned 195. Nationwide, there are 581,000 vacancies against an approved strength of 2.72 million.",
      "\"Even then, we continue to rely on this overburdened system to combat minor infractions, including those that attract nominal fines,\" the report says.",
      "It says that criminal law should be limited to acts that threaten core societal values - like public safety, national security, life, liberty, property and social harmony.",
      "Authorities say they plan to scrap criminal penalties in more than 100 legal provisions - on top of the 180 already axed in 2023. It's not just legal clean-up; it's a chance to rethink how the law treats people. Less fear, more trust. Less suspect, more citizen."

      "On Sunday in his Easter message, his last public appearance, he was again calling for peace and a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "With his words read by an aide, he said: \"The terrible conflict continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation.''",
      "\"War is not just weapons.  War is sometimes words,\" the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, said when I asked him about the Pope's final address.  He said the Pope had a moral clarity.",
      "\"Pope Francis recently, especially in the last year, has been very outspoken about the situation of the Holy Land, calling for the liberation of the hostages, but also condemning the dramatic situation, the ongoing war in Gaza and the situation for Palestinians,\" the cardinal said.",
      "Israeli media has noted that while President Isaac Herzog expressed condolences to the Catholic world, there were not similar comments from the prime minister or foreign minister as would have been expected - widely attributed to the Pope's strong positions against the Gaza war.",
      "Some of his most explicit criticism of Israel came late last year when excerpts of an upcoming book were published.",
      "\"According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide,\" Pope Francis wrote.",
      "\"It should be carefully investigated to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies.\"",
      "Israel firmly rejects allegations of genocide in Gaza and says its war goal is to defeat Hamas.",
      "As a conclave gets under way in Rome this week to decide Pope Francis's successor, Palestinians and Israelis will be watching closely to see what the next Pope has to say about their intractable conflict.",
      "Christians in Gaza say they hope that whoever is chosen will be pushing for peace."

      "It came as a surprise to many \u2013 including Bergoglio himself \u2013 that he was elected to the highest office in the Catholic Church in the first place.",
      "At 76 years old at the time - one year older than the typical age of bishops and cardinals when they submit their resignation to the pope - he was not seen as a real candidate to fill the vacancy, according to analysts.",
      "\"When he left Buenos Aires for the conclave, he seemed somewhat sad; he was getting ready to retire in a room at the Priests' Home in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Flores,\" Guillermo Marc\u00f3, a priest from the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires, told Argentine newspaper Clar\u00edn.",
      "However, Bergoglio would soon begin a papacy that lasted 12 years.",
      "His death has been particularly keenly felt in his home country, where seven days of national mourning have been declared - as Argentina grieves a man many regarded as simple and humble, despite holding one of the most powerful offices in the world.",
      "Those qualities were praised by Elenir Ramazol, a nun who spoke to BBC Mundo  during a vigil at the Buenos Aires cathedral on Monday.",
      "The fact he did not return to his homeland was \"a sign of the total commitment he made to the whole Church, not just to his people, to his country\", Ms Ramazol said.",
      "Gustavo Vera exchanged hundreds of letters with Francis, having become friends with him when he was still archbishop. He agreed that the pontiff always showed an enduring interest in what was happening in his home country.",
      "\"Sometimes he commented on soccer, sometimes on tango, sometimes on cultural events,\" Mr Vera, the leader of La Alameda, an Argentine anti-trafficking and slavery organisation, said. Francis followed Argentine news \"in detail\", he added.",
      "During his papacy, Francis visited four of the five countries that border Argentina - but never his home country, despite continuing to take a keen interest in it.",
      "He was loved by many there who now mourn him, but others remember him as a controversial figure.",
      "The initial pride felt by most Argentines after the announcement that a fellow countryman would be the first Latin American pope gave way to disenchantment among some over the years.",
      "A Pew Research Center survey suggested that the proportion of people who held a positive view of the pontiff fell from 91% in 2013 to 64% in 2024.",
      "Of six Latin American countries surveyed, the largest drop in favourable attitudes was recorded in Argentina.",
      "Conservatives in Argentina accused him of undermining historical traditions they held sacred, while reformers hoped for more profound changes.",
      "Critics felt he failed to do enough to oppose the country's brutal military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s and to criticise the complicity of some figures in the Church.",
      "Every time he was asked about a possible trip, Pope Francis gave vague answers.",
      "\"I would like to go. It's my people, but it hasn't been planned yet. There are several things to sort out first,\" he said the last time he was publicly asked about the subject, in September 2024.",
      "Some fellow Argentines found this hesitation difficult to understand.",
      "The pontiff's absence has been felt more acutely in recent years, as Argentina has endured a profound economic crisis, with annual inflation reaching nearly 300% and a sharp increase in poverty.",
      "Mr Vera suggests that Francis was planning to visit, but had not yet done so because he wanted to avoid his presence being used for political purposes.",
      "\"He always used to say he would go to Argentina when he felt that he was an instrument to bring about national unity, to help overcome the rift, to try to bring Argentines back together,\" Mr Vera said.",
      "The \"rift\" refers to the vast, decades-long gulf in Argentine politics and society between supporters and opponents of the populist political movement Peronism, founded by late President Juan Per\u00f3n in the 1940s.",
      "There is a widespread belief in the country that Pope Francis was a Peronist - something he denied in a book in 2023, while adding: \"If we had a Peronist conception of politics, what would be wrong with that?\"",
      "The comment was seized upon by conservative detractors who accused him of being too closely aligned with social justice causes and left-wing politics.",
      "Before taking office, Javier Milei, the current president who has demonised left-wing politics, even called Pope Francis \"the representation of evil on Earth\" - although he softened his tone after coming to power.",
      "The two had a cordial meeting in the Vatican and President Milei officially invited the pontiff to Argentina. And following the Pope's death, Milei said he was deeply pained by his loss, and praised the pontiff's benevolence and wisdom.",
      "Some Argentines accused him of being too close to Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, a divisive left-leaning populist politician, who was president from 2007 to 2015.",
      "But according to Mr Vera, the Pope met with people \"from the whole political and social spectrum of Argentina\".",
      "The late pontiff's friend also pointed out that, while there was some criticism of Pope Francis in the media and major urban centres, he was loved in other parts of the country.",
      "Although he maintained his connection with Argentina, Mr Vera said, Pope Francis no longer felt he belonged to just one country.",
      "\"Argentines believe he was Argentinian, but in reality, he was a citizen of the world,\" he added.",
      "It is a view shared by Alejandra Castro, a social worker who was among the mourners who gathered on Monday night at Buenos Aires cathedral.",
      "Argentina was \"always in his prayers\", Ms Castro said. \"In one way or another, he was always present, and I think that shows that in his heart, Argentina was always present.\"",

      "It also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons.",
      "The College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.",
      "With 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.",
      "For the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European.",
      "And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".",
      "For those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next pope.",
      "Could the cardinals elect an African or an Asian pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?",
      "Here are some of the names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor.",
      "Pietro Parolin",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 70",
      "Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.",
      "Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.",
      "He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.",
      "But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".",
      "The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"",
      "Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.",
      "Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle",
      "Nationality: Filipino",
      "Age: 67",
      "Could the next pope come from Asia?",
      "Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience \u2013 meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.",
      "The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals \u2013 which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.",
      "He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.",
      "He has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" \u2013 a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.",
      "But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.",
      "The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.",
      "Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"",
      "Fridolin Ambongo Besungu",
      "Nationality: Congolese",
      "Age: 65",
      "It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).",
      "He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.",
      "He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.",
      "But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"",
      "Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.",
      "Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson",
      "Nationality: Ghanaian",
      "Age: 76",
      "If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.",
      "Like Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.",
      "Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".",
      "He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.",
      "Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.",
      "A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.",
      "Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.",
      "In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.",

      "Peter Erdo",
      "Nationality: Hungarian",
      "Age: 72",
      "A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.",
      "He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.",
      "The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.",
      "Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.",
      "His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.",
      "Angelo Scola",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 83",
      "Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.",
      "The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.",
      "His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".",
      "Francis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.",
      "Reinhard Marx",
      "Nationality: German",
      "Age: 71",
      "Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.",
      "The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.",
      "He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.",
      "But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.",
      "Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.",
      "Marc Ouellet",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 80",
      "Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.",
      "For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.",
      "Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.",
      "He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".",
      "Robert Prevost",
      "Nationality: American",
      "Age: 69",
      "Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?",
      "Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.",
      "Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.",
      "He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.",
      "Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.",
      "He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.",
      "Robert Sarah",
      "Nationality: Guinean",
      "Age: 79",
      "Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings.",
      "The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.",
      "He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.",
      "While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.",
      "Michael Czerny",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 78",
      "Cardinal Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world.",
      "Although he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two.",
      "He has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya.",
      "Czerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development.",
      "Although a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession."

      "In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.",

      "However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.",
      "The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.",

      "Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.",
      "That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "In 2013, when the aging Pope Benedict XVI, the conservative leader of the Catholic Church, resigned, the choice of a successor was nothing short of an election on the future direction of the Vatican. From the instant the progressive Argentinian cleric Jorge Mario Bergoglio walked out on the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square, the papacy of Pope Francis (Dec. 17, 1936-April 21, 2025) signaled and end to \"business as usual.\" He began with his choice of taking the name of a saint who lived in poverty after hearing God call him to \"rebuild my church, for it is in ruins.\"",
      "And the new pope's pronouncements demonstrated a willingness to look beyond accepted Catholic orthodoxy. He frankly discussed topics that were controversial within the Church, including gay priests and the role of women\u00a0in leadership. He also offered a more welcoming tone to the LGBTQ community, saying, \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\"",
      "He spoke out to address the danger of climate change, criticized the global financial system, and favored the opening of borders not just for refugees from conflict but also for economic migrants.",
      "His charisma and humility earned him the label \"the People's Pope,\" while his willingness to take as inspiration the life of the humble founder of the Franciscan order rejuvenated some Catholics, and attracted non-Catholics to the pope's mission. New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan described the \"Francis effect\" to \"Sunday Morning\" in 2017: \"The number of people that will come up to me as I'm walking the streets of New York and say, 'Hey, we like this guy, Francis. I haven't been to church in a while, but I'm taking a second look, okay?'\"",
      "The 266th pope was the first from the Americas. Born in Buenos Aires, the son of an accountant from Italy and the daughter of Italian immigrants, Bergoglio was ordained a priest with the Jesuit order, which he led during the country's violent dictatorship. He was named auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992, and in 1998 became archbishop. Three years later, he was elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II.",
      "His writings focused on social justice issues that would become among his chief concerns as pope: the poor, Indigenous peoples, the environment, and the need for a missionary church.",
      "His first trip outside Rome as pope was to the island of Lampedusa in the Mediterranean, where he met with newly-arrived migrants. There, he denounced the \"globalization of indifference\" shown to refugees, many of whom had drowned while seeking a better life. In his homily during an open Mass there, Francis said, \"Who has wept for the deaths of these brothers and sisters? Who has wept for the people who were on the boat? For the young mothers carrying their babies? For these men who wanted something to support their families? We are a society that has forgotten the experience of weeping, of 'suffering with'; the globalization of indifference has taken from us the ability to weep! \u2026 Let us ask the Lord for the grace to weep over our indifference, to weep over the cruelty in the world, in ourselves, and even in those who anonymously make socio-economic decisions that open the way to tragedies like this.\"",
      "And despite his overall popularity, Francis did have his critics who believe he had blurred the lines around traditional Church teachings. For example, while stating that marriage was between a man and a woman, he also said that priests could bless same-sex couples.",
      "\"You bet there are some conservatives that are unhappy with Pope Francis,\" Cardinal Dolan told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"There're also some liberals that wish he would move much more radically and expeditiously in some of the reforms. So, you're gonna get it from both sides.\"",
      "In 2017, when \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Mo Rocca asked the pope why he chose the name Francis, the pontiff replied, \"It just came to me.\"",
      "He then left with a request of his audience: \"Pray for me; I need it.\""

      "All David Hyde Pierce has to do is step out on stage, and he gets applause, even before he launches into the idiotic tongue-twister from \"The Pirates of Penzance\":",

      "With practically no expression on his face, babbling away, all kinds of commotion around him, he's funny.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think 'less is more' can be funny?\"",
      "\"Well, I think so much of theater, rightly, is MORE,\" Pierce replied. \"Sometimes, what's unexpected in theater is someone doing less.\"",
      "\"Is there a temptation to overact?\"",
      "\"Always,\" he said. \"You remind me of a great line from 'Frasier,' which was, 'If less is more, think how much more MORE will be!'\"",
      "It is thanks to his 11-year run on the TV mega-hit \"Frasier\" that Pierce has the recognition, and can afford to pick and choose his roles. He's the Major-General in \"Pirates! The Penzance Musical,\" a jazzy re-working of the Gilbert & Sullivan classic, transplanted to New Orleans.",
      "Pierce showed us one of the Gilbert & Sullivan scores from his summer camp from the 1970s (\"It's almost as old as I am\"), which was also the score he used for an episode of \"Frasier\" where he, Kelsey Grammer and David Ogden Stiers sang from \"Penzance.\"",
      "I asked, \"What does Gilbert & Sullivan mean to you?\"",
      "\"Hmm. Well, it must mean something, 'cause it's \u2026 I'm getting emotional,\" Pierce replied. \"Thinking about the question, I guess it's just, it's just because it's been threaded through my life for so long.\"",
      "In his dressing room at the Roundabout Theatre, the wall is covered with photographs of people who were in the dressing room before: \"Famous people, a lot of them dear friends of mine,\" he said. \"I'll be up there eventually. Tradition is very important to us. It's being aware that you're part of something bigger.\"",
      "Pierce's \"Pirates\" dressing room is full of nods to the emotional touchstones that define him, including one of the most important: a photograph of him talking to his dad about a show he was doing, \"at a time when I didn't even know that that's what I was going into, had no idea what was lying ahead,\" he said.",
      "Pierce's father and his grandfather were amateur performers. \"The disease runs in the family,\" he said. \"I just hadn't been diagnosed, I guess!\"",
      "He set out to be a concert pianist. He still plays every day, but decided to become an actor instead while he was a student at Yale.",
      "And what brought him to comedy? \"I think it has to do with what I was drawn to,\" Pierce said. \"I watched reruns of 'The Dick Van Dyke Show' and 'Mary Tyler Moore' and 'All in the Family.' When I was a teenager, 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' came to American television on PBS, and my head blew off. I loved Alec Guinness. Oh, and Buster Keaton. Oh my God, Buster Keaton!\"",
      "It's impossible not to see a hint of Buster Keaton in Pierce's famous ironing board scene from \"Frasier\":",
      "Pierce said, \"I do want people to be able to laugh.\"",
      "\"Why? What does that mean to you? Why is it important?\"",
      "\"I guess it's the perception of connection,\" he said. \"For example, doing a comic film is not nearly as enjoyable for me as doing a comic play. In a comic play, you feel from the audience the connection. That's what I'm in it for. That's where I started out. I love that.\"",
      "For almost as long as he's been in it, his partner along the way, his husband since 2008, has been actor-writer Brian Hargrove. They met at an audition, became friends, and only later discovered they were both gay. \"Brian had me over to dinner at his apartment to do my taxes,\" said Pierce.",
      "\"I used to have a tax business as well as an actor,\" said Hargrove.",
      "\"That's not a metaphor; that's actually what he was doing. Tax practitioner! And then we were going to see this movie, and it came up. We went back to his apartment, and then, as Brian puts it, I never left.\"",
      "That was in 1983. It was Hargrove who suggested moving to California, which led to Pierce being cast as Dr. Niles Crane alongside Kelsey Grammer in \"Frasier.\" Forty years, four Emmys and two Tonys later, he chose not to be in the \"Frasier\" reboot. At the time he was playing Julia Child's husband, Paul, on HBO. \"I've been very happy with what originally came to me, and then when I've been able to make choices in my career and the choices I've made,\" Pierce said. \"My creativity is fueled by change and by diversity.\"",
      "Which is why David Hyde Pierce said yes to \"Pirates\" \u2013 and a new chance to make people laugh in one of his old favorites.",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:11:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Affordable Care Act requires health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive-care services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force at no cost to patients.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday considered a case that could impact whether Americans have to pay out-of-pocket for preventive-care services such as diabetes screenings, HIV-prevention drugs and statins, which are currently provided to patients at no cost under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The legal battle is the latest to land before the high court that involves the landmark health care overhaul signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in 2010. But this dispute turns on how to classify the 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which sits within the Department of Health and Human Services and has been making recommendations on preventive medical services to avoid serious health conditions since 1984.",
      "But last year, a federal appeals court in New Orleans found that the task force's structure violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because its members are principal officers who were not properly appointed. Principal officers must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "If the Supreme Court affirms the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, major hospital associations and leading nonprofits advocating on behalf of breast cancer and HIV patients have warned it would limit access to life-saving medical care for millions of patients, as insurers would no longer be required to cover at no cost to patients the services recommended by the task force.",
      "\"Patients who relied on the promise of preventive care without out-of-pocket costs for a variety of lifesaving interventions and screenings may now need to bear those costs themselves,\" a coalition of trade groups, led by the American Hospital Association, wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief file with the Supreme Court. \"Realistically, this means that patients will not seek out essential preventive care or adhere to preventive medications after they are prescribed.\"",
      "While the Preventive Services Task Force has for more than three decades been making recommendations on preventive medical services, its role was codified by Congress in 1999. The task force's volunteer members are selected by the health and human services secretary and appointed to a four-year term. There are no restrictions on a member's removal, though Congress has said that all members and its recommendations \"shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "With passage of the Affordable Care Act, Congress required health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "Congress did not create a list of covered preventive services when it passed the ACA, but instead provided for categories of services that must be covered based on the recommendations of medical experts, including the task force. The Biden and Trump administrations have both estimated that millions of Americans have received these services for free through their insurance plans.",
      "Among the preventive services currently recommended by the task force are screenings for lung, cervical and colorectal cancers, as well as diabetes; statin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke; and medication to prevent HIV, known as PrEP, which gave rise to the legal battle currently before the Supreme Court.",
      "During arguments on Monday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested the language of the statute that established the task force is different from others involving the structure of independent agencies, which specify its officers are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and limit a president's ability to remove members to certain grounds.",
      "\"All of that's missing here,\" he said.",
      "Kavanaugh told Jonathan Mitchell, who argued that the task force's members are unlawfully appointed, that his argument hinges on the Supreme Court treating the task force as a \"massively important\" agency that makes \"critical decisions\" that affect a key segment of the economy, without any supervision or direction by the secretary.",
      "\"Normally, before that kind of thing would happen, Congress would've provided stronger indications that this task force is enormously important,\" he said, adding that he doesn't see any indicators that the entity is \"more powerful than the secretary of Health and Human Services or the president in terms of how these recommendations are going to affect the health care industry.\"",
      "Justice Elena Kagan also questioned why the secretary's power to remove task force members at will is not enough to show that they are accountable to the leader of the Department Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, which would undercut Mitchell's characterization of the members as principal officers who must be appointed by the president and Senate-confirmed.",
      "\"If you read this court's decisions, it seems often to be the end-all and the be-all that the court has suggested on many occasions that removal power is really the essence of control: If you have it, you have control. If you don't have it, you don't have control,\" she said.",
      "Kagan also said it would be \"odd\" for Congress to set up a task force, but not say who picks its members.",
      "Other justices questioned the scope of the word \"independent,\" and whether that puts the task force outside of the secretary's supervision.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor likened the task force, which gives technical advice, to her law clerks, who may offer independent judgments but are hired to \"help the decision-makers come to a conclusion.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court finds that the task force members are inferior officers, one possible outcome that was raised during the arguments was sending the case back to the 5th Circuit for more proceedings to decide whether Congress gave the Health and Human Services secretary the authority to appoint them.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch first raised that option and noted that the lower court didn't address whether the secretary has that power.",
      "While inferior officers must be appointed by the president and Senate, Congress can choose to vest this appointment power elsewhere, to an agency leader, for instance.",
      "The dispute before the high court arose after the task force recommended in June 2019 that PrEP be included among the preventive services covered without cost-sharing arrangements. A group of four individuals and two small businesses filed a lawsuit targeting the Preventive Services Task Force, and objected to the ACA's requirement that insurers cover certain HIV-prevention drugs that are recommended by it on religious grounds.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that providing coverage of PrEP \"encourages and facilitates homosexual behavior,\" which conflicts with their religious beliefs, and said they want to purchase or provide plans that exclude coverage of that medication.",
      "Five of the six challengers do not participate in the health insurance market, and the sixth, Braidwood Management, provides coverage to 70 employees through a self-insured plan.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Texas, argued that the task force's structure violates the Constitution's Appointments Clause because its members are principal officers who therefore must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "The district court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that the task force members were improperly appointed. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor also invalidated all preventive-care coverage recommendations that had been implemented since the ACA was signed into law in March 2010, and barred the government from enforcing the health care law's coverage requirements in response to the task force's recommendations going forward.",
      "The 5th Circuit affirmed the lower court's finding that the task force's structure is unconstitutional, but disagreed with the universal relief it provided as to the task force's prior requirements for preventive-care coverage.",
      "In concluding that the task force's members are principal officers, the 5th Circuit said they were not properly appointed because they wield \"unreviewable power\" \u2014 issuing preventive-care recommendations for services that insurers, in turn, must cover under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court and the Trump administration has continued to defend the board's structure.",
      "Hashim Mooppan, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices that the task force members are inferior officers because they are \"subject to ample supervision\" by the Health and Human Services secretary when issuing recommendations on preventive care services that must be covered by insurers and group health plans.",
      "Additionally, the task force members can be removed by the head of the Health and Human Services Department at-will, and the secretary can review its recommendations and prevent them from taking effect, Mooppan said.",
      "Given these \"collective powers of supervision,\" the task force can't issue recommendations that bind the insurance industry unless the secretary permits it to do so, he said.",
      "In court filings, the Trump administration also noted that even if the task force members were principal officers who had to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, the constitutional violation would be remedied by severing a provision of federal law that the 5th Circuit found insulates it from the Health and Human Services secretary's supervision.",
      "Doing that would allow the task force to \"make recommendations that will have legal effect only under appropriate supervision by the secretary,\" then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in a February brief.",
      "But lawyers for Braidwood Management have said that the task force members are principal officers who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate in part because federal law dictates that their recommendations be kept \"independent\" and \"not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "\"Congress has chosen to create an independent task force and shield it from political pressure,\" Mitchell, who argued on behalf of Braidwood Management, told the justices.",
      "He said that it's \"not clear\" Congress would even have approved a regime under which the secretary \u2014 a political appointee \u2014 rather than an independent task force decides the preventive care that insurers have to cover.",
      "Even if the Supreme Court finds that the members are inferior officers, as the Trump administration argues, Mitchell said that category of executive branch officials still requires appointment by the president and Senate, unless Congress says otherwise.",
      "He also disputed that the court can fix these constitutional violations by separating out the problematic provision of the law and empowering the secretary to veto the task force's recommendations for mandated preventive-care coverage. The task force, Mitchell said, would still have unreviewable discretion when it decides not to require coverage of a particular service.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, outside medical organizations have warned that a decision invalidating the structure of the task force would have significant ramifications for access to preventive care.",
      "The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation said that the elimination of cost-sharing for breast cancer preventive-care measures has had a \"profound impact\" on public health because screenings lead to earlier detection and treatment, and fewer deaths.",
      "\"The costs of such preventive care \u2014 if not fully covered by insurance, which is the effect of the district court's decision \u2014 dissuade individuals from utilizing the services, and thus lead to later detection, later-stage diagnoses, more aggressive treatment plans, higher treatment costs, and more deaths,\" the organization said in a brief.",
      "The HIV and Hepatitis Policy Institute said the task force's recommendations have been \"essential\" to preventing HIV, hepatitis and other infectious diseases for millions of patients.",
      "\"Without continued access to the no-cost prevention assured under the ACA and consequent new transmissions, our nation will witness a reversal of decades of progress as HIV resurges,\" the group said in a brief, joined by 19 other organizations.",
      "But groups backing Braidwood have argued that the task force is insulated from political accountability, as the ACA left no room for supervision by the Health and Human Services secretary or any other principal officer who answers to the president.",

    "summary": "Some employees working on the CDC's measles response were warned they could face layoffs.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has scrapped a plan to offer help curbing measles in Texas schools after some staff working on the agency's response to this year's record outbreak of the virus were warned they could face layoffs, an agency employee said.",
      "CDC officials had initially weighed expanding a service they had been offering to hospitals in Texas \u2014 onsite assessments to root out how errors in ventilation and air filtration could be enabling spread of the virus \u2013 to other kinds of facilities like schools as well.",
      "\"Being on the ground allows us to actually look at the filters that are in place, look at the HVAC systems, how they're set up, how they're being used, how they're being monitored. And after seeing what we did, I'm glad we did,\" Dylan Neu, who had led the CDC's ventilation assessments in Texas, told CBS News.",
      "Neu is a biomedical engineer for the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, which was largely eliminated by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s first wave of layoffs earlier this month.",
      "He spoke with CBS News as a member of the labor union American Federation of Government Employees Local 3840, which represents NIOSH employees in Ohio that were impacted by Kennedy's layoffs.",
      "Two experts from NIOSH \u2014 Neu and an industrial hygienist \u2014 were first sent to Texas on March 20 at the state's request. They found a number of issues at hospitals in Texas that had been actively treating measles patients during the outbreak, Neu said.",
      "The agency's teams do careful inspections of the hospital's facilities, assessing how air is moving, he said, which can be difficult to accurately do over the phone with people unfamiliar with the technical details of how HVAC systems work.",
      "In one example, an isolation room at a hospital was found to have been pressurized wrongly, with air flowing out of the room with the measles patient, Neu said. Another hospital had skipped a key step in setting up an air filter in their waiting room: unwrapping the filter before turning it on.",
      "\"They might say in an interview, 'Yeah, we purchased HEPA filters. They've been running in the waiting room.' But if they're not actually out of the plastic bag, they're not doing what they think they're doing,\" Neu said.",
      "While Neu remains on the job for now, he received a notice on April 1 warning him to expect to be laid off by HHS in the coming weeks.",
      "\"This action is necessary to align our workforce with the agency's current and future needs and to ensure the efficient and effective operation of our programs,\" Neu's notice from the department said.",
      "Neu said he received the notice while in his hotel room in Texas, as he prepared to return from his deployment. Most of his colleagues and the leadership above him within NIOSH have either been laid off, offered reassignments to other agencies or warned to expect cuts.",
      "\"My current understanding is that I'll be working in the office until the end of this month, and then I'll be on 60 days administrative leave until June 30th, and then we'll be separated at that point,\" he said.",
      "Agency officials scrapped plans to offer future ventilation assessments to Texas, he said, because of the prospect that he might get laid off while in the field and cut off from the agency's systems.",
      "A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "While much of the work Neu's team does at NIOSH is research, he said that experts on his team have often been tapped to deploy to emergency responses as the agency's primary experts on topics like ventilation and contamination.",
      "He recounted several past deployments, ranging from helping hospitals around the country draw up plans to prepare for Ebola cases during the Obama administration, to helping the agency's quarantine station at Detroit's airport build an isolation room to screen passengers early during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We're involved in pretty much every response the CDC is involved in. Especially if there's some sort of engineering or ventilation component, NIOSH gets called in as that scientific expertise,\" he said.",
      "The layoffs have also upended other work done by NIOSH to respond to requests like health hazard evaluations, where workplaces can call on the agency for help investigating health issues on the job, like cancer clusters\u00a0or fungal outbreaks.",
      "Impact on the CDC's measles response also goes beyond NIOSH. CBS News previously reported that multiple agency staff assigned to the effort had been let go.",
      "An official said Tuesday that the CDC was now \"scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support\" to Texas and other states now facing outbreaks.",

    "summary": "Some states want to block SNAP recipients from using benefits to buy sugary foods as part of the \"make America healthy again\" movement.",
    "story": [
      "The federal food stamp program is facing scrutiny in some states that want to block enrollees from using their government benefits to buy soda and candy.",
      "Three Republican-led states \u2014 Arkansas, Idaho and Indiana \u2014 on Tuesday moved to ban purchases of soda and candy with benefits provided by the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Those states have a combined total of roughly 1 million residents on SNAP out of the program's total 41.7 million U.S. participants.",
      "Other states are also likely to restrict SNAP recipients' food purchases, experts say. Lawmakers in states including Arizona, Kansas and Tennessee\u00a0have introduced similar measures to curtail food stamp purchases of sugary foods and drinks.",
      "The rationale for such legislation is the view that blocking low-income Americans from using food stamps on soda and candy will help improve their health. But anti-hunger advocates say that these restrictions will add to negative perceptions of receiving food aid, while also being unlikely to improve recipients' eating habits.",
      "\"It's stigmatizing to say, 'You who are low income, we don't trust you to make the right choices,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, the SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger research group.",
      "Instead, she said, these states would be better off focusing on the biggest obstacle to healthy eating: the high cost of groceries, particularly the expense of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Because SNAP provides an average individual monthly benefit of $187, or a little over $6 per day, many recipients fill up by purchasing the cheapest, most calorie-dense foods they can afford, she added.",
      "Grocery costs soared during the pandemic, surging almost 24% from 2020 to 2024 and outpacing overall inflation by almost three percentage points, according to an analysis from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Food prices aren't expected to drop anytime soon, with the USDA forecasting that groceries could rise 2.7% in 2025, adding to the challenges SNAP recipients face in affording healthy food.",
      "Make America healthy again?",
      "In announcing plans to block food stamp purchases of soda and candy, Idaho Governor Brad Little on Tuesday\u00a0proclaimed that the state \"welcomes the MAHA movement,\" referring to the \"make America healthy again\" movement started by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders credited the Trump administration with placing \"a laser focus on solving America's chronic disease epidemic,\" saying that banning candy and soda from food stamp purchases is \"a great place to start.\"",
      "About 80 cents of every $1 in SNAP benefits is used to purchase staples like meat, bread, milk, cereal and rice, with the remainder going to salty snacks, candy and sweetened beverages. Households that rely on food stamps have very similar patterns of spending to households not on food stamps, according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "The Arkansas plan, which would take effect in July 2026, would exclude soda, including no- and low-calorie soda; fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice; \"unhealthy drinks;\" candy, including confections made with flour, like Kit Kat bars; and artificially sweetened candy.",
      "It also would allow participants to use benefits to buy hot rotisserie chicken, which is excluded from the program now under the SNAP program's longstanding ban on hot foods. Food stamp recipients also would be barred from using their benefits to buy nonfood items, such as soap or toothpaste, as well as alcohol or tobacco.",
      "Some industries are pushing back against the SNAP restrictions. Representatives for American Beverage accused state and federal officials of \"choosing to be the food police rather than take truly meaningful steps to lift people off SNAP with good-paying jobs.\"",
      "The National Confectioners Association called the approach \"misguided.\"",
      "\"SNAP participants and non-SNAP participants alike understand that chocolate and candy are treats \u2014 not meal replacements,\" spokesman Chris Gindlesperger said.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health\"",
      "Over the past two decades, lawmakers from both political parties have proposed halting SNAP payments for everything from soda to\u00a0 steak. To date, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the SNAP program, hasn't granted the required waivers for states to curb food stamp purchases.",
      "But the Trump administration is signaling that it will grant the waivers requested this week, with USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins saying in a Tuesday statement\u00a0that she plans to quickly approve Arkansas' request.",
      "\"I have said since my confirmation that USDA has a role to play in improving nutrition programs to better serve individuals in need of support, all while recognizing the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Rollins said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our shared goal should be to lift millions of Americans out of dependency and into hopeful futures and insert new energy and ideas into long-ignored programs like diet-related, chronic disease.\"",
      "Blocking SNAP purchases of candy and soda wouldn't keep recipients from using their own money to buy such items, as food stamp benefits typically pay for roughly\u00a0two-thirds of a household's grocery costs.",
      "But advocates of banning unhealthy foods from SNAP say that taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for supporting bad eating habits.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health,\" Sanders said Tuesday at a news conference with Rollins in Little Rock, Arkansas. \"We're paying for it on the front end and the back end.\"",

    "story": [
      "One out of 31 children \u2014 more than 3% of kids \u2014 have been identified with autism, according to the latest results published Tuesday from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that tracks trends of autism's prevalence across some communities in the U.S.",
      "\"They've again gone up dramatically, just in two years. We have in some states as low as 1 out of 20 boys having autism, 1 out of 31 kids. And when I was, in my generation today, the rate of autism was 1 in 10,000,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday in Indiana, announcing the new findings. \"And this is just one disease. This whole generation of kids is damaged by chronic disease.\"",
      "Kennedy often cites the CDC's figures from this study as evidence for his claim that the U.S. is now seeing a growing \"epidemic\"\u00a0of autism, which experts and advocacy groups have criticized as stigmatizing and misleading.",
      "\"As the report indicates, more children have access to evaluations for autism and more children are being identified as autistic. This is encouraging because when children are identified early, appropriate supports and services can be tailored to help them, and their families thrive,\" said Dr. Kristin Sohl, of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism, in a statement shared before Kennedy's remarks and the report's release.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told \"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0that the definition of what autism is has also expanded.",
      "\"It's a spectrum. It's not just one thing. ... So that's part of it,\" she said. \"We also are being much more aggressive about looking for it \u2014 pediatricians, educators.\"",
      "The definitions used in this study are also quite broad, Gounder added.",
      "\"They were looking at both health records, educational records, did a student access special ed supports, that sort of thing,\" she said. \"So part of it is the way in which we're looking for it. But there also does seem to be an underlying increase that has been occurring over time.\"",
      "For years, CDC scientists have said that the data indicating a rise in diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, could be reflecting improved screening and access to autism services in some communities. However, the agency's experts were not made available for a press briefing about the latest findings, marking a change from previous years.",
      "\"Research has not demonstrated that living in certain communities puts children at greater risk for developing ASD,\" the CDC's authors said in their report.",
      "The study's authors said estimated autism prevalence was consistently higher among Asian, Black and Hispanic children compared to White children. Factors like disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning could be contributing to this gap, the report says.",
      "Data from sites in 16 communities were collected for the new CDC report. The last report found a rate of 1 in 36 children through 2020, based on data from 11 communities.",
      "While the network's data is not nationally representative, figures from other federally-funded surveys and studies have also tracked a rise in autism's prevalence over the past two decades, accelerating in the early 2000s.",
      "\"Autistic children add value to our communities. Advocating for resources and funding to support autistic people across the lifespan is essential for a productive and healthy America,\" Sohl said in the statement.",
      "It comes as federal spending into autism research has also surged, largely going into efforts to study the biology suspected to underlie the condition. While scientists have linked up to 90% of autism to genetic traits, other factors are also suspected to play a role in changing its risk.",
      "Kennedy has said he believes \"an environmental toxin\" is causing autism, pointing to a range of potential culprits from food contaminants to vaccines.",
      "Many studies have debunked the claim that vaccines cause autism. But there is less research for some other factors that studies suggest might be linked to autism, ranging from pesticides to time between pregnancies.",
      "\"While the number of studies investigating the epidemiology of autism is increasing, most potential environmental factors have not been investigated sufficiently to draw firm conclusions,\" the federal government's autism research coordination office said in 2023.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Kennedy claimed that autism was preventable and said that it was \"unforgivable that we have not yet identified the underlying causes.\"",
      "\"We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September,\" he said. Leading autism organizations have expressed skepticism over that promise and concern that he will revive debunked theories.",
      "Finding an answer to the cause or causes of autism by September is \"not realistic,\" Gounder said.",
      "\"Some of the theories include diabetes during pregnancy that might be affecting the development of the child, air pollution, exposure to micro plastics, antibiotic use and the way that changes the microbiome and the gut,\" she said. \"There's a whole bunch of different theories. And again, because it's so many different diseases actually labeled Autism Spectrum Disorder, it's going to take a while to really tease that out.\"",
      "The CDC also released a statement noting that prevalence varied widely between different sites in the study. That variation \"could reflect differences in availability of services for early detection, evaluation, and diagnostic practices,\" Dr. Karyl Rattay, head of the CDC's Division of Human Development and Disability, said.",
      "CDC delayed report, barred agency experts from media",
      "The CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities was initially planning to release the report in March this year, multiple officials told CBS News. Its publication was pushed back by CDC officials amid a department-wide pause on communications ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "Plans to make the agency's experts available to explain and interpret the results were also scrapped, said multiple CDC officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ahead of the agency's last release of autism figures in 2023, CDC scientists appeared at press briefings and interviews with media outlets about the report.",
      "That year, news outlets were also provided with embargoed copies of the report ahead of time to give journalists time to prepare their reports and interview experts. This longstanding practice has also now been abandoned agency-wide under the Trump administration, officials said, both for the autism report and many other studies published by the agency.",

    "summary": "Federal health officials want companies to swap out certain food dyes with natural alternatives.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is asking the food industry to stop using synthetic food dyes, in a bid to fulfill one of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goals to swap them out with natural alternatives in the U.S. food supply.",
      "The FDA's move stops short of the outright ban that had been floated for in Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform from the campaign trail. Instead, it relies on what the Department of Health and Human Services said was a \"national standard and timeline for the industry\" to voluntarily make the switch.",
      "\"Let's start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes. But we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly,\" FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told reporters at an event to announce the plan.",
      "Makary said he had had \"wonderful meetings with the food industry\" and claimed that they are eager to remove artificial dyes from the food supply.",
      "\"They want to do it. So why go down a complicated road with Congress when they want to do this,\" Makary said.",
      "HHS says the FDA will be \"working with industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic food dyes\" and will also be accelerating the review and approval of some new natural color additives.",
      "Response from the food industry",
      "The food dye industry denied that there was a safety concern with artificial dyes, citing past reviews by the FDA and other international authorities, and said that their use is \"essential for consistency, visual appeal, and consumer trust in food products.\"",
      "\"Requiring reformulation by the end of 2026 ignores scientific evidence and underestimates the complexity of food production. The process is neither simple nor immediate, and the resulting supply disruptions will limit access to familiar, affordable grocery items,\" the International Association of Color Manufacturers said in a statement after the announcement.",
      "The group representing milk, cheese and yogurt manufacturers, the International Dairy Foods Association, announced a \"voluntary\" pledge for some of its members stop adding artificial colors to producs supplied to school lunches.",
      "The National Confectioners Association, which represents candy brands, was noncommittal in\u00a0their response, saying that they \"look forward to working with the Trump Administration and Congress on this issue.\"",
      "A\u00a0statement from the Consumer Brands Association, which represents industry giants from Coca-Cola to WK Kellogg, also stopped short of pledging to remove all synthetic dyes by 2026, but said they \"appreciate that the administration has reasserted their leadership\" in response to a patchwork of state laws.",
      "\"Removing these safe ingredients does not change the consumer packaged goods industry's commitment to providing safe, affordable and convenient product choices to consumers,\" the association said.",
      "Why Makary opposes synthetic dyes",
      "Ending the use of artificial dyes has long been a goal of Kennedy's agenda, over concerns that these colors are inflating the consumption of unhealthy foods and raising the risk of potentially worrying behavioral changes in children, among other risks.",
      "\"Why are we taking a gamble? Parents, moms and dads have also tried to raise attention to this issue. Some parents have observed that these chemicals cause hyperactivity and even aggressive behavior, and that it subsides when the chemicals are removed from the diet,\" said Makary.",
      "Makary said that the scientific community \"has conducted a number of studies raising concerns about the correlation\" between synthetic dyes derived from petroleum and health conditions like ADHD, obesity, stomach or digestive issues and allergies.",
      "\"Other studies have found that artificial colors that create vibrant colors mess with the child's developing brain to make ultra-processed foods more attractive, even when the child already feels full,\" said Makary.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the FDA moved to revoke the authorization for one synthetic dye, Red 3, after studies suggested that the color additive could cause cancer in laboratory animals at high doses.",
      "The food and drug industry has a few years to stop using the food dye completely. Makary said they are asking companies to stop using the dye sooner than the deadlines laid out by the agency under the law, which are as late as 2028 for drugmakers.",
      "While FDA officials at the time said the way that Red 3 caused cancer in animals did not apply to humans, officials said their hands were tied by a law called the Delaney Clause that required them to pull any additives from the market shown to cause cancer in animals.",
      "The agency has faced calls for years to pull other synthetic food dyes derived from petroleum like Red 40, which is largely absent from food in some other countries.",
      "Pressure on the agency has stepped up in recent years, after an influential report by California authorities\u00a0 in 2021 concluded that synthetic food dyes \"can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children.\" A handful of states have now moved to ban the use of these synthetic food dyes in school meal programs.",
      "For years in Europe, companies adding Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes have also had to add a warning label to their products saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "However, FDA officials had previously said that the data was a far cry from being enough to merit banning the dyes. The agency also closely oversees the production of synthetic food dyes, checking for impurities that might result in a safety risk.",
      "Makary said Tuesday's announcement calling for food companies to stop using the artificial dyes \"fulfills the administration's promise to use both gold-standard science and common sense.\"",
      "\"For the last 50 years, we have been running one of the largest uncontrolled scientific experiments in the world, on our nation's children, without their consent,\" said Makary.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Apr 2025 06:49:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Allianz survey finds that nearly two-thirds of Americans are more worried about running out of money in retirement than they are about dying.",
    "story": [
      "Faced with inflation, taxes and concerns over the size of Social Security benefits, most Americans are more afraid of going broke in retirement than they are of death.",
      "That's according to a new study from Allianz Life that surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults aged 25 years and older with annual incomes of $50,000 and above. In total, 64% of respondents across generations said they are more stressed about running out of funds in their golden years than the prospect of death.",
      "\"It's much higher right now than it has been for quite a while,\" said Kelly LaVigne, VP of consumer insights at Allianz Life. The company has been polling people on the question of whether dying or running out of money worries them more since 2022.",
      "Americans say they need $1.26 million to finance a comfortable retirement, according to a\u00a0recent study by Northwestern Mutual. That's $200,000 lower than last year's estimate, but still a far cry from the median amount of $87,000 people have saved in their retirement accounts, according to Federal Reserve Board's\u00a0Survey of Consumer Finances.",
      "Among the different age groups, Gen Xers, for whom retirement is fast approaching, are the most concerned about running out of money before they die. Seventy percent of the age group expressed concern, followed by 61% of boomers. Ages 61 to 79, boomers are already in their retirement era, while Gen Xers, ages 45 to 60, will be the next generation to retire.",
      "\"Certainly for boomers who are already in retirement, inflation is a big deal because you only have a certain amount of money that you're going to have for the rest of your life,\" said LaVigne.",
      "Tough time to save money",
      "Though Inflation rates have eased since peaking in June 2022, the cost of basic living expenses\u00a0is still rising, making it difficult for Americans to sock away extra savings. Over 50% of those surveyed by Allianz said high inflation contributed to their fear of running out of money in retirement.",
      "Other factors contributing to Americans' fears include high taxes and concern over whether monthly Social Security payments will provide them with enough financial support. For the average American, Social Security benefits typically replaces about 40% of their income, LaVigne said.",
      "Recent shake-ups at the Social Security Administration carried out by the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also stoked fears about the stability of the government agency.",
      "LaVigne's advice for distressed savers: Don't let fear stop you from seeking help. \"You really want to make sure that you're working with a professional to help you get through the times like this, where there's a lot of uncertainty,\" he said.",

    "summary": "President Trump said he isn't planning on firing Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after calling Powell a \"major loser.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he has \"no intention of firing\"\u00a0Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after the president called Powell a \"major loser\" and publicly lobbied the central bank chief to lower interest rates at a faster clip.",
      "When asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he has any plans to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said he \"never did\" and claimed \"the press runs away with things\" \u2014 though he once again pressed Powell to cut interest rates, which remain elevated after the Fed hiked rates to quell inflation.",
      "\"This is a perfect time to lower interest rates,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If he doesn't, is it the end? No, it's not. But it would be good timing.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump argued in a social media post that Powell is \"always TOO LATE AND WRONG,\" and said his \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" drawing speculation that the president could try to oust Powell before his four-year term ends next year.",
      "Powell has led the Fed since 2018, after Mr. Trump initially nominated him for the job. Former President Joe Biden nominated Powell for a second term, bringing his time atop the central bank to at least May 2026.",
      "It's not clear if Mr. Trump has the power to fire Powell. According to federal law and past legal precedent, members of the Federal Reserve board \u2014 which includes the chair \u2014 can only be removed from their jobs before their terms expire \"for cause.\" However, the Trump administration has argued it has the legal right to fire members of other independent federal agencies, setting up a court fight over the issue that could have broad consequences.",
      "The administration will \"study\" whether it has the right to fire Powell, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told reporters last week.",
      "For his part, Powell\u00a0said last year he will not step down if Mr. Trump asks him to leave his job.",
      "Why is Trump criticizing Powell \u2014 and why does it matter?",
      "Mr. Trump's feud with Powell revolves around the Fed's decision to leave interest rates steady so far this year, after lowering rates from a decades-long high in late 2024. The decision has broad implications. Cutting interest rates can lead to higher economic growth and lower borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which is why Mr. Trump is lobbying for cuts. But lower rates can also boost inflation. And while the inflation rate is now well below its 2022 peak, it remains above the Fed's 2% year-over-year benchmark.",
      "Powell has cited \"uncertainty\" for the Fed's decision to pause rate cuts. Last week, Powell warned\u00a0that Mr. Trump's steep tariffs on foreign imports could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, posing a \"challenging scenario\" for the central bank.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump repeatedly lashed out at Powell on social media, calling him \"Mr. Too Late\" on Monday and arguing the Federal Reserve should slash rates more aggressively because there is \"virtually No Inflation.\"",
      "The showdown \u2014 and the possibility Mr. Trump could try to fire Powell \u2014 have sparked concerns about whether the Federal Reserve will maintain its independence, allowing it to make decisions about economic policy without political influence. Stocks slumped Monday amid concerns about upheaval at the Fed, before rebounding Tuesday.",
      "In an interview Sunday with \"Face the Nation,\" Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, warned that a loss of independence would \"undermine the credibility of the Fed.\" Countries without independent central banks typically have worse inflation, slower economic growth and more sluggish job markets, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday the president \"has the right to express...his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\" Leavitt also said Mr. Trump believes the Fed has \"been making moves and taking action in the name of politics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at Powell for years. The president sharply criticized Powell when the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, before calling the central banker his \"most improved player\" after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted steep rate cuts in 2020.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is facing a corporate reckoning on Tuesday, with the electric car maker's first-quarter results showing sales and profit fell short of analyst expectations while the billionaire was focused on leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts.",
      "Ahead of the quarterly report, investors submitted questions to Tesla they hoped to get answered during the company's earnings conference call. A top issue flagged by investors is Elon Musk himself, with dozens asking about his focus on the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and when he might redirect his energies to running Tesla.",
      "\"Can Elon please provide some reassurance that at some point soon he will be done with DOGE and politics?\" one investor asked. \"Many Tesla shareholders wish he would reprioritize the majority of his time and effort to engineering.\"",
      "That's a question that Wall Street also wants answered. Tesla's stock price has plunged 53% from its most recent high in December, when the stock was pushed higher after President Trump's electoral victory on optimism that Musk's role advising Mr. Trump would help the EV maker's bottom line.",
      "But Musk's activities with DOGE \u2014 including cutting tens of thousands of federal workers and accessing taxpayers' personal data \u2014 have alienated some consumers and sparked protests across the globe, causing the stock price to deflate.",
      "Investors got an answer on Tuesday afternoon, with Musk announcing on a call to discuss the company's earnings that he plans to scale back his time spent on DOGE, beginning next month.",
      "\"Starting probably in next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,\" Musk said.",
      "But Musk added he plans to continue his involvement with DOGE throughout Mr. Trump's term, saying he will likely spend one to two days a week on government issues moving forward. \"Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" he said.",
      "Musk also defended his work on DOGE, saying that he needed to \"fight the waste and fraud and try to get the country back on the right track.\"",
      "Tariff impact",
      "The company cautioned that \"trade policy\" and \"changing political sentiment\" could impact demand for its products in the near term. Mr. Trump's tariffs are expected to result in higher prices for many vehicles, including Teslas.",
      "Musk also said he would like to see lower tariffs, but that the decision is Mr. Trump's. \"I'm advocating for lower tariffs, rather than higher, but that's all I can do,\" the Tesla CEO said in the earnings call.",
      "The company's first-quarter results were \"grim,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a note to investors. [E]xpectations were very low, but these are still bad numbers.\"",
      "Tesla's transformation into a symbol of the Trump administration has dampened demand for the vehicles, and could reduce demand for Tesla vehicles by 15% to 20% due to consumers who don't want to be associated with the billionaire, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a research note.",
      "\"Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,\" Ives concluded.",
      "What time is the Tesla earnings call?",
      "Tesla's earnings fell short of analyst expectations. The company reported a per-share profit of 27 cents, compared with an average forecast of 41 cents per share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.",
      "Net income tumbled 71% to $409 million, versus $1.39 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Sales slid 9% to $19.3 billion, far short of the $21.3 billion expected by analysts.",
      "Tesla shares, which have fallen 41% this year, were largely flat in after-hours trading.",
      "Earlier this month, Tesla said its delivery of vehicles in the first three months of 2025 fell nearly 13% as demand for the automaker's electric cars continued to weaken, with deliveries also falling well short of analysts' expectations.",
      "In assessing Tesla's latest financial results, Crisafulli thinks Tesla boosters are likely to focus on the company's plan to start testing its Robotaxi and a humanoid robot called Optimus later this year, as well as beginning production of a lower cost vehicle in the months ahead.",
      "But more bearish observers will conclude \"there's no reason to think things are about to get a lot better\" at Tesla, he said, adding that its Robotaxi service is well behind Alphabet's Waymo self-driving vehicle rollout.",
      "Under this view, \"Musk's personal brand has been permanently tarnished by his political activities in the last several months, and exiting DOGE won't change that. On top of all this, the stock remains very expensive,\" Crisafulli said.",
      "In addition to insights into Musk's role at Tesla, investors will also be listening for updates on several strategic initiatives. The company is expected to roll out a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y SUV, later in the year. Tesla has also said it plans to start a paid driverless robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June.",

      "Elon Musk told Tesla investors he's scaling back his work at the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, saying the amount of time he spends on the task force will \"drop significantly\" starting in May.",
      "As the Trump administration's cost-cutting initiative, DOGE has slashed tens of thousands of federal jobs in the name of reducing fraud, waste and abuse. But DOGE has also sparked a backlash \u2014 and plenty of lawsuits \u2014 as critics accuse it of accessing voters' private data and cutting programs that are vital to many Americans.",
      "At the same time, Tesla's sales have taken a hit as the automaker's vehicles have increasingly become a symbol of the Trump administration, repelling some consumers. The stock has also plunged more than 50% from its most recent high in December, when the shares surged after the presidential election on optimism that Musk's role advising Mr. Trump would help the EV maker's bottom line.",
      "\"Starting probably in next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,\" Musk said on a conference call to discuss Tesla's earnings.",
      "But Musk added he plans to continue his involvement with DOGE throughout Mr. Trump's term, saying he will likely spend one to two days a week on government issues moving forward. \"Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" he said.",
      "Tesla shares, which have fallen 41% this year, jumped 4% to $247.53 after Musk vowed to scale back his work at DOGE.",
      "Tesla's first-quarter earnings, announced Tuesday, fell far short of analyst expectations, with revenue tumbling 9% and profit slumping 71%.",
      "Musk's leaving DOGE might not heal the wounds that Tesla has suffered due to Musk's activities, some analysts say.",
      "\"Musk's personal brand has been permanently tarnished by his political activities in the last several months, and exiting DOGE won't change that,\" noted Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge in a Tuesday research note. \"On top of all this, the stock remains very expensive.\"",
      "Tesla's issues go beyond politics. The company that once dominated the EV market is now facing fierce competition from U.S. automakers such as Ford to rivals in Europe that are offering new models with advanced technology that is making them real alternatives.",
      "Earlier this year, Chinese EV maker BYD announced it had developed an electric battery charging system that can fully power up a vehicle within minutes.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 16:18:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Record consumer debt, years of steep inflation and other factors are driving more Americans to considering filing for bankruptcy.",
    "story": [
      "The number of Americans considering bankruptcy is soaring to its highest level since just before the pandemic, a potentially alarming sign as clouds gather over the economy.",
      "Personal bankruptcy inquiries surged in the first three months of the year, according to data from LegalShield, a provider of consumer legal services. The jump could augur a potential wave of\u00a0bankruptcy filings\u00a0as consumers start to buckle under a record level of debt and as\u00a0tariffs fuel inflation, the company warned in a report this week.",
      "Personal bankruptcy filings in the U.S. averaged about 750,000 a year before COVID-19, but fell sharply during the pandemic itself as Americans were buoyed by trillions of dollars in government aid and relief.",
      "LegalShield now expects bankruptcies to surge as soon as this this summer. \"Consumers are calling lawyers to ask questions because they can't pay their bills or are having trouble, and they ask about the process of filing for bankruptcy,\" Matt Layton, LegalShield senior vice president of consumer analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Why are more Americans mulling bankruptcy?",
      "Heavy consumer debts, years of stiff inflation and higher interest rates are squeezing Americans' budgets, according to Layton. Billing disputes, debt collections and other leading indicators of bankruptcy are also on the rise.",
      "\"Our members are calling and saying, 'I don't have enough money at the end of month to pay my bills.' They're asking which ones to pay and which ones to put off. They're saying, 'They're coming to get my car \u2014 what can I do about these things?'\" Layton said.",
      "The jump in Americans who are considering declaring bankruptcy reflects the tough economic economic and financial conditions that have prevailed 2020, experts said. Total household debt as of the end of 2024 hit an all-time of\u00a0$18 trillion, while the percentage of Americans falling seriously behind on their debts also rose last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "\"Quarterly filings from the U.S. courts will come out soon, and I'd expect to see a quarter-over-quarter increase in personal bankruptcy filings from the end of 2024 to the beginning of 2025,\" Pamela Foohey, a bankruptcy professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am not surprised attorneys say they're hearing from people who are looking to file for bankruptcy now because it's April. This is when people get their tax returns, so they have money to file for bankruptcy with,\" she added, noting that it costs money to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the most common type of personal filing. \"If they are getting their tax return, that's the time to file because they have an infusion of money.\"",
      "Economists warn that the Trump administration's economic policies, including heavy tariffs on China and other key trading partners, is likely to stoke inflation while dampening economic growth. Still, the flood of people weighing bankruptcy now reflects the steady rise in financial stress in recent years rather than current economic conditions, Foohey emphasized.",
      "\"Rising [bankruptcy] filings will show that people have been struggling with their finances for years when they do file, and things have been getting incrementally worse month after month now for years,\" she said. \"It's been building, and it's only going to get worse unless something is done about inflation, unless something is done about tariffs.\"",
      "When should you file for bankruptcy?",
      "As Foohey notes, bankruptcy typically comes after a prolonged period of financial stress. Although some Americans struggle to overcome the stigma of bankruptcy, experts recommend filing for protection sooner rather than later in order to shield their assets from creditors.",
      "Filing for bankruptcy can help an individual liquidate their assets to pay off their debt or create a repayment plan. Individuals may file for file\u00a0Chapter 7\u00a0or\u00a0Chapter 13\u00a0bankruptcy, and all bankruptcy cases are handled in federal courts.",
      "But bankruptcy expert Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign College of Law, said declaring bankruptcy accomplishes one thing: wiping out people's debt.",
      "\"It doesn't get you a job, it doesn't get you a raise, it doesn't put money on the table,\" he said. \"Filing for bankruptcy protection doesn't make sense when things are still on the way down. It makes sense to file when you're in the hole, but starting to climb out of it.\"",

      "Data shows the IRS' Direct File free tax-filing tool has helped save taxpayers money. Now lawmakers want to know why the Trump administration may soon pull the plug on the program.",
      "The Trump administration is planning on ending Direct File, the Associated Press reported earlier this month, citing people familiar with the plan. The program, launched during Joe Biden's presidency, has been credited by some users with making it easier and cheaper to file their taxes, saving the average user $160 in tax preparation fees and hours of their time, according to the Economic Security Project, an advocacy group focused on enhancing financial fairness and security for Americans.",
      "But the IRS has also faced blowback to Direct File from private tax prep companies that have made billions from charging people to use their software.",
      "\"Direct File is and has been a solution in search of a problem, a drain on critical IRS resources and a waste of taxpayer dollars,\" Derrick Plummer, a spokesman for the commercial tax preparation company Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, told the AP.",
      "DirectFile was used by about 141,000 taxpayers in 12 states when it debuted in 2024, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). Although it was expanded to 25 states in 2025, the IRS hasn't yet released data on how many people used it during the tax season that ended on April 15.",
      "$100 billion on tax prep",
      "Americans spend more than $100 billion each year to prepare and file their returns, according to the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. Direct File was developed as a method to help taxpayers avoid paying tax-prep and filing fees.",
      "However, Republican lawmakers and commercial tax preparation companies \u2014 including Intuit, the owner of TurboTax, H&R Block \u2014 have complained the Direct File program is a waste of taxpayer money because free filing programs already exist. One such service is Free File, a partnership between the IRS and tax-prep companies.",
      "On Monday, more than 170 Democratic and independent lawmakers sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and IRS acting commissioner Michael Faulkender asking them to commit to keeping Direct File open and operating. No Republican lawmakers signed the letter.",
      "\"Ending this free, easy-to-use and popular program would be an insult to American taxpayers, eliminating an important alternative to commercial options provided by the tax prep industry,\" the Democratic lawmakers, led by by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, wrote in the April 21 letter.",
      "Under the Trump administration, the IRS is undergoing a cost-cutting overhaul, with plans to eliminate up to 40% of its roughly 100,000-person workforce after the end of tax filing season, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News. The agency is also expected to shed more than 20,000 IRS employees through its Deferred Resignation Program offer.",
      "Those changes are part of the Trump administration's efforts, overseen by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut federal spending.",
      "\"No decisions on the future of Direct File have been made as of yet,\" a Treasury spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It is a failed program at a cost of tens of millions of taxpayer dollars per year.\"",
      "Pushback against Direct File",
      "Direct File has drawn pushback from some Republican lawmakers, with more than 20 GOP representatives asking President Trump to \"immediately end the IRS' unlawful Direct File pilot program upon taking office in January,\" according to a Dec. 10 statement from Rep. Adrian Smith, a Republican from Nebraska.",
      "\"The program's creation and ongoing expansion pose a threat to taxpayers' freedom from government overreach, and its shaky rollout and structural flaws have already come at a steep price,\" the Republican lawmakers said in their\u00a0letter.",
      "The IRS spent about $13 million on the Direct File pilot in 2024, according a December\u00a0report from the GAO. That funding came from money the tax agency received from the Inflation Reduction Act, which Mr. Biden signed into law in 2022.",
      "While consumer advocacy groups and some tax experts have praised Direct File for creating a free pathway for some taxpayers to file their returns, the service hasn't earned universal praise.",
      "Direct File was \"problematic\" from the start, David Williams, president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, which describes itself as a nonpartisan organization that disseminates research and analysis on the government's effects on the economy, told the AP.",
      "Pointing to the program's costs, Williams noted that many people who start the free-filing process never finish. According to the IRS, while 423,450 taxpayers logged into Direct File in 2024, only 140,803 of them submitted accepted returns.",
      "Despite those criticisms, taxpayers who have used Direct File give the program high marks. About 96% of taxpayers who used the 2024 pilot program said they were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with the service, a Code for America survey found.",

The international financial agency said trade was stable in 2024 and was expected to remain that way, but that the landscape changed in light of America's tariff war with trade partners.",
      "\"This on its own is a major negative shock to growth,\" an executive summary of the monetary fund's report said.",
      "Tariffs have already thrown sand in the gears of U.S. small businessess, the American auto industry, and other sectors that import their supplies from abroad.",
      "The trade war also led to a weaker forecast for China, one of America's top trading partners. The IMF projects the country's economy will expand 4% this year, down roughly half a point from its previous forecast. President Trump's\u00a0tariffs on China now total 145%. China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods total 125%.",
      "The IMF's forecasts were finalized April 4, just after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs. The international agency warned that further escalation of the trade war could stymie both near- and long-term growth.

      "\"These actions have stark real-life consequences for patients, students, faculty, staff, researchers and the standing of American higher education in the world,\" Garber wrote.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration violated Harvard's constitutional rights by halting federal funding, claiming that the withholding of funds is \"part of its pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to the Government's control over its academic programs.\"",
      "\"Defendants' actions threaten Harvard's academic independence and place at risk critical lifesaving and pathbreaking research that occurs on its campus. And they are part of a broader effort by the Government to punish Harvard for protecting its constitutional rights,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, the Trump administration said, \"The gravy train of federal assistance to institutions like Harvard, which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families, is coming to an end. Taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege.\"",
      "Research at Harvard has helped develop drugs that treat Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, led to the development of nanofibers that protect first responders and service members, and contributed to innovation in cancer-detecting artificial intelligence technology, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Harvard isn't the only university facing pressure from the Trump administration, which has said it is taking action against some schools to ensure they combat anti-semitism on campuses.",
      "The administration threatened last month to cancel $400 million in grants and contracts to Columbia University, citing \"the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\" Cornell and Northwestern are also facing funding freezes totaling a combined $1.8 billion.",
      "Yet the battle between Harvard and the Trump administration has become far more public and heated than those at other universities. Aside from the funding stoppage, the Trump administration also threatened to block the Massachusetts university from enrolling international students.",
      "The White House also called for broad leadership reforms at the university and changes to admissions policies.",
      "Harvard leaders frame the Trump administration's demands as a threat not only to the Ivy League school but also to the autonomy that the Supreme Court has long granted American universities. For the White House, Harvard presents a major hurdle in its effort to force change at universities that Republicans claim have become hotbeds of liberalism and antisemitism.",
      "In its suit, Harvard alleges the Trump administration also \"failed to engage in the statutorily mandated process Congress required under Title VI before funds are cut off, which provides independent grounds for declaring the freeze unlawful.\"",
      "Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin from programs that receive federal funding.",
      "Harvard's complaint against the Trump administration also claims the halt in federal funding will impede critical scientific and medical research as well as diminish economic innovation.",
      "\"The consequences of the government's overreach will be severe and long-lasting,\" Garber wrote. \"Research that the government has put in jeopardy includes efforts to improve the prospects of children who survive cancer, to understand at the molecular level how cancer spreads throughout the body, to predict the spread of infectious disease outbreaks, and to ease the pain of soldiers wounded on the battlefield.\"",

It also claims that Walgreens pressured its workers to fill the prescriptions quickly without regard for proper legal protocols.",
      "\"These practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores,\" said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the DOJ's Civil Division in a January\u00a0statement.",
      "Included in those prescriptions, the government says, were \"excessive quantities of opioids\" and prescriptions for \"trinity\" which is a triple-drug combination of opioids, benzodiazepines and muscle relaxants.",
      "The Justice Department filed its original lawsuit against the national drugstore chain on Jan. 16, claiming that Walgreens dispensed unlawful prescriptions and then sought reimbursement for the drugs from Medicare and other federal health care programs. In doing so, the agency said Walgreens violated the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)\u2014 which regulates the distribution of regulated substances \u2014 and the False Claims Act (FCA).",
      "Walgreens has over 8,000 pharmacies across the United States.",
      "\"We strongly disagree with the government's legal theory and admit no liability,\" a spokesperson for Walgreens told CBS MoneyWatch in an email Monday. \"Our pharmacists are dedicated health care professionals who care deeply about patient safety and continue to play a critical role in providing education and resources to help combat opioid misuse and abuse across our country.\"",

      "Stocks also\u00a0took a hit last Wednesday after Fed chief Powell warned that tariffs could drive up U.S. inflation and stymie growth.",
      "President Trump and his team have floated the idea of firing Powell, who Mr. Trump tapped to lead the central bank during his first term in 2017. Although many legal experts \u2014 and Powell himself \u2014 say the president lacks authority to fire a Fed chief, Mr. Trump's fierce criticism has fueled investor concerns that the White House could defy norms and seek to replace the central bank chief.",
      "Referring to Powell, Mr. Trump said on Truth Social on Monday that the economy could slow down \"unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has put increasing pressure on Powell to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rate, which would spur economic growth but also risk boosting inflation.",
      "\"The problem is that Powell's term still has more than a year to go while Trump's tariffs haven't even shown up in the data, which means the battle between the Fed and White House could get a lot worse in the coming months,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "A landmark Supreme Court Ruling from 1935 upholds the independent authority of the Fed and would make it difficult to fire Powell before his term concludes on May 15, 2026. But that hasn't stopped Mr. Trump from taking aim at Powell, who has stood firm against cutting interest rates until the Fed has more economic data on how tariffs will affect the economy.",

      "The latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell\u00a0is an option.",
      "Interest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "The Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.",
      "The White House declined further comment.",
      "Here's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "Board members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.",
      "\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court\u00a0ruled\u00a0in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "But Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.",
      "While lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.",
      "Who appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?",
      "Powell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.",
      "What is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.",
      "The Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.",
      "\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.",
      "He added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"",
      "Inflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis \u2014 a sign that inflation continues to percolate.",
      "What has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?",
      "Powell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the\u00a0impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Still, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.",
      "What do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?",
      "Wall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.",
      "The market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.",
      "\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes \u2014 publicly or politically \u2014 sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"",
      "The Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.",
      "What has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he\u00a0wouldn't step down\u00a0if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "Some lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"",
      "\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.",

      "The so-called remedy hearing is the consequence of a court ruling last August that found Google is operating a monopoly and uses its dominant market position to crush rivals and put a lid on innovation.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is arguing that Google should be forced to divest its Chrome browser, which the agency describes as \"one of the largest entry points that exists for searches.\" By selling Chrome, rivals could have a chance to compete for search queries, the government argues, but such a change would drastically reshape Google's parent, Alphabet, a tech giant with a $1.8 trillion market valuation.",
      "\"Google can compete, but they simply don't want to compete on a level playing field,\" Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist said on Monday during his opening before the court. \"Google is now fearful of competing against rivals who will only get stronger with the proposed remedies in place.\"",
      "The hearing comes just days after Google was branded an abusive monopolist in a separate case that ruled the tech giant had illegally exploited some of its online marketing technology to boost profits. The more recent case focused on Google's online advertising business, which has been built around its search engine and other widely used products, including Chrome and YouTube.",
      "Here's what to know about the current remedy hearing.",

      "Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",
      "Some of the changes sought by the DOJ would last for years, with Sheridan noting that the requirements would \"include Google enabling ongoing access to its search index, making available user and ads search data (for up to 10 years), syndicating its search text ads data for up to 1 year and syndicating its search results, ranking signals & query understanding information (for queries originated in the U.S.) for up to 10 years.\"",
      "What would happen to Chrome?",
      "Jon Sallet, representing a group of states that joined the Justice Department in the case, said in his opening statements that his first priority is the divestiture of Chrome.",
      "Chrome is a \"massively attractive asset\" with over 4.1 billion global users, he added. \"This kind of asset doesn't come up very often.\"",
      "Divestitures can happen in a number of ways, such as a spinoff or sale of a business unit. In some cases, the existing shareholders of a company \u2014 in this case, Google parent Alphabet \u2014 receive new shares in the divested business.",
      "AT&T may be one of the best-known companies to have been broken apart after being accused of operating a monopoly. The phone giant split into several smaller companies as part of a 1982 settlement with the U.S. government, leading to the creation of several smaller regional phone operators, such as Bell South and Bell Atlantic.",
      "Splitting off Chrome would likely deliver a financial hit to Google's revenue, Goldman's Sheridan added. It would not only limit Google Search revenue, but would also restrict search query volume and access to user data, he noted.",
      "What is Google's response to the DOJ?",
      "Google attacked the government's proposed antitrust remedies, with its lead attorney, John Schmidtlein, calling them \"fundamentally flawed\" and arguing that they would unfairly penalize the company for its innovation.",
      "\"Google earned its market position through hard work and ingenuity,\" Schmidtlein said.",
      "A divestiture of Chrome would be \"far from simple,\" he said, noting that the remedy would go beyond the browser to include the open-source Chromium project Google created and has supported for years.",
      "\"The decree demands not only Chrome but also everything critical to Chromium's functionality,\" Schmidtlein said. \"What does that even mean? They're leaving it up to a technical committee, but there's no clarity on what constitutes necessary assets.\"",

It takes big financial institutions to court who cheat consumers, whether it's a credit reporting agency, or a large bank or a credit card giant,\" Rohit Chopra, who was\u00a0fired by President Trump as director of CFPB earlier this month, said in an interview\u00a0aired\u00a0on NPR on Monday. \"The CFPB has been recovering billions of dollars for consumers who were wronged.\"",
      "In the weeks leading up to Chopra's departure, the CFPB targeted a number of large institutions in a flurry of legal actions. That included suing Capital One for\u00a0allegedly misleading people\u00a0about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts and accusing Experian of\u00a0improperly investigating consumer complaints of errors in credit reports.

      "Still, while long an advocate of pulling the plug on the agency's operations, Michel was unclear on the White House's tactics.",

      "The U.S. is India's largest trading partner and the two countries are now holding negotiations aimed at sealing a bilateral trade agreement this year.",
      "Shortly after his arrival in New Delhi, word came that Pope Francis had died. Vance had met with Francis in Rome on Easter Sunday.",
      "Vance posted his condolences on X, saying,\"My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him.   I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill. But I'll always remember him for the below homily he gave in the very early days of COVID. It was really quite beautiful.    May God rest his soul.\"",
      "Modi, whose country has nearly 30 million Christians who make up 2.3% of the population, says Francis will always be remembered \"as a beacon of compassion, humility and spiritual courage by millions across the world.",
      "\"From a young age, he devoted himself towards realizing the ideals of Lord Christ. He diligently served the poor and downtrodden. For those who were suffering, he ignited a spirit of hope,\" Modi said.",
      "The Indian leader posted a photo of himself with the pope and said he was \"greatly inspired by his commitment to inclusive and all-round development.\"",
      "The U.S. and India have set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. If achieved, the trade deal could significantly enhance economic ties between the two countries and potentially strengthen diplomatic ties as well.",
      "Vance's first visit to New Delhi comes amid the backdrop of Mr. Trump's now-paused tariff program against most countries, including India. It also coincides with a rapidly intensifying trade war between Washington and Beijing, which is New Delhi's main rival in the region.",

      "Modi established a good working relationship with Mr. Trump during his first term in office and the two leaders are likely to further boost cooperation between their countries.",
      "He was among the first leaders to visit the U.S. and hold talks with Mr. Trump after he returned to the White House. During his visit, Modi hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the U.S., and kickstarted a negotiation process to minimize the possible fallout of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The two leaders also said they planned to grow their defense partnership, with India signaling compliance with the Trump administration's demands, saying it will purchase more oil, energy and defense equipment from the U.S.",

      "Mr. Trump's scrutiny of Harvard's tax status comes after the university on Monday rejected his administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration this week moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard.",
      "The Trump administration has also threatened to cut off federal funding at other\u00a0top universities\u00a0as it exerts pressure on the institutions' policies governing student expression on campus and academic programs.",
      "But stripping an organization of its tax-exempt status is an unusual step, especially for an institution the size and reputation of Harvard, experts said.",
      "\"It would be historically unprecedented,\" Brian Galle, professor of tax policy at Georgetown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Certainly no major research university has ever lost its tax exemption.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the issue.",
      "Why is Harvard tax exempt?",
      "Organizations that have a purpose deemed to be \"charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition and the prevention of cruelty to children or animals\" can qualify for tax-exempt status, according to the IRS.",
      "Most private and public universities and colleges have been granted tax-exempt status by the IRS because of their educational mission, which the federal government has recognized for their importance in fostering the productivity and civic contributions of American citizens, the Association of American Universities says.",
      "Can Mr. Trump order the IRS to remove Harvard's tax-exempt status?",
      "Not legally, according to Sam Brunson, a professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and an expert on federal income tax and nonprofit organizations.",
      "That's because Congress in 1998 passed a law that forbids the president from directing the IRS to audit or investigate taxpayers, he explained. If Mr. Trump instructed the IRS to remove Harvard's tax exemption, \"that runs exactly contrary to law,\" Brunson said.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said, \"Any forthcoming actions by the IRS will be conducted independently of the President, and investigations into any institution's violations of its tax status were initiated prior\" to Mr. Trump's social media post this week questioning Harvard's tax-exempt status.",
      "The IRS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Could the IRS remove Harvard's tax exemption?",
      "The IRS has legal authority to strip organizations of their tax-exempt status, and it occasionally exercises that power. But that is usually due to groups failing to meet tax requirements, like neglecting to file an annual information return for more than three consecutive years.",
      "One famous case involved a university losing its tax-exempt status, Galle and Brunson noted. In the 1970s, Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, a Christian institution, lost its tax-exempt status due to a policy that banned interracial relationships.",
      "That case ended up at the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1983 that the IRS was correct in depriving Bob Jones of the status because its rules had violated a \"fundamental national public policy\" about racial discrimination in education.",
      "The IRS could argue that Harvard is in violation of public policy either by failing to crack down on protestors rallying against Israel's actions in Gaza or by refusing to comply with the Trump administration's push against diversity, equity and inclusion policies, Brunson said. But both he and Galle expressed skepticism that such rationales would hold up in court, partly because universities have a constitutional right to freedom of speech, while also representing issues that are far different from the practices that Bob Jones engaged in.",
      "\"There isn't a society-wide agreement that allowing protests on your campus is inconsistent with fundamental public policy,\" Galle said.",
      "He added, \"Let's be clear: There is absolutely no basis for Harvard to lose its exemption. Zero.\"",
      "What happens if the IRS strips Harvard of its tax-exempt status?",
      "The IRS would first do an investigation and then inform Harvard of its reason for removing its tax-exempt status, Brunson said. Harvard could then file an appeal to the IRS. If that appeal failed, the university could then take the issue to the courts.",
      "As the case proceeded, it's likely that a court would issue an injunction or order to halt the IRS' decision, which means that Harvard would likely continue to operate as a tax-exempt institution until the case was resolved, experts said.",
      "\"Harvard isn't going to lose this \u2014 they have the money and the resources and the alumni to get the best people representing them,\" Brunson said. He predicted that Harvard would win a court case and \"set a precedent.\"",
      "How could losing tax-exempt status affect Harvard?",
      "Harvard could take a financial hit if it were to lose the tax-exempt status. But the extent of any resulting damage would be unclear given that Harvard could use tax strategies to lower its taxable income, similar to how major corporations rely on sophisticated techniques to reduce their tax liability. For instance, Harvard could lower its taxable income by deducting business costs, including its faculty salaries.",
      "By contrast, donors to Harvard could feel the impact because they wouldn't be able to deduct their contributions to the university from their own taxes. That could make it less palatable for donors to make large financial contributions.",
      "\"The biggest cost would be reduced donations,\" Brunson said. \"And the other cost is its endowment, which would no longer be tax exempt.\"",
      "Harvard's endowment stands at $52.3 billion, making it the biggest among all U.S. universities.",
      "What does Harvard say about the risk to its tax-exempt status?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Harvard reiterated that such a decision would be illegal.",
      "\"The government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission,\" a spokesperson wrote in an email. \"The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth.\"",
      "The spokesperson added, \"There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status.\"",

    "story": [
      "The federal food stamp program is facing scrutiny in some states that want to block enrollees from using their government benefits to buy soda and candy.",
      "Three Republican-led states \u2014 Arkansas, Idaho and Indiana \u2014 on Tuesday moved to ban purchases of soda and candy with benefits provided by the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Those states have a combined total of roughly 1 million residents on SNAP out of the program's total 41.7 million U.S. participants.",
      "Other states are also likely to restrict SNAP recipients' food purchases, experts say. Lawmakers in states including Arizona, Kansas and Tennessee\u00a0have introduced similar measures to curtail food stamp purchases of sugary foods and drinks.",
      "The rationale for such legislation is the view that blocking low-income Americans from using food stamps on soda and candy will help improve their health. But anti-hunger advocates say that these restrictions will add to negative perceptions of receiving food aid, while also being unlikely to improve recipients' eating habits.",
      "\"It's stigmatizing to say, 'You who are low income, we don't trust you to make the right choices,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, the SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger research group.",
      "Instead, she said, these states would be better off focusing on the biggest obstacle to healthy eating: the high cost of groceries, particularly the expense of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Because SNAP provides an average individual monthly benefit of $187, or a little over $6 per day, many recipients fill up by purchasing the cheapest, most calorie-dense foods they can afford, she added.",
      "Grocery costs soared during the pandemic, surging almost 24% from 2020 to 2024 and outpacing overall inflation by almost three percentage points, according to an analysis from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Food prices aren't expected to drop anytime soon, with the USDA forecasting that groceries could rise 2.7% in 2025, adding to the challenges SNAP recipients face in affording healthy food.",
      "Make America healthy again?",
      "In announcing plans to block food stamp purchases of soda and candy, Idaho Governor Brad Little on Tuesday\u00a0proclaimed that the state \"welcomes the MAHA movement,\" referring to the \"make America healthy again\" movement started by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders credited the Trump administration with placing \"a laser focus on solving America's chronic disease epidemic,\" saying that banning candy and soda from food stamp purchases is \"a great place to start.\"",
      "About 80 cents of every $1 in SNAP benefits is used to purchase staples like meat, bread, milk, cereal and rice, with the remainder going to salty snacks, candy and sweetened beverages. Households that rely on food stamps have very similar patterns of spending to households not on food stamps, according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "The Arkansas plan, which would take effect in July 2026, would exclude soda, including no- and low-calorie soda; fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice; \"unhealthy drinks;\" candy, including confections made with flour, like Kit Kat bars; and artificially sweetened candy.",
      "It also would allow participants to use benefits to buy hot rotisserie chicken, which is excluded from the program now under the SNAP program's longstanding ban on hot foods. Food stamp recipients also would be barred from using their benefits to buy nonfood items, such as soap or toothpaste, as well as alcohol or tobacco.",
      "Some industries are pushing back against the SNAP restrictions. Representatives for American Beverage accused state and federal officials of \"choosing to be the food police rather than take truly meaningful steps to lift people off SNAP with good-paying jobs.\"",
      "The National Confectioners Association called the approach \"misguided.\"",
      "\"SNAP participants and non-SNAP participants alike understand that chocolate and candy are treats \u2014 not meal replacements,\" spokesman Chris Gindlesperger said.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health\"",
      "Over the past two decades, lawmakers from both political parties have proposed halting SNAP payments for everything from soda to\u00a0 steak. To date, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the SNAP program, hasn't granted the required waivers for states to curb food stamp purchases.",
      "But the Trump administration is signaling that it will grant the waivers requested this week, with USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins saying in a Tuesday statement\u00a0that she plans to quickly approve Arkansas' request.",
      "\"I have said since my confirmation that USDA has a role to play in improving nutrition programs to better serve individuals in need of support, all while recognizing the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Rollins said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our shared goal should be to lift millions of Americans out of dependency and into hopeful futures and insert new energy and ideas into long-ignored programs like diet-related, chronic disease.\"",
      "Blocking SNAP purchases of candy and soda wouldn't keep recipients from using their own money to buy such items, as food stamp benefits typically pay for roughly\u00a0two-thirds of a household's grocery costs.",
      "But advocates of banning unhealthy foods from SNAP say that taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for supporting bad eating habits.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health,\" Sanders said Tuesday at a news conference with Rollins in Little Rock, Arkansas. \"We're paying for it on the front end and the back end.\"",

    "story": [
      "As ongoing inflation continues to deplete household budgets, perhaps nowhere is the pinch felt more strongly\u00a0than in grocery aisles. However, depending on where you live, the pain can be sharper than in other areas.",
      "That's according to a new study from\u00a0SmartAsset\u00a0which reveals notable fluctuations in grocery price increases from city to city. The financial technology company used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to examine how the costs of everyday items like eggs, meat and produce have changed in 12 major metro areas over the last year.",
      "\"While prices of fruits, vegetables and dairy products either increased or decreased depending on the location, eggs, meat and poultry soared almost unanimously, reaching over 9% or higher than just a year before \u2014 tripling the general rate of inflation,\" the study found.",
      "Jaclyn DeJohn, director of economic analysis and author of the SmartAsset study, said the big takeaway is how much location can impact these day-to-day items.",
      "\"We really wanted to do was compare where people's budget is going to get hit the hardest,\" said DeJohn, who noted that the study in not a comprehensive ranking but a snapshot of location-related shifts in the cost of groceries. \"People are noticing these costs, and they're impacting their bottom line.\"",
      "Read on to see how grocery prices\u00a0fluctuated in 12 major U.S. metros.",
      "Which cities are seeing price increases?",
      "Out of the 12 cities included in SmartAsset's analysis, Honolulu, Hawaii, experienced the largest uptick with a 5.3% increase in overall grocery prices since last year. Price hikes in Tampa Bay, Florida, are the second highest at 4.3%, followed by the Twin Cities, Minnesota, at 4.2%.",
      "When it comes to fresh produce, the Twin Cities saw the biggest spike among the 12 metro areas, with the cost of fruits and vegetables rising 6.9% from 2024. In Los Angeles, egg, meat, poultry and fish prices rose the most, at 9.8%, followed by the D.C. metro area at 9.4%.",
      "By contrast, residents of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington experienced only a modest price hike of 2.1% on eggs, meat, poultry and fish.",
      "While the report doesn't specify the factors driving price changes from city to city, a combination of influences could be at play, said SmartAsset's DeJohn. \"A big factor for something like Honolulu is it's isolated from the rest of the U.S.,\" she said. \"So, that's a good illustration of how transportation costs where you're located geographically compared to where your food is sourced can impact the prices big time.\"",
      "While price fluctuations varied from city to city, prices for egg, meats, poultry and fish went up in all metro areas, which DeJohn says were behind overall grocery cost increases across all 12 metro areas. \"As we didn't see such intense price increases across any other category of grocery, it was the egg and meat prices that were really driving the increase in grocery prices across the board in these metros,\" she said.",
      "The rise in egg prices at the metro level tracks with national BLS data. Egg prices have been climbing in large part due to the bird flu outbreak which has\u00a0forced farmers to kill infected flocks to prevent the disease from spreading.",
      "Are any cities seeing lower grocery prices?",
      "Yes. Two metro areas in SmartAsset's study \u2014 Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and Boston \u2014 saw a decrease in grocery prices of 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively, from a year ago.",
      "Where are grocery prices headed?",
      "A recent analysis by the Yale Budget Lab estimates that overall food prices will rise by 2.6% in the next three years, as a result of U.S. tariffs as well as reciprocal tariffs from foreign nations in place as of April 15. Fresh produce is estimated to rise 5.4%, according to the think tank, before stabilizing at 3.6% higher.",
      "The USDA's\u00a0food price outlook, based on Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index data from this year and last, forecasts a slightly larger rise in overall food prices of 3.2%, with grocery store or supermarket food purchases, or food-at-home, increasing 2.7%.",
      "Prices for dairy products and fresh vegetables will remain mostly unchanged, according to the USDA, but unfortunately for consumers, the cost of egg prices is expected to climb. Egg prices, which have\u00a0soared over the past year, are expected to rise 57.6% in 2025, according to the report.",

      "European leaders are hoping Italy's right-wing premier\u00a0can position herself as a bridge between the Trump administration and the European Union, which Mr. Trump and his top aides have bashed as a deadbeat, if not abusive partner on defense and trade.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday that \"of course\" there will be a trade deal with the EU, amid the 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Asked if the EU is on his priority list of nations for reaching trade deals, Mr. Trump said, \"Everybody's on my priority list.\"",
      "The president said he and Meloni discussed trade and \"many, many things\" in their first meeting of the day. But it's unclear how much progress Mr. Trump and Meloni made in discussing any sort of trade deal.",
      "The hope not only in Rome, but in EU capitals across the 27-nation bloc is likely that Meloni can persuade Mr. Trump not to impose the steep tariff hikes he's threatened, which could devastate European economies. A reporter asked Meloni if she believes the U.S. is a reliable partner.",

      "Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen discussed strategies on how to approach her meeting with Mr. Trump during multiple phone calls ahead of the trip, according to a commission spokesperson.",
      "Von der Leyen herself has not yet been granted a meeting with Mr. Trump, despite repeated requests. Meloni's sit-down at the White House will be the first with any European leader since the administration announced its tariffs on virtually every nation with which the U.S. conducts trade at the beginning of April. The EU was hit with a blanket 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S. with that announcement, though Mr. Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days about a week later, as global stock markets reeled, leaving a 10% universal rate in place.",
      "Meloni has gently chided the sweeping tariffs on the EU as \"wrong,\" but she's been one of the voices urging the continental bloc not to impose retaliatory measures, insisting that a calm response focused on negotiations would bring a more constructive resolution.",
      "The White House claims dozens of counties have come forward seeking to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S., with Mr. Trump boasting that leaders were calling him and \"kissing my ass,\" begging to strike deals to avoid the reimposition of the higher levies.",
      "\"We know we're going through a difficult period, let's see how it goes in the coming hours. I am feeling no pressure, as you can imagine, for my next two days,\" Meloni said with a note of clear irony at an awards ceremony two days before her White House meeting. \"I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.\"",
      "Not all European politicians were so sanguine about the potential outcome of the Trump-Meloni meeting, however.\u00a0 Italian opposition politician Carlo Calenda said, \"the most important thing is that Meloni does not allow herself to be used by Trump to split the European front.\"",
      "In other European capitals, there was clear anxiety over the possibility that the White House could use the meeting to try to undermine EU unity.",
      "\"If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,\" the French government's Minister for Industry and Energy, Marc Ferracci, said last week, adding: \"Europe is only strong if it is united.\"",

    "summary": "The ruling involving Google's online ad technology follows a similar case last year in which Google's search engine was declared a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Google has been branded an abusive monopolist by a federal judge for the second time in less than a year, this time for illegally exploiting some of its online marketing technology to boost the profits fueling an internet empire currently worth $1.8 trillion.",
      "The ruling issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia comes on the heels of a separate decision in August that concluded Google's namesake search engine has been illegally leveraging its dominance to stifle competition and innovation.",
      "After the U.S. Justice Department targeted Google's ubiquitous search engine during President Donald Trump's first administration, the same agency went after the company's lucrative digital advertising network in 2023 during President Joe Biden's ensuing administration in an attempt to undercut the power that Google has amassed since its inception in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Although antitrust regulators prevailed both times, the battle is likely to continue for several more years as Google tries to overturn the two monopoly decisions in appeals while forging ahead in the new and highly lucrative technological frontier of artificial intelligence.",
      "The next step in the latest case is a penalty phase that will likely begin late this year or early next year. The same so-called remedy hearings in the search monopoly case are scheduled to begin Monday in Washington D.C., where Justice Department lawyers will try to convince U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to impose a sweeping punishment that includes a proposed requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Brinkema's 115-page decision centers on the marketing machine that Google has spent the past 17 years building around its search engine and other widely used products and services, including its Chrome browser, YouTube video site and digital maps.",
      "The system was largely built around a series of acquisitions that started with Google's $3.2 billion purchase of online ad specialist DoubleClick in 2008. U.S. regulators approved the deals at the time they were made before realizing that they had given the Mountain View, California, company a platform to manipulate the prices in an ecosystem that a wide range of websites depend on for revenue and provides a vital marketing connection to consumers.",
      "The Justice Department lawyers argued that Google built and maintained dominant market positions in a technology trifecta used by website publishers to sell ad space on their webpages, as well as the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of consumers, and the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions in fractions of a second to match buyer and seller.",
      "After evaluating the evidence presented during a lengthy trial that\u00a0concluded just before Thanksgiving last year,\u00a0Brinkema reached a decision that rejected the Justice Department's assertions that Google has been mistreating advertisers while concluding the company has been abusing its power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers forced to rely on its network for revenue.",
      "\"For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.\" Brinkema wrote. \"Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anticompetitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features.\"",
      "Despite that rebuke, Brinkema also concluded that Google didn't break the law when it snapped Doubleclick nor when it followed up that deal a few years later by buying another service, Admeld.",
      "The Justice Department \"failed to show that the DoubleClick and Admeld acquisitions were anticompetitive,\" Brinkema wrote. \"Although these acquisitions helped Google gain monopoly power in two adjacent ad tech markets, they are insufficient, when viewed in isolation, to prove that Google acquired or maintained this monopoly power through exclusionary practices.\"",
      "That finding may help Google fight off any attempt to force it to sell its advertising technology to stop its monopolistic behavior.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"We disagree with the Court's decision regarding our publisher tools,\" said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \"Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\"",
      "Analysts such as Brian Pitz of BMO Markets had been predicting that Google would likely lose the case, helping to brace investors for the latest setback to the company and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., whose shares declined 1% in afternoon trading. Alphabet's stock has plunged by 20% so far this year.",
      "As it did in the search monopoly case, Google and its corporate parent Alphabet vehemently denied the Justice Department's allegations. Their lawyers argued the government largely based its case on an antiquated concept of a market that existed a decade ago while underestimating a highly competitive market for advertising spending that includes the likes of Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Comcast.",
      "The market as drawn in the Justice Department's case didn't include ads that appear on mobile apps, streaming television services, or other platforms to which internet users have increasingly migrated, prompting Google lawyer Karen Dunn to compare the government's definition a \"time capsule with a BlackBerry, an iPod and a Blockbuster video card\" during her opening statement\u00a0when the trial began last September.",
      "At trial, the Justice Department's lawyers emphasized the harm to news publishers that has arisen from Google's alleged dominance of the marketplace. Witnesses from Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and other newspapers, and News Corp., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, testified about the difficulties they have faced and what they said was a lack of alternatives to Google's ad tech. Those companies rely on online advertising to fund their news operations and make their articles free to consumers on the internet, government lawyers have argued.",
      "Now, government is in position to try to dismantle that byzantine ad system. When the case was filed more than two years ago during the Biden administration, the Justice Department asserted Google should be forced to sell, at a minimum, its Ad Manager product, which includes the technology used by website publishers and the ad exchange.",

      "Shein and Temu, two popular Chinese e-commerce sites known for their low-cost items, say they will raise prices for U.S. consumers starting next week, a move that comes amid President Trump's 145% tariff on imports from China and the end of a trade loophole.",
      "The sites are popular with U.S. shoppers because of their low prices, with a focus on fast fashion. While they predominantly sell women's apparel and accessories, both also sell men's and children's clothing. Temu carries household items and small personal electronics.",
      "At Shein, women's blouses cost as little as $5, and bikinis can be found for around $10. Temu offers running sneakers for $14.",
      "Beginning April 25, though, the deals won't be as enticing for U.S. consumers. In a notice on its website, Shein told customers that \"price adjustments\" will go into effect late next week. Shein said \"recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\" have caused its own costs to rise, making the price hikes necessary.",
      "\"We're doing everything we can to keep prices low and minimize the impact on you. Our team is working hard to improve your shopping experience and stay true to our mission: making fashion accessible for everyone,\" Shein added, without indicating the size of the price hikes.",
      "Temu posted a nearly identical notice, saying that its operating expenses have risen, and that it will therefore introduce price hikes beginning next week. Until then, prices will remain unchanged, it added.",
      "The \"de minimis\" loophole",
      "The two e-commerce sites have benefitted from a tax law loophole known as the \"de minimis\" exemption, which has allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty free. Mr. Trump's recent action\u00a0to eliminate the loophole beginning May 2 throws a wrench in the companies' business models.",

      "The end of the \"de minimis\" loophole, as well as the Trump administration's tariffs of 145% on imports from China, have dented the business models of the two platforms.",
      "The changes come at a time when American shoppers have increasingly flocked to the low-cost retailers. The number of de minimis parcels shipped to the U.S. has surged to more than 1 billion in 2023, up from 153 million in 2015, with China accounting for the largest volume of shipments, according to a January Congressional Research Service report.

    "story": [
      "In less than a month, Americans and permanent residents will only be able to pass through airport security or enter a federal government building if they have a Real ID. Most states are not yet fully compliant, though they've had nearly 20 years to prepare for this deadline.",
      "A CBS News data analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that at least 17 states are less than 50% compliant with the law, which goes into effect May 7. The Transportation Security Administration currently plans to treat that date as an \"all hands on deck\" day because of the looming potential for disruptions at airport checkpoints. The chart below the article lists the states and their compliance so far with the Real ID requirement.",
      "The Real ID is an enhanced ID card issued by state drivers license agencies. To obtain one, people are required to show a valid ID, as well as proof of identity, such as a passport or certified birth certificate, proof of a Social Security number and date of birth, plus two documents showing state residency, including a utility bill, credit card statement or rental agreement.",
      "So far, 30 states are less than 70% compliant. That means that in more than half the country, as many as three in every 10 travelers may not be able to pass through an airport checkpoint in just a few weeks.",
      "As of last week, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation \u2014 just 17% of its state-issued IDs are Real IDs. Pennsylvania reported 26%, while Washington and Maine tell CBS News they are at 27% compliance. New York reports 43% compliance, and California has reached nearly 55% compliance.",
      "CBS News recently traveled to a Real ID Super Center in Chicago with a line extending out the door. In Illinois, two out of three residents lack a Real ID, which prompted the state to open the downtown location in an old Walgreens, aiming to process up to 1,500 new IDs a day as it tries to catch up with surging demand.\u00a0 States mail the new IDs, however, so it can take up to two weeks to receive the new credential (a temporary paper license will not be considered a Real ID).",
      "Twelve states and the District of Columbia reported compliance rates above 90%, with seven states \u2014 Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wyoming and the District of Columbia \u2014 saying they're virtually 100% compliant. Texas reports 98% compliance, Mississippi 97%, Hawaii 96%, Utah 96% and Vermont 92%.",
      "TSA says it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints \u2014 meaning passengers are showing up with either a Real ID-compliant driver's license or state ID, a passport, a valid military ID, an \"enhanced\" ID issued by a handful of states or other valid identification.",
      "Earlier this month, TSA told CBS News that on May 7, when travellers show up at a TSA checkpoint with a non-compliant legacy ID, they will be subject to additional screening. TSA officers will utilize a secondary identity verification process, similar to the one used when someone's ID is stolen or lost while traveling, to verify identity. But this can be a time-consuming process, so legacy ID holders should plan to be at the airport at least three hours before departure, instead of the usual two hours for a domestic flight. If the secondary identification verification fails, the traveler will not be allowed to enter the security checkpoint or the gate area. The agency had previously indicated there would be a phased enforcement policy.",
      "\"People will experience travel delays,\" TSA spokesperson Patricia Mancha told CBS News in a recent interview at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. \"People have had years to really plan for this, so TSA will simply enforce the laws and the rules as they apply.\"",
      "The Real ID law was passed in 2005, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, to try to make state-issued identification more secure and harder to counterfeit. The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, most recently because of the pandemic. Several fully compliant states began issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009, enabling all residents to obtain a compliant ID when they renewed an existing license.",
      "\"Any new issuance of driver's license, you had to prove your identity and lawful presence back in 2009,\" said Electra Bustle, the senior director of the Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles. She says the deadline delays helped the Centennial State to be ready for the May 7 deadline. \"We have a 10-year renewal cycle before you have to get a new photograph. You can see that moving it allowed us to ensure that we're at 100% of those who are eligible to be now \u2014 to have Real IDS.\"",
      "A Real ID can be identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner of the ID. Sometimes the star appears in a circle, while California puts its star symbol inside a golden bear.",
      "Not everyone needs a Real ID. If you don't fly or enter federal government buildings, a legacy ID will continue to be valid until its expiration date.",
      "States continue to process Real ID applications, so compliance numbers will continue to change, and CBS News will update these figures before the May 7 deadline.",

    "summary": "The autism study is planning to link confidential data \"with broad coverage in the U.S. population\" in one place for the first time.",
    "story": [
      "The National Institutes of Health is amassing private medical records from a number of federal and commercial databases to give to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new effort to study autism, the NIH's top official said Monday.",
      "The new data will allow external researchers picked for Kennedy's autism studies to study \"comprehensive\" patient data with \"broad coverage\" of the U.S. population for the first time, NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said.",
      "\"The idea of the platform is that the existing data resources are often fragmented and difficult to obtain. The NIH itself will often pay multiple times for the same data resource. Even data resources that are within the federal government are difficult to obtain,\" he said in a presentation to the agency's advisers.",
      "Medication records from pharmacy chains, lab testing and genomics data from patients treated by the Department of Veterans Affairs and Indian Health Service, claims from private insurers and data from smartwatches and fitness trackers will all be linked together, he said.",
      "The NIH is also now in talks with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to broaden agreements governing access to their data, Bhattacharya said.",
      "In addition, a new disease registry is being launched to track Americans with autism, which will be integrated into the data. Advocacy groups and experts have called out Kennedy for describing autism as a \"preventable disease,\" which they say is stigmatizing and unfounded.",
      "Between 10 and 20 outside groups of researchers will be given grant funding and access to the records to produce Kennedy's autism studies. Bhattacharya did not give details on how they would be chosen, but said their selection would be \"run through normal NIH processes.\"",
      "Bhattacharya said the research they will back using the data will be \"the highest quality proposals\" that will range \"from basic science to epidemiological approaches, to other more applied approaches\" to treat and manage autism. He also acknowledged autism's wide variation in how it affects people.",
      "\"I recognize, of course, that autism, there's a range of manifestations ranging from highly functioning children to children that are quite severely disabled. And of course the research will account very carefully for that,\" he said.",
      "While the selected researchers will be able to access and study the private medical data, Bhattacharya said they will not be able to download it. He promised \"state of the art protections\" to protect confidentiality.",
      "By bringing the data into one place, he said it could give health agencies a window into \"real-time health monitoring\" on Americans for studying other health problems too.",
      "\"What we're proposing is a transformative real-world data initiative, which aims to provide a robust and secure computational data platform for chronic disease and autism research,\" he said.",
      "They are planning a \"rapid timeline\" to launch the autism research using this data, he said, but did not give specifics on when it would start or how long the studies would take. Kennedy last week appeared to walk back his earlier prediction that they would have all the answers to autism's causes by September.",
      "Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, Bhattacharya pushed back the timeline, saying that they now hope to have grants going out the door by September for the research.",

    "summary": "A Maryland school board decided to end parental opt-outs for instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation, sparking the dispute that's before the Supreme Court.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A sharply divided Supreme Court appeared likely to require a Maryland school board provide parents with the ability to opt their elementary school-age children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "At issue in the court fight between a group of families and the Montgomery County Board of Education is whether public schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment right to exercise their religion freely when they require children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality that violate the families' religious beliefs.",
      "After more than two hours of arguments, the court's conservative majority seemed ready to side with the families.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who lives in Montgomery County, Maryland, invoked the state's founding and said the county in particular has been a \"beacon\" of religious liberty and tolerance. He told Alan Schoenfeld, who argued for the school board, he was \"surprised\" given that history that \"this is the hill we're going to die on in terms of not respecting religious liberty.\"",
      "\"What is the big deal about allowing them to opt-out of this?\" Justice Samuel Alito asked, noting that the county allows parents to request their children be excused from other areas of instruction, such as sexual education or Halloween or Valentine's Day celebrations. \"What is infeasible about doing that?\"",
      "Kavanaugh echoed Alito, saying, \"I'm not understanding why it's not feasible\" for schools to excuse children from instruction that violate their families' religious beliefs.",
      "Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia allow for parental opt-outs or require opt-ins before students participate in sex education. Montgomery County, home to Maryland's largest public school system with more than 160,000 students, also had an opt-out policy for parents with religious objections to classroom instruction or activities so long as the requests did not become \"too frequent or burdensome,\" according to court papers.",
      "After Maryland enacted rules seeking to promote \"educational equity,\" the Montgomery County Education Board introduced \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks for elementary school students into its English Language Arts curriculum. The district said it supplemented its language arts books with a handful of stories \"in order to better represent all Montgomery County families.\" Among the five books incorporated, which are at issue in the case, were \"Born Ready,\" about a transgender elementary-aged child, and \"Prince & Knight,\" about a prince who falls in with and marries a knight.",
      "Several of the justices acknowledged that they had read the picture books that were included in the curriculum, and Alito at one point even read from one, \"Uncle Bobby's Wedding,\" which discusses gay marriage.",
      "The board adopted the lessons in 2022, but allowed parents to opt their children out of reading and instruction involving the storybooks. But in March 2023, the Montgomery County school board announced that families would no longer receive advanced notice of when the books would be read and would not be able to have their kids excused from the instruction.",
      "The board said in court filings that the opt-outs had become \"unworkable,\" as some schools had high numbers of absences, and all faced \"substantial hurdles\" in using the books while honoring opt-out requests, as teachers would have to manage the removal of excused students from class and plan alternative activities for them.",
      "That decision, however, sparked backlash within the community \u2014 more than 1,000 parents signed a petition that called on the board to restore the notice and opt-outs, and dozens protested the books at board meetings as violating their religious beliefs. The school board then revised its Religious Diversity Guidelines to limit the circumstances when students can be excused to noncurricular activities or free-time events that conflict with their family's religious practices.",
      "A group of three families filed a lawsuit against the Montgomery County Board of Education, arguing that denial of the notice and opt-outs violated their right to exercise their religion freely under the First Amendment because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children. The families \u2014 who are Muslim, Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox\u00a0 \u2014 sought a preliminary injunction that would've required the school board to provide advance notice and the chance to opt their children out of instruction that involved the books.",
      "But a federal district judge in Maryland denied the request, finding that the no-opt-out policy did not burden the families' religious exercise. The parents' inability to excuse their children from instruction with the storybooks doesn't coerce them into violating their religious beliefs, the court found, as they can still teach their kids about their convictions regarding sexuality, marriage and gender.",
      "A divided panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit also found that there was no burden on the families' free exercise of religion because there was no evidence they were compelled to change their religious beliefs or conduct.",
      "The families asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, and the high court in January agreed to do so. The Trump administration is backing the parents in the case, arguing that the board burdened parents' religious exercise by forcing them to choose between violating their religious beliefs or forgoing public education.",
      "In filings\u00a0with the high court, lawyers for the parents also said that Montgomery County is presenting them with an \"impossible\" choice.",
      "The parents, they said, \"must subject their children to instruction intended to disrupt their religious beliefs or forgo the benefits of a public education at the sizeable cost of either paying for private school, homeschooling, or facing government fines and penalties.\"",
      "Additionally, they argued that suspending the notice and opt-outs created \"topsy-turvy categorizations\" in which a 14-year-old can be excused from instruction on gender and sexuality during sex education, but a 4-year-old has to sit through similar instruction as part of the English Language Arts curriculum.",
      "Eric Baxter, who argued on behalf of the families, told the justices that Montgomery County is an \"extreme outlier\" for declining to allow parents to excuse their children despite their religious objections to the content. He said the instruction featuring the books with LGBTQ-themes was \"clearly indoctrinating\" students.",
      "The families also said that at least one member of the board demonstrated religious hostility toward them, claiming they likened them to \"white supremacists\" and \"xenophobes.\"",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly raised the comments, and asked Shoenfeld if they \"suggest a hostility toward religion.\"",
      "Shoenfeld said the remarks were taken out of context but acknowledged they were \"intemperate.\"",
      "Kavanaugh said that as a lifelong resident of Montgomery County, he was \"mystified\" by what led the county to eventually end the opt-outs, and said it \"stands alone\" both with the types of books added to the curriculum for young students and in not allowing parents to opt their children out of the instruction.",
      "The school system has said that its teachers were expressly forbidden from using the books to pressure students to change their religious beliefs, and argued that while it tried to accommodate parents' requests to opt their children out of the instruction, doing so eventually became \"unworkably disruptive.\"",
      "Lawyers for the school district also argued that exposure to content that parents object to on religious grounds is not the same as impermissibly coercing students to disavow their religious practices.",
      "The parents, they said, didn't put forward any evidence that their children were penalized for their religious beliefs, were asked to affirm views contrary to their faith, or were prohibited from engaging in religious practice. Schoenfeld told the justices that the books sought to \"foster mutual respect in a pluralistic community.\"",
      "It was unclear whether the court would adopt a firm rule that specifies when certain public-school instruction crosses the line from mere exposure to objectionable content into impermissible coercion of students. The justices raised several examples to discern the point at which the right to free exercise of religion would be burdened.",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned whether a parent could request an opt-out for their child whose teacher shows photos from their same-sex wedding or talks about it, or whether a teacher would have to notify a parent if their child had a transgender classmate.",
      "\"This is not just about books,\" she said. \"This is about exposure to people of different sexual orientations and the objection, the sincerely held objection, that children shouldn't be exposed to this?\"",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned Baxter on whether the families were objecting to the \"exposure to the ideas\" portrayed in the books and asked whether they would be pursuing their claim if the storybooks were just on the shelf at the library, rather than incorporated into instruction.",
      "Baxter said his clients would be making the same claim based on their religious beliefs if the picturebooks were just on the shelves.",
      "The school board has warned that accepting the parents' argument that the no-opt-out policy burdened their religious exercise could have harmful effects for public education as a whole.",
      "\"Crediting petitioners' burden theory would not only contravene constitutional text, history, and precedent, but also \u2014 as courts have long recognized \u2014 'leave public education in shreds' by entitling parents to pick and choose which aspects of the curriculum will be taught to their children,\" they wrote in court papers.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union also said that under the parents' assertions, public school families could request exemptions from an array of curricular requirements because of their religious beliefs, including objecting to lessons on major historical figures who are LGBTQ.",
      "\"In sum, requiring public schools to exempt students from secular instruction that they or their parents may find objectionable for religious reasons could throw public schools into disarray, effectively 4 forcing them to tailor their educational materials to align with the religious beliefs of individual students and/or their parents,\" ACLU lawyers wrote in a filing.",

    "summary": "President Trump said he isn't planning on firing Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after calling Powell a \"major loser.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he has \"no intention of firing\"\u00a0Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after the president called Powell a \"major loser\" and publicly lobbied the central bank chief to lower interest rates at a faster clip.",
      "When asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he has any plans to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said he \"never did\" and claimed \"the press runs away with things\" \u2014 though he once again pressed Powell to cut interest rates, which remain elevated after the Fed hiked rates to quell inflation.",
      "\"This is a perfect time to lower interest rates,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If he doesn't, is it the end? No, it's not. But it would be good timing.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump argued in a social media post that Powell is \"always TOO LATE AND WRONG,\" and said his \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" drawing speculation that the president could try to oust Powell before his four-year term ends next year.",
      "Powell has led the Fed since 2018, after Mr. Trump initially nominated him for the job. Former President Joe Biden nominated Powell for a second term, bringing his time atop the central bank to at least May 2026.",
      "It's not clear if Mr. Trump has the power to fire Powell. According to federal law and past legal precedent, members of the Federal Reserve board \u2014 which includes the chair \u2014 can only be removed from their jobs before their terms expire \"for cause.\" However, the Trump administration has argued it has the legal right to fire members of other independent federal agencies, setting up a court fight over the issue that could have broad consequences.",
      "The administration will \"study\" whether it has the right to fire Powell, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told reporters last week.",
      "For his part, Powell\u00a0said last year he will not step down if Mr. Trump asks him to leave his job.",
      "Why is Trump criticizing Powell \u2014 and why does it matter?",
      "Mr. Trump's feud with Powell revolves around the Fed's decision to leave interest rates steady so far this year, after lowering rates from a decades-long high in late 2024. The decision has broad implications. Cutting interest rates can lead to higher economic growth and lower borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which is why Mr. Trump is lobbying for cuts. But lower rates can also boost inflation. And while the inflation rate is now well below its 2022 peak, it remains above the Fed's 2% year-over-year benchmark.",
      "Powell has cited \"uncertainty\" for the Fed's decision to pause rate cuts. Last week, Powell warned\u00a0that Mr. Trump's steep tariffs on foreign imports could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, posing a \"challenging scenario\" for the central bank.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump repeatedly lashed out at Powell on social media, calling him \"Mr. Too Late\" on Monday and arguing the Federal Reserve should slash rates more aggressively because there is \"virtually No Inflation.\"",
      "The showdown \u2014 and the possibility Mr. Trump could try to fire Powell \u2014 have sparked concerns about whether the Federal Reserve will maintain its independence, allowing it to make decisions about economic policy without political influence. Stocks slumped Monday amid concerns about upheaval at the Fed, before rebounding Tuesday.",
      "In an interview Sunday with \"Face the Nation,\" Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, warned that a loss of independence would \"undermine the credibility of the Fed.\" Countries without independent central banks typically have worse inflation, slower economic growth and more sluggish job markets, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday the president \"has the right to express...his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\" Leavitt also said Mr. Trump believes the Fed has \"been making moves and taking action in the name of politics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at Powell for years. The president sharply criticized Powell when the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, before calling the central banker his \"most improved player\" after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted steep rate cuts in 2020.",

    "story": [
      "A town hall hosted by Rep. Byron Donalds turned chaotic Tuesday, with audience members repeatedly interrupting the Florida Republican, leading authorities to remove two people \u2014 the latest raucous town hall dominated by protests against President Trump's administration.",
      "Donalds, a three-term congressman running in next year's Florida gubernatorial race, was asked a litany of often-testy questions, several of which focused on billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Audience members booed or cheered \u2014 and, in some cases, angrily left early \u2014 throughout the almost two-hour event at Estero High School in southwest Florida. Donalds occasionally verbally sparred with the protesters.",
      "Two people appeared to be escorted out by the local sheriff's department after yelling pro-Palestinian sentiments while Donalds answered a question about the Israel-Hamas war. During one incident, Donalds said he would have a protester removed if she kept interrupting. \"Let's have a disagreement. But when you're going to stand and yell and disrespect everybody in this room because you think you're being heard, and let's be clear, you're not,\" he said.",
      "Two back-to-back ejections after the crowd goes back and forth with @ByronDonalds on the Israel-Hamas war. The first two removed shouted \u201cfree Palestine\u201d on their way out. pic.twitter.com/SAiXRssOx0",
      "Donalds told reporters after the event he plans on holding more town halls, but he said the interruptions \"got out of hand,\" calling some of them \"rude\" and \"disrespectful\" to other attendees.",
      "\"I could kind of tell from the first question or two what kind of night it was going to be. But you know, that's alright. It's part of the business,\" Donalds told reporters.",
      "The interruptions began quickly. Minutes into the event, a staff member read a pre-submitted question about whether Donalds supports congressional oversight of DOGE. Donalds defended Musk's cost-cutting efforts and said lawmakers are \"letting DOGE complete its work,\" leading some audience members to groan and boo \u2014 though others appeared to cheer Donalds on.",
      "Donalds was also heckled during questions about immigration, gun control measures, DOGE's work in the Social Security Administration, tariffs and diversity programs. He broadly defended Trump administration policies, drawing boos in many cases.",
      "The lawmaker pushed back on protesters in some cases, asking them questions about Biden- and Obama-era programs and arguing critics were not being \"intellectually honest.\" At other points, he encouraged people to \"relax\" and stop heckling: \"You can yell or you can hear,\" he said during an exchange about the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"Is anybody finding this informative?\" Donalds asked the crowd at one point, drawing a mixture of cheers and jeers. \"60-40? That'll work.\"",
      "Donalds is seeking to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A staunch Trump ally, the congressman earned the president's endorsement in February, before Donalds formally launched his gubernatorial campaign.",
      "Monday's event was the latest congressional town hall to get chaotic. Members of both parties have faced adversarial crowds in recent weeks, with protesters often pushing back against Mr. Trump and Musk. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was repeatedly interrupted by protests at a meeting in the Georgia Republican's home district last Tuesday, with police arresting three demonstrators \u2014 two of whom were tased at the scene. That same evening, a town hall hosted by Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, was also derailed by angry constituents.",
      "Some lawmakers have shied away from hosting in-person events, in some cases shifting to virtual meetings with voters instead. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, suggested last month GOP lawmakers should reconsider in-person town halls, saying members of his caucus should communicate with their constituents but \"there are other avenues to do it than just going in to try to give the other side sound bites.\"",
      "Donalds said last month he plans to continue holding town halls, brushing off plans to protest the events in an interview with Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle.\"",
      "\"Quite frankly, I don't care what they do,\" Donalds said. \"I would tell any Democrat that wants to come out there and astroturf my town hall, bring it, because we're going to talk the truth. We're going to talk about what's really going on. I'm not afraid of you.\"",

      "Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to a prison in El Salvador, say the government has failed to provide appropriate responses to a judge's order for expedited discovery and to her questions about facilitating his return to the U.S.",
      "In a letter addressed to U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis, Abrego Garcia's lawyers requested a hearing to be scheduled Wednesday \"to address the government's failure to comply\" with Xinis' order for expedited discovery in the case.",
      "Xinis on Tuesday issued a scathing order denying the Justice Department's objection to some of the discovery in the case, accusing the department of \"continued mischaracterization of the Supreme Court's Order,\" to return Abrego Garcia and writing the \"defendants' objection reflects a willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\"",
      "Xinis also denied a Justice Deparmtnet claim that it does not need to commit to answering questions brought by Abrego Garcia's lawyers and can instead claim privilege over the answers.",
      "\"For weeks, Defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this Court's orders. Defendants have known, at least since last week, that this Court requires specific legal and factual showings to support any claim of privilege,\" Xinis wrote.",
      "\"Yet they have continued to rely on boilerplate assertions. That ends now. If Defendants want to preserve their privilege claims, they must support them with the required detail. Otherwise, they will lose the protections they failed to properly invoke.\"",
      "Xinis ordered a speedy fact-finding process after the Trump administration refused to comply with three different court orders, including an order from the Supreme Court, to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. so he can receive due process regarding the Trump administration's claim that he is an MS-13 gang member.",
      "Last week in court, a Justice Department attorney said that the Trump administration would facilitate Abrego Garcia's return only if he arrived at a port of entry and continued to dodge questions from Xinis about what, if anything, the Trump administration is doing to return the man.",
      "Xinis said that \"every day Mr. Abrego Garcia is detained in CECOT is another date of irreparable harm\" and gave both sides two weeks to complete expedited discovery in the case, including sworn depositions from Trump administration officials with first-hand knowledge of the efforts to return him. Depositions are set to be completed on Wednesday.",
      "But attorneys for Abrego Garcia say all of the discovery produced by the Justice Department has been \"nothing of substance,\" and \"consists entirely of public filings from the dockets, copies of Plaintiffs' own discovery requests and correspondence, and two nonsubstantive cover emails transmitting declarations filed in this case.\" Other questions for which Abrego Garcia's attorneys have sought answers have been \"similarly non-responsive,\" they wrote.",
      "The plaintiff's lawyers said that the government \"artificially\" narrowed Xinis' order for discovery \"to avoid complying with its obligations.\"",
      "\"The Government refuses to respond to interrogatories it claims are 'based on the false premise that the United States can or has been ordered to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador,'\" Abrego Garcia's attorneys wrote, adding that the Justice Department has not provided any information about Abrego Garcia's detention before April 2, although he has been detained in El Salvador since March 15.",
      "They also argued that the government has asserted privilege \"including deliberative process privilege, state secret privilege, and 'governmental privilege' without any foundation for doing so.\"",
      "Justice Department attorneys countered that they have \"put forward a good-faith effort to provide appropriate responses\" to Abrego Garcia's attorneys and added that they plan to file specific privilege claims over information pertaining to Abrego Garcia soon.",
      "The government also said the administration is \"in discussions\" with the Salvadoran government to return Abrego Garcia, but \"any requirement of a more detailed response by the Defendants would be wholly inappropriate and an invasion of diplomatic discussions.\"",
      "One detail of Abrego Garcia's detention in El Salvador may prompt Xinis to seek more information about what the Trump administration knew \u2014 and when \u2014 about his transfer from CECOT, the country's notorious supermax prison, to another detention center.",
      "Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who met with Abrego Garcia last week, said he was moved from CECOT on April 9 to another lower-security detention facility in El Salvador.",
      "But in court-mandated, daily status updates ordered by Xinis about Abrego Garcia's condition and what the administration is doing to return him, four different officials \u2014 from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the State Department, and Homeland Security \u2014 each stated that Abrego Garcia was being detained at CECOT after that date.",
      "On Monday, the Trump administration confirmed that Abrego Garcia had been moved to a facility in Santa Ana, El Salvador, and reported based on conversations with the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador that he is \"in good conditions and in an excellent state of health.\"",

The senior official said State Department undersecretaries for the various bureaus must in about 30 days present a plan on how they will eliminate positions.",
      "Rubio reposted \"X\" posts in which Free Press journalists said the move would entail closing 132 offices, moving 137 offices elsewhere, and directing undersecretaries to reduce personnel by anywhere between 15-17%. Another senior State Department official told reporters on Tuesday that the personnel reduction would be 22%.",
      "Among the agency offices to be cut, according to an \"X\" post Rubio reposted, are those intended to further human rights, advance democracy overseas, counter extremism, and prevent war crimes. Asked during Tuesday's departmental press briefing about the department's office of Global Criminal Justice, which plays a role in investigating war crimes and is missing from the proposed \"reorganization\" chart, Pentagon spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that just \"because it's now folded into another larger bureau, doesn't mean that it's gone or we don't care.\"",

      "\"Over the past 15 years, the department's footprint has had unprecedented growth and costs have soared,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"But far from seeing a return on investment, taxpayers have seen less effective and efficient diplomacy. The sprawling bureaucracy created a system more beholden to radical political ideology than advancing America's core national interests.\"",
      "\"That is why today I am announcing a comprehensive reorganization plan that will bring the Department into the 21st Century,\" Rubio continued. \"This approach will empower the Department from the ground up, from the bureaus to the embassies. Region-specific functions will be consolidated to increase functionality, redundant offices will be removed, and non-statutory programs that are misaligned with America's core national interests will cease to exist.\"",
      "The senior State Department official who briefed reporters stressed this is a \"purely domestic plan\" that \"does not have anything to do with any foreign missions.\"",
      "\"That's not to say that there won't be subsequent decisions on foreign missions, but that's not what this is,\" the official said.",

      "The FBI declined to share Patel's flight schedule and would not confirm his presence on a number of flights to destinations where he later appeared. During the first weekend in April, for instance, a Boeing 757 owned by the Department of Justice made two round trip flights from Washington to New York.",
      "On Saturday, April 5, the narrow-body jet took a 57-minute flight to Stewart International Airport, a short drive from West Point, where Patel made an appearance at a charity hockey event hosted by the FBI. The next day, the jet was back in the air to JFK Airport, landing just hours before Patel resurfaced in box seats next to hockey legend Wayne Gretzky and watched Capitals star Alex Ovechkin break the NHL scoring record.",

When traveling for personal reasons, the director may bring family or friends, but guest travel must be reimbursed to the government as well. Friends or family members are never allowed to fly on FBI aircraft unaccompanied by the director. It is unclear whether Patel has brought friends or family aboard government jets.",

      "Patel's use of Gulfstream jets operated by the FBI appears to extend to his frequent trips to Las Vegas, where he has a home, and to Nashville, where Patel's girlfriend, who is a country singer, lives. Sources familiar with Patel's travel confirmed to CBS News that the director was on the plane for several trips captured by FlightRadar24, including a weekend dash to Las Vegas on March 7 and a weekend in Nashville on March 14.",
      "It is unclear if he was aboard on Feb. 24, when one of the FBI's Gulfstream 5 jets flew from Manassas, Virginia, where the plane is based, to Nashville, stayed on the ground for an hour and 27 minutes before returning to Manassas.",
      "On some occasions, Patel may have traveled for both pleasure and business. An FBI jet flew on March 21 from Washington to Nashville. That day, Patel attended a roundtable meeting with state and local law enforcement officials in Tennessee, and also visited the FBI field office in Nashville. The plane returned to Washington later that afternoon. It is unclear whether he saw Alexis Wilkins, his girlfriend, while he was there.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the FBI said it \"does not comment on travel arrangements for security purposes. All ethical guidelines are followed rigorously.\"",
      "Some bureau veterans told CBS News they have been troubled by the frequent use of government aircraft by FBI executives, making the aircraft less available to support operations in line with the primary mission of investigating crimes, chasing spies and preventing terrorist attacks.",
      "\"Those aircraft have been procured or leased specifically to support operational needs,\" said Christopher O'Leary, a former senior counterterrorism official at the FBI who has used the planes dozens of times for sensitive missions and critical response. \"The concern is that the routine use of them by the director and deputy director for personal travel could take a critical resource offline when they are sometimes needed at a moment's notice.\"",
      "O'Leary and others said they also worry that the use of the planes sets the wrong tone.",
      "\"It's a bad leadership example,\" he told CBS News. \"All agents are provided an FBI vehicle, and they cannot be used for personal use.\u00a0 They can only be used for going to and from work, for official duties or to respond to a crisis and that is strictly enforced.\"",
      "Congressional watchdog advised limits on personal jet travel",
      "In 2013, the Government Accountability Office probed the Justice Department's and the FBI's use of the FBI G5 jets for \"non-mission purposes.\" The report that followed laid out how often and for what reasons the planes were used by the attorney general and the FBI director, the costs associated with the flights and the rules and regulations governing them. At the time, the GAO did not find any specific instances of wrongdoing, although it did emphasize the importance of officials being responsible stewards of taxpayer funds when using the planes.",
      "Diana Maurer, a director at GAO and author of the 2013 report, told CBS News that the same principles that were at play when the congressional watchdog agency did its review remain relevant today.",
      "\"I don't know what the current FBI director did or didn't do, and we haven't updated our 2013 report,\" Mauer said in an interview.\u00a0 \"But just because you're allowed to do something doesn't necessarily mean you should.\"",
      "Maurer noted that government officials should not abuse their privileges at the expense of the taxpayer.",
      "\"Using government aircraft, as FBI Directors are required to do for security reasons, costs significantly more than commercial flights. I hope the FBI and the Department of Justice are considering the implications for taxpayers when the Director uses government aircraft for non-mission purposes.\"",
      "Past FBI directors faced scrutiny",
      "During the years that Wray ran the FBI, his personal use of the jet became a touchstone for conservative critics. Wray occasionally flew from Washington to his hometown of Atlanta, where his family maintained its residence. He drew criticism from Republicans in Congress and some former FBI agents for summoning the G5s to Reagan National Airport from Manassas, a 15-minute flight, rather than being driven 30 miles to the Virginia airport where it maintains a hangar.",
      "FBI whistleblower Steven Friend, a close ally of Patel's who was suspended by the bureau over concerns that his views on the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol affected his work, criticized Wray in more than a dozen social media posts for his use of the jets. \"Chris Wray abuses his\u00a0 @FBI jet privileges because he doesn't like to sit in traffic,\" Friend wrote in a Dec. 14, 2023, tweet.",
      "Wray was also raked over the coals by Republican lawmakers for cutting short a Senate oversight hearing in 2023 to fly on an FBI aircraft to a family vacation in the Adirondacks. (Wray at the time pointed out that he had negotiated the length of the hearing with committee staff.) The chairman of the committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, later questioned Wray's use of the FBI jets and whether it amounted to an abuse of taxpayer money, a suggestion that Wray rejected, noting that he was a \"required use traveler,\" and that he reimbursed the government in every instance he used the planes for personal purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Grassley said the senator is \"still waiting on the FBI\" for records regarding Wray's use of the jets and criticized Democrats and the media, claiming they never showed \"any interest in scrutinizing FBI Directors' travel logs until Kash Patel came on the scene.\" Grassley's office did not respond to a question about whether the senator would continue his oversight of FBI directors' government jet travel while Patel is director.",
      "FBI directors have also at times been sensitive about the potential misuses of the FBI's fleet. In at least one case, a former FBI director went to extraordinary lengths to save the taxpayer money for his air travel.",
      "Soon after he became FBI director in 2013, James Comey traveled back and forth to Connecticut where his family was still living. At the time, Washington was in the midst of a heated budget battle with the possibility that government workers would be furloughed and have their paychecks withheld. So, according to two former law enforcement officials, Comey asked President Barack Obama for a special dispensation from the \"required use\" rule so that he could fly commercial at a much lower cost to the government.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said Sunday that he can \"absolutely\" guarantee Trump administration deregulations won't have adverse health impacts on people and the environment.",
      "\"We have to both protect the environment and grow the economy,\" Zeldin said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "As part of President Trump's pledge to unleash American energy, Zeldin announced in March that the EPA would reconsider rules across a number of sectors, including regulations on power plants, on mercury and air toxic standards that target coal-fired power plants and on wastewater regulations for the development of oil and gas. The Trump administration touted the 31 deregulatory actions as the \"most momentous day\" in EPA history.",
      "The decisions are the start of what's expected to be a yearslong effort to repeal or revise dozens of environmental rules, much to the dismay of climate experts and advocates.",
      "Zeldin, who formerly represented New York in the House, said at the time of the announcement that \"today the green new scam ends,\" while pledging that the EPA will do its part to \"usher in the golden age of American success.\"",
      "While Zeldin says the policy changes won't have adverse health effects, The Environmental Protection Network, a group of former EPA employees, found otherwise. They analyzed EPA data of 12 of the 31 proposed rollbacks and estimate that air pollution would increase as a result of the deregulation that would lead to nearly 200,000 premature deaths and cause more than 10,000 asthma attacks every day in America.",
      "Already, the EPA has provided exemptions to 47 power plants operators from complying with stricter mercury and air toxin standards that are due to go into effect in 2027. Power plants in 23 states are on the list and several are coal plants that emit fine particulate matter, which pose the greatest risk to health. This comes after the EPA announced it would accept emails from companies and industries looking to avoid environmental regulations if they could prove it was in the best interest of national security.",
      "On Sunday, Zeldin told senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang on \"Face the Nation\" that the American people want the administration to \"make sure that we are applying common sense,\" arguing that regulation brought over the finish line during the Biden administration was too broad and targeted entire industries.",
      "\"When the American public went to vote last November, they were talking about economic concerns, about struggling to make ends meet,\" Zeldin added. \"What we've also heard are the costs of compliance, which amount into the trillions and what that does to the American economy as well.\"",
      "Zeldin said he doesn't prejudge outcomes, noting that there will be a process on the deregulatory actions that includes public comment, while encouraging Americans to \"weigh in when they have that opportunity.\"",

      "The messages, sent on March 15, included flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets tasked with striking Houthi targets, the sources said. The messages were sent the same day Hegseth shared similar operational details in a separate Signal chat that inadvertently included The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, sparking\u00a0widespread concern over how senior officials handle sensitive military information.",
      "Among the recipients of the private messages was Hegseth's wife, Jennifer, a former Fox News producer who holds no official role at the Department of Defense. She had previously drawn criticism after the Wall Street Journal reported she joined the defense secretary on official foreign trips and attended high-level meetings with international leaders.",
      "Also included in the chat were Hegseth's brother, Phil Hegseth, and the defense secretary's longtime personal attorney Tim Parlatore. While both hold positions at the Pentagon, it was not clear why either would require advance knowledge of strike plans in this case.",
      "The second Signal chat was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Responding to reporters' questions on Monday, Hegseth said he had spoken to President Trump and \"we're going to continue fighting, on the same page all the way.\"",
      "Hegseth accused the media of taking \"anonymous sources from disgruntled, former employees, and then they try to slash and burn people, and ruin their reputation.\"",
      "In a statement on social media, Defense Department spokeperson Sean Parnell wrote Sunday, \"There was no classified information in any Signal chat, no matter how many ways they try to write the story. What is true is that the Office of the Secretary of Defense is continuing to become stronger and more efficient in executing President Trump's agenda.\"",

    "story": [
      "A showdown in federal court in Denver could help shape the future legal landscape surrounding deportations nationwide.",
      "A high-stakes hearing concluded Monday morning  in a case filed by immigrants' rights groups against the Trump administration. Attorneys for the administration argued that people facing deportation should only be allotted 24 hours' notice to be able to fight their deportation order in court, but attorneys for the ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network argued that 24 hours isn't \"reasonable,\" as ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\"The government wants to give as little notice as possible so they can pull people out of the country without a judge reviewing it,\" Tim Macdonald, legal director of the ACLU of Colorado, told CBS News Colorado outside the Alfred A. Arraj U.S. Courthouse   on Monday.",
      "\"The idea that 24 hours is sufficient for someone who's detained at the Aurora detention facility, who likely doesn't speak English, who may not have a high level of education, who doesn't have a lawyer, who doesn't have access to a phone -- the idea that that person can file a, quote, 'writ of habeas corpus' in 24 hours is preposterous,\" he continued.",
      "Macdonald went on to say that alleged Nazis were afforded more rights\u00a0in court after World War II than Venezuelans facing deportation under the Trump administration, echoing what a U.S. Appeals Court judge said in Washington, D.C. last month.",
      "Charlotte Sweeney, U.S. District judge for the District of Colorado, said on Monday she wouldn't rule on the case for 24 hours. During that hearing, attorneys for the ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network said 11 people have been deported from Colorado to El Salvador and about 85% of people being held in the Aurora ICE Processing Center -- which has 1,532 beds -- have not yet been able to retain legal counsel, which those groups argue is a violation of their due process rights.",
      "Court records show the hearing lasted just over an hour. In addition to President Trump, the defendants named in the case include U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, ICE Director Todd Lyons, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, ICE Denver Field Office Director Robert Gaudian, and Dawn Ceja, warden of the ICE Processing Center in Aurora.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court issued a rare weekend ruling\u00a0temporarily halting the Trump administration's plan to deport more Venezuelan migrants from a Texas detention facility under a seldom-used wartime law passed in 1798, the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The president has invoked the Alien Enemies Act, allowing the executive branch to detain or deport noncitizens it deems \"dangerous,\" particularly those administration officials say are part of the gang Tren de Aragua. Last month, the administration used the law to send more than 200 people to a\u00a0prison in El Salvador.",
      "The Supreme Court's weekend ruling came as mass protests continued across the country, including in Colorado, denouncing the Trump administration's immigration policies. The administration is urging the court to reconsider its decision blocking the deportations.",
      "Now, El Salvador's president has proposed exchanging the deported migrants for political prisoners held in Venezuela.",
      "In Denver, a federal court recently barred the removal of any noncitizens within Colorado\u00a0who are or will be subject to the Alien Enemies Act. Some of those previously deported from Colorado have already been sent to the El Salvador prison, according to their attorneys.",
      "At issue is what kind of legal rights migrants have to challenge the government's allegations before they are removed from the U.S.",
      "Trump has said the United States is facing an \"invasion\" by the Tren de Aragua gang and that he has the authority to use the 1798 law. The act was last invoked during World War II, including in Colorado, to hold Japanese Americans at internment camps, including Camp Amache.",
      "Prior to World War II, the act had only been used against the Central Powers during World War I and against the British during the War of 1812.",
      "\"If you think of internment camps during World War II in the United States, that's the kind of framework that we're looking at in terms of how this law has been used in the past,\" Laura Lunn, an immigrant advocacy lawyer with the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, said.",
      "The legal battle has triggered a series of emergency filings over the weekend after the Supreme Court bumped a case out of U.S. District Court for Washington, D.C., saying it needed to be filed in Texas and other states from which people are being deported.",
      "Asked about why this case matters, Macdonald said, \"if the government can remove these folks without due process, it erodes civil liberties for every one of us, and they could be next. We could be next. If the government is able to dispense with due process, it's a risk for liberty for all of us.\"",

      "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post\u00a0on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"",
      "The latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell\u00a0is an option.",
      "Interest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "The Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.",
      "The White House declined further comment.",
      "Here's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "Board members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.",
      "\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court\u00a0ruled\u00a0in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "But Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.",
      "While lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.",
      "Who appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?",
      "Powell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.",
      "What is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.",
      "The Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.",
      "\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.",
      "He added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"",
      "Inflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis \u2014 a sign that inflation continues to percolate.",
      "What has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?",
      "Powell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the\u00a0impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Still, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.",
      "What do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?",
      "Wall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.",
      "The market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.",
      "\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes \u2014 publicly or politically \u2014 sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"",
      "The Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.",
      "What has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he\u00a0wouldn't step down\u00a0if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "Some lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"",
      "\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.",
      "Also Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.",
      "\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really \u2014 I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"",
      "William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-affordable-care-acts-preventive-care-prep-cancer-screenings/",
    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:11:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Affordable Care Act requires health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive-care services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force at no cost to patients.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday considered a case that could impact whether Americans have to pay out-of-pocket for preventive-care services such as diabetes screenings, HIV-prevention drugs and statins, which are currently provided to patients at no cost under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The legal battle is the latest to land before the high court that involves the landmark health care overhaul signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in 2010. But this dispute turns on how to classify the 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which sits within the Department of Health and Human Services and has been making recommendations on preventive medical services to avoid serious health conditions since 1984.",
      "But last year, a federal appeals court in New Orleans found that the task force's structure violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because its members are principal officers who were not properly appointed. Principal officers must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "If the Supreme Court affirms the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, major hospital associations and leading nonprofits advocating on behalf of breast cancer and HIV patients have warned it would limit access to life-saving medical care for millions of patients, as insurers would no longer be required to cover at no cost to patients the services recommended by the task force.",
      "\"Patients who relied on the promise of preventive care without out-of-pocket costs for a variety of lifesaving interventions and screenings may now need to bear those costs themselves,\" a coalition of trade groups, led by the American Hospital Association, wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief file with the Supreme Court. \"Realistically, this means that patients will not seek out essential preventive care or adhere to preventive medications after they are prescribed.\"",
      "While the Preventive Services Task Force has for more than three decades been making recommendations on preventive medical services, its role was codified by Congress in 1999. The task force's volunteer members are selected by the health and human services secretary and appointed to a four-year term. There are no restrictions on a member's removal, though Congress has said that all members and its recommendations \"shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "With passage of the Affordable Care Act, Congress required health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "Congress did not create a list of covered preventive services when it passed the ACA, but instead provided for categories of services that must be covered based on the recommendations of medical experts, including the task force. The Biden and Trump administrations have both estimated that millions of Americans have received these services for free through their insurance plans.",
      "Among the preventive services currently recommended by the task force are screenings for lung, cervical and colorectal cancers, as well as diabetes; statin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke; and medication to prevent HIV, known as PrEP, which gave rise to the legal battle currently before the Supreme Court.",
      "During arguments on Monday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested the language of the statute that established the task force is different from others involving the structure of independent agencies, which specify its officers are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and limit a president's ability to remove members to certain grounds.",
      "\"All of that's missing here,\" he said.",
      "Kavanaugh told Jonathan Mitchell, who argued that the task force's members are unlawfully appointed, that his argument hinges on the Supreme Court treating the task force as a \"massively important\" agency that makes \"critical decisions\" that affect a key segment of the economy, without any supervision or direction by the secretary.",
      "\"Normally, before that kind of thing would happen, Congress would've provided stronger indications that this task force is enormously important,\" he said, adding that he doesn't see any indicators that the entity is \"more powerful than the secretary of Health and Human Services or the president in terms of how these recommendations are going to affect the health care industry.\"",
      "Justice Elena Kagan also questioned why the secretary's power to remove task force members at will is not enough to show that they are accountable to the leader of the Department Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, which would undercut Mitchell's characterization of the members as principal officers who must be appointed by the president and Senate-confirmed.",
      "\"If you read this court's decisions, it seems often to be the end-all and the be-all that the court has suggested on many occasions that removal power is really the essence of control: If you have it, you have control. If you don't have it, you don't have control,\" she said.",
      "Kagan also said it would be \"odd\" for Congress to set up a task force, but not say who picks its members.",
      "Other justices questioned the scope of the word \"independent,\" and whether that puts the task force outside of the secretary's supervision.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor likened the task force, which gives technical advice, to her law clerks, who may offer independent judgments but are hired to \"help the decision-makers come to a conclusion.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court finds that the task force members are inferior officers, one possible outcome that was raised during the arguments was sending the case back to the 5th Circuit for more proceedings to decide whether Congress gave the Health and Human Services secretary the authority to appoint them.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch first raised that option and noted that the lower court didn't address whether the secretary has that power.",
      "While inferior officers must be appointed by the president and Senate, Congress can choose to vest this appointment power elsewhere, to an agency leader, for instance.",
      "The dispute before the high court arose after the task force recommended in June 2019 that PrEP be included among the preventive services covered without cost-sharing arrangements. A group of four individuals and two small businesses filed a lawsuit targeting the Preventive Services Task Force, and objected to the ACA's requirement that insurers cover certain HIV-prevention drugs that are recommended by it on religious grounds.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that providing coverage of PrEP \"encourages and facilitates homosexual behavior,\" which conflicts with their religious beliefs, and said they want to purchase or provide plans that exclude coverage of that medication.",
      "Five of the six challengers do not participate in the health insurance market, and the sixth, Braidwood Management, provides coverage to 70 employees through a self-insured plan.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Texas, argued that the task force's structure violates the Constitution's Appointments Clause because its members are principal officers who therefore must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "The district court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that the task force members were improperly appointed. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor also invalidated all preventive-care coverage recommendations that had been implemented since the ACA was signed into law in March 2010, and barred the government from enforcing the health care law's coverage requirements in response to the task force's recommendations going forward.",
      "The 5th Circuit affirmed the lower court's finding that the task force's structure is unconstitutional, but disagreed with the universal relief it provided as to the task force's prior requirements for preventive-care coverage.",
      "In concluding that the task force's members are principal officers, the 5th Circuit said they were not properly appointed because they wield \"unreviewable power\" \u2014 issuing preventive-care recommendations for services that insurers, in turn, must cover under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court and the Trump administration has continued to defend the board's structure.",
      "Hashim Mooppan, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices that the task force members are inferior officers because they are \"subject to ample supervision\" by the Health and Human Services secretary when issuing recommendations on preventive care services that must be covered by insurers and group health plans.",
      "Additionally, the task force members can be removed by the head of the Health and Human Services Department at-will, and the secretary can review its recommendations and prevent them from taking effect, Mooppan said.",
      "Given these \"collective powers of supervision,\" the task force can't issue recommendations that bind the insurance industry unless the secretary permits it to do so, he said.",
      "In court filings, the Trump administration also noted that even if the task force members were principal officers who had to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, the constitutional violation would be remedied by severing a provision of federal law that the 5th Circuit found insulates it from the Health and Human Services secretary's supervision.",
      "Doing that would allow the task force to \"make recommendations that will have legal effect only under appropriate supervision by the secretary,\" then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in a February brief.",
      "But lawyers for Braidwood Management have said that the task force members are principal officers who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate in part because federal law dictates that their recommendations be kept \"independent\" and \"not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "\"Congress has chosen to create an independent task force and shield it from political pressure,\" Mitchell, who argued on behalf of Braidwood Management, told the justices.",
      "He said that it's \"not clear\" Congress would even have approved a regime under which the secretary \u2014 a political appointee \u2014 rather than an independent task force decides the preventive care that insurers have to cover.",
      "Even if the Supreme Court finds that the members are inferior officers, as the Trump administration argues, Mitchell said that category of executive branch officials still requires appointment by the president and Senate, unless Congress says otherwise.",
      "He also disputed that the court can fix these constitutional violations by separating out the problematic provision of the law and empowering the secretary to veto the task force's recommendations for mandated preventive-care coverage. The task force, Mitchell said, would still have unreviewable discretion when it decides not to require coverage of a particular service.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, outside medical organizations have warned that a decision invalidating the structure of the task force would have significant ramifications for access to preventive care.",
      "The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation said that the elimination of cost-sharing for breast cancer preventive-care measures has had a \"profound impact\" on public health because screenings lead to earlier detection and treatment, and fewer deaths.",
      "\"The costs of such preventive care \u2014 if not fully covered by insurance, which is the effect of the district court's decision \u2014 dissuade individuals from utilizing the services, and thus lead to later detection, later-stage diagnoses, more aggressive treatment plans, higher treatment costs, and more deaths,\" the organization said in a brief.",
      "The HIV and Hepatitis Policy Institute said the task force's recommendations have been \"essential\" to preventing HIV, hepatitis and other infectious diseases for millions of patients.",
      "\"Without continued access to the no-cost prevention assured under the ACA and consequent new transmissions, our nation will witness a reversal of decades of progress as HIV resurges,\" the group said in a brief, joined by 19 other organizations.",
      "But groups backing Braidwood have argued that the task force is insulated from political accountability, as the ACA left no room for supervision by the Health and Human Services secretary or any other principal officer who answers to the president.",

      "Trump administration officials argue that it has\u00a0overstepped its authority and should have a more limited mission, amounting to an existential crisis for \u00a0government agency that itself was born from crisis.",
      "The CFPB was launched in 2011 under President Barack Obama following the housing industry meltdown that devastated the global economy. The agency's mission: to protect Americans from abuse by financial firms; ensure that industry players follow consumer protection rules governing everything from home loans to credit cards; and help regulate a sector implicated in the biggest U.S. economic collapse since the Great Depression.",
      "Republican lawmakers and other critics have long attacked the CFPB, saying it lacked accountability and imposed burdensome regulations on the financial industry. Supporters of the agency say it has played a vital role safeguarding consumers.",
      "Why was the CFPB created?",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency that was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis as lawmakers implemented financial reform. The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world. The disaster\u00a0wiped out\u00a0almost $8 trillion in stock market wealth and $6 trillion in home value.",

It takes big financial institutions to court who cheat consumers, whether it's a credit reporting agency, or a large bank or a credit card giant,\" Rohit Chopra, who was\u00a0fired by President Trump as director of CFPB earlier this month, said in an interview\u00a0aired\u00a0on NPR on Monday. \"The CFPB has been recovering billions of dollars for consumers who were wronged.\"",
      "In the weeks leading up to Chopra's departure, the CFPB targeted a number of large institutions in a flurry of legal actions. That included suing Capital One for\u00a0allegedly misleading people\u00a0about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts and accusing Experian of\u00a0improperly investigating consumer complaints of errors in credit reports. Both Capital one Experian dispute the allegations.",
      "The CFPB in December also said that more than 4 million Americans\u00a0allegedly gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com would soon collectively be refunded $1.8 billion.",
      "What do the CFPB's critics say?",
      "Funded by the Federal Reserve, the CFPB has weathered multiple legal challenges from opponents over its short life as a regulatory agency. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "The CFPB had been \"a woke & weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,\" acting CFPB director Russ Vought wrote in a Feb. 9 social media post. Vought previously served as Office of Management and Budget director in the first Trump administration and was involved in writing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which called for\u00a0eliminating the agency.",
      "According to a slew of published reports, Mr. Trump on Tuesday picked Jonathan McKernan to head the agency. McKernan on Monday resigned from the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vought will continue to lead the agency until the Senate confirms a nominee.",

      "\"That was a very important thing to get rid of,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday from the Oval Office. Asked if his intention was to eliminate the agency, he Trump replied, \"I would say, yeah, because we're trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse.\"",

      "If one is looking to root out redundancy in federal government, the CFPB is a \"great place to start,\" Norbert Michel, vice president and director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's completely untrue that there was no consumer protection in financial markets prior to the CFPB,\" said Michel, who lists the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as among the regulators already on hand.",
      "Still, while long an advocate of pulling the plug on the agency's operations, Michel was unclear on the White House's tactics.",
      "\"Congress created this thing, and I don't understand how that's possible for the executive branch to truly get rid of a federal agency that Congress created, whether I like it or not,\" said Michel. \"I don't know what the end game is \u2014 I don't know what they are trying to do,\" the economist and statistician said of the Trump administration's efforts at pulling the plug on the CFPB's work.",
      "What could happen to the CFPB?",
      "One financial analyst believes the CFPB will survive, even as it drops its defense of rule changes now being challenged in the courts.",
      "\"We expect to see the repeal of the credit card late fee, the overdraft late fee, the open banking and the credit bureau rules reversed by the courts,\" Jaret Seiberg wrote, an analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report on Tuesday, referencing consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB during Chopra's time at the agency's helm.",
      "A union representing employees at dozens of federal agencies is suing to block the agency's shutdown. Democrats including Sen.

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday temporarily blocked the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law.",
      "In a brief order, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center \"until further order from this court.\"",
      "The high court acted overnight following an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union, contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798. The Supreme Court had said earlier in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given \"a reasonable time\" to contest their pending removals.",
      "\"These men were in imminent danger of spending their lives in a horrific foreign prison without ever having had a chance to go to court,\" ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt told CBS News in a statement on Saturday. \"We are relieved that the Supreme Court has not permitted the administration to whisk them away the way others were just last month.\"",
      "Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. Alito wrote in his dissent, joined by Thomas, that \"the court hastily and prematurely granted unprecedented emergency relief.\" He argued that the high court's intervention was inappropriate because it was unclear that the court had jurisdiction and that there was \"little concrete support\" for the allegation that the migrants were in imminent danger of removal. He also noted that the Supreme Court heard only from the ACLU, and not the government, before acting.",
      "\"In sum, literally in the middle of the night, the Court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,\" Alito wrote.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller on Saturday responded to the Supreme Court's order on X, claiming that the men being held were \"foreign terrorists.\"",
      "\"They were arrested in diligently planned and executed raids recently carried out by Departments of Justice and Homeland Security,\" Miller said.",
      "\"We are confident we will ultimately prevail against the onslaught of meritless litigation brought by radical activists who care more about the rights of these terrorist aliens than those of the American people,\" Leavitt wrote in a separate post.",
      "On Friday, two federal judges refused to step in as lawyers for the men launched a desperate legal campaign to prevent their deportation. Early Saturday, the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals refused to issue an order protecting the detainees from being deported.",
      "The administration is expected to return to the Supreme Court quickly in an effort to persuade the justices to lift their temporary order.",
      "The ACLU had already sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet facility and sought an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "In an emergency filing early Friday, the ACLU said it heard from lawyers and relatives of some of the men held at the detention center in Ansen, Texas, that immigration authorities were accusing the men of being members of the Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang President Trump has made into a focal point of his crackdown on illegal immigration. The organization, citing lawyers and family members, said some of them had been given notices telling them they were slated to be deported under the wartime law.",
      "Citing the March 15 deportations of scores of migrants who were taken to El Salvador's notorious Center for the Confinement of Terrorism, or CECOT, mega-prison, the ACLU implored U.S. District Court Judge James Wesley Hendrix to act quickly.",
      "\"(G)iven the brutal nature of the Salvadoran prison where other Venezuelan men were sent under the (Alien Enemies Act) last month, the irreparable harm to them is manifest,\" the ACLU's emergency motion said.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act in March\u00a0to order officials to immediately detain and remove Venezuelan migrants with alleged ties to Tren de Aragua, arguing that they were invading or staging an incursion into the U.S.",
      "The act has only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The Trump administration contended the AEA gave it the power to swiftly remove immigrants it identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status.",
      "Following the unanimous high court order on April 9, federal judges in\u00a0Colorado,\u00a0New York and southern Texas\u00a0promptly issued orders barring the removal of detainees under the AEA until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court.",
      "But there had been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is located 24 miles north of Abilene in the far northern end of the state.",
      "Judge Hendrix, a Trump appointee, this week declined to bar the administration from removing the two men identified in the ACLU lawsuit because Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed sworn declarations that they would not be immediately deported. He also balked at issuing a broader order prohibiting the removal of all Venezuelans in the area under the act because he said removals hadn't started yet.",
      "But the ACLU's Friday filing included sworn declarations from three separate immigration lawyers who said their clients in Bluebonnet were given paperwork indicating they were members of Tren de Aragua and could be deported by Saturday.",
      "An attorney for the Legal Aid Society said her client refused to sign papers he was given by the detention facility staff because they were in English and he could not understand what they said.",
      "Gelernt said in a Friday evening hearing before District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington, D.C., that the administration initially moved Venezuelans to its south Texas immigration facility for deportation. But since a judge banned deportations in that area, it has funneled them to the Bluebonnet facility, where no such order exists. He said witnesses reported the men were being loaded on buses Friday evening to be taken to the airport.",
      "With Hendrix not agreeing to the ACLU's request for an emergency order, the group turned to Boasberg, who initially halted deportations in March. The Supreme Court ruled the orders against deportation could only come from judges in jurisdictions where immigrants were held, which Boasberg said made him powerless on Friday.",
      "\"I'm sympathetic to everything you're saying,\" Boasberg told Gelernt. \"I just don't think I have the power to do anything about it.\"",
      "Boasberg this week found there's probable cause that the Trump administration committed\u00a0criminal contempt\u00a0by ignoring his order to turn around the planes carrying more than 200 Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador. He was concerned that the paper that ICE was giving those held did not make clear they had a right to challenge their removal in court, which he believed the Supreme Court mandated.",
      "Drew Ensign, an attorney for the Justice Department, disagreed, saying that people slated for deportation would have a \"minimum\" of 24 hours to challenge their removal in court. He said no flights were scheduled for Friday night and he was unaware of any Saturday, but the Department of Homeland Security said it reserved the right to remove people then.",
      "ICE said it would not comment on the litigation.",
      "Also Friday, a Massachusetts judge made permanent his temporary ban on the administration deporting immigrants who have exhausted their appeals to countries other than their home countries unless they are informed of their destination and given a chance to object if they'd face torture or death there.",
      "Some Venezuelans subject to Trump's Alien Enemies Act have been sent to El Salvador and housed in its\u00a0notorious\u00a0main prison.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Sunday that El Salvador \"tried really hard\" to prevent him from seeing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, before the government reversed course late last week.",
      "\"I think they realized that that was not a good look at the end of the day,\" Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia is a 29-year-old Salvadoran national who lived in Maryland who was sent last month to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison as part of a White House effort, although the administration later admitted in court that Abrego Garcia was mistakenly among those deported. The case has come to the fore in recent weeks amid simmering tensions between the federal judiciary and the Trump administration's sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last week, where he met with Abrego Garcia on Thursday after he said his attempts were repeatedly turned down by the Salvadoran government.",
      "Van Hollen noted that he held press conferences in El Salvador, where he made the point that the government was \"violating international law by not allowing anyone to reach him,\" adding that \"they realized that was a bad look.\"",
      "After Van Hollen was allowed to meet with Abrego Garcia, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele was the first to announce the meeting, writing in a post on X that Abrego Garcia was \"now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador,\" alongside photos that showed the two men sitting at a table with drinks that resemble margaritas. The president later wrote, \"I love chess.\"",
      "Van Hollen said of the Salvadoran government, \"they go to great lengths to deceive people,\" outlining how drinks were brought to the table as photos were taken during his meeting with Abrego Garcia, adding that \"no one touched them.\"",
      "\"The reality is, if you look at the photos when I first sat down and the ones at the end, you can see that that was all staged,\" Van Hollen said. \"They're trying to create the impression that, you know, this is a guy in paradise, when in fact he's been in one of the most notorious prisons in the world.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. unlawfully in 2011 and was arrested in 2019. When he was released from immigration custody, an immigration judge granted him withholding of removal \u2014\u00a0 a legal status that forbids the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador.",
      "Van Hollen said Sunday that Abrego Garcia has since been transferred from CECOT to a facility in Santa Ana.",
      "In an update to the federal district court in Maryland, a top State Department official noted Sunday that Abrego Garcia told the senator he had been transferred to Centro Industrial about eight days before their meeting.",
      "\"Abrego Garc\u00eda told Sen. Van Hollen that he had been placed in the administrative building of Centro Industrial, in a room of his own with a bed and furniture, and that he was not in a cell,\" Michael Kozak said in the court filing.",
      "Trump administration officials have since acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "Still, a fierce legal battle has ensued around efforts to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. The administration was ordered earlier this month to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador, before the Supreme Court ruled that the judge's decision properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release, while the scope should be clarified. On Thursday, a federal appeals court rejected a request from the Trump administration to pause the district judge's order, writing that the government's assertions in the case should be \"shocking\" to all Americans.",
      "Meanwhile, the White House and Bukele have made clear that they don't intend to bring Abrego Garcia back, despite the orders, while Trump administration officials have repeatedly claimed that he is a member of the gang MS-13. Van Hollen stressed that the administration hasn't presented evidence to link Abrego Garcia to MS-13 or other terrorist activity, while urging officials to \"put up or shut up in court.\"",
      "\"Go to court, stop tweeting, and put up or shut up in front of the judges,\" Van Hollen added.",
      "The Maryland Democrat said he did not travel to El Salvador to litigate the details of Abrego Garcia's case, but rather \"to make sure that he was still alive and check on his health.\" But he argued that the case is also much bigger than one man.",
      "\"This is not a case about just one man whose constitutional rights are being ignored and disrespected, because when you trample on the constitutional rights of one man \u2014 as the courts have all said is happening in this case \u2014 you threaten the constitutional rights of every American,\" Van Hollen said.",

And yes, we talked at length about a whole host of topics. We didn't leave really anything out of the discussion. And obviously, that day, he was signing a Memorandum of Understanding on a minerals agreement, which they've gone back and forth on. You know, he and I had talks about the security guarantees. That's obviously a big concern of his. He is rightfully concerned. The history is with the Budapest Memorandum. When Ukraine was the third largest possessor nuclear weapons, they gave them up voluntarily, based on a memorandum- also a memorandum in 1994 that said that they would get security guarantees for- in exchange for giving up the nuclear arsenal. As it turns out, that that promise was not kept by none other than Russia, right? Go figure. So he has justifiable concerns, but we talked through that because we do want this economic partnership to be the precursor to security guarantees.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And just a quick follow on that Congressman the President indicated in the Oval Office on Thursday that that deal would be signed next week. Do you know if that's true?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Well, that remains to be seen, and it depends on what's in the deal. So what President Zelensky made clear to me, as he has many times, is, you know, certain agreements can be signed by his finance minister and Secretary Bessent, but if it's worded differently, if there are specific numbers, for example, that's something that needs to go through his parliament and potentially our Congress, if it's fashion in terms of a treaty. So a lot of it's going to depend on the details and what is actually in it, in terms of what's required for approval.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG : Okay. So we'll wait- wait to see that. You just talked about all the frustration that Zelenskyy continues to express, and he did so with regard to this Easter ceasefire. If these two countries can't even get through a holiday ceasefire, how realistic is a 30-day-pause, not to mention the end of a war anytime soon?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: That is entirely up to Vladimir Putin. The man has never kept his word, ever in any context, as far as I'm aware. So we have to know what we're dealing with our government, I hope knows who they're dealing with, with Vladimir Putin. He's not a man of his word. He's not interested in peace. I hope he gets there. He is not all that different, Weijia, from the schoolyard bully. If you look at Russia, right? Obviously, it's huge geographically, but a population of about 150 million people, about half the size of the United States, 1/5 the size of Europe, a total GDP of $2 trillion. That's the GDP of the state of Texas. So they are large, but they're weak, and they're proving that weakness by the fact that they can't even successfully prosecute a war against a much weaker neighbor. So we got to stop, you know, being fearful or bowing down to Russia. We need to stand up to Russia. We need to defend Ukraine, support Ukraine, and if it's done the right way, this will end positively. It's all about peace through strength. There's peace through strength and there's war through weakness. There's no magical third option.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, President Trump and Secretary of State Rubio have said that the US has to figure out if a deal is doable in a matter of days, or just move on. And on Friday, I asked President Trump about this fresh sense of urgency. Here's what he said.",
      "[START SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: What do you need to see from both sides in order to keep negotiations going? What do you want to see from Russia and Ukraine?",
      "DONALD TRUMP: I have to see- my whole life has been one big negotiation, and I know when people are playing us, and I know when they're not. And I have to see an enthusiasm to want to end it.",
      "[END SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: How much of this demand, Congressman for enthusiasm, do you think it's a direct message to Russia, and how much time do these two sides have to get something done?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Well, I hope it's directed to Russia. I think it is directed to Russia. I can tell you, President Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian people. I know them well, Weijia. I have lived there as an FBI agent. I was assigned there as a- working Russian counterintelligence. They want peace. They're a peaceful nation. There are democratically elected- elected officials, including President Zelenskyy. They want peace. They did not ask for this invasion. They did not provoke this invasion. They were invaded by Vladimir Putin, who had been telegraphing this punch for years. We all knew what he was intending to do, and now he's doing it. He views the fall of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical disaster of our lifetimes, and he's trying to reconstitute it. Step one is Ukraine. We cannot allow him to do that, and what we also can't allow is for the precedent being set here that dictators are going to be rewarded for violating the territorial borders and territorial sovereignty of their neighbors. We cannot reward that. So, you know, I- I want to say this too. I think Secretary Rubio is doing a great job. He's a smart man. He understands Putin, he understands the dynamic of the- of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the history there, and I have full faith in his ability to barter a just and fair agreement. But it's important to remember, and this applies to all agreements where we facilitate as a nation, that it's ultimately up to the nations to accept and abide by those conditions. President Zelensky, the Ukrainian people desperately want peace. They've always wanted peace. They were a peaceful nation before Russia wrongfully invaded them, and they want to get it back, but it's got to be a just and lasting peace.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And very quickly, Congressman, because we have to let you go soon. But if these talks fail, the President was ambiguous about whether the Administration would continue to support Ukraine, and Speaker Johnson has earlier said that there was no appetite for additional aid. So will there be a new bill on the House floor, quickly?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I don't want to get ahead of the administration or the Speaker, but I will just leave it at this. I will do everything in my power to make sure that Ukraine wins this fight and that Russia loses, and that we have a peaceful settlement. If you look at every time the Ukraine support has been put on the House floor, overwhelming support.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Thank you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, really appreciate your time.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Austan Goolsbee, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank president, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 20, 2025.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: We turn now to the economy and the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, Austan Goolsbee, he joins us this morning from Chicago. Austan, it's great to see you this morning.",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Yeah. Thank you for having me, Weijia.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I want to talk about President Trump's tariffs plan, because last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said tariff increases were higher than expected, and the economic effects will be too, including higher inflation and slower growth. Do you agree with that assessment?",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Well, look, I'm out here. The Chicago Fed district is kind of the heart of the Midwest, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan. Folks, when I'm out talking to them, business people and civic leaders have been saying for months that they had anxiety that if the tariffs were going to be as big as- as what- what they were saying they might be in February, March, that that would have a pretty significant impact on their operations. The tariff announcement, April 2, was definitely bigger than- than what- what they had been expressing, but there's just a lot of question marks. We don't know 90 days from now, when, when they've revisited the tariffs, we just don't know how big they're going to be.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Yeah, and the administration says they have a lot of deals in the works, so we have to wait to see what those look like. Trump's former top economic adviser Gary Cohn, was on CNBC talking about what he is hearing from business executives about how they are impacting consumers right now. I want to play that- some of that for you.",
      "(BEGIN SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "GARY COHN: What everyone's worried about is June, July and August. Are we just pulling all this demand forward from the summer? Because people that were going to buy stuff naturally through the next six months are saying, Look, I'm going to save the tariff. I'm going to buy it now.",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: So, he's talking about people trying to get ahead of the tariffs in case no deals are reached in case those high numbers do get put into effect. So I wonder if you're hearing the same from your contacts in Chicago that people are trying to rush out there to buy, and how does that impact your outlook for the economy?",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Yeah, that kind of preemptive purchasing is probably even more pronounced on the business side, where in anticipation, a lot of the imports that the tariffs would apply to, especially in the auto sector, are things that are parts, components, supplies that go into the manufacturing of other products. So we heard a lot about preemptive building up of inventories that could last 60 days, 90 days, if there were going to be more uncertainty. That raises the possibility that that Gary Cohn raised there, that activity might look artificially high in the initial and then by the summer, might fall off, because people had bought it all and brought it forward. I'm still hopeful, and the people that I talked to out in the Midwest are still hopeful that on the back end of this, it would be more like what Secretary Besent said, that this could be a spark to lead to a new he called it golden age of global trade. If we can get through this, it's important to remember the hard data coming into April was pretty good, the unemployment rate around steady, full employment, inflation coming down. It's just a desire of people expressing they don't want to go back to kind of 21 and 22 at a time when inflation was- was really raging out of control.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Got it. I do want to go back to Jay Powell's remarks about the impact of tariffs, or potential impact, because they prompted President Trump to lash out by declaring \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\" Here's what the President said when reporters pressed if he has the power to remove Powell.",
      "(BEGIN SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "DONALD TRUMP: I'm not happy with him. I let him know it, and if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me.",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Now, Austan, I know the Fed does not wade into politics, and I'm not going to ask you to do that, but I wonder if statements like this undermine or complicate your job as an apolitical institution?",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Look, I'm glad you didn't ask me for legal advice, because I have an econ PhD. Don't ever ask legal advice from somebody like me. I would say, monetary independence- before I was ever at the Fed, I was a research economist at the University of Chicago. There's virtual unanimity among economists that monetary independence from political interference, that the Fed or any central bank be able to do the job that it needs to do, is really important. And they came to that not as a theory, but just by looking around the world at places where they don't have monetary independence. And the fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse. So we really- I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that- that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: All right, Austan, thank you so much for your time, and Happy Easter to you.",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Yeah, happy Easter. Great to see you, Weijia.",

    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Thursday that they had detected the most promising \"hints\" of potential life on a planet beyond our solar system, though other scientists expressed skepticism.",
      "There has been vigorous debate in scientific circles about whether the planet K2-18b, which is 124 light years away in the Leo constellation, could be an ocean world capable of hosting microbial life, at least.",
      "Using the James Webb Space Telescope, a British-U.S. team of researchers detected signs of two chemicals in the planet's atmosphere long considered to be \"biosignatures\" indicating extraterrestrial life.",
      "On Earth, the chemicals dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide are produced only by life, mostly microscopic marine algae called phytoplankton.",
      "The researchers emphasized caution, saying that more observations were needed to confirm these findings, and that they were not announcing a definitive discovery.",
      "But the implications could be huge, according to Nikku Madhusudhan, a Cambridge University astrophysicist and lead author of the study, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "Madhusudhan told BBC News that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.",
      "\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there,\" he said. \"I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"",
      "But outside experts pointed to disputes over previous discoveries about the exoplanet, adding that these chemicals could have been created by unknown means having nothing to do with life.",
      "\"Goldilocks\" zone",
      "More than eight times the mass of Earth and 2.5 times as big, K2-18b is rare among the roughly 6,000 exoplanets discovered so far in that it orbits its star in a habitable or \"goldilocks\" zone.",
      "This means it is neither too hot nor too cold to have liquid water, considered the most important ingredient for life.",
      "Telescopes observe such far-off exoplanets when they cross in front of their star, allowing astronomers to analyze how molecules block the light streaming through their atmosphere.",
      "In 2023, the Webb telescope detected methane and carbon dioxide in K2-18b's atmosphere, the first time such carbon-based molecules were detected on an exoplanet in a habitable zone.",
      "It also detected weak signals of the chemical DMS, leading astronomers to turn Webb towards the planet again a year ago, this time using its mid-infrared instrument to detect different wavelengths of light.",
      "They found much stronger signs of the chemicals, though still well below the \"five sigma\" threshold of statistical significance scientists seek for such discoveries.",
      "Even if the results are confirmed, it would not necessarily mean that the planet is home to life.",
      "Last year, scientists found traces of DMS on a comet, which suggested it can be produced in non-organic ways and is perhaps not a \"biosignature.\"",
      "However the concentration of the chemical observed on K2-18b appears to be thousands of times stronger than levels on Earth, likely suggesting a biological origin, Madhusudhan said.",
      "\"Hellishly hot\"",
      "K2-18b has long been considered the premier candidate for a \"hycean planet\" \u2014 an ocean world bigger than Earth with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.",
      "Hycean planets, much like Earth, are covered in oceans and have atmospheres rich with hydrogen, an element that is essential for life. Many of the planets are bigger and hotter than Earth \u2014 up to 2.6 times larger than our planet and reaching atmospheric temperatures up to nearly 200 degrees Celsius, or 392 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "These planets would not be expected to be home to intelligent alien life, but rather tiny microbes similar to those in Earth's oceans billions of years ago.",
      "\"Hycean planets open a whole new avenue in our search for life elsewhere,\" Madhusudhan said previously.",
      "Some research has questioned whether the currently proposed hycean planets are too close to their stars to support liquid water \u2014 including K2-18b, which orbits its star every 33 days.",
      "Raymond Pierrehumbert, a planetary physics professor at Oxford University, has conducted separate research indicating K2-18b is too hot for life.",
      "If the planet did have water, it would be \"hellishly hot\" and uninhabitable, he told AFP, adding that oceans of lava were more plausible.",
      "Sara Seager, a professor of planetary science at MIT, called for patience, pointing to previous claims of water vapor in K2-18b's atmosphere that turned out to be a different gas.",
      "Madhusudhan estimated that it would take just 16 to 24 more hours of Webb's time to reach the five-sigma threshold, which could happen in the next few years.",
      "The current three-sigma is comparable to the odds of flipping a coin 10 times and getting the same result each time, Cambridge University statistician Stephen Burgess explained.",
      "Five sigma would be getting that result after 20 flips, and would mean \"we can be very confident that this observation isn't just a chance finding,\" he said.",
      "Even beyond K2-18b, Madhusudhan said Webb and future telescopes could allow humanity to discover life outside our home planet sooner than one might think.",
      "\"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering,\" he said.",

      "The Russians then launched replacements for Pettit's crew\u00a0\u2014 Soyuz commander Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim \u2014 on April 8, clearing the way for Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit to return to Earth Saturday.",
      "In a brief ceremony Friday, Ovchinin turned command of the station over to Onishi.",
      "\"It's a great honor for me to accept the command of the ISS,\" Onishi said. \"I feel so special that I am taking over the command from you because it's been almost nine years since we met here in 2016 during Expedition 48. At that time, both of us were rookies and here we are two veterans who are ISS commanders.\"",
      "\"Human space flight is not easy. Only continuous dedication from generation to generation made it possible for human beings to get here. Now today, we have four rookies (on board). I'm sure one day they will come back and become commanders ... that's how we will continue to develop human space flight,\" Onishi said.",
      "The ISS has been continuously staffed by rotating crews since Nov. 2, 2000. Scheduled for retirement in five years, the lab is facing problems on multiple fronts, ranging from air leaks in the Russian segment to uncertain funding, spare parts shortages and resupply delays.",
      "\"Spaceflight is difficult and very risky,\" Rich Williams, a member of NASA's independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, told the group in a public meeting Thursday. \"The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence.\"",
      "\"The ISS management, crew and support personnel always make spaceflight look easy. Spaceflight is anything but easy, and the increasing risks attending the ISS program are making it harder,\" Williams said.",
      "The air leaks in the Zvezda module's aft docking compartment are presumably the results of metal fatigue and repeated pressure cycles as visiting Soyuz crew ships and Progress cargo freighters come and go.",
      "\"Primary risk mitigation activities at this point include application and patching materials to known cracks and limiting ... pressurization cycles to try to limit stress and fatigue,\" Williams said. \"The ISS program is monitoring this closely, and the panel considers this one of our highest concerns.\"",
      "NASA has hired SpaceX to build a U.S. deorbit vehicle, or USDV, to drive the million-pound space station back into the atmosphere in 2030 to ensure it breaks up over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from shipping lanes and populated areas. The USDV is expected to arrive at the lab in 2029.",
      "\"Delivering and utilizing this USDV capability is critical to ensuring that the deorbit debris risk meets the established government public safety standards,\" Williams said. \"If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the USDV is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude.\"",
      "He said NASA and Russian space officials are working \"to address the challenges associated with achieving a safe deorbit capability, both for end-of-life as well as a risk-managed deorbit for contingencies.\"",
      "The major problem facing the ISS is what Williams called \"a large ISS budget shortfall.\" NASA's fiscal 2024 budget included nearly $1 billion for station operations and maintenance with another $1.6 billion earmarked for crew launches and resupply missions.",
      "\"It is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle has safely re-entered, not only to assure safety of day-to-day operations in a high-risk environment, but also to ensure controlled, safe deorbit within debris footprint requirements for the sake of public safety,\" Williams said.",
      "In summary, he said, \"the panel appreciates the demonstrated operational excellence of the ISS program, but remains deeply concerned about the increasing and cascading risks attending the program over the next several years.\"",

    "summary": "A British-U.S. team of researchers detected signs of two chemicals in the planet's atmosphere long considered to be \"biosignatures\" indicating extraterrestrial life.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Thursday that they had detected the most promising \"hints\" of potential life on a planet beyond our solar system, though other scientists expressed skepticism.",
      "There has been vigorous debate in scientific circles about whether the planet K2-18b, which is 124 light years away in the Leo constellation, could be an ocean world capable of hosting microbial life, at least.",
      "Using the James Webb Space Telescope, a British-U.S. team of researchers detected signs of two chemicals in the planet's atmosphere long considered to be \"biosignatures\" indicating extraterrestrial life.",
      "On Earth, the chemicals dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide are produced only by life, mostly microscopic marine algae called phytoplankton.",
      "The researchers emphasized caution, saying that more observations were needed to confirm these findings, and that they were not announcing a definitive discovery.",
      "But the implications could be huge, according to Nikku Madhusudhan, a Cambridge University astrophysicist and lead author of the study, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "Madhusudhan told BBC News that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.",
      "\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there,\" he said. \"I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"",
      "But outside experts pointed to disputes over previous discoveries about the exoplanet, adding that these chemicals could have been created by unknown means having nothing to do with life.",
      "\"Goldilocks\" zone",
      "More than eight times the mass of Earth and 2.5 times as big, K2-18b is rare among the roughly 6,000 exoplanets discovered so far in that it orbits its star in a habitable or \"goldilocks\" zone.",
      "This means it is neither too hot nor too cold to have liquid water, considered the most important ingredient for life.",
      "Telescopes observe such far-off exoplanets when they cross in front of their star, allowing astronomers to analyze how molecules block the light streaming through their atmosphere.",
      "In 2023, the Webb telescope detected methane and carbon dioxide in K2-18b's atmosphere, the first time such carbon-based molecules were detected on an exoplanet in a habitable zone.",
      "It also detected weak signals of the chemical DMS, leading astronomers to turn Webb towards the planet again a year ago, this time using its mid-infrared instrument to detect different wavelengths of light.",
      "They found much stronger signs of the chemicals, though still well below the \"five sigma\" threshold of statistical significance scientists seek for such discoveries.",
      "Even if the results are confirmed, it would not necessarily mean that the planet is home to life.",
      "Last year, scientists found traces of DMS on a comet, which suggested it can be produced in non-organic ways and is perhaps not a \"biosignature.\"",
      "However the concentration of the chemical observed on K2-18b appears to be thousands of times stronger than levels on Earth, likely suggesting a biological origin, Madhusudhan said.",
      "\"Hellishly hot\"",
      "K2-18b has long been considered the premier candidate for a \"hycean planet\" \u2014 an ocean world bigger than Earth with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.",
      "Hycean planets, much like Earth, are covered in oceans and have atmospheres rich with hydrogen, an element that is essential for life. Many of the planets are bigger and hotter than Earth \u2014 up to 2.6 times larger than our planet and reaching atmospheric temperatures up to nearly 200 degrees Celsius, or 392 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "These planets would not be expected to be home to intelligent alien life, but rather tiny microbes similar to those in Earth's oceans billions of years ago.",
      "\"Hycean planets open a whole new avenue in our search for life elsewhere,\" Madhusudhan said previously.",
      "Some research has questioned whether the currently proposed hycean planets are too close to their stars to support liquid water \u2014 including K2-18b, which orbits its star every 33 days.",
      "Raymond Pierrehumbert, a planetary physics professor at Oxford University, has conducted separate research indicating K2-18b is too hot for life.",
      "If the planet did have water, it would be \"hellishly hot\" and uninhabitable, he told AFP, adding that oceans of lava were more plausible.",
      "Sara Seager, a professor of planetary science at MIT, called for patience, pointing to previous claims of water vapor in K2-18b's atmosphere that turned out to be a different gas.",
      "Madhusudhan estimated that it would take just 16 to 24 more hours of Webb's time to reach the five-sigma threshold, which could happen in the next few years.",
      "The current three-sigma is comparable to the odds of flipping a coin 10 times and getting the same result each time, Cambridge University statistician Stephen Burgess explained.",
      "Five sigma would be getting that result after 20 flips, and would mean \"we can be very confident that this observation isn't just a chance finding,\" he said.",
      "Even beyond K2-18b, Madhusudhan said Webb and future telescopes could allow humanity to discover life outside our home planet sooner than one might think.",
      "\"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 16:18:00 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. Department of Justice attorneys are seeking to impose sweeping penalties on Google after a court ruled the tech giant is a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "A hearing kicked off today in Washington, D.C., that could determine whether Google remains in its current form, or if it could face penalties such as selling off its popular Chrome web browser.",
      "The so-called remedy hearing is the consequence of a court ruling last August that found Google is operating a monopoly and uses its dominant market position to crush rivals and put a lid on innovation.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is arguing that Google should be forced to divest its Chrome browser, which the agency describes as \"one of the largest entry points that exists for searches.\" By selling Chrome, rivals could have a chance to compete for search queries, the government argues, but such a change would drastically reshape Google's parent, Alphabet, a tech giant with a $1.8 trillion market valuation.",
      "\"Google can compete, but they simply don't want to compete on a level playing field,\" Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist said on Monday during his opening before the court. \"Google is now fearful of competing against rivals who will only get stronger with the proposed remedies in place.\"",
      "The hearing comes just days after Google was branded an abusive monopolist in a separate case that ruled the tech giant had illegally exploited some of its online marketing technology to boost profits. The more recent case focused on Google's online advertising business, which has been built around its search engine and other widely used products, including Chrome and YouTube.",
      "Here's what to know about the current remedy hearing.",
      "What is the Google hearing about?",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that Google has illegally exploited its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.",
      "The current hearing is aimed at addressing potential remedies, with Mehta expected to issue a decision by August 2025, according to a November research note from Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan.",
      "\"We are not here to relitigate the case, we are here to ask the court to fix the harm from Google's unlawful conduct,\" said Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater in a Monday statement before the hearing's opening arguments.",
      "What does the Justice Department want?",
      "The Justice Department is pushing for several changes, Dahlquist said on Monday during the trial.",
      "They include:",
      "Forcing Google to divest the Chrome browser;Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",
      "Forcing Google to divest the Chrome browser;",
      "Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;",
      "Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",
      "Some of the changes sought by the DOJ would last for years, with Sheridan noting that the requirements would \"include Google enabling ongoing access to its search index, making available user and ads search data (for up to 10 years), syndicating its search text ads data for up to 1 year and syndicating its search results, ranking signals & query understanding information (for queries originated in the U.S.) for up to 10 years.\"",
      "What would happen to Chrome?",
      "Jon Sallet, representing a group of states that joined the Justice Department in the case, said in his opening statements that his first priority is the divestiture of Chrome.",
      "Chrome is a \"massively attractive asset\" with over 4.1 billion global users, he added. \"This kind of asset doesn't come up very often.\"",
      "Divestitures can happen in a number of ways, such as a spinoff or sale of a business unit. In some cases, the existing shareholders of a company \u2014 in this case, Google parent Alphabet \u2014 receive new shares in the divested business.",
      "AT&T may be one of the best-known companies to have been broken apart after being accused of operating a monopoly. The phone giant split into several smaller companies as part of a 1982 settlement with the U.S. government, leading to the creation of several smaller regional phone operators, such as Bell South and Bell Atlantic.",
      "Splitting off Chrome would likely deliver a financial hit to Google's revenue, Goldman's Sheridan added. It would not only limit Google Search revenue, but would also restrict search query volume and access to user data, he noted.",
      "What is Google's response to the DOJ?",
      "Google attacked the government's proposed antitrust remedies, with its lead attorney, John Schmidtlein, calling them \"fundamentally flawed\" and arguing that they would unfairly penalize the company for its innovation.",
      "\"Google earned its market position through hard work and ingenuity,\" Schmidtlein said.",
      "A divestiture of Chrome would be \"far from simple,\" he said, noting that the remedy would go beyond the browser to include the open-source Chromium project Google created and has supported for years.",
      "\"The decree demands not only Chrome but also everything critical to Chromium's functionality,\" Schmidtlein said. \"What does that even mean? They're leaving it up to a technical committee, but there's no clarity on what constitutes necessary assets.\"",
      "He criticized the process, saying it lacks a clear path for evaluating potential buyers, and warned that Google would effectively be barred from the browser market for 10 years. \"I can't think of an antitrust remedy that approaches this,\" he added.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The ruling involving Google's online ad technology follows a similar case last year in which Google's search engine was declared a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Google has been branded an abusive monopolist by a federal judge for the second time in less than a year, this time for illegally exploiting some of its online marketing technology to boost the profits fueling an internet empire currently worth $1.8 trillion.",
      "The ruling issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia comes on the heels of a separate decision in August that concluded Google's namesake search engine has been illegally leveraging its dominance to stifle competition and innovation.",
      "After the U.S. Justice Department targeted Google's ubiquitous search engine during President Donald Trump's first administration, the same agency went after the company's lucrative digital advertising network in 2023 during President Joe Biden's ensuing administration in an attempt to undercut the power that Google has amassed since its inception in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Although antitrust regulators prevailed both times, the battle is likely to continue for several more years as Google tries to overturn the two monopoly decisions in appeals while forging ahead in the new and highly lucrative technological frontier of artificial intelligence.",
      "The next step in the latest case is a penalty phase that will likely begin late this year or early next year. The same so-called remedy hearings in the search monopoly case are scheduled to begin Monday in Washington D.C., where Justice Department lawyers will try to convince U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to impose a sweeping punishment that includes a proposed requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Brinkema's 115-page decision centers on the marketing machine that Google has spent the past 17 years building around its search engine and other widely used products and services, including its Chrome browser, YouTube video site and digital maps.",
      "The system was largely built around a series of acquisitions that started with Google's $3.2 billion purchase of online ad specialist DoubleClick in 2008. U.S. regulators approved the deals at the time they were made before realizing that they had given the Mountain View, California, company a platform to manipulate the prices in an ecosystem that a wide range of websites depend on for revenue and provides a vital marketing connection to consumers.",
      "The Justice Department lawyers argued that Google built and maintained dominant market positions in a technology trifecta used by website publishers to sell ad space on their webpages, as well as the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of consumers, and the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions in fractions of a second to match buyer and seller.",
      "After evaluating the evidence presented during a lengthy trial that\u00a0concluded just before Thanksgiving last year,\u00a0Brinkema reached a decision that rejected the Justice Department's assertions that Google has been mistreating advertisers while concluding the company has been abusing its power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers forced to rely on its network for revenue.",
      "\"For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.\" Brinkema wrote. \"Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anticompetitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features.\"",
      "Despite that rebuke, Brinkema also concluded that Google didn't break the law when it snapped Doubleclick nor when it followed up that deal a few years later by buying another service, Admeld.",
      "The Justice Department \"failed to show that the DoubleClick and Admeld acquisitions were anticompetitive,\" Brinkema wrote. \"Although these acquisitions helped Google gain monopoly power in two adjacent ad tech markets, they are insufficient, when viewed in isolation, to prove that Google acquired or maintained this monopoly power through exclusionary practices.\"",
      "That finding may help Google fight off any attempt to force it to sell its advertising technology to stop its monopolistic behavior.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"We disagree with the Court's decision regarding our publisher tools,\" said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \"Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\"",
      "Analysts such as Brian Pitz of BMO Markets had been predicting that Google would likely lose the case, helping to brace investors for the latest setback to the company and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., whose shares declined 1% in afternoon trading. Alphabet's stock has plunged by 20% so far this year.",
      "As it did in the search monopoly case, Google and its corporate parent Alphabet vehemently denied the Justice Department's allegations. Their lawyers argued the government largely based its case on an antiquated concept of a market that existed a decade ago while underestimating a highly competitive market for advertising spending that includes the likes of Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Comcast.",
      "The market as drawn in the Justice Department's case didn't include ads that appear on mobile apps, streaming television services, or other platforms to which internet users have increasingly migrated, prompting Google lawyer Karen Dunn to compare the government's definition a \"time capsule with a BlackBerry, an iPod and a Blockbuster video card\" during her opening statement\u00a0when the trial began last September.",
      "At trial, the Justice Department's lawyers emphasized the harm to news publishers that has arisen from Google's alleged dominance of the marketplace. Witnesses from Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and other newspapers, and News Corp., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, testified about the difficulties they have faced and what they said was a lack of alternatives to Google's ad tech. Those companies rely on online advertising to fund their news operations and make their articles free to consumers on the internet, government lawyers have argued.",
      "Now, government is in position to try to dismantle that byzantine ad system. When the case was filed more than two years ago during the Biden administration, the Justice Department asserted Google should be forced to sell, at a minimum, its Ad Manager product, which includes the technology used by website publishers and the ad exchange.",

      "Brown was found dead in her home on Oct. 23, 2010, after her employer became concerned when she did not show up for work. She had been stabbed and her throat was cut, prosecutors said.",
      "After Osgood was convicted in 2014 and sentenced to death, an appeals court threw out the sentence, ruling that a judge gave improper instructions to jurors. But as a new sentencing hearing began, Osgood asked for another death sentence.",
      "\"I knew they were going to come back with death. I didn't want her family and my family to relive all that, just for the same thing. Why put them through that?\"",
      "Osgood has struggled to explain what he did. He said he had been drinking for 36 to 48 hours before the crime, but he said alcohol was not to blame for what he did. Asked what he would say to young people, Osgood said it would be don't do anything to someone they wouldn't want done to themselves.",
      "Osgood ended up spending more than a decade on death row. He decided early on that he would let his appeals go for 10 years, but no longer. He also wanted to explore being a bone marrow donor for his sister, but then she chose other treatments, and Osgood figured the prison wouldn't allow him to donate anyway. He dropped his appeals last summer, and asked for an execution date.",
      "\"I no longer feel as if I'm even existing. I'm tired. I want to complete my sentence,\" Osgood wrote to his attorney.",
      "Osgood said he thinks more death row inmates are thinking about dropping their appeals, because life without parole is scarier than death.",

      "The food dye industry denied that there was a safety concern with artificial dyes, citing past reviews by the FDA and other international authorities, and said that their use is \"essential for consistency, visual appeal, and consumer trust in food products.\"",
      "\"Requiring reformulation by the end of 2026 ignores scientific evidence and underestimates the complexity of food production. The process is neither simple nor immediate, and the resulting supply disruptions will limit access to familiar, affordable grocery items,\" the International Association of Color Manufacturers said in a statement after the announcement.",
      "The group representing milk, cheese and yogurt manufacturers, the International Dairy Foods Association, announced a \"voluntary\" pledge for some of its members stop adding artificial colors to producs supplied to school lunches.",
      "The National Confectioners Association, which represents candy brands, was noncommittal in\u00a0their response, saying that they \"look forward to working with the Trump Administration and Congress on this issue.\"",
      "A\u00a0statement from the Consumer Brands Association, which represents industry giants from Coca-Cola to WK Kellogg, also stopped short of pledging to remove all synthetic dyes by 2026, but said they \"appreciate that the administration has reasserted their leadership\" in response to a patchwork of state laws.",
      "\"Removing these safe ingredients does not change the consumer packaged goods industry's commitment to providing safe, affordable and convenient product choices to consumers,\" the association said.",
      "Why Makary opposes synthetic dyes",
      "Ending the use of artificial dyes has long been a goal of Kennedy's agenda, over concerns that these colors are inflating the consumption of unhealthy foods and raising the risk of potentially worrying behavioral changes in children, among other risks.",
      "\"Why are we taking a gamble? Parents, moms and dads have also tried to raise attention to this issue. Some parents have observed that these chemicals cause hyperactivity and even aggressive behavior, and that it subsides when the chemicals are removed from the diet,\" said Makary.",
      "Makary said that the scientific community \"has conducted a number of studies raising concerns about the correlation\" between synthetic dyes derived from petroleum and health conditions like ADHD, obesity, stomach or digestive issues and allergies.",
      "\"Other studies have found that artificial colors that create vibrant colors mess with the child's developing brain to make ultra-processed foods more attractive, even when the child already feels full,\" said Makary.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the FDA moved to revoke the authorization for one synthetic dye, Red 3, after studies suggested that the color additive could cause cancer in laboratory animals at high doses.",
      "The food and drug industry has a few years to stop using the food dye completely. Makary said they are asking companies to stop using the dye sooner than the deadlines laid out by the agency under the law, which are as late as 2028 for drugmakers.",
      "While FDA officials at the time said the way that Red 3 caused cancer in animals did not apply to humans, officials said their hands were tied by a law called the Delaney Clause that required them to pull any additives from the market shown to cause cancer in animals.",
      "The agency has faced calls for years to pull other synthetic food dyes derived from petroleum like Red 40, which is largely absent from food in some other countries.",
      "Pressure on the agency has stepped up in recent years, after an influential report by California authorities\u00a0 in 2021 concluded that synthetic food dyes \"can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children.\" A handful of states have now moved to ban the use of these synthetic food dyes in school meal programs.",
      "For years in Europe, companies adding Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes have also had to add a warning label to their products saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "However, FDA officials had previously said that the data was a far cry from being enough to merit banning the dyes. The agency also closely oversees the production of synthetic food dyes, checking for impurities that might result in a safety risk.",
      "Makary said Tuesday's announcement calling for food companies to stop using the artificial dyes \"fulfills the administration's promise to use both gold-standard science and common sense.\"",
      "\"For the last 50 years, we have been running one of the largest uncontrolled scientific experiments in the world, on our nation's children, without their consent,\" said Makary.",

    "summary": "Allianz survey finds that nearly two-thirds of Americans are more worried about running out of money in retirement than they are about dying.",
    "story": [
      "Faced with inflation, taxes and concerns over the size of Social Security benefits, most Americans are more afraid of going broke in retirement than they are of death.",
      "That's according to a new study from Allianz Life that surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults aged 25 years and older with annual incomes of $50,000 and above. In total, 64% of respondents across generations said they are more stressed about running out of funds in their golden years than the prospect of death.",
      "\"It's much higher right now than it has been for quite a while,\" said Kelly LaVigne, VP of consumer insights at Allianz Life. The company has been polling people on the question of whether dying or running out of money worries them more since 2022.",
      "Americans say they need $1.26 million to finance a comfortable retirement, according to a\u00a0recent study by Northwestern Mutual. That's $200,000 lower than last year's estimate, but still a far cry from the median amount of $87,000 people have saved in their retirement accounts, according to Federal Reserve Board's\u00a0Survey of Consumer Finances.",
      "Among the different age groups, Gen Xers, for whom retirement is fast approaching, are the most concerned about running out of money before they die. Seventy percent of the age group expressed concern, followed by 61% of boomers. Ages 61 to 79, boomers are already in their retirement era, while Gen Xers, ages 45 to 60, will be the next generation to retire.",
      "\"Certainly for boomers who are already in retirement, inflation is a big deal because you only have a certain amount of money that you're going to have for the rest of your life,\" said LaVigne.",
      "Tough time to save money",
      "Though Inflation rates have eased since peaking in June 2022, the cost of basic living expenses\u00a0is still rising, making it difficult for Americans to sock away extra savings. Over 50% of those surveyed by Allianz said high inflation contributed to their fear of running out of money in retirement.",
      "Other factors contributing to Americans' fears include high taxes and concern over whether monthly Social Security payments will provide them with enough financial support. For the average American, Social Security benefits typically replaces about 40% of their income, LaVigne said.",
      "Recent shake-ups at the Social Security Administration carried out by the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also stoked fears about the stability of the government agency.",
      "LaVigne's advice for distressed savers: Don't let fear stop you from seeking help. \"You really want to make sure that you're working with a professional to help you get through the times like this, where there's a lot of uncertainty,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "In less than a month, Americans and permanent residents will only be able to pass through airport security or enter a federal government building if they have a Real ID. Most states are not yet fully compliant, though they've had nearly 20 years to prepare for this deadline.",
      "A CBS News data analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that at least 17 states are less than 50% compliant with the law, which goes into effect May 7. The Transportation Security Administration currently plans to treat that date as an \"all hands on deck\" day because of the looming potential for disruptions at airport checkpoints. The chart below the article lists the states and their compliance so far with the Real ID requirement.",
      "The Real ID is an enhanced ID card issued by state drivers license agencies. To obtain one, people are required to show a valid ID, as well as proof of identity, such as a passport or certified birth certificate, proof of a Social Security number and date of birth, plus two documents showing state residency, including a utility bill, credit card statement or rental agreement.",
      "So far, 30 states are less than 70% compliant. That means that in more than half the country, as many as three in every 10 travelers may not be able to pass through an airport checkpoint in just a few weeks.",
      "As of last week, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation \u2014 just 17% of its state-issued IDs are Real IDs. Pennsylvania reported 26%, while Washington and Maine tell CBS News they are at 27% compliance. New York reports 43% compliance, and California has reached nearly 55% compliance.",
      "CBS News recently traveled to a Real ID Super Center in Chicago with a line extending out the door. In Illinois, two out of three residents lack a Real ID, which prompted the state to open the downtown location in an old Walgreens, aiming to process up to 1,500 new IDs a day as it tries to catch up with surging demand.\u00a0 States mail the new IDs, however, so it can take up to two weeks to receive the new credential (a temporary paper license will not be considered a Real ID).",
      "Twelve states and the District of Columbia reported compliance rates above 90%, with seven states \u2014 Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wyoming and the District of Columbia \u2014 saying they're virtually 100% compliant. Texas reports 98% compliance, Mississippi 97%, Hawaii 96%, Utah 96% and Vermont 92%.",
      "TSA says it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints \u2014 meaning passengers are showing up with either a Real ID-compliant driver's license or state ID, a passport, a valid military ID, an \"enhanced\" ID issued by a handful of states or other valid identification.",
      "Earlier this month, TSA told CBS News that on May 7, when travellers show up at a TSA checkpoint with a non-compliant legacy ID, they will be subject to additional screening. TSA officers will utilize a secondary identity verification process, similar to the one used when someone's ID is stolen or lost while traveling, to verify identity. But this can be a time-consuming process, so legacy ID holders should plan to be at the airport at least three hours before departure, instead of the usual two hours for a domestic flight. If the secondary identification verification fails, the traveler will not be allowed to enter the security checkpoint or the gate area. The agency had previously indicated there would be a phased enforcement policy.",
      "\"People will experience travel delays,\" TSA spokesperson Patricia Mancha told CBS News in a recent interview at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. \"People have had years to really plan for this, so TSA will simply enforce the laws and the rules as they apply.\"",
      "The Real ID law was passed in 2005, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, to try to make state-issued identification more secure and harder to counterfeit. The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, most recently because of the pandemic. Several fully compliant states began issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009, enabling all residents to obtain a compliant ID when they renewed an existing license.",
      "\"Any new issuance of driver's license, you had to prove your identity and lawful presence back in 2009,\" said Electra Bustle, the senior director of the Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles. She says the deadline delays helped the Centennial State to be ready for the May 7 deadline. \"We have a 10-year renewal cycle before you have to get a new photograph. You can see that moving it allowed us to ensure that we're at 100% of those who are eligible to be now \u2014 to have Real IDS.\"",
      "A Real ID can be identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner of the ID. Sometimes the star appears in a circle, while California puts its star symbol inside a golden bear.",
      "Not everyone needs a Real ID. If you don't fly or enter federal government buildings, a legacy ID will continue to be valid until its expiration date.",
      "States continue to process Real ID applications, so compliance numbers will continue to change, and CBS News will update these figures before the May 7 deadline.",

      "Owens' departure comes as President Trump is suing the network, alleging that \"60 Minutes\" intentionally misled the public in editing an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris about her candidacy for president. The network aired two different portions of Harris's response to the same question about the conflict in the Middle East \u2014 one in an early excerpt on \"Face the Nation\" and the other on the \"60 Minutes\" full broadcast.",
      "Mr. Trump initially demanded $10 billion in damages when he filed the lawsuit in October, then upped the demand to $20 billion in February. His lawsuit claimed that millions of Americans \"were confused and misled by the two doctored Interview versions.\" Constitutional law experts say the lawsuit is \"frivolous\" and an infringement on First Amendment rights.",
      "CBS News, which filed motions to dismiss the complaint in March, repeatedly refuted Mr. Trump's claims. In a statement released when Mr. Trump first filed suit, \"60 Minutes\" explained: \"Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the response. When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point.\"",
      "The New York Times reported earlier this month that CBS News' parent company, Paramount, and Mr. Trump's legal team had selected a mediator to try to reach a settlement.",
      "In a note to staffers today, Owens wrote, \"Over the past months, it has also become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it. To make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience.\u00a0 So, having defended this show \u2014 and what we stand for \u2014 from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward.\"",
      "\"The show is too important to the country, it has to continue, just not with me as the Executive Producer,\" he wrote.",
      "Wendy McMahon, the president and CEO of CBS News & Stations and CBS Media Ventures, said in an email announcing the decision that \"Bill has led 60 Minutes with unwavering integrity, curiosity, and a deep commitment to the truth. He has championed the kind of journalism that informs, enlightens, and often changes the national conversation.\"",
      "In recent months, Mr. Trump has continued to lash out at CBS News and \"60 Minutes,\" posting on Truth Social in April that he was \"honored\" to be suing the network and its parent company, Paramount. He also wrote that he hoped Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr would \"impose the maximum fines and punishment\" against CBS as the FCC investigates a complaint from a conservative group which alleged the Harris interview amounted to news distortion. CBS has denied that claim.",
      "Paramount is also awaiting FCC approval of a merger with Skydance, a deal the companies reached last year that remains pending.",
      "Owens began his career at CBS News as an intern in 1988. His many roles at the network span the assignment desk, the White House beat, where he served as senior producer, and \"CBS Evening News,\" where he was senior broadcast producer.",
      "Owens was named executive producer of \"60 Minutes\" in 2019 after 12 years supervising the broadcast's content in senior roles. He is just one of three \"60 Minutes\" executive producers in the show's 57-year history.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A sharply divided Supreme Court appeared likely to require a Maryland school board provide parents with the ability to opt their elementary school-age children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "At issue in the court fight between a group of families and the Montgomery County Board of Education is whether public schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment right to exercise their religion freely when they require children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality that violate the families' religious beliefs.",
      "After more than two hours of arguments, the court's conservative majority seemed ready to side with the families.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who lives in Montgomery County, Maryland, invoked the state's founding and said the county in particular has been a \"beacon\" of religious liberty and tolerance. He told Alan Schoenfeld, who argued for the school board, he was \"surprised\" given that history that \"this is the hill we're going to die on in terms of not respecting religious liberty.\"",
      "\"What is the big deal about allowing them to opt-out of this?\" Justice Samuel Alito asked, noting that the county allows parents to request their children be excused from other areas of instruction, such as sexual education or Halloween or Valentine's Day celebrations. \"What is infeasible about doing that?\"",
      "Kavanaugh echoed Alito, saying, \"I'm not understanding why it's not feasible\" for schools to excuse children from instruction that violate their families' religious beliefs.",
      "Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia allow for parental opt-outs or require opt-ins before students participate in sex education. Montgomery County, home to Maryland's largest public school system with more than 160,000 students, also had an opt-out policy for parents with religious objections to classroom instruction or activities so long as the requests did not become \"too frequent or burdensome,\" according to court papers.",
      "After Maryland enacted rules seeking to promote \"educational equity,\" the Montgomery County Education Board introduced \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks for elementary school students into its English Language Arts curriculum. The district said it supplemented its language arts books with a handful of stories \"in order to better represent all Montgomery County families.\" Among the five books incorporated, which are at issue in the case, were \"Born Ready,\" about a transgender elementary-aged child, and \"Prince & Knight,\" about a prince who falls in with and marries a knight.",
      "Several of the justices acknowledged that they had read the picture books that were included in the curriculum, and Alito at one point even read from one, \"Uncle Bobby's Wedding,\" which discusses gay marriage.",
      "The board adopted the lessons in 2022, but allowed parents to opt their children out of reading and instruction involving the storybooks. But in March 2023, the Montgomery County school board announced that families would no longer receive advanced notice of when the books would be read and would not be able to have their kids excused from the instruction.",
      "The board said in court filings that the opt-outs had become \"unworkable,\" as some schools had high numbers of absences, and all faced \"substantial hurdles\" in using the books while honoring opt-out requests, as teachers would have to manage the removal of excused students from class and plan alternative activities for them.",
      "That decision, however, sparked backlash within the community \u2014 more than 1,000 parents signed a petition that called on the board to restore the notice and opt-outs, and dozens protested the books at board meetings as violating their religious beliefs. The school board then revised its Religious Diversity Guidelines to limit the circumstances when students can be excused to noncurricular activities or free-time events that conflict with their family's religious practices.",
      "A group of three families filed a lawsuit against the Montgomery County Board of Education, arguing that denial of the notice and opt-outs violated their right to exercise their religion freely under the First Amendment because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children. The families \u2014 who are Muslim, Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox\u00a0 \u2014 sought a preliminary injunction that would've required the school board to provide advance notice and the chance to opt their children out of instruction that involved the books.",
      "But a federal district judge in Maryland denied the request, finding that the no-opt-out policy did not burden the families' religious exercise. The parents' inability to excuse their children from instruction with the storybooks doesn't coerce them into violating their religious beliefs, the court found, as they can still teach their kids about their convictions regarding sexuality, marriage and gender.",
      "A divided panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit also found that there was no burden on the families' free exercise of religion because there was no evidence they were compelled to change their religious beliefs or conduct.",
      "The families asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, and the high court in January agreed to do so. The Trump administration is backing the parents in the case, arguing that the board burdened parents' religious exercise by forcing them to choose between violating their religious beliefs or forgoing public education.",
      "In filings\u00a0with the high court, lawyers for the parents also said that Montgomery County is presenting them with an \"impossible\" choice.",
      "The parents, they said, \"must subject their children to instruction intended to disrupt their religious beliefs or forgo the benefits of a public education at the sizeable cost of either paying for private school, homeschooling, or facing government fines and penalties.\"",
      "Additionally, they argued that suspending the notice and opt-outs created \"topsy-turvy categorizations\" in which a 14-year-old can be excused from instruction on gender and sexuality during sex education, but a 4-year-old has to sit through similar instruction as part of the English Language Arts curriculum.",
      "Eric Baxter, who argued on behalf of the families, told the justices that Montgomery County is an \"extreme outlier\" for declining to allow parents to excuse their children despite their religious objections to the content. He said the instruction featuring the books with LGBTQ-themes was \"clearly indoctrinating\" students.",
      "The families also said that at least one member of the board demonstrated religious hostility toward them, claiming they likened them to \"white supremacists\" and \"xenophobes.\"",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly raised the comments, and asked Shoenfeld if they \"suggest a hostility toward religion.\"",
      "Shoenfeld said the remarks were taken out of context but acknowledged they were \"intemperate.\"",
      "Kavanaugh said that as a lifelong resident of Montgomery County, he was \"mystified\" by what led the county to eventually end the opt-outs, and said it \"stands alone\" both with the types of books added to the curriculum for young students and in not allowing parents to opt their children out of the instruction.",
      "The school system has said that its teachers were expressly forbidden from using the books to pressure students to change their religious beliefs, and argued that while it tried to accommodate parents' requests to opt their children out of the instruction, doing so eventually became \"unworkably disruptive.\"",
      "Lawyers for the school district also argued that exposure to content that parents object to on religious grounds is not the same as impermissibly coercing students to disavow their religious practices.",
      "The parents, they said, didn't put forward any evidence that their children were penalized for their religious beliefs, were asked to affirm views contrary to their faith, or were prohibited from engaging in religious practice. Schoenfeld told the justices that the books sought to \"foster mutual respect in a pluralistic community.\"",
      "It was unclear whether the court would adopt a firm rule that specifies when certain public-school instruction crosses the line from mere exposure to objectionable content into impermissible coercion of students. The justices raised several examples to discern the point at which the right to free exercise of religion would be burdened.",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned whether a parent could request an opt-out for their child whose teacher shows photos from their same-sex wedding or talks about it, or whether a teacher would have to notify a parent if their child had a transgender classmate.",
      "\"This is not just about books,\" she said. \"This is about exposure to people of different sexual orientations and the objection, the sincerely held objection, that children shouldn't be exposed to this?\"",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned Baxter on whether the families were objecting to the \"exposure to the ideas\" portrayed in the books and asked whether they would be pursuing their claim if the storybooks were just on the shelf at the library, rather than incorporated into instruction.",
      "Baxter said his clients would be making the same claim based on their religious beliefs if the picturebooks were just on the shelves.",
      "The school board has warned that accepting the parents' argument that the no-opt-out policy burdened their religious exercise could have harmful effects for public education as a whole.",
      "\"Crediting petitioners' burden theory would not only contravene constitutional text, history, and precedent, but also \u2014 as courts have long recognized \u2014 'leave public education in shreds' by entitling parents to pick and choose which aspects of the curriculum will be taught to their children,\" they wrote in court papers.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union also said that under the parents' assertions, public school families could request exemptions from an array of curricular requirements because of their religious beliefs, including objecting to lessons on major historical figures who are LGBTQ.",
      "\"In sum, requiring public schools to exempt students from secular instruction that they or their parents may find objectionable for religious reasons could throw public schools into disarray, effectively 4 forcing them to tailor their educational materials to align with the religious beliefs of individual students and/or their parents,\" ACLU lawyers wrote in a filing.",

    "summary": "President Trump said he isn't planning on firing Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after calling Powell a \"major loser.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he has \"no intention of firing\"\u00a0Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after the president called Powell a \"major loser\" and publicly lobbied the central bank chief to lower interest rates at a faster clip.",
      "When asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he has any plans to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said he \"never did\" and claimed \"the press runs away with things\" \u2014 though he once again pressed Powell to cut interest rates, which remain elevated after the Fed hiked rates to quell inflation.",
      "\"This is a perfect time to lower interest rates,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If he doesn't, is it the end? No, it's not. But it would be good timing.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump argued in a social media post that Powell is \"always TOO LATE AND WRONG,\" and said his \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" drawing speculation that the president could try to oust Powell before his four-year term ends next year.",
      "Powell has led the Fed since 2018, after Mr. Trump initially nominated him for the job. Former President Joe Biden nominated Powell for a second term, bringing his time atop the central bank to at least May 2026.",
      "It's not clear if Mr. Trump has the power to fire Powell. According to federal law and past legal precedent, members of the Federal Reserve board \u2014 which includes the chair \u2014 can only be removed from their jobs before their terms expire \"for cause.\" However, the Trump administration has argued it has the legal right to fire members of other independent federal agencies, setting up a court fight over the issue that could have broad consequences.",
      "The administration will \"study\" whether it has the right to fire Powell, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told reporters last week.",
      "For his part, Powell\u00a0said last year he will not step down if Mr. Trump asks him to leave his job.",
      "Why is Trump criticizing Powell \u2014 and why does it matter?",
      "Mr. Trump's feud with Powell revolves around the Fed's decision to leave interest rates steady so far this year, after lowering rates from a decades-long high in late 2024. The decision has broad implications. Cutting interest rates can lead to higher economic growth and lower borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which is why Mr. Trump is lobbying for cuts. But lower rates can also boost inflation. And while the inflation rate is now well below its 2022 peak, it remains above the Fed's 2% year-over-year benchmark.",
      "Powell has cited \"uncertainty\" for the Fed's decision to pause rate cuts. Last week, Powell warned\u00a0that Mr. Trump's steep tariffs on foreign imports could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, posing a \"challenging scenario\" for the central bank.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump repeatedly lashed out at Powell on social media, calling him \"Mr. Too Late\" on Monday and arguing the Federal Reserve should slash rates more aggressively because there is \"virtually No Inflation.\"",
      "The showdown \u2014 and the possibility Mr. Trump could try to fire Powell \u2014 have sparked concerns about whether the Federal Reserve will maintain its independence, allowing it to make decisions about economic policy without political influence. Stocks slumped Monday amid concerns about upheaval at the Fed, before rebounding Tuesday.",
      "In an interview Sunday with \"Face the Nation,\" Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, warned that a loss of independence would \"undermine the credibility of the Fed.\" Countries without independent central banks typically have worse inflation, slower economic growth and more sluggish job markets, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday the president \"has the right to express...his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\" Leavitt also said Mr. Trump believes the Fed has \"been making moves and taking action in the name of politics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at Powell for years. The president sharply criticized Powell when the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, before calling the central banker his \"most improved player\" after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted steep rate cuts in 2020.",

    "story": [
      "A town hall hosted by Rep. Byron Donalds turned chaotic Tuesday, with audience members repeatedly interrupting the Florida Republican, leading authorities to remove two people \u2014 the latest raucous town hall dominated by protests against President Trump's administration.",
      "Donalds, a three-term congressman running in next year's Florida gubernatorial race, was asked a litany of often-testy questions, several of which focused on billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Audience members booed or cheered \u2014 and, in some cases, angrily left early \u2014 throughout the almost two-hour event at Estero High School in southwest Florida. Donalds occasionally verbally sparred with the protesters.",
      "Two people appeared to be escorted out by the local sheriff's department after yelling pro-Palestinian sentiments while Donalds answered a question about the Israel-Hamas war. During one incident, Donalds said he would have a protester removed if she kept interrupting. \"Let's have a disagreement. But when you're going to stand and yell and disrespect everybody in this room because you think you're being heard, and let's be clear, you're not,\" he said.",
      "Two back-to-back ejections after the crowd goes back and forth with @ByronDonalds on the Israel-Hamas war. The first two removed shouted \u201cfree Palestine\u201d on their way out. pic.twitter.com/SAiXRssOx0",
      "Donalds told reporters after the event he plans on holding more town halls, but he said the interruptions \"got out of hand,\" calling some of them \"rude\" and \"disrespectful\" to other attendees.",
      "\"I could kind of tell from the first question or two what kind of night it was going to be. But you know, that's alright. It's part of the business,\" Donalds told reporters.",
      "The interruptions began quickly. Minutes into the event, a staff member read a pre-submitted question about whether Donalds supports congressional oversight of DOGE. Donalds defended Musk's cost-cutting efforts and said lawmakers are \"letting DOGE complete its work,\" leading some audience members to groan and boo \u2014 though others appeared to cheer Donalds on.",
      "Donalds was also heckled during questions about immigration, gun control measures, DOGE's work in the Social Security Administration, tariffs and diversity programs. He broadly defended Trump administration policies, drawing boos in many cases.",
      "The lawmaker pushed back on protesters in some cases, asking them questions about Biden- and Obama-era programs and arguing critics were not being \"intellectually honest.\" At other points, he encouraged people to \"relax\" and stop heckling: \"You can yell or you can hear,\" he said during an exchange about the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"Is anybody finding this informative?\" Donalds asked the crowd at one point, drawing a mixture of cheers and jeers. \"60-40? That'll work.\"",
      "Donalds is seeking to replace term-limited Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A staunch Trump ally, the congressman earned the president's endorsement in February, before Donalds formally launched his gubernatorial campaign.",
      "Monday's event was the latest congressional town hall to get chaotic. Members of both parties have faced adversarial crowds in recent weeks, with protesters often pushing back against Mr. Trump and Musk. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was repeatedly interrupted by protests at a meeting in the Georgia Republican's home district last Tuesday, with police arresting three demonstrators \u2014 two of whom were tased at the scene. That same evening, a town hall hosted by Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, was also derailed by angry constituents.",
      "Some lawmakers have shied away from hosting in-person events, in some cases shifting to virtual meetings with voters instead. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, suggested last month GOP lawmakers should reconsider in-person town halls, saying members of his caucus should communicate with their constituents but \"there are other avenues to do it than just going in to try to give the other side sound bites.\"",
      "Donalds said last month he plans to continue holding town halls, brushing off plans to protest the events in an interview with Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle.\"",
      "\"Quite frankly, I don't care what they do,\" Donalds said. \"I would tell any Democrat that wants to come out there and astroturf my town hall, bring it, because we're going to talk the truth. We're going to talk about what's really going on. I'm not afraid of you.\"",

      "Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to a prison in El Salvador, say the government has failed to provide appropriate responses to a judge's order for expedited discovery and to her questions about facilitating his return to the U.S.",
      "In a letter addressed to U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis, Abrego Garcia's lawyers requested a hearing to be scheduled Wednesday \"to address the government's failure to comply\" with Xinis' order for expedited discovery in the case.",
      "Xinis on Tuesday issued a scathing order denying the Justice Department's objection to some of the discovery in the case, accusing the department of \"continued mischaracterization of the Supreme Court's Order,\" to return Abrego Garcia and writing the \"defendants' objection reflects a willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\"",
      "Xinis also denied a Justice Deparmtnet claim that it does not need to commit to answering questions brought by Abrego Garcia's lawyers and can instead claim privilege over the answers.",
      "\"For weeks, Defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this Court's orders. Defendants have known, at least since last week, that this Court requires specific legal and factual showings to support any claim of privilege,\" Xinis wrote.",
      "\"Yet they have continued to rely on boilerplate assertions. That ends now. If Defendants want to preserve their privilege claims, they must support them with the required detail. Otherwise, they will lose the protections they failed to properly invoke.\"",
      "Xinis ordered a speedy fact-finding process after the Trump administration refused to comply with three different court orders, including an order from the Supreme Court, to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. so he can receive due process regarding the Trump administration's claim that he is an MS-13 gang member.",
      "Last week in court, a Justice Department attorney said that the Trump administration would facilitate Abrego Garcia's return only if he arrived at a port of entry and continued to dodge questions from Xinis about what, if anything, the Trump administration is doing to return the man.",
      "Xinis said that \"every day Mr. Abrego Garcia is detained in CECOT is another date of irreparable harm\" and gave both sides two weeks to complete expedited discovery in the case, including sworn depositions from Trump administration officials with first-hand knowledge of the efforts to return him. Depositions are set to be completed on Wednesday.",
      "But attorneys for Abrego Garcia say all of the discovery produced by the Justice Department has been \"nothing of substance,\" and \"consists entirely of public filings from the dockets, copies of Plaintiffs' own discovery requests and correspondence, and two nonsubstantive cover emails transmitting declarations filed in this case.\" Other questions for which Abrego Garcia's attorneys have sought answers have been \"similarly non-responsive,\" they wrote.",
      "The plaintiff's lawyers said that the government \"artificially\" narrowed Xinis' order for discovery \"to avoid complying with its obligations.\"",
      "\"The Government refuses to respond to interrogatories it claims are 'based on the false premise that the United States can or has been ordered to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador,'\" Abrego Garcia's attorneys wrote, adding that the Justice Department has not provided any information about Abrego Garcia's detention before April 2, although he has been detained in El Salvador since March 15.",
      "They also argued that the government has asserted privilege \"including deliberative process privilege, state secret privilege, and 'governmental privilege' without any foundation for doing so.\"",
      "Justice Department attorneys countered that they have \"put forward a good-faith effort to provide appropriate responses\" to Abrego Garcia's attorneys and added that they plan to file specific privilege claims over information pertaining to Abrego Garcia soon.",
      "The government also said the administration is \"in discussions\" with the Salvadoran government to return Abrego Garcia, but \"any requirement of a more detailed response by the Defendants would be wholly inappropriate and an invasion of diplomatic discussions.\"",
      "One detail of Abrego Garcia's detention in El Salvador may prompt Xinis to seek more information about what the Trump administration knew \u2014 and when \u2014 about his transfer from CECOT, the country's notorious supermax prison, to another detention center.",
      "Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who met with Abrego Garcia last week, said he was moved from CECOT on April 9 to another lower-security detention facility in El Salvador.",
      "But in court-mandated, daily status updates ordered by Xinis about Abrego Garcia's condition and what the administration is doing to return him, four different officials \u2014 from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the State Department, and Homeland Security \u2014 each stated that Abrego Garcia was being detained at CECOT after that date.",
      "On Monday, the Trump administration confirmed that Abrego Garcia had been moved to a facility in Santa Ana, El Salvador, and reported based on conversations with the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador that he is \"in good conditions and in an excellent state of health.\"",

      "Ahead of the quarterly report, investors submitted questions to Tesla they hoped to get answered during the company's earnings conference call. A top issue flagged by investors is Elon Musk himself, with dozens asking about his focus on the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and when he might redirect his energies to running Tesla.",
      "\"Can Elon please provide some reassurance that at some point soon he will be done with DOGE and politics?\" one investor asked. \"Many Tesla shareholders wish he would reprioritize the majority of his time and effort to engineering.\"",
      "That's a question that Wall Street also wants answered. Tesla's stock price has plunged 53% from its most recent high in December, when the stock was pushed higher after President Trump's electoral victory on optimism that Musk's role advising Mr. Trump would help the EV maker's bottom line.",
      "But Musk's activities with DOGE \u2014 including cutting tens of thousands of federal workers and accessing taxpayers' personal data \u2014 have alienated some consumers and sparked protests across the globe, causing the stock price to deflate.",

      "Musk also defended his work on DOGE, saying that he needed to \"fight the waste and fraud and try to get the country back on the right track.\"",
      "Tariff impact",
      "The company cautioned that \"trade policy\" and \"changing political sentiment\" could impact demand for its products in the near term. Mr. Trump's tariffs are expected to result in higher prices for many vehicles, including Teslas.",
      "Musk also said he would like to see lower tariffs, but that the decision is Mr. Trump's. \"I'm advocating for lower tariffs, rather than higher, but that's all I can do,\" the Tesla CEO said in the earnings call.",
      "The company's first-quarter results were \"grim,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a note to investors. [E]xpectations were very low, but these are still bad numbers.\"",
      "Tesla's transformation into a symbol of the Trump administration has dampened demand for the vehicles, and could reduce demand for Tesla vehicles by 15% to 20% due to consumers who don't want to be associated with the billionaire, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a research note.",
      "\"Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,\" Ives concluded.",
      "What time is the Tesla earnings call?",
      "Tesla's earnings fell short of analyst expectations. The company reported a per-share profit of 27 cents, compared with an average forecast of 41 cents per share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.",
      "Net income tumbled 71% to $409 million, versus $1.39 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Sales slid 9% to $19.3 billion, far short of the $21.3 billion expected by analysts.",
      "Tesla shares, which have fallen 41% this year, were largely flat in after-hours trading.",
      "Earlier this month, Tesla said its delivery of vehicles in the first three months of 2025 fell nearly 13% as demand for the automaker's electric cars continued to weaken, with deliveries also falling well short of analysts' expectations.",
      "In assessing Tesla's latest financial results, Crisafulli thinks Tesla boosters are likely to focus on the company's plan to start testing its Robotaxi and a humanoid robot called Optimus later this year, as well as beginning production of a lower cost vehicle in the months ahead.",
      "But more bearish observers will conclude \"there's no reason to think things are about to get a lot better\" at Tesla, he said, adding that its Robotaxi service is well behind Alphabet's Waymo self-driving vehicle rollout.",
      "Under this view, \"Musk's personal brand has been permanently tarnished by his political activities in the last several months, and exiting DOGE won't change that. On top of all this, the stock remains very expensive,\" Crisafulli said.",
      "In addition to insights into Musk's role at Tesla, investors will also be listening for updates on several strategic initiatives. The company is expected to roll out a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y SUV, later in the year.

      "\"The hardest part of it all is not knowing how many patients you're going to get,\" he said, adding that TMH staff was very proactive with its communication systems in place and activated the necessary resources by bringing additional staff to prepare for the worst.",
      "Howard said that the proximity of the hospital to the university also helped with the fast response and immediate treatment, adding that all six patients were seen within an hour of admission. He also highlighted that the relationship between hospital staff, law enforcement, and first responders also helped make the process go smoothly.",
      "Out of the six patients, three were brought into the operating room for surgery, with two of them needing abdominal surgery and the third needing facial surgery. The other patients also suffered gunshot wounds to their extremities, hospital staff said, but didn't specify exactly what kind of injuries they sustained.",
      "One doctor also helped patients during 2014 FSU library shooting",
      "Among the hospital staff that treated the victims, one of the doctors was able to speak about the comparison of medical response between Thursday's shooting and the FSU library shooting over a decade ago.",
      "Doctor Shelby Blank, a general and breast surgeon who also on staff during the 2014 shooting, said it was a \"more limited situation\" compared to Thursday's tragedy.",

      "Blank continued, saying that Thursday's shooting was \"catastrophic.\"",

      "As the Trump administration's cost-cutting initiative, DOGE has slashed tens of thousands of federal jobs in the name of reducing fraud, waste and abuse. But DOGE has also sparked a backlash \u2014 and plenty of lawsuits \u2014 as critics accuse it of accessing voters' private data and cutting programs that are vital to many Americans.",
      "At the same time, Tesla's sales have taken a hit as the automaker's vehicles have increasingly become a symbol of the Trump administration, repelling some consumers. The stock has also plunged more than 50% from its most recent high in December, when the shares surged after the presidential election on optimism that Musk's role advising Mr. Trump would help the EV maker's bottom line.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 16:18:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Record consumer debt, years of steep inflation and other factors are driving more Americans to considering filing for bankruptcy.",
    "story": [
      "The number of Americans considering bankruptcy is soaring to its highest level since just before the pandemic, a potentially alarming sign as clouds gather over the economy.",
      "Personal bankruptcy inquiries surged in the first three months of the year, according to data from LegalShield, a provider of consumer legal services. The jump could augur a potential wave of\u00a0bankruptcy filings\u00a0as consumers start to buckle under a record level of debt and as\u00a0tariffs fuel inflation, the company warned in a report this week.",
      "Personal bankruptcy filings in the U.S. averaged about 750,000 a year before COVID-19, but fell sharply during the pandemic itself as Americans were buoyed by trillions of dollars in government aid and relief.",
      "LegalShield now expects bankruptcies to surge as soon as this this summer. \"Consumers are calling lawyers to ask questions because they can't pay their bills or are having trouble, and they ask about the process of filing for bankruptcy,\" Matt Layton, LegalShield senior vice president of consumer analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Why are more Americans mulling bankruptcy?",
      "Heavy consumer debts, years of stiff inflation and higher interest rates are squeezing Americans' budgets, according to Layton. Billing disputes, debt collections and other leading indicators of bankruptcy are also on the rise.",
      "\"Our members are calling and saying, 'I don't have enough money at the end of month to pay my bills.' They're asking which ones to pay and which ones to put off. They're saying, 'They're coming to get my car \u2014 what can I do about these things?'\" Layton said.",
      "The jump in Americans who are considering declaring bankruptcy reflects the tough economic economic and financial conditions that have prevailed 2020, experts said. Total household debt as of the end of 2024 hit an all-time of\u00a0$18 trillion, while the percentage of Americans falling seriously behind on their debts also rose last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "\"Quarterly filings from the U.S. courts will come out soon, and I'd expect to see a quarter-over-quarter increase in personal bankruptcy filings from the end of 2024 to the beginning of 2025,\" Pamela Foohey, a bankruptcy professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am not surprised attorneys say they're hearing from people who are looking to file for bankruptcy now because it's April. This is when people get their tax returns, so they have money to file for bankruptcy with,\" she added, noting that it costs money to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the most common type of personal filing. \"If they are getting their tax return, that's the time to file because they have an infusion of money.\"",
      "Economists warn that the Trump administration's economic policies, including heavy tariffs on China and other key trading partners, is likely to stoke inflation while dampening economic growth. Still, the flood of people weighing bankruptcy now reflects the steady rise in financial stress in recent years rather than current economic conditions, Foohey emphasized.",
      "\"Rising [bankruptcy] filings will show that people have been struggling with their finances for years when they do file, and things have been getting incrementally worse month after month now for years,\" she said. \"It's been building, and it's only going to get worse unless something is done about inflation, unless something is done about tariffs.\"",
      "When should you file for bankruptcy?",
      "As Foohey notes, bankruptcy typically comes after a prolonged period of financial stress. Although some Americans struggle to overcome the stigma of bankruptcy, experts recommend filing for protection sooner rather than later in order to shield their assets from creditors.",
      "Filing for bankruptcy can help an individual liquidate their assets to pay off their debt or create a repayment plan. Individuals may file for file\u00a0Chapter 7\u00a0or\u00a0Chapter 13\u00a0bankruptcy, and all bankruptcy cases are handled in federal courts.",
      "But bankruptcy expert Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign College of Law, said declaring bankruptcy accomplishes one thing: wiping out people's debt.",
      "\"It doesn't get you a job, it doesn't get you a raise, it doesn't put money on the table,\" he said. \"Filing for bankruptcy protection doesn't make sense when things are still on the way down. It makes sense to file when you're in the hole, but starting to climb out of it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday announced a \"reorganization\" of the State Department, with plans to make staffing cuts and consolidate domestic offices.",
      "The cuts aren't happening immediately, but a senior State Department official told reporters that Rubio's announcement sets forth a road map for future cuts, and Congress has been notified to set the process in motion. The senior official said State Department undersecretaries for the various bureaus must in about 30 days present a plan on how they will eliminate positions.",
      "Rubio reposted \"X\" posts in which Free Press journalists said the move would entail closing 132 offices, moving 137 offices elsewhere, and directing undersecretaries to reduce personnel by anywhere between 15-17%. Another senior State Department official told reporters on Tuesday that the personnel reduction would be 22%.",
      "Among the agency offices to be cut, according to an \"X\" post Rubio reposted, are those intended to further human rights, advance democracy overseas, counter extremism, and prevent war crimes. Asked during Tuesday's departmental press briefing about the department's office of Global Criminal Justice, which plays a role in investigating war crimes and is missing from the proposed \"reorganization\" chart, Pentagon spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that just \"because it's now folded into another larger bureau, doesn't mean that it's gone or we don't care.\"",
      "Rubio called the State Department in its current form \"bloated, bureaucratic, and unable to perform its essential diplomatic mission in this new era of great power competition.\"",
      "\"Over the past 15 years, the department's footprint has had unprecedented growth and costs have soared,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"But far from seeing a return on investment, taxpayers have seen less effective and efficient diplomacy. The sprawling bureaucracy created a system more beholden to radical political ideology than advancing America's core national interests.\"",
      "\"That is why today I am announcing a comprehensive reorganization plan that will bring the Department into the 21st Century,\" Rubio continued. \"This approach will empower the Department from the ground up, from the bureaus to the embassies. Region-specific functions will be consolidated to increase functionality, redundant offices will be removed, and non-statutory programs that are misaligned with America's core national interests will cease to exist.\"",
      "The senior State Department official who briefed reporters stressed this is a \"purely domestic plan\" that \"does not have anything to do with any foreign missions.\"",
      "\"That's not to say that there won't be subsequent decisions on foreign missions, but that's not what this is,\" the official said.",
      "According to Rubio's notification to Congress, the State Department would formally assume responsibility for remaining humanitarian assistance programming, and most remaining USAID functions would be absorbed by the State Department.",
      "The senior State Department official said these changes are an \"attempt to go back to the traditional roots of the State Department, which are the primacy of the regional bureaus and of our foreign missions.\"",
      "The changes to the State Department come amid the Trump administration's efforts to shutter most of USAID.",

    "summary": "FBI directors typically fly on government jets, but they're encouraged to limit personal travel.",
    "story": [
      "Two years ago, Kash Patel emerged as a vocal critic of then-FBI Director Christopher Wray for his use of the government's fleet of private aircraft for personal travel.",
      "The FBI should \"ground Chris Wray's private jet that he pays for with taxpayer dollars to hop around the country,\" Patel said during his \"Kash's Corner\" podcast in 2023.",
      "Now, Patel himself is the director, and questions have begun circulating inside the FBI about the degree to which Patel is using governmental airplanes for his personal travels.",
      "The FBI declined to share Patel's flight schedule and would not confirm his presence on a number of flights to destinations where he later appeared. During the first weekend in April, for instance, a Boeing 757 owned by the Department of Justice made two round trip flights from Washington to New York.",
      "On Saturday, April 5, the narrow-body jet took a 57-minute flight to Stewart International Airport, a short drive from West Point, where Patel made an appearance at a charity hockey event hosted by the FBI. The next day, the jet was back in the air to JFK Airport, landing just hours before Patel resurfaced in box seats next to hockey legend Wayne Gretzky and watched Capitals star Alex Ovechkin break the NHL scoring record.",
      "The New York Times first reported on Patel's use of FBI aircraft on Sunday.",
      "It's unclear if Patel was on these flights \u2014 and if he was, whether they were purely personal, work related, or both. But on Monday, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee told CBS News in a statement that he wants the answer to those questions.",
      "\"The Judiciary Committee must investigate Director Patel's apparent misuse of taxpayer dollars,\" said U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois. \"The American people expect an FBI Director who focuses on the security and safety of the nation, not someone wrapped up in the trappings of the spotlight.\"",
      "FBI directors are required by executive branch policy to use government aircraft for air travel, whether official or personal. That enables them to maintain access to secure communications wherever they travel. And it gives the director the ability to move quickly in an emergency.",
      "If the travel is personal, the director must reimburse the government the cost of a commercial coach airfare. When traveling for personal reasons, the director may bring family or friends, but guest travel must be reimbursed to the government as well. Friends or family members are never allowed to fly on FBI aircraft unaccompanied by the director. It is unclear whether Patel has brought friends or family aboard government jets.",
      "But Durbin said the use of the plane still has limits and questioned whether the use of the aircraft cut against the Trump administration's professed commitment to rooting out government waste.",
      "Patel's use of Gulfstream jets operated by the FBI appears to extend to his frequent trips to Las Vegas, where he has a home, and to Nashville, where Patel's girlfriend, who is a country singer, lives. Sources familiar with Patel's travel confirmed to CBS News that the director was on the plane for several trips captured by FlightRadar24, including a weekend dash to Las Vegas on March 7 and a weekend in Nashville on March 14.",
      "It is unclear if he was aboard on Feb. 24, when one of the FBI's Gulfstream 5 jets flew from Manassas, Virginia, where the plane is based, to Nashville, stayed on the ground for an hour and 27 minutes before returning to Manassas.",
      "On some occasions, Patel may have traveled for both pleasure and business. An FBI jet flew on March 21 from Washington to Nashville. That day, Patel attended a roundtable meeting with state and local law enforcement officials in Tennessee, and also visited the FBI field office in Nashville. The plane returned to Washington later that afternoon. It is unclear whether he saw Alexis Wilkins, his girlfriend, while he was there.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the FBI said it \"does not comment on travel arrangements for security purposes. All ethical guidelines are followed rigorously.\"",
      "Some bureau veterans told CBS News they have been troubled by the frequent use of government aircraft by FBI executives, making the aircraft less available to support operations in line with the primary mission of investigating crimes, chasing spies and preventing terrorist attacks.",
      "\"Those aircraft have been procured or leased specifically to support operational needs,\" said Christopher O'Leary, a former senior counterterrorism official at the FBI who has used the planes dozens of times for sensitive missions and critical response. \"The concern is that the routine use of them by the director and deputy director for personal travel could take a critical resource offline when they are sometimes needed at a moment's notice.\"",
      "O'Leary and others said they also worry that the use of the planes sets the wrong tone.",
      "\"It's a bad leadership example,\" he told CBS News. \"All agents are provided an FBI vehicle, and they cannot be used for personal use.\u00a0 They can only be used for going to and from work, for official duties or to respond to a crisis and that is strictly enforced.\"",
      "Congressional watchdog advised limits on personal jet travel",
      "In 2013, the Government Accountability Office probed the Justice Department's and the FBI's use of the FBI G5 jets for \"non-mission purposes.\" The report that followed laid out how often and for what reasons the planes were used by the attorney general and the FBI director, the costs associated with the flights and the rules and regulations governing them. At the time, the GAO did not find any specific instances of wrongdoing, although it did emphasize the importance of officials being responsible stewards of taxpayer funds when using the planes.",
      "Diana Maurer, a director at GAO and author of the 2013 report, told CBS News that the same principles that were at play when the congressional watchdog agency did its review remain relevant today.",
      "\"I don't know what the current FBI director did or didn't do, and we haven't updated our 2013 report,\" Mauer said in an interview.\u00a0 \"But just because you're allowed to do something doesn't necessarily mean you should.\"",
      "Maurer noted that government officials should not abuse their privileges at the expense of the taxpayer.",
      "\"Using government aircraft, as FBI Directors are required to do for security reasons, costs significantly more than commercial flights. I hope the FBI and the Department of Justice are considering the implications for taxpayers when the Director uses government aircraft for non-mission purposes.\"",
      "Past FBI directors faced scrutiny",
      "During the years that Wray ran the FBI, his personal use of the jet became a touchstone for conservative critics. Wray occasionally flew from Washington to his hometown of Atlanta, where his family maintained its residence. He drew criticism from Republicans in Congress and some former FBI agents for summoning the G5s to Reagan National Airport from Manassas, a 15-minute flight, rather than being driven 30 miles to the Virginia airport where it maintains a hangar.",
      "FBI whistleblower Steven Friend, a close ally of Patel's who was suspended by the bureau over concerns that his views on the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol affected his work, criticized Wray in more than a dozen social media posts for his use of the jets. \"Chris Wray abuses his\u00a0 @FBI jet privileges because he doesn't like to sit in traffic,\" Friend wrote in a Dec. 14, 2023, tweet.",
      "Wray was also raked over the coals by Republican lawmakers for cutting short a Senate oversight hearing in 2023 to fly on an FBI aircraft to a family vacation in the Adirondacks. (Wray at the time pointed out that he had negotiated the length of the hearing with committee staff.) The chairman of the committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, later questioned Wray's use of the FBI jets and whether it amounted to an abuse of taxpayer money, a suggestion that Wray rejected, noting that he was a \"required use traveler,\" and that he reimbursed the government in every instance he used the planes for personal purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Grassley said the senator is \"still waiting on the FBI\" for records regarding Wray's use of the jets and criticized Democrats and the media, claiming they never showed \"any interest in scrutinizing FBI Directors' travel logs until Kash Patel came on the scene.\" Grassley's office did not respond to a question about whether the senator would continue his oversight of FBI directors' government jet travel while Patel is director.",
      "FBI directors have also at times been sensitive about the potential misuses of the FBI's fleet. In at least one case, a former FBI director went to extraordinary lengths to save the taxpayer money for his air travel.",
      "Soon after he became FBI director in 2013, James Comey traveled back and forth to Connecticut where his family was still living. At the time, Washington was in the midst of a heated budget battle with the possibility that government workers would be furloughed and have their paychecks withheld. So, according to two former law enforcement officials, Comey asked President Barack Obama for a special dispensation from the \"required use\" rule so that he could fly commercial at a much lower cost to the government.",

He said he, Holloway and their daughter, Vanessa, who was 14 months old at the time, were in Holloway's apartment when two intruders broke in. He said one of the intruders attacked Holloway with a crowbar and he was assaulted before they kidnapped Vanessa, who has never been found. Morales also said he was high on PCP at the time.",

      "Morales was later arrested on weapons charges, but those charges were not related to Holloway's death or Vanessa's disappearance, CBS affiliate WFSB-TV previously reported.",
      "Prosecutors argued that Morales' story about how Halloway was killed did not match the evidence, WFSB reported.",
      "During closing arguments on Monday, Supervisory Assistant State's Attorney Howard Stein said the evidence showed that Morales repeatedly struck Holloway in the head with an object and tried to cover it up by cleaning up the crime scene.",
      "Morales had admitted on the stand that he attempted to clean the apartment after Halloway was killed and had also put some of the blood-soaked evidence in a donation bin, according to WFSB.",
      "\"Why would you believe that home invaders that committed murder and kidnapped a child would leave behind a living witness? How does that make sense?\" Stein asked in his closing argument.",
      "Morales' lawyer, Edward Gavin, in his closing argument asked the jury, \"Who calls 911 before committing a homicide? No one.\" The question was referring to the call Morales made before he allegedly killed Holloway. Gavin then replayed the call for the jury.",
      "\"And don't forget, that's Christine Holloway's voice in the background on the call. Christine was there,\" Gavin said.",
      "Gavin declined to comment after the verdict. During his closing argument, he said there was no evidence that Morales had any intent to kill Holloway.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 15:05:40 -0400",
    "summary": "Amid reports the IRS may end its free Direct File program, more than 170 lawmakers are demanding it remains open.",
    "story": [
      "Data shows the IRS' Direct File free tax-filing tool has helped save taxpayers money. Now lawmakers want to know why the Trump administration may soon pull the plug on the program.",
      "The Trump administration is planning on ending Direct File, the Associated Press reported earlier this month, citing people familiar with the plan. The program, launched during Joe Biden's presidency, has been credited by some users with making it easier and cheaper to file their taxes, saving the average user $160 in tax preparation fees and hours of their time, according to the Economic Security Project, an advocacy group focused on enhancing financial fairness and security for Americans.",
      "But the IRS has also faced blowback to Direct File from private tax prep companies that have made billions from charging people to use their software.",
      "\"Direct File is and has been a solution in search of a problem, a drain on critical IRS resources and a waste of taxpayer dollars,\" Derrick Plummer, a spokesman for the commercial tax preparation company Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, told the AP.",
      "DirectFile was used by about 141,000 taxpayers in 12 states when it debuted in 2024, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). Although it was expanded to 25 states in 2025, the IRS hasn't yet released data on how many people used it during the tax season that ended on April 15.",
      "$100 billion on tax prep",
      "Americans spend more than $100 billion each year to prepare and file their returns, according to the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. Direct File was developed as a method to help taxpayers avoid paying tax-prep and filing fees.",
      "However, Republican lawmakers and commercial tax preparation companies \u2014 including Intuit, the owner of TurboTax, H&R Block \u2014 have complained the Direct File program is a waste of taxpayer money because free filing programs already exist. One such service is Free File, a partnership between the IRS and tax-prep companies.",
      "On Monday, more than 170 Democratic and independent lawmakers sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and IRS acting commissioner Michael Faulkender asking them to commit to keeping Direct File open and operating. No Republican lawmakers signed the letter.",
      "\"Ending this free, easy-to-use and popular program would be an insult to American taxpayers, eliminating an important alternative to commercial options provided by the tax prep industry,\" the Democratic lawmakers, led by by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, wrote in the April 21 letter.",
      "Under the Trump administration, the IRS is undergoing a cost-cutting overhaul, with plans to eliminate up to 40% of its roughly 100,000-person workforce after the end of tax filing season, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News. The agency is also expected to shed more than 20,000 IRS employees through its Deferred Resignation Program offer.",
      "Those changes are part of the Trump administration's efforts, overseen by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut federal spending.",
      "\"No decisions on the future of Direct File have been made as of yet,\" a Treasury spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It is a failed program at a cost of tens of millions of taxpayer dollars per year.\"",
      "Pushback against Direct File",
      "Direct File has drawn pushback from some Republican lawmakers, with more than 20 GOP representatives asking President Trump to \"immediately end the IRS' unlawful Direct File pilot program upon taking office in January,\" according to a Dec. 10 statement from Rep. Adrian Smith, a Republican from Nebraska.",
      "\"The program's creation and ongoing expansion pose a threat to taxpayers' freedom from government overreach, and its shaky rollout and structural flaws have already come at a steep price,\" the Republican lawmakers said in their\u00a0letter.",
      "The IRS spent about $13 million on the Direct File pilot in 2024, according a December\u00a0report from the GAO. That funding came from money the tax agency received from the Inflation Reduction Act, which Mr. Biden signed into law in 2022.",
      "While consumer advocacy groups and some tax experts have praised Direct File for creating a free pathway for some taxpayers to file their returns, the service hasn't earned universal praise.",
      "Direct File was \"problematic\" from the start, David Williams, president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, which describes itself as a nonpartisan organization that disseminates research and analysis on the government's effects on the economy, told the AP.",
      "Pointing to the program's costs, Williams noted that many people who start the free-filing process never finish. According to the IRS, while 423,450 taxpayers logged into Direct File in 2024, only 140,803 of them submitted accepted returns.",
      "Despite those criticisms, taxpayers who have used Direct File give the program high marks. About 96% of taxpayers who used the 2024 pilot program said they were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with the service, a Code for America survey found.",
      "\"Taxpayers have spoken loudly and clearly: Direct File works well for them, and more Americans want access to it,\" the April 21 letter from Warren, Sanders and other lawmakers said.",

The packages weighed about 70 pounds and were worth over $1 million, police said at the time.

      "Since the start of President Trump's second term in office, a number of corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S.",
      "The announcements come as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs\u00a0take effect, with other import duties still pending. Although not all the companies expecting to grow their manufacturing footprint in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such moves as furthering Mr. Trump's goal of stoking job-creation on home soil.",

More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis' funeral has been scheduled for 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. eastern) on Saturday in front of St. Peter's Basilica, the Vatican announced Tuesday, following a meeting of the College of Cardinals at the Catholic Church's city-state headquarters in the heart of Rome. The coffin carrying the pope, who died Monday morning after suffering a stroke and heart failure at the age of 88, was brought in a procession on Wednesday morning to the basilica from his residence at Casa Santa Marta, where he died.",
      "The late pontiff will lie in state inside St. Peter's Basilica for three days ahead of his funeral, with the faithful processing slowly up to his simple wooden coffin to pay their respects.",
      "A steady stream of cardinals, the most senior prelates in the Catholic Church, were the first to file up to Francis' coffin on Wednesday.",
      "On Tuesday, the Vatican released the first photos and video of Francis since his death, showing him in his coffin wearing a red robe with the papal mitre on his head and a rosary intertwined in his hands.",
      "The images showed cardinals and other church officials performing what the Vatican said was the formal Confirmation of the Pope's Death and praying over his body.",
      "CBS News correspondent Seth Doane said the intimate service at the Santa Marta hotel on Tuesday gave senior clergy and Vatican insiders a private chance to pay their respects to Francis ahead of the more public lying in state at St. Peter's.",
      "Church officials also shared some details on Tuesday about the pope's final hours, describing \"a discreet death, almost sudden, without long suffering or public alarm.\"",
      "The interim administrator of the Vatican, Irish-American Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who will play a major role in the funeral and subsequent events in the coming weeks, presided over the Wednesday morning procession to St. Peter's and the ritual transfer of the pope's body to the basilica.",
      "The funeral Mass will be celebrated on Saturday morning by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re. The papal funeral is broken down into three separate phases, or  \"stations.\" They are the preparation of the body, the viewing of the  body, and then the burial.",
      "Who will come to Pope Francis' funeral?",
      "The funeral at St. Peter's Basilica on Saturday will draw \"Patriarchs, Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops, and priests from across the globe,\" the Vatican said. It will also be attended by a number of world leaders and other dignitaries.",
      "President Trump said Monday that he and first lady Melania would attend, as did Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and France's Emmanuel Macron. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was to attend, along with a number of other European heads of state, including U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Germany's\u00a0outgoing Chancellor\u00a0Olaf Scholz.",
      "Among the first royals to confirm they will attend the funeral were King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of Belgium. The country's official Belga News agency confirmed that they would attend, noting the royal couple' social media post on Monday in which they honored Francis as, \"a great man, close to the most vulnerable and concerned with the problems of the world.\"",
      "King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain were also planning to be at the funeral, the French news agency AFP said Tuesday, citing the royal palace in Madrid.",
      "Kensington Palace said Tuesday that William, the Prince of Wales and heir to the British throne, would attend the pope's funeral on behalf of the U.K. royals, representing his father King Charles III. Charles, along with Queen Camilla, met with Francis at the Vatican less than two weeks before the pontiff died.",
      "Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who is currently the subject of an International Criminal Court arrest warrant over war crimes allegedly committed during his country's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, will not attend the pope's funeral, the Kremlin's chief spokesman said Tuesday.",
      "\"No. The president has no such plans,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about Francis' funeral. The ICC warrant severely limits Putin's ability to travel internationally, as any nation that's a signatory to the U.N. court's founding charter is legally obligated to arrest him if he enters its territory.",
      "The Reuters news agency said Brazil's President Luis Inacio da Silva and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had also confirmed that they would attend the funeral. President Javier Milei of Argentina, where Francis was born in 1936, would also be at the funeral, according to his office.",
      "China's government indicated Tuesday that no decisions had been made regarding which officials might attend the service at the Vatican.",
      "What happens after Pope Francis' funeral?",
      "After the funeral Mass at St. Peter's, Pope Francis' coffin will be taken to the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome, where he will be entombed. The pope chose to be buried at the smaller basilica, which is about four miles away, outside the Vatican walls. He prayed at St. Mary's often, before and after international trips during his 12-year pontificate.",
      "Between 15 and 20 days after the pope's death, the\u00a0Cardinal Electors\u00a0will gather at the Vatican and seal themselves off from the world behind the doors of the Sistine Chapel for the papal conclave, the centuries-old process of choosing the next pope. Only cardinals under the age of 80 \u2014 currently a group of about 135 \u2014 are eligible to vote in a conclave.",
      "The meeting of the cardinals on Tuesday was the first in what will be a series of gatherings culminating with the conclave. John Allen, editor of the Catholic news website \"Crux,\" told CBS News that the cardinals who were already at the Vatican to attend Tuesday's meeting would soon be joined by others from around the world.",
      "\"The really important part of these meetings begin when cardinals begin giving programmatic talks about where they believe the church stands\u2026 and what the profile of the man is needed to carry it forward,\" Allen told CBS News about the process leading up to the conclave.",
      "\"Let's be clear: These are not the Iowa Caucuses. Nobody's going to be standing up, barnstorming on behalf of their preferred candidate,\" he said, adding that one can, however, \"read between the lines\" of the addresses delivered by the cardinals \"to figure out, 'he's probably talking about cardinal so-and-so, or he may be talking against cardinal, so-in-so\u2026 so this is as close to political sausage grinding as we're going to get in the process electing the next pope.\"",
      "For the actual conclave, the cardinals will cast ballots inside the Sistine Chapel, out of public view, for their choice to lead the church, repeating the process until a candidate emerges with a two-thirds-plus-one majority. The paper ballots are burned after each round of voting, sending up black smoke to signal no choice has been reached yet, and finally white smoke to reveal that a new pope has been selected.",

      "Army Cpl. Albert J. Estrada was a member of Battery B, 57th Field Artillery Battalion, 31st Regimental Combat Team, 7th Infantry Division, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. He began service in July 1950, according to the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation. He was one of tens of thousands of soldiers present at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in November and December 1950, the DPAA said.",
      "During the battle, 30,000 United Nations servicemembers, including U.S. soldiers, faced off against 120,000 Chinese and North Korean enemy forces in \"rugged terrain in lethally cold weather,\" the DPAA said. The battle, which the DPAA described as \"one of the most brutal\" of the entire war, raged for 17 days.",
      "Army officials wanted to push North Korean forces into China and sever supply lines near the Chosin reservoir, the DPAA said. But the North Korean forces launched a surprise attack that forced one group of soldiers to retreat in late November. A few days later, Chinese soldiers surrounded and isolated another group of soldiers. A task force was hastily assembled to try to organize a withdrawal. A \"bitter fight\" allowed U.N. forces to open an airfield to bring in reinforcements and evacuate casualties on December 1, according to the U.S. military, and eventually, the U.N. soldiers managed a full retreat.",
      "More than 1,000 U.S. Marines and soldiers were killed during this time, the DPAA said. Thousands more were injured or incapacitated by the cold weather. Due to the elements and the retreat, \"hundreds of fallen Marines and soldiers were unable to be immediately recovered,\" the DPAA said.",
      "Estrada was one of the soldiers who could not be located after the battle. He was reported missing on Dec. 6, 1950. There was no information to indicate that he was ever held as a prisoner of war, the DPAA said. Three years later, on Dec. 31, 1953, the U.S. Army issued a presumptive finding of death.",
      "Between 1953 and 1954, the North Korean government returned thousands of remains of soldiers who had died during the Korean War. The remains had been buried in U.N. cemeteries in North Korea. The effort, known as Operation Glory, included the return of 500 sets of remains that had been buried near the Chosin reservoir. All but 126 of the remains were identified. The unidentified remains were buried as unknowns at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, the DPAA said.",
      "From 1990 to 1994, the North Korean government returned 47 additional containers of remains attributed to the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. From those recovery efforts, the DPAA and the organizations that preceded it were able to identify over 130 of the unaccounted-for missing personnel lost in the Chosin Reservoir Campaign.",
      "The DPAA did not say which handover Estrada's remains were recovered from. A full announcement of his accounting will be shared at a later date, the agency said.",
      "Estrada earned multiple military honors, including the Purple Heart, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Republic of Korea War Service Medal, according to the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation.",
      "Estrada's surviving siblings, Manuel Estrada and Ruth Tucker, have long lobbied for his identification, according to a 2018 article from The Daily Democrat. That year, Tucker was presented with a medal from the Republic of South Korea honoring her efforts to account for missing American soldiers who died during the Korean War. At the time, Tucker said complete identification of Korean War remains can take between four and five years.",

    "summary": "A longtime Vatican correspondent shares his insights on the legacy of Pope Francis, a populist leader who sought to bring the Church closer to the people.",
    "story": [
      "Rome \u2014 He was a populist leader, often referred to as the \"People's Pope.\" As pontiff, Francis, who died Monday at age 88, sought to bring the Church closer to the people, stating early in his papacy that he wanted to have a poorer Church \"for the poor.\" He was known for being driven around in unflashy cars and for making folksy gestures, like taking trips into Rome to buy an item at the store.",
      "He was brilliant at playing to the press, creating the sorts of photo-ops that would draw attention to his areas of interest. He'd often speak extemporaneously while on papal voyages, particularly toward the beginning of his papacy, fielding questions on the flight.",
      "That made his papal trips a must-attend event for the press covering him. For those of us who got to travel with Pope Francis, we could see how he'd interact over the course of days with various dignitaries and his wider flock of the faithful. He'd appear particularly energized and engaged, lighting up when with children or in an audience with those who were cast aside, living on the margins of society.",
      "He died just a day after surprising many with a brief appearance in St. Peter's Square on Easter Sunday, blessing thousands of people and sounding stronger as he did so than he had since his release from a Rome hospital at the end of March.",
      "We wanted to look back on his papacy, his legacy, and also look forward to the next pope, so we asked veteran Vatican correspondent Francis X. Rocca to meet recently on the terrace of a convent in Rome, with a spectacular view out over St. Peter's Basilica, for a chat about Pope Francis.",
      "We look back, and ahead. Below is a partial transcript from our conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "SETH DOANE: What is Pope Francis' legacy?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, I suppose it depends on whom you ask. I mean, for women, for example, he certainly was someone who brought women in the Vatican, and gave them higher positions than had ever been the case. It's still a relatively small number, but that was certainly a very dramatic change. For conservatives, he started by giving them heartburn and ended up by giving practically a heart attack. It was quite a dramatic confrontation. In some ways was a polarizing pope. At the same time that he really pushed the envelope and allowed things to be spoken about that had been considered closed, whether on sexual ethics, on medical ethics. \u2026 In a way, because of his very informal style of discourse, talking to journalists, giving interviews, press conferences, he seemed to give permission to people to criticize him, too, even if that wasn't his intention. So the debate became much more heated during his pontificate.",
      "SETH DOANE: Why was Pope Francis seen as such a divisive figure? Why did conservatives dislike him?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, I think there were a number of reasons. One is that he had a very\u00a0 loose attitude toward tradition, let's put it that way. From the very beginning, when he stepped out on the loggia in the front of St. Peter's Basilica, and he didn't wear the red cape that was customary on that occasion \u2014 before he even said a word, already people started to get nervous, conservatives started to get nervous that he was just not going to respect tradition.",
      "And he broke it in small ways like that, but he also tested it in bigger ways. And, for example, relatively late in his pontificate, gave permission for the blessings of same-sex couples. They tried to present that as something that was consistent with tradition, but it certainly wasn't seen that way by conservatives. And especially in Africa, where basically all the bishops of sub-Saharan Africa protested and wanted a kind of exemption from this new permission, which is extraordinary. And that's just a very clear illustration how divisive things became, when you have an entire continent \u2014 a continent where the Church is growing very quickly \u2014 taking a completely different stand from other parts of the Church. That happened under Pope Francis, and it happened because he made a bold move.",
      "SETH DOANE: Conservative Catholics in America were some of his loudest critics.",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Yes, that's right. He had a the majority of the U.S. bishops were not on board with his priorities, I think that's pretty clear. The pope and his allies among the U.S. bishops, who are a minority, wanted to play down abortion. The pope hated abortion, but he wanted to play [it] down, with respect to social and environmental and economic issues, or at least put them on an equal plane. That's maybe the better way to put it. The U.S. bishops have for years said that opposition to abortion is their \"preeminent priority.\" And the pope and his allies didn't want that, and they weren't able to persuade the majority of U.S. bishops about that, and that became a very, very big point of tension.",
      "SETH DOANE: We traveled with the pope together. One of the things that struck me was how he was with kids \u2014 he would kind of come alive in a way.",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: He was very approachable. He was very informal. That was the \u2014 one of the beguiling, charming things, charismatic things about him. His predecessors are \u2014 John Paul was a very charismatic figure, very telegenic, but he was not so relaxed. And Pope Francis had an ordinary style that appealed to people.",
      "SETH DOANE: Pope Francis was known as the \"People's Pope.\" He was known to reach out to try to pull in the masses.",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Yeah. He was also a populist pope, with a kind of political resonance. His style was very much to try to have a bond with the people, with \u2014 implicitly or sometimes not so implicitly, against the elites, in this case, the hierarchy: the bishops and the cardinals. He kind of played off of them. And he was always sort of suggesting that the elites, even the Diocesan clergy priests and parish priests, could be aloof from their people, could be too rigid, could be too attached to luxury or to privilege. And so he was always beating that drum and saying, \"No. I'm with the people.\"",
      "SETH DOANE: This pope tried to tackle sexual abuse issues within the clergy, within the Church. He tried to tackle the vast bureaucracy and economic issues in the Church. How did he do?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, I \u2014 his record on sex abuse was mixed. And I think actually not up to the level that people had expected of him. He had a kind of a distaste for disciplining the priests and bishops compared with his predecessor, Pope Benedict. Pope Benedict the high water mark in terms of discipline of abusive clergy. Pope Francis stepped back a bit from that. He got in trouble for that in Chile, when he was very stubbornly supportive of a bishop who'd been accused of covering up sex abuse. He finally backed down, but it was an embarrassment.",
      "SETH DOANE: What were some of the big issues under Pope Francis' papacy?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, certainly a big issue was his relative leniency on questions of marriage, the family, and sexuality. The single most famous statement from his pontificate was the one he made at his very first press conference in 2013, which was, \"Who am I to judge?\" He was talking, in that case, about gay priests. But he could have been talking about divorced Catholics, whom he allowed to take communion, in many cases, which had not been the practice before. He could have been talking about Catholics who use contraception. Pope Francis didn't change teaching formally on any of these issues. But what he did was signal that it was OK to have different points of view about them, that it was not a priority \u2014 that he was not censuring anyone. And, in fact, some of his advisors here explored, for example, the possibility of relaxing the ban on contraception that had been so controversial since Pope Paul VI had reaffirmed it in 1968. So those are some issues.",
      "Another issue: He had a rapprochement with China, which was controversial, even among Chinese Catholics, where he \u2026 agreed to share responsibility for choosing Catholic bishops in China with the Communist government there. And that was controversial. He felt that it was important to have dialogue and to keep the Church unified at some level, but a lot of the Catholics who resisted government control in China resented that and felt that he was selling them out.",
      "SETH DOANE: One of the regular criticisms of this pope was that he sowed confusion. Why was that heard so often?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, he played with ambiguity. A lot of his statement were made in an informal manner at press conferences and in interviews, not in doctrinal documents that came out from the Vatican. And so therefore he, you know, when he says, \"Who am I to judge?\" \u2014 well, what does that mean? Conservatives tried very hard to read that in a way very consistent with strict tradition. And you could if you wished. But the pope was very media savvy. He knew how his comments would play. He knew how his soundbites and headlines would play, and so when he made a statement like that, he knew that most people would read that as meaning that sexual morality, or at least in that case, was a matter of conscience, that people could follow their own conscience. That's not explicitly what he said, but when he said, \"Who am I to judge?\" he seemed to be saying, \"This is a private affair, this is someone with his own conscience.\" And that's how many people read it, even if he didn't explicitly say that.",
      "SETH DOANE: During his papacy, Pope Francis changed the feeling of the Church. You saw him driving around in simple cars, sometimes going out into Rome to buy something at a store. The feeling of who a pope is changed even in where he decided to live, at the Santa Marta Hotel, and not in the Apostolic Palace.",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Yeah, that's right, even wearing, you know, ordinary black shoes, or having his Argentinian passport renewed, wearing the white skull cap in the photo. That's true: He was definitely very deliberate. He wanted to make the pope seem more with the people, and to pull down some of the barriers. And that's why he had a very tactile, approachable style. It will be interesting to see if his successor feels the need to maintain that, or will go back to something more traditional and more formal.",
      "SETH DOANE: In the long arc of the Church's history, how much will Francis' papacy really have changed?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, the long march of papal history is very long indeed. One thing is he was the first pope from the Americas, and the first pope from the Global South. So he'll always have a place in the history books for that reason. Beyond that, it depends on what happens next. I mean, if the next pope is going to carry forward his progressive approach, and if that's going to continue and change the Church, and Church teaching is going to change on things like women's ordination, you know, or homosexuality, if it's actually going to change, then he will be a historic figure in that respect. If we go back to something more traditional, then that will be a kind of an anomaly. But he will remain in the history books because of where he's from.",
      "SETH DOANE: Looking ahead to the next pope, did Pope Francis, if you will, \"stack the decks\" enough that the College of Cardinals is likely to go with a more progressive, more liberal pope? Or does the pendulum swing the other way?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, that's always the big question. Certainly Pope Francis was notable,\u00a0 and even some of his supporters acknowledge this, in not choosing people who didn't agree with him as cardinals. He tended to choose people like that. On the other hand, he chose a lot of people from far-flung regions, from places that had never had a cardinal before, about whom we know very little, and probably Pope Francis didn't know very much either. So that's a bit of a wild card. There's also the issue that cardinals tend to be pretty conservative people \u2014 \"conservative\" with a small \"c.\" They tend to want not to rock the boat too much, and Pope Francis rocked the boat continually.",
      "SETH DOANE: We could see a more conservative pope next?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Certainly it's very possible that we'll see a pope with a more conservative temperament, a more conservative governing style, a more conservative communicative style. Maybe not a hard-right conservative, in terms of doctrine, we might not get that. But we might get someone who's going to \u2014 the College of Cardinals wants to calm the waters. It's been a very turbulent period under Pope Francis, and so they might want someone who will just not speak quite so often to the press, not stir things up, not shake things up for a while. We could be looking at that.",

      "After being elected by his fellow Catholic cardinals in 2013, he set the tone with his first official act as pope, reversing a centuries-old tradition \u2014 by simply asking for help.",
      "Normally after a new pope is elected, they come out and bless the masses gathered at St. Peter's Square at the Vatican. But when Francis was elected, he came out and first asked the faithful to bless and pray for him.",
      "\"I want to ask you a favor,\" he said. \"Before the bishop blesses the people, I ask that you would pray to the lord to bless me.\"",
      "It may seem a subtle change, but along with his familiar greeting and farewell to the crowd in Italian that day, it set the tone for his entire papacy. Pope Francis made it clear that he identified himself as a brother pilgrim, not as an imperial pope. He didn't want to keep leading a one-way monologue from the highest post in the Catholic Church, but a dialogue.",
      "As pope, the man previously known as Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio chose to name himself after Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of Italy, known for his simplicity and humanity.",
      "The first pope from the New World, born and raised in Argentina, he said he wanted \"a poorer Church\" and one that would \"include the excluded.\"",
      "He set an example by choosing to live in Room 201 at the Santa Marta \u2014 a small Vatican hotel usually used for visiting priests \u2014 rather than in the lavish papal apartments used by his predecessors. Pope Francis carried his own bag, and walked across Rome to buy his own pair of glasses.",
      "His desire to reach out to ordinary people sent the bulletproof \"popemobiles\" into storage.",
      "\"I cannot greet people from inside a sardine can,\" he famously explained, \"even if it is made of glass.\"",
      "He became one of the most popular public figures in the world, regularly speaking up for the voiceless and leading by example \u2014 whether that was by dining with the homeless, washing inmates' feet, or providing a home in Italy for migrants and refugees fleeing war or economic instability.",
      "Pope Francis railed against consumerism and individualism, and he insisted that \"unfair economic structures\" were a violation of human rights.",
      "He also pushed for progress in combating climate change, even publishing an encyclical \u2014 a formal letter from himself to Catholic leaders around the world \u2014 on the topic. And he reformed the Curia \u2014 the central administration of the church \u2014 allowing lay men and women to run Vatican offices, positions historically reserved for cardinals and bishops.",
      "He continued to give his public prayers during the coronavirus lockdowns, but with crowds banned, \"the People's Pope\" was left to deliver his messages in an empty St. Peter's Square.",
      "Wasting no time after getting his COVID vaccine, Pope Francis made a daring, first-ever\u00a0papal visit to Iraq, despite immense security risks. In Mosul, where ISIS militants once ransacked churches, Pope Francis prayed in them.",
      "A few months later, his health finally caught up with him. He spent 10 days\u00a0in a Rome hospital\u00a0in July 2021 recovering from a scheduled surgery to remove part of his colon. It was the first time he was hospitalized after being named pope.",
      "In 2022, a torn knee ligament forced him to finally\u00a0slow down. He was using a wheelchair and canceling both Vatican celebrations and overseas trips, generating persistent rumors that Francis, like Pope Benedict XVI, would\u00a0resign. When\u00a0Benedict died, Francis\u00a0presided over\u00a0his funeral, the first time in modern history a pope has laid his predecessor to rest.",
      "Over time, Francis' papacy began to be defined by a topic he did not choose: the wave of clerical sex abuse scandals that stretched to the very highest levels of the Catholic Church. He was accused, at first, of being insensitive in his slow response to the crisis.",
      "Then he tried to take control of the narrative, notably summoning senior clerics from around the world to the Vatican in early 2019. From that meeting came new Vatican laws about sex abuse, and a mandate that every diocese set up a clear reporting process. He also abolished the top-level confidentiality of the \"pontifical secret,\" which had shrouded the sex abuse crisis in yet another layer of systemic secrecy.",
      "His diplomatic skill was on display when he\u00a0played a key role\u00a0in restoring relations between the United States and its decades-old enemy, Cuba.",
      "His' simple style was a product of his humble beginnings. He was born on Dec. 17, 1936, to an immigrant Italian railway worker and a housewife in Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a young man, he lost part of a lung to an infection. He worked at various menial jobs and studied chemistry.",
      "After being ordained as a priest at the late age of 32, he made visiting the slums of Buenos Aires and caring for the city's poor a feature of his ministry.",
      "During a press conference aboard one papal flight years later, he appeared to crack open a space for homosexuals in the church, with a single, highly symbolic phrase: \"Who am I to judge?\"\u00a0he asked\u00a0when a reporter fired him a question about LGBTQ rights.",
      "But while he may have received widespread credit for changing the tone of the church when it comes to acceptance, the church's teachings and policy did not change.",
      "Despite drawing fire from Catholic conservatives for being too liberal, Pope Francis reaffirmed long-standing church doctrines\u00a0opposing same-sex marriage, and on pretty much everything else from birth control to\u00a0ordaining women.",
      "He claimed that he only brought a small bag to the papal conclave in 2013 that saw him elected, because he expected to be going back home to Argentina.",
      "Instead, neither his life, nor the papacy, were ever the same again.",

    "summary": "Pope Francis had expressed the desire to be buried in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, a fifth-century church in Rome.",
    "story": [
      "Joanne M. Pierce\u00a0is a professor emerita of religious studies at the\u00a0College of the Holy Cross.",
      "The 88-year-old pontiff had been well aware of his fragile state and advanced age. As early as 2015, Pope Francis had expressed the desire to be buried in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, a fifth-century church in Rome dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. He was so devoted to Mary and her basilica that after each of his more than 100 trips abroad, he would visit it after returning to Rome to pray and meditate.",
      "No pope has been buried in Santa Maria Maggiore since the 17th century, when Pope Clement IX was laid to rest there.",
      "I'm a specialist in Catholic liturgical history. In earlier centuries, papal funerals have been elaborate affairs, ceremonies befitting a Renaissance prince or other regal figure. But in recent years, the rites have been simplified. As Pope Francis has mandated, here are the steps that the ritual will follow.",
      "First station: Preparation of the body",
      "The funeral rites take place in three parts, called stations. The first takes place in the pope's private chapel, after medical professionals have certified his death. Until recently, this stage had taken place at the pope's bedside.",
      "After the body lies in rest in the chapel, the cardinal serving as the pope's camerlengo \u2014 the pope's chief of staff \u2014 will make the arrangements for the funeral. He is also tasked with running the Vatican until a new pope is elected. The current camerlengo is Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell, appointed by Francis in 2019.",
      "As has been done for centuries, the camerlengo will formally call the deceased pope by the full name given to him when he was baptized as an infant \u2014 Jorge Mario Bergoglio. There are narratives or legends stating that, at this time, the pope was also tapped three times on the forehead with a small silver hammer. However, there is no documented proof that this was actually done in earlier centuries to verify a pope's death.",
      "Traditionally, another ancient rite will also take place after the declaration of the pope's death: the defacing of the pope's ring. Each pope wears a custom-made ring with an engraved image of a man fishing from a boat, hearkening back to the gospel of Matthew, where Jesus calls St. Peter a \"fisher of men.\" This Fisherman's Ring, with the name of the current pope engraved over the image, could act as a seal on official documents. The camerlengo will break Francis' ring and smash the seal with a hammer or other instrument to prevent any other person from using it.",
      "The pope's apartments will also be locked, with no one allowed to enter; traditionally, this was done to prevent looting.",
      "Second station: Viewing the body",
      "The deceased pope will be dressed in his simple white cassock and red vestments, then placed in a simple wooden coffin. This will be carried in procession to St. Peter's Basilica, where the public viewing will take place for the next three days.",
      "The pope's body will be left in the plain, open casket during this viewing period in order to emphasize the pope's humble role as a pastor, not a head of state. The earlier practice would have been to place the body on top of a tall raised platform, called a catafalque; this ended with the funeral of Pope Benedict XVI in 2022.",
      "Pope Benedict was also the last pope to be buried in the traditional three coffins of cypress, lead and elm. Two coffins contained specific documents about his pontificate; the first coffin also held the traditional three bags of coins \u2014 gold, silver and copper \u2014 representing each year of his pontificate.",
      "At Francis' funeral, after the public viewing, a plain white cloth will be placed over the pope's face as he lies in the oak coffin, a continuing part of papal funerals. But this will be the first time that only a single coffin will be used; it will likely contain a document describing his pontificate and a bag of coins from his pontificate as well.",
      "The funeral Mass will then be celebrated at St. Peter's, most likely inside because of the late winter weather, and there will likely be a crowd of believers outside, assembled on the plaza. The homily will reflect on the life and spirituality of the deceased pope; Francis himself preached at the funeral of his retired predecessor, Pope Benedict. And the future Pope Benedict, as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, preached at the funeral of Pope St. John Paul II when Ratzinger was the leader, or the dean, of all senior church officials \u2013 what's known as the College of Cardinals.",
      "The current dean is 91-year-old Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, and it is unclear whether he will be able to continue this tradition due to his advanced age. Masses will continue to be said in Francis' memory for nine days after his death \u2014 a period called the Novendialis. This ritual was inspired by an ancient Roman tradition prescribing a mourning period ending on the ninth day after a death.",
      "Third station: Burial",
      "Popes in the past have been buried in several different places. Until the legalization of Christianity in the Roman Empire in the early fourth century, popes would be interred in the catacombs, the burial grounds on the outskirts of Rome.",
      "Afterward, popes could be buried in a number of different locations, such as the Basilica of St. John Lateran \u2014 the official cathedral of Rome \u2014 or other churches in and around Rome. A few were even buried in France during the 14th century, when the papacy moved to the French border for political reasons.",
      "Most popes are buried in the grottoes underneath St. Peter's, and since Pope Leo XIII's burial at St. John Lateran in 1903, every pope has been buried at St. Peter's. According to Francis' wishes, however, there will likely be a procession across Rome to Santa Maria Maggiore, including the hearse and cars carrying others who will attend this private ritual.",
      "After a few final prayers and sprinkling of holy water, the coffin will be placed in its final location inside the church. Only later will the area be opened to the public for prayers and veneration.",
      "After so many journeys from Rome to visit Catholic communities in countries across the globe, and so many visits to this basilica for prayer and meditation, it seems fitting that, at the end of his life's journey, Francis would make one last trip to the church he loved so much to be laid to rest forever.",

      "The 88-year-old pontiff died Monday after 12 years as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "The Vatican announced that the canonization of Carlo Acutis will be next Sunday in St. Peter's Square on the occasion of the Jubilee celebration of adolescents. It was originally scheduled to happen on April 27, the second Sunday of Easter.",
      "Acutis died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15. Born in London to wealthy Italian parents, he grew up in Milan, where he managed the website for his parish and later a Vatican-based academy. He also used his computer skills to create an online database of Eucharistic miracles around the world.",
      "His road to sainthood started more than 10 years ago at the initiative of a group of priests and friends, and formally took off shortly after Francis began his papacy in 2013.",
      "Acutis was named \"venerable\" in 2018 after the church recognized his virtuous life, and his body - wearing sneakers, jeans and a sweatshirt - was taken to a shrine in the Santuario della Spogliazione in Assisi, Italy. It was a major site linked to St. Francis' life.",
      "The teenager was declared \"blessed\" or beatified \u2014 the first step toward sainthood \u2014 in 2020 after one miracle was attributed to him. In that miracle, Acutis is credited with healing a Brazilian child of a congenital disease affecting his pancreas.",
      "A second miracle was attributed to Acutis in May 2024. It involved the healing of a university student in Florence who had a brain bleed after suffering head trauma in a bicycle accident.",
      "Francis and the cardinals residing in Rome formally approved his canonization in July 2024.",
      "In the months leading up to the expected canonization, the faithful have been flocking to Assisi.",

      "Pope Francis died Monday after 12 years as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, triggering an outpouring of mourning across the globe. The pope's death initiates a centuries-old process of rituals and traditions that culminates with a conclave, a gathering of the Church's current 135 Cardinal Electors who are sealed inside the Sistine Chapel to elect the next pontiff.",
      "Here's what's to come in the following days.",
      "Day One",
      "The pope was formally pronounced dead by the Cardinal Camerlengo \u2014 currently Irish-born American Kevin Farrell \u2014 who is one of the most important Vatican officials during the interregnum period.",
      "Traditionally, the camerlengo (chamberlain) would tap a silver hammer on the pope's head while calling out his baptismal name three times. The hammer is no longer used. Far more conventionally, an electrocardiogram was used to confirm John Paul II's death in 2005.",
      "Farrell then made a\u00a0statement announcing\u00a0the news: \"At 7:35 this morning, The Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the Father's house. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and His church.\"",
      "Once the camerlengo pronounces the pope dead, and before sealing the papal apartment, he breaks the pope's Fisherman's ring and destroys the dies used to make the papal seal for apostolic letters, to symbolize the end of the pontificate.",
      "These items will be buried with the pope. But first, the pontiff is transported to lie in state in St. Peter's Basilica. Hundreds of thousands of mourners descended on Vatican City after the death of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI in 2022\u00a0 to pay their respects.",
      "Novemdiales",
      "Pope Francis's death will be followed by a nine-day mourning period called Novemdiales, a tradition that dates back to Roman times.",
      "Vatican flags will fly at half-staff, and the bronze doors of St Peter's Basilica are closed.",
      "The funeral must take place four to six days after the pope's death. Weather permitting, it will be held in St. Peter's Square. Most recent popes have asked to be buried beneath the Basilica there, but Francis said he would be laid to rest in Rome's St. Mary Major Basilica. He also asked to be buried in a simple wooden casket.",
      "The papal funeral is broken down into three separate phases, or \"stations.\" They are the preparation of the body, the viewing of the body, and then the burial.",
      "At the funeral, attended by kings, queens, heads of state and religious leaders, the coffin will be carried through the so-called \"door of death\" to the left of the main altar, and a single bell will toll. The coffin will then be taken in procession from St. Peter's to the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome for entombment.",
      "During the nine-day mourning period, cardinals from around the world gather in Rome and begin meeting in \"General Congregations,\" a sort of campaigning period where various papal candidates give speeches about their visions for the church, mapping out the direction they think it should take.",
      "The conclave",
      "Between 15 and 20 days after the pope's death, voting will begin, as the Cardinal Electors of the papal conclave isolate themselves from the world and begin the centuries-old process of choosing the next pope. Only cardinals under the age of 80 \u2014 currently a group of about 135 \u2014 are eligible to vote.",
      "Behind closed doors in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, the cardinals will cast ballots for their choice, repeating the process until a candidate emerges with a two-thirds-plus-one majority. The paper ballots are burned after each round of voting, sending up black smoke to signal no choice has been reached yet, and finally white smoke to reveal that a new pope has been selected.",

That means she could still avoid execution if she returns $9 billion, or three-quarters of the $12 billion she embezzled, the\u00a0BBC reported.",
      "Four months later, an appeal court in Ho Chi Minh City ruled on Monday that a life sentence she was handed for three crimes during a second trial in October would be reduced to 30 years.",
      "\"Lan played the major role... (but) we also take into consideration the amount of money that Lan has spent on overcoming the consequences,\" judge Pham Cong Muoi said following discussions during the appeal about how her assets may be used to compensate victims of her crimes.",

      "The main jury is more female than the five women and seven men who convicted Weinstein at his first trial five years ago.

      "\"You may hear sexual allegations here of a salacious nature \u2014 graphic, perhaps. Would hearing that indicate that \u2026 Mr. Weinstein must be guilty?\" defense attorney Mike Cibella asked one prospective juror on Monday. The woman, who ultimately was chosen, answered no.",

      "Salinas joined Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview to discuss what\u2019s driving the spike in dementia cases and what behavioral changes could provide some degree of cognitive protection.\u00a0(See the video at the top of the article.)",

      "\"The baby boomer population, being one of the largest groups, is also the fastest-aging group,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"As we get more and more baby boomers \u2014 not just over 65, but into their 70s and 80s \u2014 we're going to see more and more of them developing some degree of cognitive impairment due to a plethora of reasons.\"",
      "Age is indeed the biggest risk factor, he noted.",
      "\"After age 65, our risk starts to increase. By the time we get to our 80s, that risk is about one in three,\" he said. \"And then after 85, it starts to go up even higher, to almost one in two.\"",
      "\"We know that individuals who don't have a lot of social engagement are at a higher risk.\"",
      "The pandemic could have played a role as well, the neurologist said.",

      "Flying robots bring precision and efficiency to harvesting",
      "Tevel\u2019s Flying Autonomous Robots (FARs) are redefining fruit harvesting by combining artificial intelligence with advanced computer vision. These drones navigate through orchards, identifying and picking only the fruit that has reached peak ripeness. Their ability to maneuver carefully around branches allows them to harvest without bruising or harming the trees. Unlike human pickers, these drones can operate continuously, working day and night to get the job done faster and more consistently.",
      "Farmers benefit from detailed, real-time information about the harvest, including the size, color and ripeness of each fruit, all accessible through a mobile app. This data helps optimize harvesting schedules and reduce waste. FARs have already been deployed in orchards across the United States, Italy, Chile and Israel, where they have helped reduce labor costs by up to 30% while improving harvest accuracy. Multiple drones work together from a mobile platform, covering large orchard areas efficiently.",

      "If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from covering data breaches over the years, it\u2019s that you should never take a company\u2019s initial numbers at face value. When a breach becomes public, most companies try to minimize the damage by reporting fewer victims or staying vague about what kind of data was exposed.",
      "Sometimes, to be fair, they genuinely don\u2019t have the full picture yet. But that rarely gets communicated clearly. The same thing just happened again with an insurtech company that has now doubled the number of people affected by a breach it disclosed last year.",

      "What you need to know",
      "Texas-based insurance administrative services provider Landmark Admin has revised the scope of its May 2024 cyberattack, revealing that nearly twice as many people were impacted as initially reported. Back in October 2024, Landmark disclosed that suspicious activity was detected in its network on May 13, prompting an investigation. At the time,\u00a0it was estimated that the breach affected 806,519 individuals. But in a recent update filed with the Maine Attorney General\u2019s office, that number has now jumped to 1,613,773.",
      "Landmark serves as a third-party administrator offering backend support to major insurers like Liberty Bankers Life and American Benefit Life. This means millions of sensitive insurance policy records flow through its systems, making it a tempting target for cybercriminals.",
      "The compromised information varies for each individual but may include a wide range of sensitive personal data. This includes full names, home addresses, Social Security numbers, tax identification numbers, driver's license or state-issued identification numbers, passport numbers and bank account details. In some cases, medical information, dates of birth, health insurance policy numbers and details related to life and annuity policies may also have been exposed.",

      "6 ways you can stay safe from insurance data breach",
      "If your information was part of the Landmark breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1) Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Landmark data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs.",
      "Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised. They often include up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team in which a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2) Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0The Landmark data breach revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud.",
      "3) Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Since Landmark hackers obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.",
      "4) Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.\u00a0One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Landmark hackers have people's email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you're not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The real risk with breaches like this isn't just the initial leak. It's the slow drip of consequences that follow. As more names and numbers surface, the fallout becomes harder to contain, and the people impacted are left scrambling to protect themselves. Landmark\u2019s delayed clarity is a reminder that in the world of cyberattacks, timelines rarely work in the public\u2019s favor. By the time the full picture emerges, the damage may already be done.",

      "\u200b\u200bImagine powering your boat not with gasoline but with clean hydrogen fuel. That\u2019s exactly what Yamaha, together with Roush Industries and Regulator Marine, is working on right now. They\u2019re developing the world\u2019s first hydrogen-combustion outboard engine, aiming to make boating greener and more sustainable.",

      "Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The big, big moment: First hydrogen fill-up",
      "To reach their goal, a specially modified Regulator Marine 26XO boat was taken to a hydrogen fueling station. The team filled its tanks with hydrogen for the very first time, which was a huge milestone. This 26-foot boat runs on a tweaked version of Yamaha\u2019s powerful 450hp XTO outboard engine, but instead of gasoline, it\u2019s fueled by gaseous hydrogen.",
      "Matt Van Benschoten from Roush, who\u2019s been deeply involved in the project, called it\u00a0\"a big moment.\" He handled the tricky job of designing and integrating the hydrogen fuel system, making sure everything was safe and worked smoothly.",

      "Yamaha started with their largest offshore outboard, the XTO 450, and made some smart changes to handle hydrogen. They adjusted parts like the cylinder heads, fuel lines and injectors to work with hydrogen\u2019s unique properties. But most of the engine is still the same as the gasoline version.",
      "The boat itself was modified to fit three high-pressure hydrogen tanks, each holding fuel at 700 bar (that\u2019s super-high pressure). These tanks are designed to expand as they fill up, so Yamaha\u2019s engineers had to come up with clever mounting solutions that let the tanks move a bit without causing problems. Though Yamaha hasn't disclosed the gasoline equivalency of the hydrogen tanks, they are striving to achieve optimal capacity for marine industry applications.",

      "Safety is a huge focus here. The boat uses a standard hydrogen refueling connector and follows strict protocols to make sure filling up is safe and efficient. There\u2019s even tank monitoring feedback between the boat and the fueling station that monitors tank conditions and can stop refueling if things get too hot.",
      "Inside the boat, multiple hydrogen detectors keep an eye on gas levels. If hydrogen starts to build up, the system alerts the captain. If it gets too high, the engine shuts down and vents the gas safely. Plus, Roush designed a special ventilation system to make sure any leaked hydrogen escapes from the highest points on the boat, since hydrogen is lighter than air and rises.",

They\u2019ve built two boats so far: one for display and one for real-world testing. Now, the team is focused on fine-tuning the system, running safety tests and figuring out how far the boat can go on a tank of hydrogen. They\u2019re also working on making refueling faster and more convenient.",
      "Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Challenges and possibilities of hydrogen technology",
      "Right now, the tanks are cylindrical and take up a lot of space, limiting how much hydrogen the boat can carry. However, in the future, Yamaha hopes to use other tank alternatives to integrate more efficiently and fit better inside the boat hull. Finding the right parts for these super-high-pressure hydrogen systems isn\u2019t easy either; the supply chain is still catching up. However, with partners like Roush and Regulator Marine, Yamaha is pushing through these challenges.",
      "And it\u2019s not stopping there. Yamaha recently acquired electric outboard maker Torqeedo, showing they\u2019re serious about exploring all kinds of clean marine propulsion technologies.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says an Apple Watch saved psychiatrist Amanda Faulkner by detecting deadly leukemia early.",
      "In recent years, smartwatches have gone far beyond just telling the time or tracking steps. These little gadgets on our wrists are becoming powerful health tools, quietly monitoring our bodies and sometimes even alerting us to serious medical issues before we realize something\u2019s wrong. From tracking heart rate and sleep patterns to measuring blood oxygen levels, smartwatches are helping people stay more in tune with their health than ever before.",

      "Apple Watch saves woman\u2019s life (Amanda Faulkner) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The life-saving power of wearable technology",
      "Take Amanda Faulkner\u2019s story, for example. Amanda, a consultant psychiatrist from New Zealand, was feeling unusually tired and hot one summer, but she just put it down to the heat or maybe perimenopause. She was busy with over 60 patients and didn\u2019t think much of it. But her new\u00a0Apple Watch kept sending alerts that her resting heart rate was way higher than normal, jumping from her usual 55 beats per minute up into the 90s.",
      "At first, she thought the watch was wrong. She was fit and healthy, after all, and she had even recently been hiking. However, the notifications kept coming every morning, and eventually Amanda decided to see her GP. That decision probably saved her life.",
      "Within hours of tests, she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, a rare and aggressive blood cancer. Doctors told her that if she had waited another 48 hours, she might not have survived.",

      "HOW TO CHECK YOUR HEARTBEAT WITH THE EKG APP ON YOUR APPLE WATCH",
      "The wider impact of Amanda\u2019s story",
      "Amanda\u2019s experience shows just how powerful these wearable devices can be, not as medical diagnosis tools but as early warning systems that encourage people to seek help sooner. Apple, for instance, is clear that its heart monitoring features aren\u2019t meant to replace doctors but to provide useful information that can prompt users to get checked out. Elevated heart rates can signal many things, from infections to allergic reactions, and catching these signs early can make all the difference.",
      "Amanda's husband, Mike, told us, \"The positive press from this story has also led to many friends and family members deciding to act on health concerns and/or buy an\u00a0Apple Watch, and I have seen many similar comments on social media where the post has been replicated. She has also had complete strangers come to see her in the hospital to discuss their own cancer journeys, and as Amanda cannot work in her role as a psychiatrist, these interactions have been great, allowing Amanda to \u2018help\u2019 people again, which, after all, is her vocation in life.\"",
      "Amanda remains in treatment, including chemotherapy and an upcoming stem cell transplant, but she remains optimistic and grateful for the smartwatch that gave her a fighting chance. She urges others, especially women who often have their symptoms dismissed, to trust their instincts and advocate for their health.",
      "Apple Watch saves woman\u2019s life (Amanda Faulkner) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO MONITOR BLOOD PRESSURE WITH YOUR APPLE WATCH",
      "Limitations and risks of smartwatch health monitoring",
      "While smartwatches offer incredible benefits, it\u2019s important to recognize their limitations. These devices are not medical-grade tools and can sometimes produce false positives or miss critical health issues. Overreliance on smartwatch data may lead to unnecessary anxiety or, conversely, false reassurance. Additionally, not everyone\u2019s body responds the same way, and factors like skin tone, movement or device placement can affect accuracy. Privacy and data security are also concerns, as sensitive health information is transmitted and stored digitally. It\u2019s essential to view smartwatches as supplementary tools that can prompt users to seek professional medical advice rather than definitive diagnoses.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Smartwatches are more than just tech accessories; they\u2019re becoming essential health companions. While they don\u2019t replace professional medical advice, their ability to monitor vital signs continuously and alert users to potential problems is transforming how we approach health. Amanda Faulkner\u2019s story is a powerful reminder that sometimes the smallest devices can make the biggest difference, literally saving lives by catching warning signs early. So, if your smartwatch starts \"nagging\" you about your health, it might just be worth paying attention to it.",

      "Data breaches usually happen for one reason \u2014 financial gain. This often involves selling stolen information to scammers or hackers who use it for fraudulent activities, such as running credit fraud schemes. Since many forms of identity theft revolve around credit accounts, it\u2019s crucial to take action if your or a loved one\u2019s personal data has been exposed.",
      "One of the most effective ways to prevent credit fraud is by placing a security freeze on your credit accounts. A security freeze stops anyone from opening new accounts, issuing new cards or conducting any credit-related activities in your name while the freeze is in place.",
      "If managing this process feels overwhelming, consider using an identity theft protection service. These services can handle placing and managing security freezes on your behalf, saving you time and ensuring the process is done correctly. Many of these services also offer additional features, such as credit monitoring and alerts, to help you stay on top of potential threats to your personal information. Taking this step can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind that your financial information is secure.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "A fraud alert is an extra layer of protection for your credit accounts. Like a credit freeze, you can set it up with all three credit bureaus.",
      "When you activate a fraud alert, it notifies the bureaus that there may be suspicious activity on your account. As a result, any attempts to open new credit or make changes will be looked at more carefully.",
      "Equifax: You can place a\u00a0fraud alert online\u00a0or by calling their customer support at (888) 298-0045.",

      "Now that your credit accounts are secured, there\u2019s one more step worth taking, a broader layer of protection. I\u2019m talking about personal data removal services.

      "Cybercriminals are constantly finding new ways to steal your data. As people become more aware of common threats like phishing links, fake websites, fraudulent emails and impersonation scams, attackers are becoming more creative in their approach.",
      "One of the newer methods they are using involves targeting USB flash drives. It may seem surprising that they would focus on something as simple as a flash drive, but the data it holds can be valuable.",
      "Plus, flash drives can be used to spread malware to other devices.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "Person plugging USB flash drive into laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why target USB flash drives?",
      "USB drives are ubiquitous in workplaces, especially in environments with air-gapped systems or restricted internet access, such as those in government and energy sectors. This makes them an easy target for data theft and malware propagation. Often, these drives store sensitive files that are not available on networked systems.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "When infected, USB drives can spread\u00a0malware not just within a single organization but also across multiple entities if shared. These attacks don\u2019t rely on network vulnerabilities, allowing them to bypass traditional security tools.",
      "USB flash drive plugged into laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "How hackers are targeting your USB drives",
      "As reported by\u00a0Kaspersky's Securelist, a cybersecurity research platform, hackers are using USB drives to spread malware in ways that can easily bypass traditional security systems. One group, known as GOFFEE, kicks off its attacks with targeted phishing emails. These emails often carry infected RAR files or Office documents with harmful macros. Once opened, they install sneaky programs like PowerModul and PowerTaskel on the victim\u2019s system.",
      "These tools don\u2019t just sit around. They lay the groundwork for more attacks. PowerModul, in particular, plays a big role. It\u2019s a PowerShell script introduced in 2024 that talks to a command-and-control server. From there, it can download and run other tools, including two especially dangerous ones, FlashFileGrabber and USB Worm.",
      "FlashFileGrabber is made to steal data from USB drives. It can either save stolen files locally or send them back to the hacker's server. Then there\u2019s USB Worm, which infects any USB drive it finds with PowerModul, turning that drive into a tool for spreading malware to other systems.",
      "What makes this method effective is that USB drives are often shared between people and offices. That physical movement allows the malware to spread even without an internet connection. The malware hides original files on the USB and replaces them with malicious scripts disguised as normal-looking shortcuts. When someone clicks one of these, they unknowingly trigger the infection.",

      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "4 practical ways to stay safe from USB-targeted attacks",
      "1. Don\u2019t plug in unknown USB drives:\u00a0It might sound obvious, but this is one of the most common ways malware spreads. If you find a USB drive lying around or someone gives you one you weren\u2019t expecting, avoid plugging it into your system. Attackers often rely on human curiosity to get the malware onto your machine.",
      "2.\u00a0Be extra cautious with email attachments:\u00a0GOFFEE\u2019s campaigns often begin with phishing emails carrying malicious RAR files or Office documents with macros. Always double-check the sender\u2019s address and never open unexpected attachments, especially if they ask you to \"enable macros\" or come from unknown contacts. When in doubt, confirm through a different channel.",
      "3. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many attacks like GOFFEE\u2019s start with emails that look legitimate but contain malicious links. These links might lead you to fake login pages or silently download malware that sets the stage for USB-targeting tools like PowerModul.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Scan USB drives before use:\u00a0The USB Worm infects USB drives by hiding original files and planting malicious scripts disguised as shortcuts, which trigger PowerModul when clicked. FlashFileGrabber also steals files silently from USBs, often going unnoticed. Always scan USB drives with updated antivirus software before opening any files. Use a reputable security tool to check for hidden scripts, unusual shortcuts or unexpected executables. If files appear renamed or hidden, don\u2019t click them until verified safe.",
      "How to scan a USB flash drive for malware (PC & Mac)",
      "No matter which antivirus tool you use, it\u2019s essential to scan USB flash drives as soon as you plug them in. Here\u2019s how to do it on both platforms:",
      "For Windows PC",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Cybercriminals thrive where convenience meets oversight. However, it\u2019s worth considering why USBs remain such a soft target. They\u2019re not just storage but a cultural artifact of workplaces, especially in high-stakes sectors like energy or government, where offline data transfer feels safer than the cloud. But that trust is a blind spot. Attackers like GOFFEE don\u2019t need zero days because they can exploit human habits such as sharing drives, skipping scans and clicking without thinking.",

      "Some credit cards include RFID chips that make contactless payments easy and convenient. However, this same feature can be exploited if someone with the right equipment gets close enough to scan your card without your knowledge. Using\u00a0RFID-blocking gear such as a wallet, card sleeve or passport holder is a simple and affordable way to prevent this type of theft. These items are widely available and effective at blocking unauthorized scans.",
      "Limiting the number of cards you bring reduces the risk of your wallet being lost or stolen. Ideally,\u00a0take only one or two credit cards that you plan to use during your trip. Keep any backup cards in your hotel safe and store a secure digital record of your card details in a\u00a0password manager.

      "Most credit card companies offer instant notifications through their mobile apps. Turning on transaction alerts ensures you\u2019ll be notified the moment your card is used, allowing you to spot suspicious activity quickly. If your card issuer offers the ability to lock your card directly from the app, enable that feature as well, so you can act immediately if anything looks off.",
      "Public Wi-Fi at airports, hotels and caf\u00e9s is rarely secure.

Gently wiggle the card reader or look for anything that seems loose, bulky or out of place. When possible, use ATMs inside banks or secure buildings instead of freestanding machines, which are easier for thieves to target.",
      "Many credit card apps now allow you to temporarily lock your card with a single tap. If you're not planning to use a card for a day or two, consider locking it until you're ready to make a purchase. This simple habit adds an extra layer of protection. If someone tries to use the card while it\u2019s locked, the transaction will be declined.",
      "Apple Pay and\u00a0Google Pay provide an additional level of security by creating unique, one-time-use codes for every transaction.

      "\"We have been told it\u2019s one of the most active courts in the nation,\" Tate said. \"This place is unique because it\u2019s one of the few in the country that were designed and built for ICE and immigration. It was designed for this purpose.\"",
      "Bret Bradford, the Field Office Director, said these detention facilities are not punitive; they are strictly for the purposes of removal.",

      "\"We only have so much bed space, so we prioritize the cases,\" Bradford said. \"There are some cases that by law have to be detained. They are mandatory detention. They are terrorism cases, extremely silent cases, expedited removal cases, things like that.\"",

Men and women were kept separate, many just sitting on bunk beds and reading books. Some throwing up peace signs at us and smiling, while others were giving thumbs down.",
      "\"There many false narratives and misinformation that's out there, especially with groups that oppose immigration enforcement. I think it's very important for us to get out there and say the true narrative,\" Bradford said.",
      "The main two narratives Bradford wanted dispel was the access to medical and legal care.",

There are multiple avenues. Not to mention, attorneys can visit anytime. There are rooms set up for attorney client visition, so they have privacy to discuss their cases.\"",
      "During the visit, we also saw the medical center and where detainees first get screened.",
      "\"Medical care is something that is criticized all the time,\" Bradford said. \"I think it\u2019s unfair. When they get booked in and assessed, we find conditions, medical conditions that they didn't even know they had and left untreated.\"",

A lot have already done. So we don't want them repeating their crimes or further victimizing the community. So we certainly want to protect the community and keep those people out of the community.

      "According to the ADL's calculations in its annual antisemitism audit, there were more than 25 \"targeted anti-Jewish incidents\" per day in 2024, more than one every hour. In its audit, the ADL detailed the types of antisemitic incidents recorded: 196 assaults (up 21% since 2023), 2,606 incidents of vandalism (up 20% since 2023) and 6,552 incidents of harassment (up from 6,535 in 2023).",
      "This is the fourth year in a row that the number of antisemitic incidents across the country broke previous records. The ADL characterized this as part of the \"continued post-Oct. 7 spike\" in antisemitism.",
      "\"Let\u2019s be clear, antisemitism is an irrational hatred of individuals or institutions just because they are Jewish,\" ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt told Fox News Digital.

      "For the first time, the ADL found that a majority of antisemitic incidents (58%, or 5,452 occurrences) were related to Israel or Zionism. Most of these incidents, 2,596, took place at anti-Israel rallies, including antisemitic speeches, chants and slogans. However, the ADL clarified in its audit that \"antisemitic expressions\" at rallies were counted as a single incident, regardless of repetition. Of the more than 5,000 rallies tracked, about half included antisemitic expressions, and the ones that did not were excluded from the audit.",

      "The White House did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions about what it would mean should the U.S. walk away from one of Trump\u2019s top campaign trail issues: ending the war in Ukraine.",

      "The administration also has not clarified if Washington would take retaliatory measures against Putin, as Trump threatened to do last month.",
      "\"Simply because Trump hasn\u2019t announced any consequences yet does not mean that he doesn\u2019t plan on taking some anti-Russia measures,\" former DIA intelligence officer and Russia expert Rebekah Koffler told Fox News Digital. \"Trump almost certainly intends for his economic warfare against China to serve as an example to Putin how far Trump is willing to go to compel his adversaries to his will.\"",
      "\"But unlike the China case, there\u2019s no similar dependence between the U.S. and Russia. Trump\u2019s decision on Russia is much more complicated, more risky and requires more thought,\" she added. \"He may or may not take draconian economic steps against Russia, as Putin may take devastating, non-kinetic actions against the U.S.",
      "\"It\u2019s Trump\u2019s risk tolerance vs. Putin\u2019s now,\" Koffler said. \"And both like to win and both have risk tolerance way above average.\"",

      "The White House did not respond to questions by Fox News Digital on whether the U.S. would still aid Ukraine in some capacity, particularly given recent restrictions on military aid Trump has implemented on Kyiv, like refusing to sell Patriot missiles previously used to defend civilian populations from Russian strikes and that cost $1.5 billion a piece.",
      "\"If we want to be a global superpower, and we want to deter aggression, not with U.S. troops on the ground, but in general, to deter aggression because it is good for our national security, then we should continue to support Ukraine,\" former CIA Moscow Station Chief Dan Hoffman told Fox News Digital. \"It's a tiny percentage of the Department of Defense budget.\"",

      "Special envoy Steve Witkoff is reportedly set to return to Moscow this week to continue negotiations with Russian officials, though the Kremlin has not indicated they are anywhere near agreeing to ceasefire terms, let alone a peace deal.",
      "A spokesperson for Putin, Dmitry Peskov, on Tuesday reportedly said the issue of Russia\u2019s invasion was too \"complex\" to achieve a quick fix and warned against rushing into a deal.",
      "\"It is not worth setting any rigid time frames and trying to get a settlement, a viable settlement, in a short time frame,\" he said.",
      "The Kremlin\u2019s position has given credence to repeated warnings from security experts that Putin is not interested in securing a peace deal with Ukraine.",
      "\"There's no indication that Putin wants to stop the war,\" Hoffman said. \"That isn't surprising. Because for a war to end, somebody has to win or both sides have to be so tired they can't continue to fight.",
      "\"Russia is the invader, so you have to stop them in order to have an end of the war,\" he added. \"The one consistent thing here is Putin is continuing to fight. His objective is to overthrow the government in Ukraine. He\u2019s going to keep fighting until he feels like he has accomplished that goal or he can't fight anymore.\"",

      "Koffler echoed Hoffman\u2019s position: \"Putin\u00a0will be pursuing the same strategy regardless of Trump\u2019s actions; that is continuing the war of attrition until Ukraine capitulates or is completely destroyed and the government collapses.\"",
      "\"Putin would like to string Trump along and will continue to try doing so,\" she added.",
      "A report by the Moscow Times on Tuesday cited sources close to Putin and said the Kremlin chief is looking to reorder the global \"spheres of influence\" by negotiating leverage points between the U.S. and adversaries like Iran and North Korea.",
      "The article claimed that Putin would attempt to get Trump to either force a less-than-desirable deal for Ukraine or potentially stop the U.S. from aiding Kyiv by proposing personally enticing deals, like allowing Trump to build a hotel in Moscow, and geopolitical wins, like securing a nuclear agreement with Iran and a \"peace deal\" in Ukraine.",

      "Fox News Digital could not verify the report\u2019s claims, but Koffler agreed it could be a strategy that Putin is looking to employ as the U.S. pushes deals across Europe and the Middle East.",
      "\"He could promise Trump not to share certain sensitive technologies to these two [nations],\" Koffler said. \"And he could convince Iran not to operationalize and weaponize its nuclear program in exchange for Trump\u2019s promise not to target Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in a kinetic strike and to lift sanctions from Russia.",
      "\"The important aspect of all of this is to give these adversaries face-saving opportunities, which is not a strong point for the U.S. style of diplomacy,\" Koffler said. \"But Putin\u2019s ability to convince Trump and Trump\u2019s decision calculus are two different things.\"",

      "One of the most controversial aspects of Pope Francis\u2019 legacy as the leader of the Catholic Church is his decision to restrict an older form of the Catholic liturgy known as the Traditional Latin Mass.",
      "Francis explained that he decided to restrict the Latin Mass because he was concerned its use was leading to division in the Church. Francis said he felt the more ancient mass was \"being used in an ideological way\" in reaction to modernity, including the more modern Vatican II mass.",
      "The mass consists of the \"Liturgy of the Word\" and \"Liturgy of the Eucharist,\" the latter of which is considered the most sacred and highest form of worship by Catholics.",
      "The Latin Mass, which was formalized by Pope St. Pius V in 1570 and continues to be practiced by some Catholics today, has several key differences from the more common Vatican II mass, which was instituted in 1969. These differences include the entirety of the mass being said in Latin and the priest facing \"ad orientem\" (\"to the east\") rather than facing the congregation.",

      "During his 12-year pontificate, Francis took several actions to limit the use of the Latin Mass throughout the world. The result was that the Latin Mass was relegated to a very limited number of churches, with it often only being offered by priests belonging to specific orders expressly devoted to it.",
      "In 2021, Francis issued a set of instructions, called a \"motu proprio,\" in which he placed sweeping restrictions on the Latin Mass, including requiring priests wanting to say the mass to seek express approval from their local bishops. In 2023, Francis issued additional restrictions on the Latin Mass, requiring bishops to obtain express approval from the Vatican to allow it to be said in their jurisdictions and barring newly ordained priests from saying it.",
      "The instructions diverged from the policy of Francis\u2019 predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who had allowed all priests to say the Latin Mass.",
      "In a conversation with Jesuits in 2023, Francis explained that he felt his predecessor\u2019s allowances \"were being used in an ideological way, to go backward.\"",

      "\"The danger today is indietrismo, the reaction against the modern. It is a nostalgic disease,\" he said. \"This is why I decided that now the permission to celebrate according to the Roman Missal of 1962 [the Latin Mass] is mandatory for all newly consecrated priests.\"",
      "Francis said the restriction was \"necessary to stop this indietrismo, which was not in the pastoral vision of my predecessors.\"",

      "Francis' move to change these papal funeral traditions, some of which date all the way back to ancient Rome, stemmed from a desire to emphasize that the pope is \"that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world,\" according to Archbishop Diego Ravelli, the head of\u00a0papal liturgical ceremonies who reportedly worked with Francis to help make the revisions. The rewrite was also preceded by the unusual circumstances of Pope Benedict XVI's funeral, which deviated from traditional papal funerals on account of the fact he was a retired pope rather than a reigning one.",
      "The new funeral rites were formally approved by Francis in 2023 and were later published in the church's liturgical guidelines in early 2024. Around the same time he was working on these revisions, the pope revealed during an interview with a Spanish-language broadcaster that he would not be buried in the grottoes of the Vatican like his predecessors, but rather at Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome. The new papal rights make it permissible for future popes to be buried outside the Vatican as well.",
      "POPE FRANCIS DEAD AT 88, VATICAN SAYS",
      "In addition to the different burial location, the new papal funeral rites have amended the way the pope will be viewed by the public following his death. In the past, the pope's body would be displayed on an elevated frame known as a bier. But, under the new funeral structure, the pope will be laid directly into an open coffin, eliminating the use of the bier. Pope Francis also eliminated the practice of being buried in three coffins made of cypress, lead and oak.",
      "The location of where Francis would be declared deceased changed too. It went from taking place in the papal bedroom to now inside the papal chapel located at the Vatican. The new rules also require that Pope Francis' remains be immediately put into a simplistic wooden-lined coffin after he is determined to have passed.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 America may be well on its way to forgetting Joe Biden; its president isn\u2019t.",
      "Donald Trump spoke Biden\u2019s name more than a dozen times on Jan. 20, day one of his second presidency, and from that point forward he has basically never stopped.",
      "As he nears the 100th day of his term, Trump has invoked his predecessor with a persistence that suggests the two are in the final throes of a bitter campaign. They aren\u2019t and won\u2019t ever be again: Biden pulled his name off the 2024 ballot and left elective office for good. But for Trump there is a certain political upside in making Biden a perpetual bogeyman.",
      "Mentioning Biden reminds voters that not so long ago, they were unhappy enough with high prices and illegal border crossings that they repudiated him and his hand-picked successor, Kamala Harris. Biden may also be a useful diversion from the whiplash of Trump\u2019s term, shifting attention to the aged ex-president who struggled through speeches and looked unsteady on his feet.",
      "As children pushed their pink and yellow eggs at the White House\u2019s annual Easter Egg Roll on Monday, Trump mingled with the crowd and mocked Biden over an incident that many may have forgotten, if they were ever aware of it at all. Three years ago, Biden hosted the Easter Egg Roll and was redirected at one point by an\u00a0aide dressed in a bunny costume.",
      "\u201cDo you remember the bunny with Joe Biden?\u201d Trump said. \u201cDo you remember when the bunny took Joe Biden out? He\u2019s not taking Trump out.\u201d\u00a0At that, a costume bunny standing alongside\u00a0shook its head in agreement.",
      "Amplifying the point, the White House\u2019s official account on X posted video of the moment with the caption \u201cThe White House is no longer a nursing home.\u201d",
      "In a statement for this article, White House spokesperson Liz Huston also invoked Biden and the work Trump has done moving on from his predecessor's administration.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has spent the first three months of his presidency cleaning up the disasters created by Joe Biden and Making America Great Again,\" Huston said. \"Under President Trump\u2019s leadership, the border is secure, inflation is cooling, jobs are up, and common sense is restored.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s running commentary on Biden brims with grievances large and small. To this day, he says he legitimately won the 2020 election. He has blamed Biden and other Democrats for the criminal investigations he faced in the aftermath.",
      "\u201cThe 2020 election was totally rigged,\u201d he told reporters last month aboard Air Force One. He described Biden as a kind of\u00a0presidential impostor who\u00a0usurped Trump\u2019s rightful place and then did\u00a0\u201csuch a bad job.\u201d",
      "In his Oval Office meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in February, the topic turned to the war between Russia and Ukraine. After he lay blame on Biden, Trump said it pained him to say as much.",
      "\u201cI hate to say that about somebody that sat here just before me, but he did a terrible, terrible job,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Unpleasant as it may be, Trump seldom tires of it.",

      "Trump\u2019s beef extends from matters of high foreign policy to White House decor.\u00a0In February, he said he had approached the Biden administration with an offer to build a ballroom for the White House \u2014 something \u201cbeautiful\u201d at a cost of about $100 million \u2014 but never heard back.",
      "\u201cThis question takes me back to 2017 and everyone asking why he mentions Hillary so much,\u201d said Michael Dubke, a White House communications director in Trump\u2019s first term. \u201c\u2018She lost; you won. Let\u2019s move on, Mr. President.\u2019 The foil is key to his central premise that those that came before broke it and I will fix it. Even now that the campaign is over, the foil still has value.\u201d",
      "There may be another dynamic at work. Always mindful of his popularity, Trump may see Biden as competition for a place in the history books. In the zero-sum game of presidential rankings, if Biden falls in history\u2019s estimation, Trump could rise.",
      "\u201cIn MAGA land, Biden was a false president. And Trump is trying to keep banging that drum so he can drive that narrative into the history books,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian.",
      "The numbers tell the story \u2014 of a president who, as much as he may want to make America great again, would be happy to see Americans abhor Biden for all time.",
      "So far, Trump has spoken about Biden, his family or his administration at least 580 times either in public remarks or on his social media site, an NBC News analysis shows. That\u2019s an average of six times every day of his presidency.",
      "After he won the 2020 election, by contrast, Biden mentioned Trump 29 times in the first 100 days of his presidency. That\u2019s an average\u00a0of once every 3\u00bd days. Even then, he did so with a certain reluctance.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m tired of talking about Donald Trump,\u201d Biden said at a town hall-style event.",
      "Last month Trump used a televised event showcasing Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla vehicles to take multiple digs at Biden. Holding notes showing prices of Tesla cars, Trump said: \u201cThey gave me notes. I said, \u2018I\u2019m not Biden, I don\u2019t need notes.\u2019\u201d",
      "He then climbed into a red Model S sitting on the White House\u2019s South Lawn.",
      "\u201cYou think Biden could get into that car?\u201d he told the assembled reporters.",
      "Trump has given no sign that his preoccupation with Biden is waning. He\u2019s using the ample communication tools at a president\u2019s disposal to keep his predecessor front and center, with aides and subordinates stepping forward to sustain the drumbeat.",
      "Trump\u2019s White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has mentioned Biden 78 times in the 16 briefings she has given thus far, including 37 times unprompted in her opening remarks.",
      "Cabinet members have gotten into the act, as well. When he was called upon during a televised Cabinet meeting on April 10, Lee Zeldin, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, opened with \u201cMr. President, the Biden EPA was strangulating the economy.\u201d",
      "Later in the meeting, when it was his turn to speak, Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, told Trump: \u201cYou came into an emergency situation where President Biden left us with a $1.2 trillion trade deficit. It\u2019s the largest of any country in human history.\u201d (A number of economists argue that running a trade deficit isn\u2019t necessarily harmful. The United States gets valuable goods in return.)",
      "Trump jumped in.",
      "\u201cYou said the largest in history, right?\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been anything like what he left us. He left us a mess. His whole administration was a mess.\u201d",
      "Four other officials at the table in the Cabinet Room that day \u2014 Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Kelly Loeffler, head of the Small Business Administration \u2014 also used their public remarks to take swipes at the Biden administration.",
      "At times, Trump-friendly conservative news outlets have teed up fresh opportunities for him to skewer Biden. At a joint news conference at the White House with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a reporter for The Gateway Pundit asked Modi whether he was more confident of a successful relationship with the United States under Trump \u201cversus with Biden\u2019s incompetence and weakness over the last four years.\u201d",
      "Before Modi could answer, Trump laughed.",
      "\u201cI agree with you,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, gross incompetence.\u201d",
      "Since he took office, Trump aides have exercised tighter control over which news outlets are allowed onto Air Force One and into smaller spaces that can accommodate only a certain number of journalists.",
      "In February, the White House stripped The Associated Press of its traditional spot in the small group of journalists allowed to cover the president in such settings, citing its refusal to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the \u201cGulf of America,\u201d the name Trump has given it.",
      "No AP reporters were on board during an Air Force One flight April 13 when Trump stopped by the press cabin to take questions. A reporter from Real America\u2019s Voice was on the plane, however, and at one point posed this question: \u201cHow do you do it, Mr. President? I haven\u2019t stayed up\u00a0to 2 a.m. in the morning since I was 25. And now we\u2019re 2:16 in the morning having a press conference. How do you do it?\u201d",
      "\u201cBiden was sleeping for 10 hours already,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Asked about Trump\u2019s fixation with Biden, a White House aide to the former president said: \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s his attempt to distract from what he\u2019s doing to the economy. I also don\u2019t think he is over the fact that Biden beat him in 2020,\u201d the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely.",
      "Denouncing Biden is easy enough; proving the point is tougher.",
      "Trump has faulted Biden for giving Ukraine aid in the form of a grant, as opposed to the Europeans, who he said will be getting their money back. Both Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron corrected him on that point in separate Oval Office meetings.",
      "He has accused Biden of weaponizing government and said he ended the practice. Trump\u2019s detractors say he has used his power to retaliate against perceived political foes, including Chris Krebs, who was a Homeland Security official in the first term. Trump signed an executive memo this month yanking Krebs\u2019 security clearance. Among the sins spelled out in the memo was Krebs\u2019 denial that the 2020 election was \u201crigged and stolen.\u201d",
      "An argument Trump makes is that Russian President Vladimir Putin so disrespected Biden that he felt free to wage war with Ukraine. Now that Biden is gone and Trump is back in the n White House, \u201cPresident Putin wants to have peace,\u201d Trump told reporters in February.",
      "Putin, he said, \u201cdidn\u2019t want to have peace with Biden. And you tell me why that is, OK?\u201d",
      "Though Trump promised during the campaign to end the war on his first day as president, administration officials have lately sounded resigned to its continuation. Indeed, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this month that the United States may be ready to \u201cmove on\u201d from its attempts to broker a peace agreement.",
      "As the 100-day milestone approaches, Trump is nearing the point where it\u2019s becoming harder to blame Biden for what goes wrong.",
      "Trump\u2019s start-and-stop approach to worldwide tariffs has rattled the financial markets, jeopardizing the 401(k) plans that millions of people rely on for retirement. Consumer confidence has dropped.",
      "People may now be less interested in what Biden did than in how Trump will dig out of a hole rooted in his seesawing trade policies.",
      "\u201cIt always gets more challenging to blame current conditions on your predecessor the farther you get from your predecessor\u2019s time in office,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. \u201cThat\u2019s especially true with the economy, which has reacted rather strongly to Trump\u2019s tariffs and trade war.\u201d",

      "After news of Pope Francis\u2019 death broke Monday, the film \u201cConclave\u201d had a viewership boost across streaming platforms it was available to watch on, according to Luminate, an entertainment data analytics company.",
      "Edward Berger\u2019s drama, which won the Oscar this year for best adapted screenplay, goes behind the scenes of the Vatican for the secretive process of electing a pope. The process is complicated further by power-hungry cardinals, played by Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and John Lithgow. (The film\u2019s distributor is Focus Features, a unit of NBC News\u2019 parent corporation, Comcast.)",
      "Since its release in October, the movie has spawned a fervent fan base online, with many social media users circulating a slew of viral memes and passionate fan edits comparing it to pop culture staples like \u201cThe Real Housewives\u201d and \u201cMean Girls.\u201d",

The movie was watched an average of 1.8 million minutes Sunday. The number surged to 6.9 million minutes watched Monday, Luminate\u00a0said.",
      "A spokesperson for Focus Features did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the streaming data.",
      "On social media, many pointed out that the film\u2019s plot mirrored current news headlines, including stories about who could succeed Pope Francis.",
      "Some \u201cConclave\u201d fans did not appear surprised by the film\u2019s resurgence in the zeitgeist.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of grief and pain attached to current events, and being able to use Conclave memes as a common/shared language of community offers some brevity and humor to a clandestine process and historical event that will significantly alter the trajectory of many peoples\u2019 lives,\u201d said the administrator behind Pope Crave, a fan account on X\u00a0that is dedicated to all things \u201cConclave.\u201d",
      "Pope Crave, who has 16,000 followers on X, asked NBC News by email to use only their username, citing a need for \u201cseparation\u201d between their professional work and \u201cfandom extracurriculars.\u201d",
      "\u201cI cannot speak for the religious breakdown of \u2018Conclave\u2019 fans, but it doesn\u2019t shock me that Catholic fans of the film would be engaged in the actual papal conclave outcomes,\u201d Pope Crave said. \u201cAnd for the non-Catholic \u2018Conclave\u2019 fans, I would hypothesize there\u2019s something to be said about the abrupt relevance and sudden application of their film knowledge and fandom enthusiasm to a seismically important current global event that holds importance to over 1.25 billion practitioners (and even more non-believers).\u201d",
      "Michael Moreland, a professor of law and religion at Villanova University, said the mass appeal of \u201cConclave\u201d captured how, even in a secular modern age, there is still pervasive intrigue around \u201cthe ancient rituals of the Catholic Church.\u201d",
      "The conclave process involves a gathering of Catholic Church cardinals, who are senior advisers to the pope (based in the Vatican or around the world), under age 80. Bound by an oath of secrecy, the cardinals vote in the Sistine Chapel via paper ballots until a pope is elected by a two-thirds majority.",
      "\u201cAll the charisma and the mystery around Catholicism and the ways in which these men in the College of Cardinals go about assembling and deliberating and voting in the secret process that no one except one of them has seen,\u201d Moreland said, \u201call of that is very fascinating.\u201d",
      "\u201cConclave\u201d paints a relatively accurate picture of the way candidates rise and fall throughout the intense balloting process, which can last for however many days it takes to reach the required two-thirds vote, Moreland said. He was disappointed, however, in the film\u2019s outsize focus on \u201ccrude right-left divides.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe significance of the theological and spiritual aspects of Catholicism and this process of electing a pope was kind of reduced into partisan politics,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cI was a head Texas high school head coach for 28 years, and coached 38 years in high school and I\u2019ve had Division I quarterbacks,\u201d Van Meter said. \u201cThe ball didn\u2019t come out of the hands like that on anybody I\u2019ve ever coached.\u201d",
      "Yet when Van Meter evangelized about Ward\u2019s skill set to the network of college coaches he\u2019d cultivated over the decades, all he heard was pushback. Ward played in a small town and in an offense far from the norm and that offered few opportunities to pass. It was enough to scare off recruiters. He entered the summer of 2019, just weeks before his final high school season, without a single college scholarship offer.",
      "\u201cIt got to the point where I was just kind of questioning myself,\u201d Van Meter said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Do I even know anything about this? Why aren\u2019t these people seeing this?\u2019 I know no one throws it like this kid does.\u201d",
      "Nearly six years later, Ward, now 22, is projected to walk across the stage Thursday at the NFL draft as the No. 1 selection \u2014 and in the process become perhaps the unlikeliest top pick in the league\u2019s modern history. It\u2019s not just that Ward began his college career at a lower rung \u2014 it's that he barely had the chance to play college football at all. It\u2019s why many close to Ward believe the biggest question about him was never about his talent, but whether any college program would take the risk to recognize it.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had numerous coaches tell me how much they loved him, and they just couldn\u2019t take a chance,\u201d said Eric Morris, who offered Ward his first and only college scholarship when he was the head coach at the University of the Incarnate Word, a private Catholic school in Texas. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, yeah, yeah \u2014 whatever. Of course you do now that he\u2019s had all that success.\u2019\u201d",
      "From Baker Mayfield, who turned down Division I scholarship offers to walk on at Texas Tech before finding fame at Oklahoma, to offensive lineman Eric Fisher, who was unheralded when he signed with Division I Central Michigan, overlooked recruits have gone on to be selected No. 1 in the NFL draft. Quarterbacks Josh Allen (Wyoming) and Aaron Rodgers (California) also went from being lightly recruited high schoolers to earning NFL MVP honors.",
      "Yet these are exceptions in a draft in which recruiting rankings have been shown to correlate to future NFL draft selections. Five-star recruits hold a much higher chance of becoming first-round picks.",
      "When Ward showed up at Incarnate Word\u2019s campus in San Antonio for a football camp in the summer of 2019, he was not an unknown commodity among Texas college coaches. The previous year, Ward and his father had attended as many college camps as possible to gain the exposure he\u2019d lacked as the starter in high school in West Columbia, a small city an hour south of Houston. There, Ward\u2019s team ran a \u201cWing T\u201d offense that primarily ran the ball, a style that was an anachronism in a state in which the spread offense was king, with quarterbacks throwing sometimes 50 times a game to four or five receivers.",
      "Brent Mascheck, Ward\u2019s high school coach, said he felt it was a \u201ccop-out\u201d for recruiters to cite the Wing T as a drawback in assessing Ward's talent, rather than trusting their own projections.",
      "From Austin to Dallas, Ward crossed the state hoping that displaying the arm that was rarely unleashed on his high school tapes could earn him a scholarship. Yet, at a time when it has never been easier for a recruit to be noticed \u2014 thanks to athletes' own social media posts and the booming media coverage around high school football recruiting \u2014 Ward held zero scholarship offers only weeks before his senior season. On a five-star recruiting scale, Ward had zero.",
      "Texas A&M, like a handful of other schools, was close to offering but ultimately never did, Van Meter said. To Mascheck and Van Meter, several college coaches expressed a sentiment that goes far beyond the case of Ward \u2014 that it was too politically difficult to vouch for an unheralded recruit over a four- or five-star, even if a coach was convinced the lower-rated player was a better fit.",
      "\u201cIf you try to bring that kid to that head coach, you better know what you\u2019re doing because if you don\u2019t, if that kid doesn\u2019t pan out, then guess what? You\u2019re looking for a job,\u201d Van Meter said.",
      "More from Sports",
      "Quarterbacks were the hottest commodity in last year's NFL draft. Now they're the biggest question.Travis Hunter wants to play both offense and defense. Will the NFL let him? He's one of the top prospects in the NFL draft \u2014 with few stats to back it up",
      "Quarterbacks were the hottest commodity in last year's NFL draft. Now they're the biggest question.",
      "Travis Hunter wants to play both offense and defense. Will the NFL let him?",
      "He's one of the top prospects in the NFL draft \u2014 with few stats to back it up",
      "With less than 6,000 undergraduates in 2019, and playing in the NCAA\u2019s second-highest division, Incarnate Word was a speck in the hierarchy of big-time college football and wasn\u2019t competing for five-stars.",
      "\u201cIt was a little bit easier to take a chance on a kid,\u201d said Morris, now the head coach at North Texas. Success hinged on finding good players who were hidden in plain sight. Ward's performance at the school's camp was \"phenomenal, as good as a camp workout as I've ever seen,\" said Morris, who had coached future NFL quarterbacks Mayfield, Patrick Mahomes and Case Keenum in college.",
      "Yet even then, the school's coaches were \u201csecond-guessing ourselves,\u201d said Mack Leftwich, then offensive coordinator under Morris, to understand why they were seemingly alone in recognizing Ward\u2019s potential.",
      "Said Morris: \u201cWe\u2019re all scratching our heads, kind of, \u2018What are we missing here?\u2019 As a college coach, I think you\u2019re starting to look for all the negatives. What are the negatives about this kid? And just as we kept doing research, there were no negatives.\u201d",
      "Said Leftwich: \u201cIn that situation, you have to just be able to trust your evaluation and trust your instincts on a kid.\u201d",
      "That summer, the staff was still intrigued by Ward\u2019s potential when Morris, during a staff meeting, called Van Meter and put him on speakerphone to ask for his impressions. That no one else had offered made the school cautious to be the first.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Well, Coach, don\u2019t take offense to this, but if Cam was in my offense, or in any spread offense that let him throw the ball 25, 35, 40 times a game, you guys wouldn\u2019t have a shot at him,\u2019\u201d Van Meter said. \u201cAnd everyone on his staff started laughing. But [Morris] said, \u2018Coach, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been talking about \u2014 we think we got a steal.\u2019 I said, \u2018Coach, I promise you, you got a steal.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ward\u2019s throwing mechanics needed polishing and there was the question of how consistent a quarterback who had attempted just 267 passes in three seasons in high school could be when throwing 40 or more attempts per game in college. Mascheck said one college coach was critical of Ward\u2019s frame, which at the time was about 6-foot-1 and around 240 pounds, about 20 pounds heavier than he weighed at February\u2019s NFL Combine.",
      "What sold Incarnate Word was partly watching Ward\u2019s basketball tape. Ward had been raised around the game \u2014 his mother coached at the high school \u2014\u00a0and he played with his eyes up in traffic, anticipating open teammates and driving lanes, a job not dissimilar from playing quarterback. The staff loved that he hated to lose, drawing inspiration from Kobe Bryant. It also didn\u2019t hurt that Incarnate Word wasn\u2019t asking Ward to be its savior.",
      "The school already had an All-American-caliber starter at quarterback whose presence would allow Ward at least two seasons, in Leftwich\u2019s belief, to learn a spread offense as a backup with little pressure. When Covid canceled Incarnate Word\u2019s fall 2020 season, Ward had even more time to learn the spread offense\u2019s nuances during practices.",
      "That extra development time proved critical. Ward walked into Morris\u2019s office on his first day on campus as a freshman and declared he would win the starting job not in two seasons, but that fall. It came true, just three months later, after he\u2019d made \u201cabout one or two plays a day where you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my gosh, this kid has a chance to be special,\u2019\u201d Leftwich said.",
      "\u201cHis confidence in what he does on a day-to-day basis, and not getting nervous or scared no matter who\u2019s across from him, is one of the strongest qualities,\u201d Morris said.",
      "In one practice, Ward somehow curved a pass around an oncoming blitzer perfectly into his receiver\u2019s hands. Leftwich, now the offensive coordinator at Texas Tech, said that hours later, Incarnate Word coaches had gathered to rewatch the play at least 15 times.",
      "Ward was an anomaly. His rise was helped, however, by enrolling in college at a time when NCAA rules changes no longer required transfers to sit out a season, giving players who started at smaller colleges more upward mobility. With the transfer portal open, Ward transferred to Washington State in 2022 (after Morris left to be the Cougars\u2019 offensive coordinator) and then in 2024 to Miami, where he increased his draft stock by replicating his big production against more difficult competition. Along the way, Ward has drawn praise for his coolness under pressure and an outward confidence that puts teammates at ease \u2014 traits that were on display in high school, too, if anyone was looking.",
      "While at Incarnate Word, Ward and his offensive coordinator, Leftwich, spoke about the possibility of him one day playing in the NFL. In fact, before Ward had even played a game for Incarnate Word, Leftwich was spending Thanksgiving in 2020 with his family when he told his father and brother, another college coach, that tiny Incarnate Word had a future NFL quarterback on its roster.",
      "This week, Ward will make that prediction come true. And it may never have happened without the willingness to offer Ward what no other team would.",
      "\u201cHoly cow, we just coached a potential No. 1 overall pick at the University of Incarnate Word,\u201d Leftwich said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unbelievable, honestly.\u201d"

    "summary": "A contract for a sprawling tent city at the Fort Bliss military base in Texas has been terminated, according to a contract record reviewed by NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "A key piece of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to rapidly expand immigration detention capacity by tens of thousands of beds appears to have fallen through, according to two sources and a government contracting document reviewed by NBC News.",
      "Facing a shortage of immigration detention space, President Donald Trump first announced he would add 30,000 beds for immigrants at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the U.S. naval base in Cuba. When that plan fell\u00a0through over cost and logistical issues, the plan shifted to Fort Bliss, a military base in Texas, to build a sprawling tent city for immigrants to be held before deportation.",
      "A $3.8 billion contract was awarded to Deployed Resources, a contractor that has previously provided toilets and tents for concertgoers, victims of natural disasters and, more recently, migrants who were briefly\u00a0detained and processed by Border Patrol.",
      "But last week, new language appeared on the Deployed Resources contract posted to a public records database that says it was terminated. The document says it was terminated \"for convenience\" and cites Trump\u2019s executive order about \u201cradical transparency\" and \"wasteful spending,\u201d but it is unclear whether cost savings played into the decision.",
      "Representatives for Deployed Resources did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "A senior official with the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, confirmed that the contract was terminated but said a \"revised procurement action for Fort Bliss is active and ongoing.\"",
      "\"While we cannot confirm individual pre-decisional conversations, we can confirm that ICE is exploring all options to meet its current and future detention requirements,\" the official added.",
      "The White House and the Defense Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The lack of space to hold immigrants before they are deported has been a bottleneck for\u00a0Trump\u2019s efforts to break records on deportations. And the difficulty in quickly building detention space that meets safety requirements mandated by long-standing federal court settlements may spell problems for overall deportation efforts.\u00a0\u00a0The tent city at Fort Bliss would have been Deployed Resources' first contract for an ICE detention facility, which can sometimes hold migrants for months before they are deported.\u00a0Unlike Border Patrol processing facilities, which can hold immigrants for a maximum of three days, holding migrants at Fort Bliss would mean the tent city there would need to meet ICE standards.",
      "ICE detention centers must provide individual beds, showers, medical care and other services to migrants.",
      "The canceled contract is another obstacle for the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to increase detention to alleviate strains on the system. One hundred-forty-one facilities now hold 47,928 detainees, far above the 41,500 approved by Congress, which means ICE is not funded by Congress for every bed it uses and could face a budget shortfall by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "The sources familiar with ICE detention settings\u00a0said that brick-and-mortar ICE detention centers take longer to build than tent facilities but that they are better equipped to detain immigrants for long periods.",
      "The sources said maintaining tents, or what are referred to as \"soft-sided facilities,\" are also more challenging because of the risks they present for migrants and detention officers.",
      "Federal court settlements require ICE to hold migrants in conditions that are nonpunitive and to give them access to basic necessities like running water and air conditioning, which are more difficult to provide in tents. And such facilities are less secure than buildings, which increases pressures on detention officers."

      "Alejandro never heard back from him. Federal agents detained Adri\u00e1n on his way to his job at a Dallas barbershop.",
      "For the next five weeks, Alejandro has searched for Adri\u00e1n, trying to learn where he was: deported to another country? Held in an immigration facility in the United States?",

      "Their mother went to a detention center in Caracas, Venezuela, where deportees are held when they arrive from the United States, Alejandro said, but she was told no one by her son\u2019s name was there.",
      "They enlisted the help of advocacy groups. Cristosal, a nonprofit organization in El Salvador working with families of presumed deportees to get answers from the U.S. and Salvadoran governments, had no answers. Same with the League of United Latin American Citizens, known as LULAC.",
      "Alejandro\u2019s 6-year-old niece asked him almost every day: When will her dad call her?",

      "The news \u201csaddens me a lot\u201d and \u201cshattered me,\u201d Alejandro said after he heard about his brother\u2019s whereabouts from NBC News.",
      "DHS didn't respond when it was asked whether Adri\u00e1n was sent to CECOT, the mega-prison in El Salvador. But Alejandro fears that's the case, given the many Venezuelans who were sent to CECOT from Texas a few days after he was detained.",
      "\u201cThere, [El Salvador President Nayib] Bukele says demons enter their hell,\" Alejandro said about the prison, speaking on the phone from the restaurant where he works. \"And my brother is not a criminal. At this moment, I don\u2019t feel very good. The news has hit me like a bucket of cold water.\u201d",
      "The Rengel family\u2019s experience echoes the experiences of others who have encountered the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation efforts \u2014 sometimes their family members seemingly disappear after having been taken by immigration authorities.",
      "The administration has prioritized deporting men alleged to be members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which it has designated as a foreign terrorist organization\u00a0under the 1700s-era wartime Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\u201cNeiyerver Adrian Leon Rengel, entered our country illegally in 2023 from Venezuela and is an associate of Tren De Aragua,\u201d DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told NBC News by email.\u00a0\u201cTren de Aragua is vicious gang that rapes, maims, and murders for sport. President Trump and [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem will not allow foreign terrorist enemies to operate in our country and endanger Americans. They will always put the safety of the American people first.\u201d",
      "Asked for details and documents supporting DHS\u2019 allegations of criminality, McLaughlin responded: \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to share intelligence reports and undermine national security every time a gang member denies he is one. That would be insane.\u201d",
      "Adrian\u2019s family denies he is a member of the gang.",
      "\u201cFor me, it\u2019s a forced disappearance, because he\u2019s not communicating with anyone, they\u2019re not permitting him a right to anything, and they\u2019re not giving him a right to a defense \u2014 from what I understand, here we\u2019re all innocent until it\u2019s proved contrary,\u201d Alejandro said.",
      "\u201cThen the only offense we have here is to be a migrant and be Venezuelan, and now the government has turned against this nationality,\u201d he said, adding the government believes \u201cwe all belong to Tren de Aragua.\u201d",
      "Adri\u00e1n, 27, came to the United States in 2023 by appointment through the CBP One app. Alejandro provided NBC News a photo of a printout confirming his brother\u2019s June 12, 2023, appointment.",
      "Adri\u00e1n had also applied for temporary protected status, according to a Dec. 1, 2024, document from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a part of DHS that handles immigration benefits.",
      "In November, Adri\u00e1n\u2019s car wasn\u2019t working, so he got a ride with a co-worker, Alejandro said. Police in Irving, Texas, stopped the co-worker, who had outstanding traffic violations, and detained them both after they found a marijuana trimmer in the co-worker\u2019s vehicle, Alejandro said.",
      "Police charged Adri\u00e1n with a Class C misdemeanor of possession of drug paraphernalia, punishable by up to a $500 fine.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know why that charge was leveled against him, because first, it wasn\u2019t his car,\u201d said Alejandro, 32. \u201cSecond, the belongings in the car were not his.\u201d",
      "Documents provided by Alejandro show Adri\u00e1n pleaded guilty/no contest \u2014 the document doesn\u2019t specify which he pleaded \u2014 and was fined $492. Alejandro said his brother was paying the fine in monthly installments.",
      "Adri\u00e1n had a crown tattoo with the initial \u201cY,\u201d the first letter of his ex-wife\u2019s name, on his hand, Alejandro said. When he was arrested in November, officers told him they were linking him to Tren de Aragua \u201cbecause of that tattoo,\u201d Alejandro said.",
      "That\u2019s why he later covered it with a tiger tattoo, Alejandro said. ICE has pointed to tattoos, including those of a crown, as indicators of membership in Tren de Aragua. Adri\u00e1n also has a tattoo of his mother\u2019s name on one of his biceps.",
      "\u201cWe are not criminal people. We are people who studied professions in Venezuela. We had careers; we\u2019re not people who are linked with any of that,\u201d said Alejandro, who had jobs in banking and insurance in Venezuela and other Latin American countries but now works at a restaurant.",
      "Adri\u00e1n graduated from high school in Venezuela with a focus on science, Alejandro said, later taking a barber course amid the country\u2019s dismal economy.",
      "Adri\u00e1n emigrated to Colombia with his then-wife and daughter and worked there for a several years. When the area became unsafe, he moved his wife and daughter back to Venezuela and then went to Mexico and applied for a CBP One appointment to enter the United States.",
      "Adri\u00e1n came to the United States \u201cbecause we all know the political, social and economic\u00a0situation in Venezuela\u201d and he wanted to make enough money to buy his daughter a house back home, Alejandro said.",
      "Before he got confirmation that his brother was in El Salvador, Alejandro said, he would sometimes get on his knees and pray. \u201cI\u2019ve had moments where I think \u2018at any moment he\u2019s going to call\u2019 and then moments when I\u2019m shattered and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cI never, ever thought I would go through a situation like this,\u201d he said, adding that the only thing he thought would happen when he came to the United States himself as a migrant was that \u201cthey either give you asylum or they deport you. Not a forced disappearance.\u201d"

      "That\u2019s according to the association\u2019s 26th annual analysis of air quality data, which shows that the country is regressing on clean air measures.",
      "The analysis \u2014 which reviewed data from the years 2021 to 2023 \u2014 saw an increase of about 25 million people living with unhealthy air in comparison with last year\u2019s survey.",
      "The report shows how the effects of climate change \u2014 heat, drought and increased wildfire smoke \u2014 are driving changes in air quality across the country.",
      "\u201cThis year, we were really struck by, first of all, the large increase in the number of people across the country living with unhealthy air, and how much of the increase was driven by worsening ozone,\u201d said Katherine Pruitt, the national senior director for clean air policy at the American Lung Association, who added that hot, sunny weather \u201cmakes ozone more likely to form.\u201d",
      "In 2023, the last year of the lung association\u2019s analysis, global temperatures were the hottest recorded to date, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\u00a0Temperatures in the U.S. were their fifth highest in the country\u2019s history.\u00a0(That record has already been surpassed: In 2024, NASA scientists estimated the Earth was about 2.65 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.47 degrees Celsius, hotter than the historic average from 1850 to 1900.)",
      "Pruitt, the report's lead author, said her study shows ozone, also known as smog, spiked in places like Texas, which dealt with a sizzling heat wave in 2023.",
      "\u201cIn 2023, the ozone levels in Texas really shot up,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cThey had a long spell of very hot weather day after day.\u201d",
      "Temperatures in towns like Del Rio exceeded 100 degrees for more than two weeks straight that year.",
      "Intense wildfire smoke also contributed to so many regions receiving failing grades. In 2023, smoke from intense Canadian wildfires spread across population centers in the Northeast, causing the most smoke exposure per person in modern U.S. history.",
      "Increases in wildfire smoke, which creates small particles that can penetrate in the lungs and circulate in people\u2019s bloodstreams, is chipping away at the progress made on air quality since Congress passed the Clean Air Act in 1963.",
      "In 2023, Marshall Burke, an associate professor at Stanford University, published a study that found that increases in wildfire smoke had undone about 25% of the progress made under the Clean Air Act.",
      "The lung association\u2019s reports show a similar turnaround in progress, beginning in 2016.",
      "\u201cIn about 2016, we start to see that trend reverse,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cThe climate is changing and it is increasing the risk of these extreme weather conditions that are making breathing worse for millions of people across the U.S. Until we get a handle on the sources of emissions that are leading to degradation of the environment, we\u2019re going to suffer the consequences.\u201d",

      "LONDON \u2014 High-level talks aimed at bringing a pause to fighting in Ukraine disintegrated Wednesday after Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff pulled out of the meeting, dealing a blow to Kyiv\u2019s hopes for a short-term peace agreement.",
      "While ministerial talks that had been planned to take place in London fell apart, President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, still planned to meet with Ukrainian presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak who arrived in London early Wednesday along the Ukrainian defense and foreign ministers.",
      "\u201cDespite everything, we continue working for peace,\u201d Yermak said in a post on X.",
      "The setback comes during a week in which the Trump administration has doubled down its efforts to push Kyiv and Moscow toward a truce. Next week marks 100 days of the second presidential term of Trump, who promised to end the war on his first day back in office. Rubio suggested last week that the United States may walk away from ceasefire efforts failing any further progress.",
      "\"The downgrading is significant,\" said Orysia Lutsevych, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at the London-based think tank Chatham House, citing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's rejection of the idea that Russia could maintain control of Crimea as part of a deal.",
      "Rubio and Witkoff's absence \"suggests that Washington is increasingly disinterested in drawn-out, multilateral negotiations,\" Lutsevych added. \"This is not just about diplomacy fatigue. It also signals a hard pivot: the U.S. is not positioning itself as a neutral mediator.\"",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce confirmed Tuesday that Rubio would skip the meeting hours after saying the opposite. \u201cThat is not a statement regarding the meetings. It\u2019s a statement about logistical issues in his schedule,\u201d she said.",
      "Despite initial plans to attend the slated talks, neither Rubio nor Witkoff were in London on Wednesday, a European diplomat told NBC News.",
      "The British Foreign Ministry issued said in a statement that \u201cthe\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0peace talks meeting with foreign ministers today is being postponed,\" with top officials from France and Germany also confirming their absence.",
      "As well as meeting with Kellogg, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post on X that he, Yermak and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov would sit down with the British foreign and defense ministers.",
      "Expectations that Kyiv and Moscow would make a deal to end their three-year-long war this week remained low after the U.S. presented Ukraine and its European allies with peace proposals last week in Paris that both sides saw as unacceptable, according to NBC News\u2019 international partner, Sky News.",
      "Under a \u201cterms sheet\u201d offered by Rubio and Witkoff, a land-for-peace deal would recognize Russia\u2019s currently illegal annexation of Crimea and work toward lifting European Union sanctions on Russia. Both parties have since rejected the terms.",
      "After months of upbeat statements on indirect U.S.-led talks, but limited practical engagement, Russian\u00a0President Vladimir\u00a0Putin on Tuesday suggested for the first time that he would be open to bilateral ceasefire talks with Zelenskyy.",
      "The Financial Times reported Tuesday that Putin had also offered to halt fighting along current front lines, leaving around a fifth of Ukraine's territory in Russian hands.",
      "Zelenskyy has not responded to such a suggestion but he rejected the suggestion Tuesday that his country would give up its claim to Crimea.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about here,\u201d he said of the disputed peninsula in a media conference. \u201cThis is against our Constitution.\u201d",
      "The issue of Crimea may well be one of the most difficult points of difference to overcome, said Matthew Saville, director of military sciences at the London-based think tank, the Royal United Services Institute.",
      "\"I think it will be extraordinarily difficult, bordering on political suicide, for [Zelenskyy] to commit to paper on things like giving up Crimea,\" Saville said. That said, \"Ukraine is not going to recapture Crimea anytime soon. Ukraine is unlikely to be a NATO member anytime soon.\"",
      "\"There might be some formulation [of a deal] that effectively kicks those into the long grass,\" Saville added, caveating that \"the terms of any deal at the moment are not going to be particularly favorable to Ukraine.\"",
      "Despite the collapse of Wednesday's talks, Putin is still planning on another meeting with Witkoff in Moscow this week, according to the Russian news agency Tass.",
      "In a media conference Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov welcomed the Trump administration's continuing mediation efforts.",
      "\"We continue our contacts,\" he said. \"Still, of course, there are many details regarding the settlement, a lot of details which need to be discussed, where we need to bring positions closer to one another.\u201d",
      "Before Rubio and Witkoff changed their plans, Britain and France \u2014 two leaders of Europe\u2019s \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d \u2014 had originally hoped instead to negotiate security guarantees and reconstruction projects with the U.S., and provide details of plans to ramp up their defense spending.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said Tuesday that Europe would attempt to make clear to the U.S. what their \u201cred lines\u201d would be in any negotiations and settlement with Russia. A French diplomatic source later said that Barrot would not be able to travel to London due to a scheduling conflict.",
      "British Foreign Minister David Lammy said Tuesday that he had held a \u201cproductive\u201d phone call with Rubio."

    "story": [
      "Cybercriminals and online scammers stole a record $16.6 billion last year, the FBI said Wednesday.",
      "The figure, from the FBI\u2019s annual Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) report, is a sharp rise from the $12.5 billion reported in 2023, reflecting the increased prevalence of online scams, particularly ones including cryptocurrency and those targeting older Americans.",
      "While the report is a leading look at how the United States is ravaged by cybercrime, its numbers are an undercount, as it only reflects people who take the time to file a report with the agency. The agency received 859,532 total complaints of scams and cybercrime last year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to have numbers tell the full story of what might be occurring across the cybercriminal ecosystem,\u201d Deputy Assistant Director Cynthia Kaiser said in a press call previewing the report.",
      "\u201cSince 2020, the virtualization of everything in our lives has increased the attack surface, and we\u2019ve seen criminals move from the physical to the digital world,\u201d she said.",
      "More than a quarter-million people reported actual financial loss from scams and cybercrime, the report said.",
      "Fake toll scams, in which people frequently get text messages telling them to pay a small fee, prompted 58,271 complaints and $129,624 in reported losses. As NBC News reported in March, at least some of those scams are tied to a Chinese-speaking cybercriminal syndicate that has advertised on Telegram.",
      "The biggest scam victims were by far people 60 and older, who reported more than $4.8 billion lost. Older victims were also the most likely to say that cryptocurrency was involved in a scam that targeted them \u2014 complaints referencing cryptocurrency accounted for $2.8 billion among that age group.",
      "People older than 60 lost the most money \u2014 $1.8 billion \u2014 in investment scams, a category that the FBI uses to include so-called \u201cpig butchering\u201d scams.",
      "Pig butchering scams often start with an innocuous or confusing text message from a stranger, which cybercriminals use as an opening to eventually build a relationship with a victim by pretending to be a friend or romantic partner. They slowly convince them to invest more and more money into a fake cryptocurrency venture and have led to tragic stories where some retirees lose their entire savings.",
      "Money reported lost to investment scams has rapidly increased in recent years, jumping from $3.3 billion in 2022 to $4.6 billion in 2023 and $6.6 billion last year, the report said."

      "Potential safety issues at Las Vegas Harry Reid International Airport have been uncovered by a federal review into the January mid-air crash between a military helicopter and a passenger jet in Washington, D.C.",
      "All 64 people on board\u00a0American Airlines Flight 5342\u00a0to Reagan Washington National Airport and the three on the Black Hawk helicopter died in the deadliest air disaster in the United States since 2001, which triggered a nationwide review of \"hotspot\" airports with mixed air traffic. Administrators say they took immediate action after reviewing the situation in Las Vegas.",
      "Local helicopter companies were previously instructed to avoid airplane arrival and departure corridors, but these areas lacked vertical and lateral measurements, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Additionally, tower controllers did not issue traffic advisories between returning tourist helicopter trips and the arrival or departure of planes.",
      "\"We took quick action, including exercising positive control over the helicopters and issuing more traffic advisories to pilots. As a result, the number of traffic alert and collision avoidance system reports decreased by 30 percent in just three weeks,\" Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau said.",
      "More action is planned at more airports in and around Las Vegas, as well as in other locations. These include Hollywood Burbank Airport and Van Nuys Airport in the greater LA area, which are 10 miles apart and \"each serve a wide mix of aircraft, and they have closely spaced arrival and departure paths,\" Rocheleau said.",
      "\"What I think the FAA wants is more communication. I think in the case of Harry Reid, they were a little bit concerned about helicopters coming back inbound and mixing, remixing with fixed-winged aircraft. I think they were concerned about separation procedures and the communication procedures,\" pilot and aviation expert Reed Yadon told NBC affiliate KSNV of Las Vegas.",
      "NBC News contacted the Clark County Department of Aviation, which owns and operates Harry Reid, for comment. The county referred questions from KSNV and The Associated Press to the FAA.",
      "Both Burbank and Van Nuys Airports were also contacted for comment.",
      "The FAA permanently banned non-essential helicopter trips around Reagan Washington National Airport after January's accident and promised to investigate areas with busy mixed air traffic.",
      "The administration held a roundtable discussion on Tuesday, stressing that potential collisions between planes and helicopters were just one of the hazards.",
      "\"The top causes of accidents are loss of control, striking an object during low-altitude operations,\" Rocheleau said, as well as intentionally and unintentionally flying into bad weather.",
      "The FAA said that this work began months before the Hudson River helicopter crash in New York earlier this month, in which six people died, but Rocheleau added that that crash \"underscored that aviation safety is not static.\"",
      "Helicopter flights in New York were grounded after that accident, and the flight operator is shutting down.",
      "The rulemaking committee members include aircraft and aircraft technology manufacturers, air tour operators and organizations, and aviation safety experts. They\u2019ll hold the first meeting on May 20 and provide recommendations to us by late September 2025.",
      "\"While flying remains the safest mode of transportation, we must always strive to do better. We have to identify trends and get smarter about how we use data. And when we put corrective actions in place, we must execute them,\" Rocheleau said.",
      "Aviation lawyer Robert Clifford, who is acting for some of the families of those who were killed in the January crash in Washington, welcomed the moves to improve safety.",
      "\"As a frequent critic of the FAA, I must say that the FAA deserves recognition for taking these steps to protect the traveling public,\" Clifford said. \"Helicopters are known for being the most dangerous and potentially unsafe aircraft. The extra vigilance by the FAA may save many lives.\""

      "Despite initial plans to attend the slated talks, neither Rubio nor Witkoff were in London on Wednesday, a European diplomat told NBC News.",
      "The British Foreign Ministry issued said in a statement that \u201cthe\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0peace talks meeting with foreign ministers today is being postponed,\" with top officials from France and Germany also confirming their absence.",
      "As well as meeting with Kellogg, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post on X that he, Yermak and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov would sit down with the British foreign and defense ministers.",
      "Expectations that Kyiv and Moscow would make a deal to end their three-year-long war this week remained low after the U.S. presented Ukraine and its European allies with peace proposals last week in Paris that both sides saw as unacceptable, according to NBC News\u2019 international partner, Sky News.",
      "Under a \u201cterms sheet\u201d offered by Rubio and Witkoff, a land-for-peace deal would recognize Russia\u2019s currently illegal annexation of Crimea and work toward lifting European Union sanctions on Russia. Both parties have since rejected the terms.",
      "After months of upbeat statements on indirect U.S.-led talks, but limited practical engagement, Russian\u00a0President Vladimir\u00a0Putin on Tuesday suggested for the first time that he would be open to bilateral ceasefire talks with Zelenskyy.",
      "The Financial Times reported Tuesday that Putin had also offered to halt fighting along current front lines, leaving around a fifth of Ukraine's territory in Russian hands.",
      "Zelenskyy has not responded to such a suggestion but he rejected the suggestion Tuesday that his country would give up its claim to Crimea.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about here,\u201d he said of the disputed peninsula in a media conference. \u201cThis is against our Constitution.\u201d",
      "The issue of Crimea may well be one of the most difficult points of difference to overcome, said Matthew Saville, director of military sciences at the London-based think tank, the Royal United Services Institute.",
      "\"I think it will be extraordinarily difficult, bordering on political suicide, for [Zelenskyy] to commit to paper on things like giving up Crimea,\" Saville said. That said, \"Ukraine is not going to recapture Crimea anytime soon. Ukraine is unlikely to be a NATO member anytime soon.\"",
      "\"There might be some formulation [of a deal] that effectively kicks those into the long grass,\" Saville added, caveating that \"the terms of any deal at the moment are not going to be particularly favorable to Ukraine.\"",
      "Despite the collapse of Wednesday's talks, Putin is still planning on another meeting with Witkoff in Moscow this week, according to the Russian news agency Tass.",
      "In a media conference Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov welcomed the Trump administration's continuing mediation efforts.",
      "\"We continue our contacts,\" he said. \"Still, of course, there are many details regarding the settlement, a lot of details which need to be discussed, where we need to bring positions closer to one another.\u201d",
      "Before Rubio and Witkoff changed their plans, Britain and France \u2014 two leaders of Europe\u2019s \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d \u2014 had originally hoped instead to negotiate security guarantees and reconstruction projects with the U.S., and provide details of plans to ramp up their defense spending.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said Tuesday that Europe would attempt to make clear to the U.S. what their \u201cred lines\u201d would be in any negotiations and settlement with Russia. A French diplomatic source later said that Barrot would not be able to travel to London due to a scheduling conflict.",
      "British Foreign Minister David Lammy said Tuesday that he had held a \u201cproductive\u201d phone call with Rubio."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/nfl/cam-ward-nfl-draft-miami-titans-rcna199363",
    "published": "Wed, 23 Apr 2025 09:01:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Cam Ward had just one college offer coming out of high school. Now he's set to be the top overall selection in the NFL draft.",
    "story": [
      "To Steve Van Meter, it seemed obvious that the high school sophomore had every quality a college coach would want in a quarterback.",
      "Academically, Cam Ward was near the top of his class. Athletically, he was his high school\u2019s leading scorer in basketball and a naturally accurate passer in football. When Van Meter, a retired coach who specialized in coaching quarterbacks around the Houston area, asked him to tweak his throwing mechanics, Ward could process the information and make the change by the very next rep.",
      "And then there was his explosive right arm.\u00a0The first time he watched Ward throw, the battle rotated so fast that it whistled.",
      "\u201cI was a head Texas high school head coach for 28 years, and coached 38 years in high school and I\u2019ve had Division I quarterbacks,\u201d Van Meter said. \u201cThe ball didn\u2019t come out of the hands like that on anybody I\u2019ve ever coached.\u201d",
      "Yet when Van Meter evangelized about Ward\u2019s skill set to the network of college coaches he\u2019d cultivated over the decades, all he heard was pushback. Ward played in a small town and in an offense far from the norm and that offered few opportunities to pass. It was enough to scare off recruiters. He entered the summer of 2019, just weeks before his final high school season, without a single college scholarship offer.",
      "\u201cIt got to the point where I was just kind of questioning myself,\u201d Van Meter said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Do I even know anything about this? Why aren\u2019t these people seeing this?\u2019 I know no one throws it like this kid does.\u201d",
      "Nearly six years later, Ward, now 22, is projected to walk across the stage Thursday at the NFL draft as the No. 1 selection \u2014 and in the process become perhaps the unlikeliest top pick in the league\u2019s modern history. It\u2019s not just that Ward began his college career at a lower rung \u2014 it's that he barely had the chance to play college football at all. It\u2019s why many close to Ward believe the biggest question about him was never about his talent, but whether any college program would take the risk to recognize it.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had numerous coaches tell me how much they loved him, and they just couldn\u2019t take a chance,\u201d said Eric Morris, who offered Ward his first and only college scholarship when he was the head coach at the University of the Incarnate Word, a private Catholic school in Texas. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, yeah, yeah \u2014 whatever. Of course you do now that he\u2019s had all that success.\u2019\u201d",
      "From Baker Mayfield, who turned down Division I scholarship offers to walk on at Texas Tech before finding fame at Oklahoma, to offensive lineman Eric Fisher, who was unheralded when he signed with Division I Central Michigan, overlooked recruits have gone on to be selected No. 1 in the NFL draft. Quarterbacks Josh Allen (Wyoming) and Aaron Rodgers (California) also went from being lightly recruited high schoolers to earning NFL MVP honors.",
      "Yet these are exceptions in a draft in which recruiting rankings have been shown to correlate to future NFL draft selections. Five-star recruits hold a much higher chance of becoming first-round picks.",
      "When Ward showed up at Incarnate Word\u2019s campus in San Antonio for a football camp in the summer of 2019, he was not an unknown commodity among Texas college coaches. The previous year, Ward and his father had attended as many college camps as possible to gain the exposure he\u2019d lacked as the starter in high school in West Columbia, a small city an hour south of Houston. There, Ward\u2019s team ran a \u201cWing T\u201d offense that primarily ran the ball, a style that was an anachronism in a state in which the spread offense was king, with quarterbacks throwing sometimes 50 times a game to four or five receivers.",
      "Brent Mascheck, Ward\u2019s high school coach, said he felt it was a \u201ccop-out\u201d for recruiters to cite the Wing T as a drawback in assessing Ward's talent, rather than trusting their own projections.",
      "From Austin to Dallas, Ward crossed the state hoping that displaying the arm that was rarely unleashed on his high school tapes could earn him a scholarship. Yet, at a time when it has never been easier for a recruit to be noticed \u2014 thanks to athletes' own social media posts and the booming media coverage around high school football recruiting \u2014 Ward held zero scholarship offers only weeks before his senior season. On a five-star recruiting scale, Ward had zero.",
      "Texas A&M, like a handful of other schools, was close to offering but ultimately never did, Van Meter said. To Mascheck and Van Meter, several college coaches expressed a sentiment that goes far beyond the case of Ward \u2014 that it was too politically difficult to vouch for an unheralded recruit over a four- or five-star, even if a coach was convinced the lower-rated player was a better fit.",
      "\u201cIf you try to bring that kid to that head coach, you better know what you\u2019re doing because if you don\u2019t, if that kid doesn\u2019t pan out, then guess what? You\u2019re looking for a job,\u201d Van Meter said.",
      "More from Sports",
      "Quarterbacks were the hottest commodity in last year's NFL draft. Now they're the biggest question.Travis Hunter wants to play both offense and defense. Will the NFL let him? He's one of the top prospects in the NFL draft \u2014 with few stats to back it up",
      "Quarterbacks were the hottest commodity in last year's NFL draft. Now they're the biggest question.",
      "Travis Hunter wants to play both offense and defense. Will the NFL let him?",
      "He's one of the top prospects in the NFL draft \u2014 with few stats to back it up",
      "With less than 6,000 undergraduates in 2019, and playing in the NCAA\u2019s second-highest division, Incarnate Word was a speck in the hierarchy of big-time college football and wasn\u2019t competing for five-stars.",
      "\u201cIt was a little bit easier to take a chance on a kid,\u201d said Morris, now the head coach at North Texas. Success hinged on finding good players who were hidden in plain sight. Ward's performance at the school's camp was \"phenomenal, as good as a camp workout as I've ever seen,\" said Morris, who had coached future NFL quarterbacks Mayfield, Patrick Mahomes and Case Keenum in college.",
      "Yet even then, the school's coaches were \u201csecond-guessing ourselves,\u201d said Mack Leftwich, then offensive coordinator under Morris, to understand why they were seemingly alone in recognizing Ward\u2019s potential.",
      "Said Morris: \u201cWe\u2019re all scratching our heads, kind of, \u2018What are we missing here?\u2019 As a college coach, I think you\u2019re starting to look for all the negatives. What are the negatives about this kid? And just as we kept doing research, there were no negatives.\u201d",
      "Said Leftwich: \u201cIn that situation, you have to just be able to trust your evaluation and trust your instincts on a kid.\u201d",
      "That summer, the staff was still intrigued by Ward\u2019s potential when Morris, during a staff meeting, called Van Meter and put him on speakerphone to ask for his impressions. That no one else had offered made the school cautious to be the first.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Well, Coach, don\u2019t take offense to this, but if Cam was in my offense, or in any spread offense that let him throw the ball 25, 35, 40 times a game, you guys wouldn\u2019t have a shot at him,\u2019\u201d Van Meter said. \u201cAnd everyone on his staff started laughing. But [Morris] said, \u2018Coach, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been talking about \u2014 we think we got a steal.\u2019 I said, \u2018Coach, I promise you, you got a steal.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ward\u2019s throwing mechanics needed polishing and there was the question of how consistent a quarterback who had attempted just 267 passes in three seasons in high school could be when throwing 40 or more attempts per game in college. Mascheck said one college coach was critical of Ward\u2019s frame, which at the time was about 6-foot-1 and around 240 pounds, about 20 pounds heavier than he weighed at February\u2019s NFL Combine.",
      "What sold Incarnate Word was partly watching Ward\u2019s basketball tape. Ward had been raised around the game \u2014 his mother coached at the high school \u2014\u00a0and he played with his eyes up in traffic, anticipating open teammates and driving lanes, a job not dissimilar from playing quarterback. The staff loved that he hated to lose, drawing inspiration from Kobe Bryant. It also didn\u2019t hurt that Incarnate Word wasn\u2019t asking Ward to be its savior.",
      "The school already had an All-American-caliber starter at quarterback whose presence would allow Ward at least two seasons, in Leftwich\u2019s belief, to learn a spread offense as a backup with little pressure. When Covid canceled Incarnate Word\u2019s fall 2020 season, Ward had even more time to learn the spread offense\u2019s nuances during practices.",
      "That extra development time proved critical. Ward walked into Morris\u2019s office on his first day on campus as a freshman and declared he would win the starting job not in two seasons, but that fall. It came true, just three months later, after he\u2019d made \u201cabout one or two plays a day where you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my gosh, this kid has a chance to be special,\u2019\u201d Leftwich said.",
      "\u201cHis confidence in what he does on a day-to-day basis, and not getting nervous or scared no matter who\u2019s across from him, is one of the strongest qualities,\u201d Morris said.",
      "In one practice, Ward somehow curved a pass around an oncoming blitzer perfectly into his receiver\u2019s hands. Leftwich, now the offensive coordinator at Texas Tech, said that hours later, Incarnate Word coaches had gathered to rewatch the play at least 15 times.",
      "Ward was an anomaly. His rise was helped, however, by enrolling in college at a time when NCAA rules changes no longer required transfers to sit out a season, giving players who started at smaller colleges more upward mobility. With the transfer portal open, Ward transferred to Washington State in 2022 (after Morris left to be the Cougars\u2019 offensive coordinator) and then in 2024 to Miami, where he increased his draft stock by replicating his big production against more difficult competition. Along the way, Ward has drawn praise for his coolness under pressure and an outward confidence that puts teammates at ease \u2014 traits that were on display in high school, too, if anyone was looking.",
      "While at Incarnate Word, Ward and his offensive coordinator, Leftwich, spoke about the possibility of him one day playing in the NFL. In fact, before Ward had even played a game for Incarnate Word, Leftwich was spending Thanksgiving in 2020 with his family when he told his father and brother, another college coach, that tiny Incarnate Word had a future NFL quarterback on its roster.",
      "This week, Ward will make that prediction come true. And it may never have happened without the willingness to offer Ward what no other team would.",
      "\u201cHoly cow, we just coached a potential No. 1 overall pick at the University of Incarnate Word,\u201d Leftwich said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unbelievable, honestly.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 America may be well on its way to forgetting Joe Biden; its president isn\u2019t.",
      "Donald Trump spoke Biden\u2019s name more than a dozen times on Jan. 20, day one of his second presidency, and from that point forward he has basically never stopped.",
      "As he nears the 100th day of his term, Trump has invoked his predecessor with a persistence that suggests the two are in the final throes of a bitter campaign. They aren\u2019t and won\u2019t ever be again: Biden pulled his name off the 2024 ballot and left elective office for good. But for Trump there is a certain political upside in making Biden a perpetual bogeyman.",
      "Mentioning Biden reminds voters that not so long ago, they were unhappy enough with high prices and illegal border crossings that they repudiated him and his hand-picked successor, Kamala Harris. Biden may also be a useful diversion from the whiplash of Trump\u2019s term, shifting attention to the aged ex-president who struggled through speeches and looked unsteady on his feet.",
      "As children pushed their pink and yellow eggs at the White House\u2019s annual Easter Egg Roll on Monday, Trump mingled with the crowd and mocked Biden over an incident that many may have forgotten, if they were ever aware of it at all. Three years ago, Biden hosted the Easter Egg Roll and was redirected at one point by an\u00a0aide dressed in a bunny costume.",
      "\u201cDo you remember the bunny with Joe Biden?\u201d Trump said. \u201cDo you remember when the bunny took Joe Biden out? He\u2019s not taking Trump out.\u201d\u00a0At that, a costume bunny standing alongside\u00a0shook its head in agreement.",
      "Amplifying the point, the White House\u2019s official account on X posted video of the moment with the caption \u201cThe White House is no longer a nursing home.\u201d",
      "In a statement for this article, White House spokesperson Liz Huston also invoked Biden and the work Trump has done moving on from his predecessor's administration.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has spent the first three months of his presidency cleaning up the disasters created by Joe Biden and Making America Great Again,\" Huston said. \"Under President Trump\u2019s leadership, the border is secure, inflation is cooling, jobs are up, and common sense is restored.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s running commentary on Biden brims with grievances large and small. To this day, he says he legitimately won the 2020 election. He has blamed Biden and other Democrats for the criminal investigations he faced in the aftermath.",
      "\u201cThe 2020 election was totally rigged,\u201d he told reporters last month aboard Air Force One. He described Biden as a kind of\u00a0presidential impostor who\u00a0usurped Trump\u2019s rightful place and then did\u00a0\u201csuch a bad job.\u201d",
      "In his Oval Office meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in February, the topic turned to the war between Russia and Ukraine. After he lay blame on Biden, Trump said it pained him to say as much.",
      "\u201cI hate to say that about somebody that sat here just before me, but he did a terrible, terrible job,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Unpleasant as it may be, Trump seldom tires of it.",
      "He has called Biden \u201cpathetic,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d \u201ca disaster,\u201d\u00a0\u201cincompetent\u201d and the worst president in history. Biden\u00a0had \u201cno clue.\u201d He \"didn\u2019t know he was alive.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s beef extends from matters of high foreign policy to White House decor.\u00a0In February, he said he had approached the Biden administration with an offer to build a ballroom for the White House \u2014 something \u201cbeautiful\u201d at a cost of about $100 million \u2014 but never heard back.",
      "\u201cThis question takes me back to 2017 and everyone asking why he mentions Hillary so much,\u201d said Michael Dubke, a White House communications director in Trump\u2019s first term. \u201c\u2018She lost; you won. Let\u2019s move on, Mr. President.\u2019 The foil is key to his central premise that those that came before broke it and I will fix it. Even now that the campaign is over, the foil still has value.\u201d",
      "There may be another dynamic at work. Always mindful of his popularity, Trump may see Biden as competition for a place in the history books. In the zero-sum game of presidential rankings, if Biden falls in history\u2019s estimation, Trump could rise.",
      "\u201cIn MAGA land, Biden was a false president. And Trump is trying to keep banging that drum so he can drive that narrative into the history books,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian.",
      "The numbers tell the story \u2014 of a president who, as much as he may want to make America great again, would be happy to see Americans abhor Biden for all time.",
      "So far, Trump has spoken about Biden, his family or his administration at least 580 times either in public remarks or on his social media site, an NBC News analysis shows. That\u2019s an average of six times every day of his presidency.",
      "After he won the 2020 election, by contrast, Biden mentioned Trump 29 times in the first 100 days of his presidency. That\u2019s an average\u00a0of once every 3\u00bd days. Even then, he did so with a certain reluctance.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m tired of talking about Donald Trump,\u201d Biden said at a town hall-style event.",
      "Last month Trump used a televised event showcasing Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla vehicles to take multiple digs at Biden. Holding notes showing prices of Tesla cars, Trump said: \u201cThey gave me notes. I said, \u2018I\u2019m not Biden, I don\u2019t need notes.\u2019\u201d",
      "He then climbed into a red Model S sitting on the White House\u2019s South Lawn.",
      "\u201cYou think Biden could get into that car?\u201d he told the assembled reporters.",
      "Trump has given no sign that his preoccupation with Biden is waning. He\u2019s using the ample communication tools at a president\u2019s disposal to keep his predecessor front and center, with aides and subordinates stepping forward to sustain the drumbeat.",
      "Trump\u2019s White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has mentioned Biden 78 times in the 16 briefings she has given thus far, including 37 times unprompted in her opening remarks.",
      "Cabinet members have gotten into the act, as well. When he was called upon during a televised Cabinet meeting on April 10, Lee Zeldin, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, opened with \u201cMr. President, the Biden EPA was strangulating the economy.\u201d",
      "Later in the meeting, when it was his turn to speak, Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, told Trump: \u201cYou came into an emergency situation where President Biden left us with a $1.2 trillion trade deficit. It\u2019s the largest of any country in human history.\u201d (A number of economists argue that running a trade deficit isn\u2019t necessarily harmful. The United States gets valuable goods in return.)",
      "Trump jumped in.",
      "\u201cYou said the largest in history, right?\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been anything like what he left us. He left us a mess. His whole administration was a mess.\u201d",
      "Four other officials at the table in the Cabinet Room that day \u2014 Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Kelly Loeffler, head of the Small Business Administration \u2014 also used their public remarks to take swipes at the Biden administration.",
      "At times, Trump-friendly conservative news outlets have teed up fresh opportunities for him to skewer Biden. At a joint news conference at the White House with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a reporter for The Gateway Pundit asked Modi whether he was more confident of a successful relationship with the United States under Trump \u201cversus with Biden\u2019s incompetence and weakness over the last four years.\u201d",
      "Before Modi could answer, Trump laughed.",
      "\u201cI agree with you,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, gross incompetence.\u201d",
      "Since he took office, Trump aides have exercised tighter control over which news outlets are allowed onto Air Force One and into smaller spaces that can accommodate only a certain number of journalists.",
      "In February, the White House stripped The Associated Press of its traditional spot in the small group of journalists allowed to cover the president in such settings, citing its refusal to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the \u201cGulf of America,\u201d the name Trump has given it.",
      "No AP reporters were on board during an Air Force One flight April 13 when Trump stopped by the press cabin to take questions. A reporter from Real America\u2019s Voice was on the plane, however, and at one point posed this question: \u201cHow do you do it, Mr. President? I haven\u2019t stayed up\u00a0to 2 a.m. in the morning since I was 25. And now we\u2019re 2:16 in the morning having a press conference. How do you do it?\u201d",
      "\u201cBiden was sleeping for 10 hours already,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Asked about Trump\u2019s fixation with Biden, a White House aide to the former president said: \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s his attempt to distract from what he\u2019s doing to the economy. I also don\u2019t think he is over the fact that Biden beat him in 2020,\u201d the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk freely.",
      "Denouncing Biden is easy enough; proving the point is tougher.",
      "Trump has faulted Biden for giving Ukraine aid in the form of a grant, as opposed to the Europeans, who he said will be getting their money back. Both Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron corrected him on that point in separate Oval Office meetings.",
      "He has accused Biden of weaponizing government and said he ended the practice. Trump\u2019s detractors say he has used his power to retaliate against perceived political foes, including Chris Krebs, who was a Homeland Security official in the first term. Trump signed an executive memo this month yanking Krebs\u2019 security clearance. Among the sins spelled out in the memo was Krebs\u2019 denial that the 2020 election was \u201crigged and stolen.\u201d",
      "An argument Trump makes is that Russian President Vladimir Putin so disrespected Biden that he felt free to wage war with Ukraine. Now that Biden is gone and Trump is back in the n White House, \u201cPresident Putin wants to have peace,\u201d Trump told reporters in February.",
      "Putin, he said, \u201cdidn\u2019t want to have peace with Biden. And you tell me why that is, OK?\u201d",
      "Though Trump promised during the campaign to end the war on his first day as president, administration officials have lately sounded resigned to its continuation.

      "As the Vatican prepares for the election of a new pope, many around the world are doing their own preparations \u2014 by watching a movie about it.",
      "After news of Pope Francis\u2019 death broke Monday, the film \u201cConclave\u201d had a viewership boost across streaming platforms it was available to watch on, according to Luminate, an entertainment data analytics company.",
      "Edward Berger\u2019s drama, which won the Oscar this year for best adapted screenplay, goes behind the scenes of the Vatican for the secretive process of electing a pope. The process is complicated further by power-hungry cardinals, played by Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and John Lithgow. (The film\u2019s distributor is Focus Features, a unit of NBC News\u2019 parent corporation, Comcast.)",
      "Since its release in October, the movie has spawned a fervent fan base online, with many social media users circulating a slew of viral memes and passionate fan edits comparing it to pop culture staples like \u201cThe Real Housewives\u201d and \u201cMean Girls.\u201d",
      "Existing fans and a new wave of viewers sought it out this week as tributes to Pope Francis poured in from around the world.",
      "From Sunday to Monday, viewership spiked 283%, according to Luminate, which measures viewership data across major platforms in the United States, including Peacock, Netflix, Paramount+, Max and Disney+. The movie was watched an average of 1.8 million minutes Sunday. The number surged to 6.9 million minutes watched Monday, Luminate\u00a0said.",
      "A spokesperson for Focus Features did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the streaming data.",
      "On social media, many pointed out that the film\u2019s plot mirrored current news headlines, including stories about who could succeed Pope Francis.",
      "Some \u201cConclave\u201d fans did not appear surprised by the film\u2019s resurgence in the zeitgeist.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of grief and pain attached to current events, and being able to use Conclave memes as a common/shared language of community offers some brevity and humor to a clandestine process and historical event that will significantly alter the trajectory of many peoples\u2019 lives,\u201d said the administrator behind Pope Crave, a fan account on X\u00a0that is dedicated to all things \u201cConclave.\u201d",
      "Pope Crave, who has 16,000 followers on X, asked NBC News by email to use only their username, citing a need for \u201cseparation\u201d between their professional work and \u201cfandom extracurriculars.\u201d",
      "\u201cI cannot speak for the religious breakdown of \u2018Conclave\u2019 fans, but it doesn\u2019t shock me that Catholic fans of the film would be engaged in the actual papal conclave outcomes,\u201d Pope Crave said. \u201cAnd for the non-Catholic \u2018Conclave\u2019 fans, I would hypothesize there\u2019s something to be said about the abrupt relevance and sudden application of their film knowledge and fandom enthusiasm to a seismically important current global event that holds importance to over 1.25 billion practitioners (and even more non-believers).\u201d",
      "Michael Moreland, a professor of law and religion at Villanova University, said the mass appeal of \u201cConclave\u201d captured how, even in a secular modern age, there is still pervasive intrigue around \u201cthe ancient rituals of the Catholic Church.\u201d",
      "The conclave process involves a gathering of Catholic Church cardinals, who are senior advisers to the pope (based in the Vatican or around the world), under age 80. Bound by an oath of secrecy, the cardinals vote in the Sistine Chapel via paper ballots until a pope is elected by a two-thirds majority.",
      "\u201cAll the charisma and the mystery around Catholicism and the ways in which these men in the College of Cardinals go about assembling and deliberating and voting in the secret process that no one except one of them has seen,\u201d Moreland said, \u201call of that is very fascinating.\u201d",
      "\u201cConclave\u201d paints a relatively accurate picture of the way candidates rise and fall throughout the intense balloting process, which can last for however many days it takes to reach the required two-thirds vote, Moreland said. He was disappointed, however, in the film\u2019s outsize focus on \u201ccrude right-left divides.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe significance of the theological and spiritual aspects of Catholicism and this process of electing a pope was kind of reduced into partisan politics,\u201d he said.",
      "On Tuesday, \u201cConclave\u201d was made available to stream on Amazon Prime. The timing was coincidental, according to Amazon, as the movie was already scheduled to release on the streaming platform this month.",
      "As of Tuesday afternoon, many stars of \u201cConclave\u201d had not yet issued any statements about Francis\u2019 death.",
      "However, in February, when he was in critical condition, the cast addressed the timeliness of the film at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.",
      "\u201cThe film has ended up extremely timely ... and it\u2019s about the social organism electing a leader,\u201d Lithgow, who played Cardinal Tremblay, one of the film\u2019s antagonists who is among the front-runners to become the next pope, told reporters.",
      "\u201cYou cannot help seeing \u2018Conclave\u2019 and not thinking what happens when different tribes quarrel with each other trying to decide on who is their leader,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s one big reason why people are paying attention to \u2018Conclave,\u2019 beyond the fact that it\u2019s simply a beautiful film that you just don\u2019t see storytelling on film like that much anymore.\u201d",
      "The funeral for Francis will be at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) Saturday in St. Peter\u2019s Square in front of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, the Vatican said. The conclave will follow the funeral."

      "Crusius, a white community college dropout, had posted online a screed about a Hispanic invasion of Texas before opening fire with an AK-style rifle at the store near the U.S.-Mexico border on Aug. 3, 2019.

      "Stephanie Melendez told Crusius that she did not want to address him but rather read a letter to her father, 63-year-old David Johnson, who was killed when he shielded his wife and 9-year-old granddaughter from the gunfire.",

      "\u201cYou made me into the strong woman I am today,\u201d she said.",

      "Thousands of people attended Margie Reckard\u2019s funeral after her partner of 22 years, Antonio Basco, invited the public to the service, saying he felt alone after her death.",

      "Country music star Jelly Roll is a step closer to being granted a pardon for crimes he committed, including robbery, in his younger days, a Tennessee sheriff said.",
      "Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall said Tuesday on X that the state Board of Parole voted to endorse a pardon for the singer, legally known as Jason B. Deford, 40. The Associated Press reported that the vote was unanimous, with one member recusing.",
      "Under Tennessee law, the matter is now before Gov. Bill Lee, who can grant a pardon, grant a commutation erasing Jelly Roll's criminal record or turn down the request.",
      "Spokespersons for the board and for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.",
      "Hall said he asked Lee to pardon Jelly Roll roughly a year ago, and he indicated that Tuesday's vote was part of that endeavor.",
      "Jelly Roll, known for his face tattoos and prodigious presence, sharpened his rap skills in prison before he blended them with country music for a career that earned him four Grammy Award nominations in February.",
      "He has used his experience as a basis for some of his music and to inspire others imprisoned, attracted to lives of crime or otherwise marginalized with little sense of hope.",
      "He speaks at prisons, rehabilitation programs and schools. In April, he accepted an award for his advocacy from the World Literacy Foundation at its annual summit at Oxford University, where a host likened him to a modern-day Johnny Cash.",
      "Jelly Roll has said he's not allowed to vote because of his criminal convictions.",
      "He said he spent most of the years between ages 14 and 25 behind bars, with his most consequential conviction being for a robbery. He admitted on a podcast last month that he sold drugs in his Nashville neighborhood, where \"the only people who had money did crime.\"",
      "He said a low point in life was when a prison guard came to his cell to report his daughter had been born \u2014 17 years ago.",
      "\"I had the one pair of clothes that I was incarcerated in,\" he said on the \u201cSmartLess\u201d podcast. \"I had zero money. In fact, I was in debt. It was the most honest accountability and self-reflection moment in my life.\"",
      "Jelly Roll rapped in prison, he said, and eventually more than 200 prisoners surrounded him for Friday night performances. \"We'd beat on the walls,\" he said on the podcast, referring to makeshift rap beats.",
      "\"It felt like we'd be free for the night,\" he said.",
      "He was released from prison in late 2016, according to state records. He didn't immediately break through in music, but he clawed at his dreams, \"living in a van and doing $50 shows,\" he said on the podcast.",
      "His music told some of his story. \"Save Me\" in 2020 includes the lines \"Somebody save me, me from myself/I\u2019ve spent so long living in Hell/They say my lifestyle is bad for my health/It\u2019s the only thing that seems to help.\"",
      "Testifying in favor of new legislation to address fentanyl overdoses, Jelly Roll told Congress last year that a passenger jet's worth of synthetic opioid users die every day, often relatively unnoticed, in the United States.",
      "The deaths don't capture the attention of a plane crash because the people who died are less valued, he said. \"America has been known to bully and shame drug addicts,\" he told federal lawmakers in January 2024.",
      "Jelly Roll said he's doing his part for those entangled in drugs and the justice system.",
      "\"I\u2019m a guy that proves it\u2019s never too late to change,\" he said on the podcast."

      "Their mother went to a detention center in Caracas, Venezuela, where deportees are held when they arrive from the United States, Alejandro said, but she was told no one by her son\u2019s name was there.",
      "They enlisted the help of advocacy groups. Cristosal, a nonprofit organization in El Salvador working with families of presumed deportees to get answers from the U.S. and Salvadoran governments, had no answers. Same with the League of United Latin American Citizens, known as LULAC.",
      "Alejandro\u2019s 6-year-old niece asked him almost every day: When will her dad call her?",
      "\u201cFor 40 days, his family has been waiting to hear his fate,\u201d LULAC CEO Juan Proa\u00f1o said.",
      "Finally, on Tuesday, an answer. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed to NBC News that Adri\u00e1n had, in fact, been deported \u2014 to El Salvador.",
      "The news \u201csaddens me a lot\u201d and \u201cshattered me,\u201d Alejandro said after he heard about his brother\u2019s whereabouts from NBC News.",
      "DHS didn't respond when it was asked whether Adri\u00e1n was sent to CECOT, the mega-prison in El Salvador. But Alejandro fears that's the case, given the many Venezuelans who were sent to CECOT from Texas a few days after he was detained.",
      "\u201cThere, [El Salvador President Nayib] Bukele says demons enter their hell,\" Alejandro said about the prison, speaking on the phone from the restaurant where he works. \"And my brother is not a criminal. At this moment, I don\u2019t feel very good. The news has hit me like a bucket of cold water.\u201d",
      "The Rengel family\u2019s experience echoes the experiences of others who have encountered the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation efforts \u2014 sometimes their family members seemingly disappear after having been taken by immigration authorities.",
      "The administration has prioritized deporting men alleged to be members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which it has designated as a foreign terrorist organization\u00a0under the 1700s-era wartime Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\u201cNeiyerver Adrian Leon Rengel, entered our country illegally in 2023 from Venezuela and is an associate of Tren De Aragua,\u201d DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told NBC News by email.\u00a0\u201cTren de Aragua is vicious gang that rapes, maims, and murders for sport. President Trump and [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem will not allow foreign terrorist enemies to operate in our country and endanger Americans. They will always put the safety of the American people first.\u201d",
      "Asked for details and documents supporting DHS\u2019 allegations of criminality, McLaughlin responded: \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to share intelligence reports and undermine national security every time a gang member denies he is one. That would be insane.\u201d",
      "Adrian\u2019s family denies he is a member of the gang.",
      "\u201cFor me, it\u2019s a forced disappearance, because he\u2019s not communicating with anyone, they\u2019re not permitting him a right to anything, and they\u2019re not giving him a right to a defense \u2014 from what I understand, here we\u2019re all innocent until it\u2019s proved contrary,\u201d Alejandro said.",
      "\u201cThen the only offense we have here is to be a migrant and be Venezuelan, and now the government has turned against this nationality,\u201d he said, adding the government believes \u201cwe all belong to Tren de Aragua.\u201d",
      "Adri\u00e1n, 27, came to the United States in 2023 by appointment through the CBP One app. Alejandro provided NBC News a photo of a printout confirming his brother\u2019s June 12, 2023, appointment.",
      "Adri\u00e1n had also applied for temporary protected status, according to a Dec. 1, 2024, document from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a part of DHS that handles immigration benefits.",
      "In November, Adri\u00e1n\u2019s car wasn\u2019t working, so he got a ride with a co-worker, Alejandro said. Police in Irving, Texas, stopped the co-worker, who had outstanding traffic violations, and detained them both after they found a marijuana trimmer in the co-worker\u2019s vehicle, Alejandro said.",
      "Police charged Adri\u00e1n with a Class C misdemeanor of possession of drug paraphernalia, punishable by up to a $500 fine.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know why that charge was leveled against him, because first, it wasn\u2019t his car,\u201d said Alejandro, 32. \u201cSecond, the belongings in the car were not his.\u201d",
      "Documents provided by Alejandro show Adri\u00e1n pleaded guilty/no contest \u2014 the document doesn\u2019t specify which he pleaded \u2014 and was fined $492. Alejandro said his brother was paying the fine in monthly installments.",
      "Adri\u00e1n had a crown tattoo with the initial \u201cY,\u201d the first letter of his ex-wife\u2019s name, on his hand, Alejandro said. When he was arrested in November, officers told him they were linking him to Tren de Aragua \u201cbecause of that tattoo,\u201d Alejandro said.",
      "That\u2019s why he later covered it with a tiger tattoo, Alejandro said. ICE has pointed to tattoos, including those of a crown, as indicators of membership in Tren de Aragua. Adri\u00e1n also has a tattoo of his mother\u2019s name on one of his biceps.",
      "\u201cWe are not criminal people. We are people who studied professions in Venezuela. We had careers; we\u2019re not people who are linked with any of that,\u201d said Alejandro, who had jobs in banking and insurance in Venezuela and other Latin American countries but now works at a restaurant.",
      "Adri\u00e1n graduated from high school in Venezuela with a focus on science, Alejandro said, later taking a barber course amid the country\u2019s dismal economy.",
      "Adri\u00e1n emigrated to Colombia with his then-wife and daughter and worked there for a several years. When the area became unsafe, he moved his wife and daughter back to Venezuela and then went to Mexico and applied for a CBP One appointment to enter the United States.",
      "Adri\u00e1n came to the United States \u201cbecause we all know the political, social and economic\u00a0situation in Venezuela\u201d and he wanted to make enough money to buy his daughter a house back home, Alejandro said.",
      "Before he got confirmation that his brother was in El Salvador, Alejandro said, he would sometimes get on his knees and pray. \u201cI\u2019ve had moments where I think \u2018at any moment he\u2019s going to call\u2019 and then moments when I\u2019m shattered and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cI never, ever thought I would go through a situation like this,\u201d he said, adding that the only thing he thought would happen when he came to the United States himself as a migrant was that \u201cthey either give you asylum or they deport you. Not a forced disappearance.\u201d"

      "About 46% of U.S. residents \u2014 156 million people \u2014 lived in areas with unhealthy air quality that earned \u201cF\u201d grades from the American Lung Association for ozone or particle pollution.",
      "That\u2019s according to the association\u2019s 26th annual analysis of air quality data, which shows that the country is regressing on clean air measures.",
      "The analysis \u2014 which reviewed data from the years 2021 to 2023 \u2014 saw an increase of about 25 million people living with unhealthy air in comparison with last year\u2019s survey.",
      "The report shows how the effects of climate change \u2014 heat, drought and increased wildfire smoke \u2014 are driving changes in air quality across the country.",
      "\u201cThis year, we were really struck by, first of all, the large increase in the number of people across the country living with unhealthy air, and how much of the increase was driven by worsening ozone,\u201d said Katherine Pruitt, the national senior director for clean air policy at the American Lung Association, who added that hot, sunny weather \u201cmakes ozone more likely to form.\u201d",
      "In 2023, the last year of the lung association\u2019s analysis, global temperatures were the hottest recorded to date, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\u00a0Temperatures in the U.S. were their fifth highest in the country\u2019s history.\u00a0(That record has already been surpassed: In 2024, NASA scientists estimated the Earth was about 2.65 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.47 degrees Celsius, hotter than the historic average from 1850 to 1900.)",
      "Pruitt, the report's lead author, said her study shows ozone, also known as smog, spiked in places like Texas, which dealt with a sizzling heat wave in 2023.",
      "\u201cIn 2023, the ozone levels in Texas really shot up,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cThey had a long spell of very hot weather day after day.\u201d",
      "Temperatures in towns like Del Rio exceeded 100 degrees for more than two weeks straight that year.",
      "Intense wildfire smoke also contributed to so many regions receiving failing grades. In 2023, smoke from intense Canadian wildfires spread across population centers in the Northeast, causing the most smoke exposure per person in modern U.S. history.",
      "Increases in wildfire smoke, which creates small particles that can penetrate in the lungs and circulate in people\u2019s bloodstreams, is chipping away at the progress made on air quality since Congress passed the Clean Air Act in 1963.",
      "In 2023, Marshall Burke, an associate professor at Stanford University, published a study that found that increases in wildfire smoke had undone about 25% of the progress made under the Clean Air Act.",
      "The lung association\u2019s reports show a similar turnaround in progress, beginning in 2016.",
      "\u201cIn about 2016, we start to see that trend reverse,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cThe climate is changing and it is increasing the risk of these extreme weather conditions that are making breathing worse for millions of people across the U.S. Until we get a handle on the sources of emissions that are leading to degradation of the environment, we\u2019re going to suffer the consequences.\u201d",
      "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin last month outlined plans for an aggressive rollback of environmental regulations, and the agency plans to reconsider some programs authorized by the Clean Air Act, including rules setting emissions standards for vehicles and regulations of\u00a0power plants.",
      "The lung association report found that Bakersfield, California, had the most polluted air in the country from 2021-2023. It ranked first in short-term particle pollution (when air reaches \"unhealthy\" or \"very unhealthy\" levels, according to the air quality index), third in year-round particle pollution and first in ozone pollution."

    "story": [
      "Author Emily Henry\u2019s career can perhaps best be described as a writer\u2019s dream.",
      "The 34-year-old has published 10 books since 2017, sold more than 9 million copies in the U.S., and secured a four-book deal in 2022 after her book \u201cBeach Read\u201d became a New York Times bestseller in the early months of the pandemic. After the release of her newest book, \u201cGreat Big Beautiful Life,\u201d on April 22, 2025, she has one more book to deliver on that deal (although she tells us it will not be her last).",
      "Five of her books are in the process of being adapted to film or TV series. The one she says is nearest completion is \"People We Meet On Vacation,\" which is expected to be released on Netflix with Emily Bader and Tom Blyth playing the leads.",
      "So when TODAY.com caught up with Henry days before her newest book was released, we led with one question: How are you holding up?",
      "\u201cI've never had an interview open with that question!\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cIt is intense, this has been kind of a breakneck pace for me.\"",
      "Just the last few months alone have been an exciting time for Henry. As she was gearing up to release \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" early screeners for \"People We Meet On Vacation\" were viewed by select audiences, and the response so far, she tells TODAY.com, has been a \"relief.\"",
      "\"It is definitely a lot but I\u2019m riding the high in the adrenaline of all of it,\" she says. \"It\u2019s been a really, really beautiful whirlwind.\"",
      "Read on for TODAY.com's conversation with the bestselling author.",
      "This interview has been condensed and edited.",
      "It's really weird. On some days, it feels totally normal and mundane almost, and then it will hit me. I don't think it will ever feel totally normal. I think I was set up to understand how bizarre and uncommon and miraculous all of this is and I try to appreciate it at every turn. It definitely stays feeling a bit surreal at all times, but that's probably a good thing.",
      "I think \"Great Big Beautiful Life\" was sort of a sidestep where I got to have a romantic-comedy plotline but also do something a little bit different. I will write some more straightforward romantic comedies in the coming years, but I also really enjoyed getting to do something different and I'm excited to see what else is out there that would be fun to work on. At some point, I would love to revisit writing thrillers, but I am always going to love a love story.",
      "I'm a laptop and couch person. I love that Abby does that. I'm just a mess with my phone, so if I were writing fully on my phone, that would take five times as long as it would on a computer.",
      "But I will say, a lot of times, my favorite scenes are things that I first do have to write down on my phone because they happen when I'm out on the go. Sometimes you're in a waiting room and something occurs to you, or you're lying down at night and trying to go to sleep and then I have an idea for a scene or a bit of dialogue. I have to pull out my notes app and transcribe as well as I can with one eye shut. So there is something really freeing about being untethered from your computer.",
      "Oh my gosh, that makes me so happy. I didn't see a ton because I do not Google anything with \"Emily Henry\" in it. But I do get tagged and saw some really excited readers who got to see an early cut of the movie. It thrilled me and relieved me.",
      "When I saw the cut, I felt pretty sure that the readers were going to be totally in love with it. But it's definitely still a relief and really exciting to see what has been the case so far.",
      "It's the full spectrum of human emotion to go through this process. It truly is a miracle that anything gets made, and it's especially a miracle when something good gets made because there are so many obstacles. The big thing for me is wanting the adaptations to be something that the readers would be excited about but that also can stand alone as movies. That's what everybody wants, and I do believe that they've managed to pull that off.",
      "I don't think it has because from the beginning, I have understood that adaptations are going to be polarizing and people are going to have intense feelings and opinions.",
      "I think readers don't fully understand the scope of what an author can and cannot do with an adaptation. I have used every moment that I have been invited to the table, so to speak, to advocate for what I think the readers will care most about. Beyond that, I am well aware that there's not so much that I can do.  I think there's a misconception that writers are out there casting their own movies and making big calls and that's simply not the case. We are one of many, many, many voices in any room that we're in when it comes to adaptations. All we can do is advocate for the readers and hope it works out.",
      "I think there\u2019s still a sense that these books are only for women, and that\u2019s not true. I do think that\u2019s still a large percentage of who the readership is, but these books are just books, they\u2019re just stories. They\u2019re meant for anyone who needs them and anyone who should feel welcome to pick them up and give them a try.",
      "I think they\u2019re really, really important cornerstones of fiction. I think love stories are always going to matter, because to most of us, love really matters.",
      "I do think right now we are seeing a huge boom because the world does feel so unpredictable and chaotic and scary. \"Beach Read\u201d came out at the start of the pandemic and I really think that part of the reason that book took off in the way it did was because we were all housebound and lonely and isolated. And even though the pandemic is now over, I think that some of those feelings of isolation have hung around and I think we\u2019re all looking for connection and hope and I think romance offers those two things in spades.",
      "The purpose of a happily ever after, to me, is to present the idea of hope and to present the idea that even though the world can be chaotic and scary and unpredictable, there are these things in our lives that make all of it worth it or manageable on some level, and that is love."

      "The supernatural horror flick opens with a shot of Sammie, portrayed by newcomer Miles Caton, arriving bloodied and bruised to his father\u2019s Mississippi church service in the 1930s. Frightened as his son stumbles toward him with a broken guitar, the preacher asks Sammie to reject his love of music, for good.",
      "Then, the movie rewinds 24 hours earlier to show a hopeful Sammie having the best day of his life with twin cousins Smoke and Stack \u2014 both played by Jordan \u2014 before the sun goes down and everything changes.",
      "In the film, which also stars Delroy Lindo, Hailee Steinfeld, Wunmi Mosaku, Jack O\u2019Connell, Jayme Lawson, Omar Benson Miller and Li Jun Li, a night filled with music and joy quickly becomes a nightmare as the characters have to fight for survival against deadly vampires. Prior to its release in theaters on April 18, \u201cSinners\u201d received rave reviews from critics, who described it as \u201cvibrant and richly acted\u201d and \u201cbloody mayhem.\u201d\u00a0It also currently holds a Rotten Tomatoes critics and audience score of 97%, which is Coogler's best film score to date.",
      "The gory last act is filled with jump scares, twists and a couple of post-credits scenes. Read on for TODAY.com\u2019s breakdown of how \u201cSinners\u201d ends, where we unpack all of the plotlines and the movie\u2019s biggest questions, including who survives and who dies.",
      "What happens at the end of \u2018Sinners\u2019?",
      "After introducing characters like Smoke, Stack and Sammie in the first few minutes, \u201cSinners\u201d shows them preparing to open a juke joint in an old mill the twins purchased from a deceitful and racist landowner. As the sun sets, patrons, including Mary (Steinfeld) and Pearline (Lawson), arrive for the establishment\u2019s grand opening while others, such as Cornbread (Miller), Grace (Li), Delta Slim (Lindo) and Annie (Mosaku), are already there to help Smoke and Stack pull off a successful night.",
      "The characters spend the early hours of the evening in pure revelry, dancing and singing along to Sammie\u2019s music before an uninvited guest named Remmick (O\u2019Connell) asks to be invited in. He is denied, but ominously waits outside.",
      "Each time a character leaves the juke joint, they return changed and suddenly need approval to re-enter. Sensing an otherworldly presence, Annie quickly realizes that Remmick is a vampire who bites and creates more blood-thirsty creatures whenever a guest leaves the safety of the jukebar.",
      "Remmick later turns Mary into a vampire, who in turn does the same to her former lover Stack. Soon, more guests are turned into the undead and only a handful of humans remain.",
      "Who dies in 'Sinners'?",
      "Ultimately, everyone who is bitten and turned into a vampire dies, but some of those vampires do live on, which viewers learn in a post-credits scene.",
      "Leading up to the climatic battle, Smoke, Annie, Delta Slim, Pearline, Grace and Sammie decide to think of a plan while Remmick and the other vampires await their demise. After a desperate Grace welcomes the vampires in, the others, armed with stakes and garlic water, fight for their lives.",
      "Annie is bitten and Smoke stabs her in the heart, at her request, before she becomes a vampire. Pearline is also killed and Grace is burned alive trying to defend herself against a vampire who has taken over her husband\u2019s body. Delta Slim chooses to sacrifice himself to give Smoke and Sammie time to escape.",
      "Before the credits officially roll, viewers learn that Smoke and Sammie are the only humans left standing.",
      "Lindo spoke to TODAY.com about his character\u2019s fate and why it was honorable given Delta Slim\u2019s backstory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very heroic thing to do, but it\u2019s also a sacrifice that\u2019s necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to, as I see it (and) as Delta Slim sees it, preserve the future of the music and the future of the culture, it has to be done.\u201d",
      "Miller, who was also interviewed by TODAY.com, chimed in and added that Delta Slim\u2019s death represents \u201cthe redemption of whatever ills that he may have, that he may be carrying.\u201d",
      "Lindo agreed, saying his character felt compelled to save Sammie.",
      "\u201cThe fact is part of my (character\u2019s) alcoholism comes out of the guilt that I feel at not being able to have saved my friend who I talked about in the car,\" he explained. \"So it is redemptive. I couldn\u2019t save him, but I will save the young preacher boy, the young one, the young pup who\u2019s carrying the tradition forward.\u201d",
      "Who survives in 'Sinners'?",
      "As the last humans standing, Smoke and Sammie attempt to flee but vampire Stack catches them. Smoke and Stack fight and Smoke appears to get the upper hand before the scene cuts to show Sammie, who jumped out a window and injured his leg, being surrounded by Remmick and all the vampires.",
      "While Remmick tries to drown and kill Sammie, the young musician reaches for his guitar \u2014 which the twins gave to him \u2014 and smashes it into Remmick\u2019s head. The metal plate on the guitar lodges in Remmick\u2019s head and kills him as the sun rises and turns all the other vampires into ashes.",
      "Sammie returns home and the scene of him walking into the church service replays. Meanwhile, Smoke, who also survived, stays at the juke joint and waits for the man who sold him the old mill to arrive. He shoots the landowner and all the Ku Klux Klan members after previously learning from Remmick that they had planned to ambush Smoke, Stack and their friends the next morning.",
      "During the shootout, one bullet hits Smoke and he slowly dies before being greeted by an apparition of Annie and their child, who died years ago.",
      "Sammie now becomes the only human survivor. However, once the post-credits roll, viewers learn that Stack and Mary, who are both vampires, have survived as well.",
      "What do the two post-credits scenes mean?",
      "\u201cSinners\u201d waits until a post-credits scene to reveal if Sammie chose to rebuke music like his father asked.",
      "As the credits roll, viewers see an older Sammie playing music at a dive bar with his band in the \u201890s. The musician chose to continue to pursue his love of music despite that traumatic night.",
      "In a second post-credits scene, the older version of Sammie sits at a bar before two familiar faces join him: Stack and Mary. It is revealed that Mary ran off and evaded the sunlight before Remmick and the others were burned years ago.",
      "Stack sits by Sammie\u2019s side and shares that he made a deal with Smoke during their fight to leave Sammie alone. Sammie tells them that he was having the best day of his life before the bloodbath. Stack agrees, pointing out that it was the last moment he felt sunshine and saw his brother.",
      "Stack and Mary then leave, leaving the door open for a potential sequel."

      "It will be available at Target stores nationwide, on the Target website and khloudfoods.com on April 29.",

      "Kardashian said in the release that it\u2019s made with ingredients \u201cyou can pronounce,\u201d which reinforces a common talking point in the nutrition world that hard-to-pronounce foods are inherently harmful.",

      "A serving of the popcorn has 7 grams of complete protein from the brand\u2019s proprietary \u201cKhloud Dust,\u201d a blend of seasoning and milk proteins that adds \u201cboth flavor and function.\u201d",
      "Kardashian seems to be hopping on the protein-maxxing bandwagon. Brands across the country have been catering to that consumer desire, packing the macronutrient into ice cream, candy bars, lemonade and even water. The cottage cheese industry has never been happier.",

      "I found myself reaching for a bag when I wasn\u2019t ready for a meal but needed a little boost. Whether or not that\u2019s due to the placebo effect, I\u2019ve already eaten the entire bag of Kettle Corn, and I\u2019ll probably buy more in the future.",
      "I may be \u201cable to pronounce\u201d milk protein isolate \u2014 the ingredient that gives this product its protein boost \u2014 but didn\u2019t know what it was until now: a supplement made from skim milk that has little effect on the popcorn\u2019s taste, at least to my tongue.",
      "Those of us who down protein shakes are familiar with the grit of protein powder. That texture is not unwelcome here.",
      "Anyone who has had a bag of white cheddar Smartfood popcorn is familiar with its pleasant powderiness, which is present in all of Khloud\u2019s popped offerings. Unsurprisingly, it works best in the White Cheddar.",
      "I will say that that texture was a little less pleasant with the Kettle Corn, since I expected it be more sticky than gritty. But I actually liked that my hands weren\u2019t covered with syrupy residue after downing a handful.",
      "The one flavor I didn\u2019t enjoy was the Olive Oil & Sea Salt. I could taste neither the olive oil nor the sea salt. But, as the blandest of the three flavors, it could make a good protein-packed base for some popcorn balls if you have leftover Easter candy."

    "summary": "\u201cPulse\u201d stars Justina Machado, Willa Fitzgerald and Colin Woodell chat with TODAY about the bilingual Netflix series set in Miami.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cPulse\u201d is the latest medical drama to hit the small screen and this time, it\u2019s set in Miami.",
      "The Netflix series has a dynamic cast that includes a slew of Latino actors who incorporate Spanish into scenes with one another and the patients in need.",
      "For star Justina Machado, acting in both languages \u201cis incredible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve always wanted to do,\u201d Machado told the 3rd Hour co-hosts during an April 21 TODAY appearance, adding that the creators \u201clet us have our authentic accents\u201d for their characters.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Puerto Rican, Nestor Carbonell is Cuban, Daniela Nieves is Venezuelan,\u201d Machado said. \u201cSo you got the whole mix up in there and it\u2019s fantastic.\u201d",
      "Machado plays Dr. Natalie Cruz, the chair of emergency medicine at a trauma hospital in Miami. She oversees the challenges that the trauma center endures as a hurricane makes its way towards Miami. At the same time, she deals with the romantic and professional fall out between third-year resident Dr. Danny Simms (Willa Fitzgerald) and beloved Chief Resident Dr. Xander Phillips (Colin Woodell).",
      "After Xander is suspended for their illicit romance, Danny is thrust into his high-pressure position as the rest of the ER is left to deal with their own complicated lives and patients.",
      "Throughout the series, Machado\u2019s Dr. Cruz and Carbonell\u2019s Dr.\u00a0Ruben Soriano, a senior surgeon, communicate in Spanish to discuss the day\u2019s issues, as well as their own personal matters.",
      "But what makes \u201cPulse\u201d unique is that the Spanish dialogue among the cast doesn\u2019t always come from a Latino actor. At time, it comes from a medical profession like Danny, who, as actor Willa Fitzgerald tells TODAY.com, would have picked up the language from living in the predominantly Latino city.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t speak Spanish, but several of the people in the cast did, several of us didn\u2019t,\u201d Fitzgerald says. \u201cThose of us that didn\u2019t, we all did Duolingo all day, every day. We were like, \u2018We have got to learn Spanish!\u2019\u201d",
      "While she jokingly considers her Spanish-speaking ability to be at \u201c2-year-old level,\u201d Fitzgerald enjoyed incorporating Spanish into her character when helping out a patient in need.",
      "Danny\u2019s Spanish is effective enough to help a man who is adamant about not having his foot amputated in the show\u2019s fourth episode.",
      "\u201cI was like, I don\u2019t think it should sound like she\u2019s a native speaker,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that she learned it because she works in a community that has a lot of Spanish speaking people.\u201d",
      "While not a native Spanish speaker himself, actor Colin Woodell applauds the team for making the show feel authentic when it comes to Spanish-speaking scenes.",
      "\u201cThe writers also really wanted to make sure it was authentic, and I knew that there was going to be different vernacular for different parts of the world,\u201d Woodell tells TODAY.com. \u201cI think a lot of the actors took a lot of ownership over how they would sound, what they would say, especially Justina, and Arturo (Del Puerto) and Daniela as well. It was really cool.\u201d",
      "\u201cPulse\u201d is now streaming on Netflix."

      "Affleck, who finalized his divorce from Lopez in January 2025, told \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d at the April 16 premiere of his film that he brought multiple special guests with him.",

I love her kids, they\u2019re wonderful. She\u2019s enormously important, tremendous person of a lot of integrity who I adore and I\u2019m grateful to.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that the kids are here with me and that\u2019s the kind of thing like, the relationships that you can have with children like that \u2014 that\u2019s the joy of my life.

      "The third episode of \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d Season 7, titled \u201cHotel Reverie,\u201d begs the question whether consciousness supersedes physical reality.",
      "The episode starts when Kimmy (Awkwafina), the head of a movie production company that uses artificial intelligence, pitches a revival of a 1940s romance, \u201cHotel Reverie.\u201d",
      "To her surprise, A-list celebrity Brandy Friday, played by Issa Rae, is interested in taking on the leading male role in the remake. When she arrives on set, Brandy is met with new technology in movie-making.",
      "The film crew transports Brandy\u2019s consciousness from her physical body onto the set of the original \u201cHotel Reverie,\u201d where she plays her role alongside AI versions of the 1940s actors. All she has to do is follow the movie's original plot.",
      "But the setting feels too real. Unexpectedly, Brandy ends up falling for her counterpart, actor Dorothy, played by Emma Corrin. The major complication? Dorothy believes that she's truly the part she plays in the film, Clara.",
      "When technical difficulties in the real world cause Brandy to be trapped in the film, she uses the time to tell Dorothy that she's unknowingly an AI version of a 1940s actor. Dorothy then begins to gain consciousness and awareness of her predicament.",
      "Giving up on finding any way out of the movie set, Brandy and Dorothy fall in love and embrace a short-lived but passionate romance.",
      "What happens at the end of the \u2018Hotel Reverie\u2019 episode of \u2018Black Mirror\u2019?",
      "The only way Brandy can leave the movie set is by finishing the narrative arc and saying her character's famous last line. Otherwise she will be trapped in the movie and her body will die.",
      "When the film's technology is once again functioning, Kimmy tells Brandy she'll finally be able to finish shooting and return to her real-life body.",
      "In order to proceed to the end of the film, the crew would have to go back in time to where they left off. By doing so, Dorothy would forget everything that happened when she was trapped with Brandy, including their romance.",
      "Brandy has to decide whether she wants to return to her physical reality or stay in the movie.",
      "Brandy proceeds to subtly change the storyline in hopes to pivot away from the ending and potentially remain in her artificial world, which sends the film crew into a panic.",
      "When they realize the depth of Brandy's feelings for Dorothy, the crew equally seems drawn into the conflict of whether to pull her out of the film.",
      "\"There\u2019s a moment where Kimmy is understanding that Brandy is being a little lost in there and the harrowing reality that maybe she might prefer to be in there,\" Awkwafina tells TODAY.com.",
      "When asked if Kimmy ever considered letting Brandy stay in the alternate reality, Awkwafina says, \u201cI don\u2019t think she would allow it to happen. That would be bad.\u201d",
      "Because of Brandy's subtle pulls to sabotage the story to stay on set longer, the plot diverts severely from the original film and results in the death of Dorothy's character, Clara.",
      "Holding Dorothy in her arms, Brandy is faced with whether or not to recite her final line and return to the real world.",
      "Ultimately, she chooses to say the line, the key to bring her back to reality. She tells Dorothy through tears that she will be \u201cforever yours.\u201d",
      "Brandy is immediately brought back to her physical reality, waking up to the entire crew teary-eyed.",
      "At the very end of the film, Brandy receives a special package from the film company. The gift contained an video of Dorothy doing a screen test back in the 1940s.",
      "During the screen test, Dorothy must take a fake phone call, but jokes about how difficult it is when there's no one on the other line. Suddenly, Brandy digs further through the package to find a telephone.",
      "The episode concludes with Brandy rekindling her spark with Dorothy, as the two share a heartwarming conversation through the phone.",
      "When asked if the ending suggests the movie company could let Brandy revisit that alternate reality and rekindle her romance with Dorothy, Awkwafina tells TODAY.com, \u201cI think probably not, but that\u2019s something that I even wonder too.\u201d",
      "The actor points to another \"Black Mirror\" episode from Season 4, \u201cSan Junipero,\u201d as being related to \"Hotel Reverie.\" Both are queer romances that feature characters finding havens in alternate consciousnesses.",
      "\u201cThe realities that you choose to live in are really subjective if your consciousness is there. You might prefer different realities if you can live in them,\u201d Awkwafina says, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s like a weird, scary kind of idea, but true.\u201d"

      "The scene in question, described at a recent panel by Christopher Meloni as \u201cthe kitchen thing,\u201d aired in January 2023, and fans have continued to discuss the tragic (?!) events of it ever since \u2014 and so have the show\u2019s stars.",
      "A teaser aired two weeks prior to the episode showing Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Meloni\u2019s Elliot Stabler with their hands all over each other before appearing to lean in for a kiss in the kitchen of Benson\u2019s apartment. The promo made national news, and Meloni even appeared ahead of the episode on TODAY, where he was grilled under a spotlight about what was to come.",
      "When the episode aired, however, some of the scenes in the promo did not make the final version.",
      "No, Benson and Stabler did not kiss, but what ended up airing that night was not actually what the actors had planned for the characters.",
      "\u201cSo, the kitchen thing,\u201d Meloni said at a TVLine Spotlight conversation April 16. \u201cWe were attempting something. I don\u2019t think it worked. But I\u2019m not going to tell you why it didn\u2019t work, because you all have your opinion; I know what transpired.\u201d",
      "His comments echo those of Hargitay, who revealed to Variety in 2024 that the scene was \u201cchanged at the last minute.\u201d \u201cTo be honest with you, Chris and I thought it should go one way and the powers that be didn\u2019t, so it got changed at the last minute, that near kiss,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously, Dick (Wolf, the show\u2019s creator) gets final say. It\u2019s his show and he didn\u2019t want that.\u201d",
      "Meloni told TVLine he has \u201cno idea\u201d what the future holds for Benson and Stabler. Even when he wrote a recent episode of his show, \u201cLaw & Order: Organized Crime,\u201d which Hargitay guest starred in, he did not touch on where the characters may ultimately end up and instead focused on who they are as people and how they interact with each other.",
      "\u201cI thought it was a natural and correct evolution to get to gain greater insight into their engagements \u2014 maybe not where they\u2019re going and all that stuff,\u201d he told TODAY.com April 14. \u201cThose are bigger-ticket items. How they speak to each other, how they feel about each other.\u201d",
      "Meloni explained to the crowd at the Spotlight conversation that the decisions about Benson and Stabler extend beyond him and Hargitay, noting that \u201cOC\u201d has cycled through multiple showrunners since its premiere in April 2021.",
      "\u201cEach new person comes in, they\u2019ve got their own ideas. They\u2019ve got their own views, and on top of that, you also have the Wolf (Entertainment) folks,\u201d he said about the show\u2019s producers. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not even quite clear. And then you have \u2018SVU\u2019 folk. So, we\u2019ve had confabs about, \u2018Where are we going? What are we doing?\u2019",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s like every meeting: It doesn\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d he joked.",
      "Hargitay and Meloni have appeared in each other\u2019s shows many times since Meloni began reprising Stabler in the \u201cL&O\u201d universe.

      "\u201cOn the day, you get what you get, and you do the best you can to make sense of it,\u201d Meloni said about filming scenes. \u201cYou push back, or you advocate for something.\u201d",
      "While decisions such as the final events of the kitchen scene are out of Meloni\u2019s and Hargitay\u2019s hands, Meloni explained they both are doing their best to \u201cmake it honest, not make it bait.\u201d",

      "While ministerial talks that had been planned to take place in London fell apart, President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, still planned to meet with Ukrainian presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak who arrived in London early Wednesday along the Ukrainian defense and foreign ministers.",
      "\u201cDespite everything, we continue working for peace,\u201d Yermak said in a post on X.",
      "The setback comes during a week in which the Trump administration has doubled down its efforts to push Kyiv and Moscow toward a truce. Next week marks 100 days of the second presidential term of Trump, who promised to end the war on his first day back in office. Rubio suggested last week that the United States may walk away from ceasefire efforts failing any further progress.",
      "\"The downgrading is significant,\" said Orysia Lutsevych, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at the London-based think tank Chatham House, citing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's rejection of the idea that Russia could maintain control of Crimea as part of a deal.",
      "Rubio and Witkoff's absence \"suggests that Washington is increasingly disinterested in drawn-out, multilateral negotiations,\" Lutsevych added. \"This is not just about diplomacy fatigue. It also signals a hard pivot: the U.S. is not positioning itself as a neutral mediator.\"",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce confirmed Tuesday that Rubio would skip the meeting hours after saying the opposite. \u201cThat is not a statement regarding the meetings. It\u2019s a statement about logistical issues in his schedule,\u201d she said.",
      "Despite initial plans to attend the slated talks, neither Rubio nor Witkoff were in London on Wednesday, a European diplomat told NBC News.",
      "The British Foreign Ministry issued said in a statement that \u201cthe\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0peace talks meeting with foreign ministers today is being postponed,\" with top officials from France and Germany also confirming their absence.",
      "As well as meeting with Kellogg, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post on X that he, Yermak and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov would sit down with the British foreign and defense ministers.",
      "Expectations that Kyiv and Moscow would make a deal to end their three-year-long war this week remained low after the U.S. presented Ukraine and its European allies with peace proposals last week in Paris that both sides saw as unacceptable, according to NBC News\u2019 international partner, Sky News.",
      "Under a \u201cterms sheet\u201d offered by Rubio and Witkoff, a land-for-peace deal would recognize Russia\u2019s currently illegal annexation of Crimea and work toward lifting European Union sanctions on Russia. Both parties have since rejected the terms.",
      "After months of upbeat statements on indirect U.S.-led talks, but limited practical engagement, Russian\u00a0President Vladimir\u00a0Putin on Tuesday suggested for the first time that he would be open to bilateral ceasefire talks with Zelenskyy.",
      "The Financial Times reported Tuesday that Putin had also offered to halt fighting along current front lines, leaving around a fifth of Ukraine's territory in Russian hands.",
      "Zelenskyy has not responded to such a suggestion but he rejected the suggestion Tuesday that his country would give up its claim to Crimea.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about here,\u201d he said of the disputed peninsula in a media conference. \u201cThis is against our Constitution.\u201d",
      "The issue of Crimea may well be one of the most difficult points of difference to overcome, said Matthew Saville, director of military sciences at the London-based think tank, the Royal United Services Institute.",
      "\"I think it will be extraordinarily difficult, bordering on political suicide, for [Zelenskyy] to commit to paper on things like giving up Crimea,\" Saville said. That said, \"Ukraine is not going to recapture Crimea anytime soon. Ukraine is unlikely to be a NATO member anytime soon.\"",
      "\"There might be some formulation [of a deal] that effectively kicks those into the long grass,\" Saville added, caveating that \"the terms of any deal at the moment are not going to be particularly favorable to Ukraine.\"",
      "Despite the collapse of Wednesday's talks, Putin is still planning on another meeting with Witkoff in Moscow this week, according to the Russian news agency Tass.",
      "In a media conference Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov welcomed the Trump administration's continuing mediation efforts.",
      "\"We continue our contacts,\" he said. \"Still, of course, there are many details regarding the settlement, a lot of details which need to be discussed, where we need to bring positions closer to one another.\u201d",

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 The Israeli Defense Forces faulted a series of \u201cprofessional failures\u201d and \u201cbreaches of order\u201d in\u00a0an\u00a0incident last month\u00a0when Israeli soldiers killed 15 Palestinian\u00a0emergency\u00a0workers in Gaza, an event that sparked widespread condemnation and calls for an independent investigation.",
      "In the summary of an internal report on the killings and a briefing to foreign media Sunday, the IDF said it \u201cregrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians\u201d and announced that it had discharged the field commander leading the implicated unit and formally reprimanded a senior officer.",
      "The report and the IDF\u2019s rare acceptance of blame were the culmination of a weekslong scandal that had heaped further criticism on Israel\u2019s military just days after it broke a two-month ceasefire agreement with Hamas and restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The controversy around the killings worsened after United Nations personnel recovered the bodies from a shallow mass grave near the scene of the incident on March 23, and cellphone video found on one of the corpses revealed serious inconsistencies in the IDF\u2019s original version of events.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a chain of professional mistakes but with no ethical gaps,\u201d Brig. Gen.\u00a0Ephraim Defrin, said the newly appointed IDF spokesperson, in a presentation to reporters Sunday evening. \u201cThere was never any intention to deceive the public.\u201d",
      "Some initial reports from Palestinian examiners claimed that some of the medics had been found with their arms bound. However, other Palestinian medics said there was no evidence that the medics had been restrained before they were shot execution-style, a claim the IDF also denied.",
      "The Palestine Red Crescent Society said in a statement after the bodies were found that the targeting of the medics \u201ccan only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law, which the occupation continues to violate before the eyes of the entire world.\u201d",
      "The aid workers included paramedics, civil defense staff members and a U.N. employee.",
      "Israel previously said its soldiers shot and killed people they considered to be \u201cterrorists\u201d who were \u201cadvancing suspiciously.\u201d The IDF also claimed that vehicles that were approaching its position lacked headlights or emergency signals. At the time, Israeli forces reported that they killed nine militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad.",
      "The military later walked that back after video from the Palestine Red Crescent challenged its version of events. NBC News reviewed video from the phone of a paramedic who was killed, showing an ambulance with its headlights and emergency lights flashing at the moment the soldiers opened fire. The vehicle was clearly marked with the insignia of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Flashing lights from two other vehicles are also visible in the video.",
      "The investigation revealed \u201cseveral professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident,\u201d the IDF said.",
      "But the public report and the presentation, which retired Maj. Gen. Yoav Har-Even, who led the presentation, said were conducted \u201coutside the chain of command,\u201d did not answer all of the questions surrounding the shootings.\u00a0It did not provide evidence to back up the Israeli military\u2019s contention that six of the 15 slain emergency workers were actually Hamas operatives, nor did it explain why the number of slain medics whom the IDF considered terrorists had changed.",
      "The report and the presentation also left it unclear why one of the surviving medics, Asaad al-Nassasra, was detained by the IDF and still remains in its custody.",
      "Alongside the report summary, Har-Even showed a video presentation that featured aerial surveillance of the early-morning shootings, including night-vision reconnaissance video.",
      "The probe found that troops were hampered by poor visibility and that they misidentified ambulances and rescue vehicles as threats during a mission targeting Hamas operatives, according to Sunday's report. Har-Even laid partial blame on the soldiers\u2019 night vision goggles for leading to what he called the \u201ctragic and undesirable result of a complex combat situation.\u201d The goggles\u2019 limited peripheral perspective, among other factors, made it difficult for the soldiers to recognize the trucks as civilian emergency vehicles despite their flashing emergency lights, he said.",
      "Another strike on a U.N. vehicle resulted from a breach of operational rules, the IDF\u2019s report says.",
      "The field commander in charge of the operation on the ground, whom the report did not name but whom IDF public relations officers identified as a major, was dismissed in part for \u201cproviding an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief.\u201d",
      "The commanding officer of the 14th Brigade\u00a0received a formal reprimand that will appear in his personnel file, the report summary said, both because of his \u201coverall responsibility\u201d for the shooting and his \u201cmanagement of the scene afterward.\u201d"

      "In a video, Mahmoud Ajjour is beaming as he skips into the breeze. He breaks into laughter as he watches his kite flutter in the sky, pulling it along with a string tied around his waist, in a moment that captured the irrepressible joy of childhood.",
      "At 9 years old, Mahmoud has known more trauma than most will see in a lifetime. On Dec. 6, 2023, the fourth grader was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, a blast that severed one of his arms and left the other so badly damaged it had to be amputated. On Thursday, an image of Mahmoud, taken by Palestinian photographer Samar Abu Elouf for The New York Times, was named World Press Photo of the Year, a haunting portrait of the impact of the war on children.",
      "Mahmoud now lives in Doha, Qatar, with his family, after becoming one of a very small number of Palestinians to be evacuated from Gaza for urgent medical treatment.",
      "When Mahmoud smiles, his happiness seems infectious, but some days are harder than others. \u201cThere are bad moments for him,\u201d his mother, Nour Ajjour, 36, told NBC News by phone from Doha, Qatar\u2019s capital. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to play or go outside.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe keep him busy and have fun with him,\u201d Ajjour said. She sent videos of him gleefully speeding down a hallway on an electric bike, steering with his feet on the handlebars, and using his feet to play with a lump of bright-green clay.",
      "For now, Ajjour said, there\u2019s not much Mahmoud can do on his own, and he\u2019s impatient for prostheses, asking when he can have them so he can drink water on his own or help his family.",
      "\u201cHe likes to help a lot, and I let him help me and carry things on his shoulder,\u201d Ajjour said.",
      "Doctors at Doha\u2019s Hamad Limb Hospital are currently fitting him for protheses, and in another video, he smiles brightly as he tries on a pair of prosthetic arms.",
      "In Gaza, such treatment isn\u2019t possible, and\u00a0Mahmoud is one of at least 1,000 children in the enclave to have lost at least one limb during the war, according to UNICEF, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Many of the children, like many adults, underwent surgery without anesthesia as the health care system buckled under Israel\u2019s siege.",
      "\u201cThe first few days were very difficult,\u201d Ajjour said. Both of his hands were gone, and without anesthetic, Mahmoud was in both physical and existential pain.",
      "\u201cHe would look at his hands and not see them,\u201d the boy\u2019s mother said. \u201cHe would scream and say, \u2018Where are my hands,\u2019 and the first thing he said was, \u2018How will I hug you, how will I pray?\u2019\u201d",
      "These days, Mahmoud is learning how to type on a computer, write and use a phone with his feet. Ajjour said he dreams of going to university and becoming a journalist so he can tell the stories of Gaza\u2019s children."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Marcus Wu\u2019s home racing simulator setup needs one more thing: a manual gearshift. A decade ago, one from a Western brand would have been a no-brainer for gamers like the 12-year-old Hongkonger.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with Beijing escalates, the fact that Wu opted for a gearshift from Chinese manufacturer Moza illustrates how far Chinese manufacturers have come in competing with their Western counterparts on affordability and quality.",
      "The deepening economic conflict between the U.S. and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, has the potential to wreak havoc on a complex web of globalized commerce. And Trump\u2019s attempts to claw back manufacturing to American shores could have unintended consequences, including giving Chinese technology manufacturers an edge at a time when American products are already becoming expensive.",
      "Wu and his father-cum-financier, Mingfai, have already made their choice, opting for a Chinese alternative over American brands such as the Oregon-based Thrustmaster. \u201cIf only the price was good but the quality wasn\u2019t, then I wouldn\u2019t have bought this,\u201d the elder Wu said. \u201cBut this is cheaper and works great.\u201d",
      "The duo were browsing Hong Kong\u2019s Sham Shui Po computer market \u2014 a sprawling hub of small tech stores selling everything from computer parts to gaming equipment for casual gamers and enthusiasts alike.",
      "To residents and tourists from mainland China \u2014 a country with a gaming market of half a billion users \u2014 the market is a one-stop shop, featuring top American brands including Dell, Corsair and the Nasdaq-listed Swiss manufacturer Logitech.",
      "Those are just some of the companies competing for market share in a gaming industry that accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates will be worth $300 billion by 2027. According to China\u2019s Game Industry Report, China\u2019s gamers contributed $44 billion in sales revenues to the industry last year.",
      "To be sure, Western brands are still popular when it comes to big-ticket items like monitors, processors and storage devices, but sellers at the market told NBC News that Chinese brands have been knocking it out of the park when it comes to accessories, like mice, keyboards and simulator setups.",
      "\u201cSo many Chinese manufacturers popped up after the pandemic,\u201d said Dennis Leung, a sales assistant at a store that specializes in gaming peripherals. \u201cThey often provide an extremely cheap and bargain price compared to the whole market,\u201d he said.",
      "Standing in front of a table of 30 mice, Leung held up two with identical feel and weight. The Chinese option, which was cheaper and more powerful, had been outselling its Western counterpart, he said.",
      "The Trump administration last week issued a memorandum saying that electronics including computers, smartphones and some components will be temporarily exempt from levies imposed on Chinese imports.",
      "But Trump\u2019s indication that duties on semiconductors and other technology could be on their way means it\u2019s still unclear whether electronics could get more expensive in the U.S. and whether prices of American-made products could go up for the rest of the world, too.",
      "That uncertainty may already be causing nervousness at companies such as Dell \u2014 the $56 billion tech giant has a 20% share of the global gaming market \u2014 as well as the $12 billion market cap for Logitech and specialists such as Corsair, which is worth $630 million.",
      "The administration\u2019s market-roiling tariffs come at a time when the quality of Chinese products has already vastly improved. That\u2019s giving Hong Kong\u2019s vendors a chance to capitalize.",
      "When it comes to buying gaming accessories, shoppers don\u2019t really care where the end product is coming from, Kira Fong, manager of another store in the market, told NBC News. \u201cMost people just look for quality. They still want the best equipment,\u201d he said.",
      "Analysts expect Chinese-made tech products only to get better.",
      "\u201cPeople are choosing more Chinese-made products in each industry, not just personal computers, gaming, smartphones or electric vehicles,\u201d said Xiao Feng Zeng, who analyzes China\u2019s gaming and esports industry at Niko Partners, an Asian and European gaming intelligence firm.",
      "\u201cTheir quality is better and the price is cheaper,\u201d the Shanghai-based vice president said, adding that Trump\u2019s policies will hurt America\u2019s ability to compete for young gamers.",
      "The policies of the president, who refers to himself as \u201cTariff Man,\u201d are already feeding through into higher prices.",
      "Hyte, a gaming PC sister brand of the California-based iBuyPower, said this month on X that while it was standing by increased prices, those prices will not be sustainable long term.",
      "That was not a problem for Marcus Wu, and more importantly his dad, at checkout at the Sham Shui Po market.",

      "Ajjour's mother, Nour Ajjour recalled that painful moment in a phone interview with NBC News on Friday.",
      "\"The first few days were very difficult. He was in a lot of pain as there was no anaesthetic,\" she said. \"He would look at his hands and not see them. He would scream and say, 'where are my hands?' And the first thing he said was, 'how will I hug you?' and 'how will I pray?'\"",
      "Ajjour was evacuated out of Gaza for treatment in Qatar's capital, Doha, where Abu Elouf took his portrait for The New York Times. The photographer also fled to the city.",

      "\u201cThese are unbelievable numbers,\u201d Dr. Ahmed Al-Fara,\u00a0head of the pediatric department at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza\u2019s Khan Younis told NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground in an interview earlier this month, noting that thousands of children have also been killed and more still have been left without one or both parents.",
      "Al-Fara said he could not understand \u201cthe silence of the world\u201d in the midst of the widespread devastation in Gaza, where much of the enclave has been destroyed.",
      "Many of the operations children in Gaza have had to undergo have been done without anesthetic, according to UNICEF, with the enclave's health care system also hit hard by Israel's offensive, which it restarted last month after a pause in the fighting.",
      "Talks for a permanent end to the fighting were supposed to begin after the first phase of the ceasefire deal \u2014 in which Hamas released 25 living hostages and the bodies of eight in exchange for around 1,800 Palestinian prisoners and detainees \u2014 ended March 1.",
      "But Israeli forces\u00a0shattered the fragile truce and have since launched airstrikes on the enclave while also resuming military ground operations.",
      "Israel has also barred the entry of medical supplies, along with food, water and other vital aid, during a more than monthlong blockade of the enclave.",
      "Efforts to secure a more permanent ceasefire and secure the release of hostages held in Gaza have so far failed to yield results.",
      "In the meantime, Ajjour is learning how to live without his arms.",
      "\"We all help Mahmoud in everything, in food, drink, clothing and the smallest things.\" But she said her son is also learning to use his feet to do things like writing and playing games on his mobile phone.",

      "Police said it was a \u201cterror attack\u201d and blamed militants fighting against Indian rule. \u201cThis attack is much larger than anything we\u2019ve seen directed at civilians in recent years,\u201d Omar Abdullah, the region\u2019s top elected official, wrote on social media.",

      "Most of the killed tourists were Indian, the officers said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with departmental policy. Officials collected at least 24 bodies in Baisaran meadow, some 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the disputed region\u2019s resort town of Pahalgam. Two others died while being taken for medical treatment.",
      "There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Police and soldiers were searching for the attackers.",
      "\u201cWe will come down heavily on the perpetrators with the harshest consequences,\u201d India\u2019s home minister, Amit Shah, wrote on social media. He arrived in Srinagar, the main city in Indian-controlled Kashmir, and convened a meeting with top security officials.",

Our thoughts and prayers are with them as they mourn this horrific attack.\u201d",

      "The region has drawn millions of visitors who enjoy a strange peace kept by ubiquitous security checkpoints, armored vehicles and patrolling soldiers. New Delhi has vigorously pushed tourism and claimed it as a sign of normalcy returning.",
      "The meadow in Pahalgam is a popular destination, surrounded by snow-capped mountains and dotted with pine forests. It is visited by hundreds of tourists every day.",
      "Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, while condemning the attack, said Modi\u2019s government should take accountability instead of making \u201chollow claims on the situation being normal\u201d in the region.",
      "Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi\u2019s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels\u2019 goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country.",
      "India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict.",
      "In March 2000, at least 35 civilians were shot and killed in a southern village in Kashmir while then-U.S. President Bill Clinton was visiting India. It was the region\u2019s deadliest attack in the past couple of decades.",
      "Violence has ebbed in recent times in the Kashmir Valley, the heart of anti-India rebellion. Fighting between government forces and rebels has largely shifted to remote areas of Jammu region, including Rajouri, Poonch and Kathua, where Indian troops have faced deadly attacks."

      "But in death, Francis will be following in many of John Paul\u2019s footsteps.",

      "They are compiled in a more than 400-page tome called the \u201cOrdo exsequiarum Romani pontificis,\u201d which includes the liturgy, music and prayers used for papal funerals over the centuries.",
      "\u201cThe Ordo covers the rituals that are followed from the moment a pope dies to the moment a pope is buried,\u201d said the Rev. David Collins, an associate professor and the director of Catholic studies at Georgetown University.",

      "\u201cHis Most Reverend Eminence Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell, Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, will preside over the rite of confirmation of death and the placing of the body in the coffin,\u201d the Vatican said in a statement.",

During those six days, millions of people filed past his coffin in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, and there was a funeral attended by presidents and monarchs. Because Benedict resigned and was not the pope when he died, Francis\u2019 ceremonies will more closely resemble John Paul\u2019s.",

      "Dust off the history books and there are papal conclaves with international intrigue, royal rigging and even riots, a checkered past that belies the air of sanctity and solemnity surrounding modern papal elections.",
      "The word \u201cconclave\u201d comes from the Latin for \u201cwith key.\u201d It is a church tradition that began in 1268 with a papal election that lasted almost three years, ending only when the townspeople of Viterbo locked up the cardinals, tore the roof off their palace, fed them nothing but bread and water and threatened them until a new pope was chosen.",
      "While it is very unlikely the decision on Pope Francis\u2019 successor will take quite as long or be quite as contentious, Vatican watchers agree that the winner is not a foregone conclusion.",
      "Follow live coverage",
      "\u201cThe great joy of the conclave is that nobody really knows and it\u2019s such a unique electorate,\u201d James Somerville-Meikle, the former deputy director of the Catholic Union of Great Britain, told NBC News before Francis\u2019 death. \u201cSo many conclaves in the past have thrown up surprises.\u201d",
      "The College of Cardinals, he said, has always been faced with two questions: \u201cDo we try something new? Do we go for continuity?\u201d",
      "NBC News takes a look at the figures believed to be the top contenders.",
      "Cardinal Matteo Zuppi",
      "The fifth of six siblings, the Rome-born Cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi, 69, has built a reputation as a peacemaker and has worked with the Community of Sant'Egidio, a Catholic lay association devoted to ecumenism and conflict resolution.",
      "\u201cThat community had a very active role in peace-building activities and finding agreements in Africa, where they have been involved in South Sudan,\u201d said NBC Vatican analyst Deborah Lubov. The east African nation has been ravaged by civil war, violence and famine since it gained independence from neighboring Sudan in March 2011.",
      "Lubov added that Zuppi, the archbishop of Bologna, was one of four mediators who helped bring an end to the civil war in the east African country of Mozambique in 1982 and more recently had been Francis\u2019 envoy for peace in Ukraine and Russia.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a very smart man, left of center, although ideologically speaking he is very close to the center of the church,\u201d said Massimo Faggioli, a professor of theology and religious studies at Villanova University.\u00a0\u201cHe would be a mix between John Paul II and Pope Francis on social issues and moral issues.\u201d",
      "Tim Gabrielli, the Gudorf chair in Catholic intellectual traditions at the University of Dayton in Ohio, agreed that Zuppi was \u201cvery close to Francis,\u201d and that he is \u201cvery much a pastor figure, close to the people.\u201d",
      "But Gabrielli said Zuppi was \u201crelative newcomer\u201d when it comes to Italian episcopal politics and didn\u2019t \u201cnecessarily have the breadth of Vatican experience that is often looked at.\u201d",
      "Cardinal Pietro Parolin",
      "The second Italian on the list, Parolin, 70, has been Francis' secretary of state since the pope chose him in 2013.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a diplomat, and this is something that the cardinals might like,\u201d said Faggioli, although he added that as secretary of state \u201cyou have to make many decisions on behalf of the pope, and you have to make a number of enemies among other cardinals.\u201d",
      "Parolin, Faggioli said, is \u201ca centrist, and he\u2019s a man of the institution, a stabilizer.\u201d",
      "However, Faggioli and other Vatican insiders agreed that Parolin\u2019s chances could take a hit because he was the chief architect of an agreement with China on the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops in the communist country that gave the pope the final say.",
      "Critics complained that it betrayed Catholics who remained loyal to the pope despite persecution, and some have said it prevented the Vatican from denouncing rights abuses in China. They also point to increasing restrictions on religious freedoms in China for Christians and other minorities.",
      "Parolin would have a lot of explaining to do about China to remedy his reputation as a credible candidate when it comes to the future of the Catholic Church, some Vatican obeservers said.",
      "Cardinal P\u00e9ter Erd\u0151",
      "The first of six children, Hungarian Cardinal P\u00e9ter Erd\u0151 \u201ccirculates regularly in conservative blogs as one who would shift away from Francis,\u201d according to Monsignor Kevin Irwin, a research professor at the Catholic University of America.",
      "\u201cA decided player for the conservative cardinals,\u201d Irwin said via email, adding that Erd\u0151, 72, now the archbishop of Budapest, is \u201ca highly trained canon lawyer\u201d who has written several erudite articles and books on the sources of canon law.",
      "Faggioli at Villanova agreed Erd\u0151 was a strong candidate, one who was much more conservative and \u201ca traditional Catholic when it comes to family, marriage, gay rights.\u201d",
      "Faggioli added that Erd\u0151 differed with Francis on the way the church should address immigration.",
      "While Francis often called for compassion toward migrants, he said Erd\u0151 was \u201cmore Eastern European and questions the ability to assimilate.\u201d",
      "Gabrielli said Erd\u0151 reminds \u201csome of us of John Paul II ... [which] comes from the fact that they were both raised under communist rule.\u201d",
      "He is also similar to Francis\u2019 predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who \u201cthought of Europe as key and the idea that Christianity of Europe was very important.\u201d",
      "Cardinal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle",
      "Tagle, who has been dubbed the \u201cAsian Pope Francis\u201d by some, would be presenting himself as a close follower of the recently deceased pontiff, according to Somerville-Meikle of the Catholic Union of Great Britain.",
      "Tagle, 67, a Filipino national who features his nickname, \u201cChito,\u201d on his X profile, is known as a champion of the poor in the Philippines and has campaigned on many social issues in his homeland, Somerville-Meikle said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s incredibly articulate and would be very able to extend Pope Francis\u2019 reflections theologically,\u201d said Gabrielli, adding that Tagle has been adept at taking Francis\u2019 ideas and running with them.",
      "However, Gabrielli said that Tagle\u2019s reputation took a bit of a hit when Francis ousted the management of the Vatican\u2019s international charitable organization, Caritas Internationalis, after an external review found management and morale problems at its head office.",
      "Tagle, who had served as the organization\u2019s president since May 2015, was among those relieved of their duties, despite having called for the review in the first place, Gabrielli said.",
      "\u201cThere might be questions resulting from that about his ability to manage,\u201d he added.",
      "However, since June, Tagle has been in charge of the Dicastery for Evangelization, one of the church's most important departments, and Gabrielli said he seemed to be doing \u201ca good job there.\u201d",
      "Other contenders",
      "Among the other candidates who might come up for consideration are the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 60, and Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, 77, the archbishop of Colombo in Sri Lanka.",
      "The general secretary of the Synod of Bishops, the Maltese Cardinal Mario Grech, and Cardinal Charles Muang Bo of Burma, the archbishop of Yangon, may also be considered.",
      "Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn, the archbishop of Vienna, is also a \u201cwell respected\u201d figure who understands the importance of governing an international archdiocese while maintaining a \u201cmoderate line between being open-minded to dialogue about the future of the church but also keeping close to the tradition of the Catholic faith,\u201d NBC News\u2019 Lubov said.",
      "But at 80, \u201chis days as a candidate are probably behind him,\u201d Gabrielli said, although he added that Sch\u00f6nborn \u201cbefuddles people who try and label him as either conservative or liberal,\u201d which might lead some to see him as a compromise candidate.",
      "Age and experience may rule out Canadian Cardinal G\u00e9rald Lacroix, the archbishop of Quebec, because at 67, some may consider him too young, Faggioli said. \u201cI expect they will look for a candidate in their 70s,\u201d he added.",
      "Gabrielli added that Lacroix was \u201ca real pastor, people person. He\u2019s not a corporate in-his-office type, which I think reminds people of Francis. He really prioritizes evangelization, but I wonder if he has the global scope that some cardinals will look for.\u201d"

Instead, it means that the talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff haven\u2019t broken down at what is likely the top-level trade \u2014 Tehran limiting its atomic program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.",
      "\u201cAgreeing to technical talks suggests both sides are expressing pragmatic, realistic objectives for the negotiations and want to explore the details,\u201d said Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association who has long studied Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "\u201cIf Witkoff was making maximalist demands during his talks with Araghchi, such as dismantlement of the enrichment program, Iran would have no incentive to meet at the technical level.\u201d",
      "That technical level, however, remains filled with possible landmines. Just how much enrichment by Iran would be comfortable for the United States? What about Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program, which President Donald Trump first cited in pulling America unilaterally out of the accord in 2018? Which sanctions could be lifted and which would remain in place on the Islamic Republic?",
      "\u201cThe most important determinant of expert talks\u2019 value lies in whether there is a political commitment to do something and experts just need to figure out what,\u201d said Richard Nephew, an adjunct fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who worked on Iran sanctions while at the U.S. State Department during negotiations over what became the 2015 nuclear deal.",
      "\u201cIf the experts also have to discuss big concepts, without political agreement, it can just result in spun wheels.\u201d",
      "The 2015 nuclear deal saw senior experts involved in both sides of the deal. For the U.S. under President Barack Obama, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz reached an understanding working with Ali Akbar Salehi, then the leader of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. Both men\u2019s technical background proved key to nailing down the specifics of the deal.",
      "Under the 2015 agreement, Iran agreed to enrich uranium only to 3.67% purity and keep a stockpile of only 300 kilograms (661 pounds). Today, Iran enriches some uranium up to 60% purity \u2014 a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency put Iran\u2019s overall uranium stockpile in February at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds)."

      "Beijing will firmly oppose any party striking a deal at China\u2019s expense and \u201cwill take countermeasures in a resolute and reciprocal manner,\u201d its Commerce Ministry said.",
      "The ministry was responding to a Bloomberg report, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the Trump administration is preparing to pressure nations seeking tariff reductions or exemptions from the U.S. to curb trade with China, including imposing monetary sanctions.",
      "President Donald Trump paused the sweeping tariffs he announced on dozens of countries on April 2 except those on China, singling out the world\u2019s second largest economy for the biggest levies.",
      "In a series of moves, Washington has raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, prompting Beijing to slap retaliatory duties of 125% on U.S. goods, effectively erecting trade embargoes against each other. Last week, China signaled that its own across-the-board rates would not rise further.",

      "\u201cIf countries have high reliance on China in terms of investment, industrial infrastructure, technology know-how and consumption, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be buying into U.S. demands. Many Southeast Asian countries belong to this category.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration also has been trying to curb Beijing\u2019s progress in developing advanced semiconductor chips which it says could be used for military purposes, and last week imposed port fees on China-built vessels to limit China\u2019s dominance in shipbuilding.",

      "From working as a bouncer at a Buenos Aires nightclub to presiding over the Vatican, the path Pope Francis forged as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church was as unlikely as it was unprecedented.",
      "Francis, who died Monday at age 88, was keen to flex his muscles as supreme pontiff. He angered some Catholic Church traditionalists by reaching out to gay and marginalized people, demanding justice for the poor and the dispossessed and railing against unbridled capitalism and climate change.",
      "As the first pope from the Americas, Francis was in many ways the ultimate Vatican outsider who charted a new and more liberal course as the leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.",
      "\u201cHe embarked on a real reorganization of the church and a real reorientation of the church after four decades of conservative theologians\u2019 leading the way,\u201d said David Gibson, director of the Fordham Center on Religion and Culture.",
      "Follow live coverage",
      "Case in point: Francis announced a radical change in Vatican policy in December 2023 by formally allowing priests to bless same-sex couples. Still, he continued to oppose gay marriage, to the dismay of more liberal Catholics.",
      "Francis also ratcheted up action against the sexual abuse of children by Catholic Church clergy by issuing the most extensive revision to its law in four decades, calling it \u201cour shame.\u201d",
      "And he steadfastly championed the plight of migrants when many countries, including the United States, were closing their borders and right-wing politicians were demonizing them.",
      "\u201cWe cannot remain indifferent in the face of such human dramas,\u201d the pope said in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview in May 2024. \u201cThe globalization of indifference is a very ugly disease. Very ugly.\u201d",
      "Francis pointedly criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt, during his first term in office, to prevent migrants fleeing violence in Central America from getting into the United States by building a wall on the border with Mexico.",
      "\u201cI realize that with this problem, a government has a hot potato in its hands, but it must be resolved differently, humanely, not with razor wire,\u201d Francis insisted.",
      "But in doing so, Francis alienated many Catholics and Republicans in the United States who supported Trump and his border wall.",
      "To be sure, Francis was also criticized by the church's progressive wing. He refused to consider ordaining women. Victims of sexual abuse said his changes weren't strong enough. And he was accused last year of using a highly offensive term to describe gay men in a closed-door meeting, two weeks after the Vatican apologized for his use of the same slur.",
      "Francis faced the stiffest resistance from archconservative American clerics during the pandemic when he urged people to get vaccinated against Covid. He also found himself being accused of heresy for, among other things, softening the ban on giving Communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics.",
      "Still, in many ways, Francis was cut from the same conservative clerical cloth as his predecessors Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict. He was against abortion, in favor of clerical celibacy and opposed to ordaining women, although he was open to giving them a greater role in running the church.",
      "It was Francis, after all, who gave final approval to make John Paul II, a religiously conservative Pole and another pontiff from \u201ca faraway land,\u201d a saint.",
      "Despite Francis\u2019 attempts to weed out sex abusers from the clerical ranks, many victims didn\u2019t believe he went far enough to address the problem and punish offenders."

    "summary": "LGBTQ Catholics and theologians said Pope Francis' legacy teaches that change can happen when leaders are willing to listen.",
    "story": [
      "In July 2013, Pope Francis posed a question that marked a radical shift in the Catholic Church\u2019s treatment of gay people.",
      "\u201cIf a person is gay and seeks God and has goodwill, who am I to judge him?\u201d he asked reporters in 2013. \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d",
      "Francis died early Monday, the day after Easter, and LGBTQ Catholics and theologians recalled the comment as one of the first Francis made that promoted acceptance of queer people. It was a dramatic departure from the way the previous figureheads of the Holy See and church doctrine had often spoken about gay people, describing homosexuality as \u201can intrinsic moral evil\u201d and an \u201cobjective disorder,\u201d and the relatively accepting tone would go on to become a major theme of Francis\u2019 papacy and, now, his complex legacy.",
      "Francis would go on to urge parents not to condemn their gay children and approve priests' blessing same-sex unions. However, \u201che wasn\u2019t perfect\u201d in the eyes of LGBTQ Catholics, said Jason Steidl Jack, an assistant teaching professor of religious studies at St. Joseph\u2019s University, New York. Just after the \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d remark, Francis said homosexuality is still a sin under Catholic doctrine. He also referred to gay people with slurs on at least two occasions, Steidl Jack said, and spoke negatively about what he called \u201cgender ideology.\u201d He also said blessings of same-sex couples couldn\u2019t resemble traditional marriage vows.",
      "But what made Francis\u2019 papacy historic is that, unlike his predecessors, he met with LGBTQ people from around the world and listened to their stories.",
      "\u201cHe could have conversations that just weren\u2019t possible under John Paul II and Benedict XVI,\u201d Steidl Jack said of the two popes before Francis. \u201cAs the years of his papacy went on, he seemed to get more open, both to gays and lesbians, but also to the trans community. This is a level of openness that was unthinkable before Pope Francis. It\u2019s been a revolution of compassion, a revolution of welcome, and it\u2019s changed the church. It\u2019s changed the church\u2019s relationship to the LGBTQ community.\u201d",
      "\u2018He sat and held our hands\u2019",
      "Francis\u2019 positive remarks about the LGBTQ community were a \u201cseismic shift\u201d in the church\u2019s treatment of gay and lesbian people, said Marianne Duddy-Burke, the executive director of DignityUSA, which advocates for LGBTQ rights within the Catholic Church.",
      "In response to the organization\u2019s advocacy, the Vatican issued a controversial \u201cLetter to the Bishops on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons\u201d in 1986, which resulted in many of the organization\u2019s chapters being expelled from their home parishes and barred from meeting on Catholic properties, Duddy-Burke said.",
      "Nearly three decades later, the Vatican invited Duddy-Burke, who is also a co-chair of Global Network of Rainbow Catholics, an international organization of LGBTQ Catholics, and two other members of the organization to meet with Francis during a synod assembly in October 2023.",
      "They talked to him about the importance of his statement earlier that year calling for the decriminalization of homosexuality worldwide but told him that the sentiment needed to be implemented by Catholic bishops and politicians. They also told him LGBTQ people are often still excluded from Catholic churches and discussed the importance of gender-affirming health care for transgender people.",
      "\u201cHe was very warm, and he laughed with us, and he made eye contact through the whole thing,\u201d Duddy-Burke said. \u201cHe sat and held our hands and hugged one of us.\u201d",
      "At the end of their meeting, Francis told them, in Italian, \u201cYour work is important. Keep pressing on,\u201d Duddy-Burke said through tears as she recalled the moment.",
      "She said there was a huge public response to photos and news about the meeting, which \u201cshowed just how significant it was for representatives [of the community] to be seen with the pope.\u201d",
      "Michael O\u2019Loughlin, author of \u201cHidden Mercy: AIDS, Catholics, and the Untold Stories of Compassion in the Face of Fear,\u201d wrote a letter to Francis after O\u2019Loughlin published his book to tell the pontiff about the conversations he had with Catholic nuns and priests who went against the teachings of the church at the time and worked behind the scenes to care for people dying from AIDS-related illnesses.",
      "In August 2021, Francis wrote back. The letter was written in Spanish but was translated to English. He thanked O\u2019Loughlin for shining a light on the priests, religious sisters and lay people who supported those who were sick from HIV and AIDS.",
      "\u201cInstead of indifference, alienation and even condemnation, these people let themselves be moved by the mercy of the Father and allowed that to become their own life\u2019s work; a discreet mercy, silent and hidden, but still capable of sustaining and restoring the life and history of each one of us,\u201d Francis wrote.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll always remember Francis for creating space for LGBT people to tell our own stories in the church,\u201d said O\u2019Loughlin, who is also the executive director of Outreach, an LGBTQ Catholic organization. \u201cWhile some LGBT advocates point out that he maybe didn\u2019t go far enough in what they had hoped he would do, he nonetheless created these opportunities for us to show that we want to live our lives in the church just like any other Catholics.\u201d",
      "Max Kuzma, a lifelong Catholic and transgender advocate, said he was also struck by Francis\u2019 pastoral presence and compassion when he met the pontiff last year. Kuzma said he introduced himself to Francis, in Spanish, as a transgender man. It was a busy moment, Kuzma said, and Francis was being pushed along in his wheelchair, so he didn\u2019t respond verbally.",
      "\u201cBut it was his expression and the way that he grasped my hand,\u201d Kuzma said. \u201cI really felt that moment of acceptance and love and support, a very pastoral feeling when you look in the eyes of the pope.\u201d",
      "An uncertain future",
      "Though Francis\u2019 gestures of acceptance for LGBTQ people set an example for other Catholic Church leaders, Steidl Jack said, it\u2019s unclear how far they will carry into the next papacy, because Francis didn\u2019t fundamentally change church doctrine.",
      "\u201cIf you open up the Catechism, it still describes homosexuality as intrinsically disordered, as something that goes against God\u2019s purposes for human sexuality, and that is opposed to human flourishing,\u201d Steidl Jack said. He added that after Francis issued the document allowing for blessings of same-sex couples, he faced backlash from priests in parts of Africa and Eastern Europe, and he was likely afraid that pushing for doctrinal change too quickly would cause a schism in the church.",
      "Francis\u2019 statements regarding LGBTQ people also haven\u2019t been entirely positive and have often been contradictory. For example, at the start of the pandemic, Francis began meeting with trans women, many of them sex workers, at the Vatican. In 2023, he also said trans people can be baptized and can become godparents. However, in March 2024, he called \u201cgender ideology\u201d the \u201cugliest danger\u201d of our time.",
      "Kuzma said that statement, combined with the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops praising President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order barring trans women and girls from competing in female sports, makes him nervous about the future if the next pope is hostile toward trans people.",
      "\u201cThat unhelpfully fed into some of the culture war stuff,\u201d Kuzma said, especially in more conservative Catholic spaces, which Kuzma said he used to be a part of.",
      "Still, Kuzma said he believes that if Francis had lived longer, he would\u2019ve formed friendships with trans people in the way he formed a friendship with Juan Carlos Cruz, a survivor of clerical sexual abuse. In 2018, regarding Cruz being gay, Francis famously told him, \u201cGod made you like this.\u201d In 2021, he appointed Cruz to a commission for protecting minors. Kuzma said such friendships would\u2019ve likely changed Francis\u2019 mind.",
      "Steidl Jack agreed, saying that one of the major lessons from Francis\u2019 pontificate was that he \u201cdidn\u2019t get things right all the time,\u201d but he was willing to listen.",
      "\u201cHe was willing to spend time with people and accept them as they are,\u201d Steidl Jack said. \u201cI believe he grew from that, and I believe the church grew from that as well. And that\u2019s where the church needs to continue growing. It\u2019s a ministry of listening to, a ministry of openness. It\u2019s a ministry of being willing to learn.\u201d"
