      "Some Republican-led states say they they will block Justice Department\u2019s election monitors from going inside polling places on Election Day, pushing back on federal authorities\u2019 decades-long practice of watching for violations of federal voting laws",
      "WASHINGTON -- Some Republican-led states say they will block the Justice Department's election monitors from going inside polling places on Election Day, pushing back on federal authorities' decades-long practice of watching for violations of federal voting laws.",
      "Officials in Florida and Texas have said they won't allow federal election monitors into polling sites on Tuesday. And on Monday, Missouri filed a lawsuit seeking a court order to block federal officials from observing inside polling places. Texas followed with a similar lawsuit seeking to permanently bar federal monitoring of elections in the state.",
      "The Justice Department announced last week that it's deploying election monitors in 86 jurisdictions across 27 states on Election Day. The Justice Department declined to comment on the moves by the Republican-led states, but filed court papers urging the judge to deny Missouri's request.",
      "The race between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump is a dead heat, and both sides are bracing for potential legal challenges to vote tallies. The Justice Department\u2019s election monitoring effort, a long practice under both Democratic and Republican administrations, is meant to ensure that federal voting rights are being followed.",
      "Here's a look at election monitors and the states' actions:",
      "_____",
      "Election monitors are lawyers who work for the Justice Department, including in the civil rights division and U.S. attorney's offices across the country. They are not law enforcement officers or federal agents.",
      "For decades, the Justice Department's civil rights division has sent attorneys and staff members to monitor polling places across the country in both federal and non-federal elections. The monitors are tasked with ensuring compliance with federal voting rights laws.",
      "The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division enforces a number of statutes protecting the right to vote. That includes the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits intimidation and threats against those who are casting ballots or counting votes. And it includes the Americans with Disabilities Act, which mandates that election officials ensure people with disabilities have the full and equal opportunity to vote.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Justice has a nearly 60-year history of addressing Election Day issues to safeguard the voting rights of Black citizens and other communities of color,\" said Edward Casper, acting co-chief counsel at the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. \u201cWhile some recent efforts to interfere in this process may appear more bark than bite, they still pose a real threat to civil rights enforcement,\u201d he said.",
      "The 86 jurisdictions that the Justice Department will send monitors to on Tuesday include Maricopa County, Arizona and Fulton County, Georgia, which in 2020 became the center of election conspiracy theories spread by Trump and other Republicans. Another place on the list is Portage County, Ohio, where a sheriff came under fire for a social media post in which he said people with Harris yard signs should have their addresses recorded so that immigrants can be sent to live with them if the Democrat wins the presidency.",
      "Other areas where federal monitors will be sent include Detroit; Queens, New York; Providence, Rhode Island; Jackson County, South Dakota; Salem, Massachusetts; Milwaukee; Manassas, Virginia; Cuyahoga County, Ohio; and Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska. The Justice Department\u2019s monitors will be in St. Louis, four jurisdictions in Florida and eight jurisdictions in Texas.",
      "In filing the lawsuit Monday, Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft said state law \u201cclearly and specifically limits who may be in polling places.\" He also accused the federal government of \"attempting to illegally interfere in Missouri\u2019s elections.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit states that Missouri law \u201cpermits only certain categories of persons to be present in voting locations, including voters, minor children accompanying voters, poll workers, election judges, etc.\" and not federal officials.",
      "The Justice Department also sought to monitor polling places in Missouri in 2022. The agency planned to have officials at Cole County, which includes Jefferson City, the state capital. County Clerk Steve Korsmeyer said he wouldn\u2019t let them in if they show up.",
      "The federal agency backed down after Ashcroft showed Justice Department officials the state law, Ashcroft said. He says the Justice Department is now \u201ctrying to go through the back door\" by contacting local election officials for access.",
      "Messages were left Monday with the St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners.",
      "In court papers filed late Monday, the Justice Department said it has authority to conduct monitoring there under a settlement agreement with the St. Louis Board aimed at ensuring people with mobility and vision impairments can access polling places. The settlement was reached in 2021 under Trump's Justice Department after federal officials found problems, such as ramps that were too steep and inaccessible parking, according to the court papers. The settlement, which expires next year, says the board must \u201ccooperate fully\u201d with Justice Department's efforts to monitor compliance, \u201cincluding but not limited to providing the United States with timely access to polling places (including on Election Day).\u201d",
      "The Justice Department said an attorney and investigator from its Disability Rights Section are in St. Louis to inspect for accessibility issues Tuesday. The department has carried out such inspections under the settlement agreement on \u201cmultiple occasions,\u201d including in the April local elections, government lawyers said in court documents.",
      "In a letter to the Justice Department on Friday, Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson said wrote, \u201cTexas law is clear: Justice Department monitors are not permitted inside polling places where ballots are being cast or a central counting station where ballots are being counted.\u201d",
      "\u201cTexas has a robust processes and procedures in place to ensure that eligible voters may participate in a free and fair election,\" Nelson wrote.",
      "In a similar letter Friday, Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd told the Justice Department that Florida law lists who is allowed inside the state's polling places and Justice Department officials are not included. Byrd said Florida is sending its own monitors to the four jurisdictions the Justice Department plans to send staff to and they will \u201censure there is no interference with the voting process.\u201d",

      "An appeals court says Arizona must release a list of tens of thousands of voters who were mistakenly classified as having access to full ballots because of a coding glitch",
      "PHOENIX -- The Arizona Court of Appeals on Monday affirmed a decision by a lower court that required the Secretary of State\u2019s office to release a list of tens of thousands of voters who were mistakenly classified as having access to Arizona\u2019s full ballot because of a coding glitch.",
      "The court rejected an appeal by Secretary of State Adrian Fontes\u2019 office that sought to reverse the lower court\u2019s order or at least suspend it. A group had sued in an effort to verify whether those on the list are in fact eligible to cast full ballots.",
      "Fontes\u2019 office had initially denied a public records request for the list of voters that was filed by America First Legal, a group run by Stephen Miller, a onetime adviser to former President Donald Trump. Fontes\u2019 office cited concerns over the accuracy of the list and the safety of the voters included.",
      "Fontes expressed his disappointment with the latest ruling during a news conference and vowed that officials will be watching for any instances of voter intimidation. While it was his intention to ensure that voter information would remain protected, he said his office has complied with the court order and has turned over the list to the plaintiffs.",
      "The lower court\u2019s ruling permitted the plaintiff to distribute the list to county recorders, the state Senate president, the House Speaker, and members of both chambers\u2019 elections committees, which the plaintiff said it intended to share. Senate President Warren Petersen posted on the social platform X that he received the list.",
      "Pointing to a previous ruling by the Arizona Supreme Court, Fontes said \u201cevery single one of these voters is eligible to vote and eligible to vote in every single election.\u201d",
      "Arizona is unique among states in that it requires voters to prove their citizenship to participate in local and state races. Those who haven\u2019t but have sworn to it under the penalty of perjury are allowed to participate only in federal elections.",
      "The misclassification of voters from federal-only to full-ballot voters was blamed on a glitch in state databases involving drivers\u2019 licenses and the Arizona Motor Vehicle Division.",
      "Several tight races in the battleground state are expected to be decided by razor-thin margins. While the batch of about 218,000 potentially affected voters won\u2019t impact the outcome of federal contests, they could influence tight state and local races.",
      "Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Scott Blaney ruled last week that the court received no credible evidence showing the information would be misused or encourage violence or harassment against the voters whose citizenship hasn\u2019t been verified.",
      "Still, Fontes reiterated his concerns Monday and used the news conference to take a swipe at the Republican-controlled Legislature. He said he has spent hours with his lawyers trying to unravel \u201csome of these crazy rules that have been shoved down our throats.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that anybody is confused about this,\u201d Fontes said, when asked about the conflicting guidance that voters are getting in some counties."

      "National Guard officials say more than two dozen states have indicated they would be willing to send Guard troops to Washington if requested in the weeks following the presidential election and in the runup to the inauguration",
      "WASHINGTON -- More than two dozen states have indicated they would be willing to send National Guard troops to Washington if requested in the weeks following the presidential election and in the runup to the inauguration, Guard officials said Monday.",
      "The District of Columbia has not yet made any formal requests for Guard troops, but officials across the government have been preparing for the possibility that the U.S. Capitol could once again be rocked by violence around the certification of the election by Congress on Jan. 6 and the inauguration two weeks later.",
      "About 25,000 Guard troops from around the country flooded into Washington in the days after the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, riot, when thousands of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol in an effort to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden's win.",
      "The troops, along with local and federal law enforcement, locked down the city for the inauguration, securing the Capitol, monuments, Metro entrances and the perimeter of the central part of the city.",
      "Speaking to reporters Monday, Col. Jean Paul Laurenceau, chief of future operations for the National Guard Bureau, said it is not yet clear how many Guard troops will be needed or requested this year. He said it will depend on what the District of Columbia wants, but he noted that the National Guard Bureau and the states are leaning forward in anticipation of a request for assistance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to support D.C. with sustainment, lodging, transportation \u2014 anything they need to prepare for this mission,\u201d he said.",
      "Other officials have said it also will depend on intelligence reports assessing the potential threats to the city and the transition of power.",
      "Fueling concerns about possible violence are Trump's claims \u2014 without proof \u2014 that cheating is already underway in the election. At rally after rally, he has told supporters that the only way he can lose is if Democrats cheat, and he has repeatedly refused to say whether he will accept the results regardless of the outcome.",
      "Guard members have historically provided support for presidential inaugurations, going back to the one for President George Washington.",
      "But the 2021 event involved an enormous response due to the riot on Jan. 6, which forced lawmakers to flee the Capitol, delaying the certification of the presidential vote for hours. In the days afterward, Guard forces poured into the city by the busload.",
      "In 2021, a few states declined to send troops, also worried about violence within their own borders and capitals.",
      "Defense officials said Monday that 10 states have activated state Guard members to assist for the election \u2014 primarily doing cybersecurity missions. The total number of troops is about 125.",
      "In addition, nine states and the District of Columbia have put a total of about 120 Guard troops on standby, ready to deploy if needed on Tuesday or in the following days \u2014 also mostly for cyber missions and some security.",
      "Those states are Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. Officials said those numbers could change on Election Day as states reassess their needs."

      "Jaylen Edgar was charged as an adult with two second-degree murder charges and a count of attempted murder, though the case will be presented before a grand jury, which could decide to up the charges to first-degree murder, said State Attorney Andrew Bain.",
      "\u201cThis decision was not made lightly, and only after reviewing all the available evidence,\u201d Bain said at a news conference in Orlando.",
      "Edgar is accused of opening fire during a Halloween street celebration that drew tens of thousands of costumed revelers to downtown Orlando's bar and restaurant district early Friday. Besides the two men who were killed, an additional seven people were wounded and a woman was trampled as people fled in terror, according to the Orlando Police Department.",
      "One of the Halloween celebrants killed and another who was injured were students at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.",
      "Edgar was tackled at the scene by some of the 100 police officers who were patrolling downtown Orlando.",
      "Among the factors that went into the decision to charge Edgar as an adult were \u201cthe brazen nature of the crime\u201d and the fact that multiple people were shot, the prosecutor said.",
      "\u201cTo shoot into a massive crowd like that shows a total disregard for life and the only recourse is to charge the defendant as an adult because it fits the egregious nature of the crime,\u201d Bain said. \u201cThis was a blatant execution in the middle of our streets, and so that's something that we can't have in our community.\u201d",
      "There was no online court docket for Edgar so it couldn't be determined if he had an attorney. Moreover, the case originated in juvenile court, where records are not public. An email to the Orange County Public Defender's office seeking information was not immediately returned Monday.",
      "Bain wouldn't disclose whether authorities knew of a motive and said detectives were still determining how he obtained the handgun.",
      "The Halloween celebration, which is one of the biggest events in downtown Orlando each year, took place about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from Orlando\u2019s tourist district, and it primarily attracts central Florida residents.",
      "In response to the shootings, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer last Friday issued a local state of emergency for the downtown entertainment area. Under the weeklong order, alcohol sales will end at midnight, and a curfew will be enforced from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m.",
      "During past Halloween celebrations, police would close off downtown streets and use dogs to screen for weapons as people walked past entry points, but they stopped doing that after Florida lawmakers passed a permit-less concealed carry law in 2023."

      "The Supreme Court is taking up a new redistricting case involving Louisiana\u2019s congressional map with two mostly Black districts",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court said Monday it will take up a new redistricting case involving Louisiana's congressional map with two mostly Black districts.",
      "The court won't hear arguments until early next year and the 2024 elections are proceeding under the challenged map, which could boost Democrats' chances of retaking the closely divided House of Representatives.",
      "A lower court had invalidated the map, but the justices allowed it to be used in 2024 after an emergency appeal from the state and civil rights groups.",
      "The issue in front of the justices is whether the state relied too heavily on race in drawing a second majority Black district.",
      "The court's order Monday is the latest step in federal court battles over Louisiana congressional districts that have lasted more than two years. Louisiana has had two congressional maps blocked by lower courts and the Supreme Court has intervened twice.",
      "The state\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature drew a new congressional map in 2022 to account for population shifts reflected in the 2020 Census. But the changes effectively maintained the status quo of five Republican-leaning majority white districts and one Democratic-leaning majority Black district in a state that is about one-third Black.",
      "Noting the size of the state\u2019s Black population, civil rights advocates challenged the map in a Baton Rouge-based federal court and won a ruling from U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick that the districts likely discriminated against Black voters.",
      "The Supreme Court put Dick\u2019s ruling on hold while it took up a similar case from Alabama. The justices allowed both states to use the maps in the 2022 elections even though both had been ruled likely discriminatory by federal judges.",
      "The high court eventually affirmed the ruling from Alabama, which led to a new map and a second district that could elect a Black lawmaker. The justices returned the Louisiana case to federal court, with the expectation that new maps would be in place for the 2024 elections.",
      "The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals gave lawmakers in Louisiana a deadline of early 2024 to draw a new map or face the possibility of a court-imposed map.",
      "Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, had defended Louisiana\u2019s congressional map as the state\u2019s attorney general. Now, though, he urged lawmakers to pass a new map with another majority Black district at a special session in January. He backed a map that created a new majority Black district stretching across the state, linking parts of the Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge areas.",
      "A different set of plaintiffs, a group of self-described non-African Americans, filed suit in western Louisiana, claiming that the new map was also illegal because it was driven too much by race, in violation of the Constitution. A divided panel of federal judges ruled 2-1 in April in their favor and blocked use of the new map.",
      "The Supreme Court voted 6-3 to put that ruling on hold and allow the map to be used.",
      "State Attorney General Liz Murrill, whose office has defended both maps enacted by lawmakers, called on the court to \u201cprovide more clear guidance to legislators and reduce judicial second-guessing after the Legislature does its job. Based upon the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent pronouncements, we believe the map is constitutional.\u201d",
      "The state and civil rights groups were at odds over the first map, but are allies now.",
      "\u201cFederal law requires Louisiana to have a fair map that reflects the power and voice of the state\u2019s Black communities,\" Stuart Naifeh of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund said in a statement. \"The state recognized as much when it adopted a new map with a second majority-Black district in January. Now the Supreme Court must do the same.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court vote to use the challenged map in this year's elections was unusual in that the dissenting votes came from the three liberal justices, who have been supportive of Black voters in redistricting cases. But, in an opinion by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, they said their votes were motivated by their view that there was time for a new map to be drawn, and their disagreement with past court orders that cited the approach of an election to block lower-court rulings.",
      "\u201cThere is little risk of voter confusion from a new map being imposed this far out from the November election,\u201d Jackson wrote in May.",
      "In adopting the districts that are being used this year, Landry and his allies said the driving factor was politics, not race. The congressional map provides politically safe districts for House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, fellow Republicans. Some lawmakers have also noted that the one Republican whose district was greatly altered in the new map, Rep. Garret Graves, supported a GOP opponent of Landry in last fall\u2019s governor\u2019s race. Graves chose not to seek reelection under the new map.",
      "Among the candidates in the new district is Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, a former congressman who is Black.",

      "This week will bring various potential flashpoints, among them Election Day in the United States. But the results may not be known for some time as officials count all the votes, and that could bring sharp swings since markets hate uncertainty.",
      "U.S. futures were virtually unchanged early Tuesday.",
      "Adding to the potential for volatility, the Federal Reserve will also be meeting on interest rates later this week. The widespread expectation is for it to cut its main interest rate for a second straight time.",
      "Investors also hope the Chinese government may announce stimulus for the world\u2019s second-largest economy.",
      "Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.3% to 38,552.67, reopening after a holiday on Monday.",
      "South Korea's Kospi fell 0.7% to 2,569.75, while the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia dropped 0.6% to 8,117.30.",
      "The Standing Committee of China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress is meeting this week, and analysts say the government may endorse major spending initiatives to boost economic growth amid troubles for the country\u2019s real-estate industry.",
      "The official Xinhua News Agency reported that the lawmakers had reviewed legislation to raise ceilings on local government debt to replace existing hidden debts, part of a process to arrange debt swaps to help resolve the financial woes brought on by the pandemic and by a collapse in the property market in recent years.",
      "Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 0.1% at 20,597.30 and the Shanghai Composite index picked up 0.4% to 3,323.26.",
      "On Monday, the S&P 500 slipped 0.3% to 5,712.69, remaining near its record  set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% to 41,794.60, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3% to 18,179.98.",
      "Intel fell 2.9%, and chemical producer Dow sank 2.1% in their first trading since getting notified they\u2019ll no longer be included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

      "The hope that\u2019s propelled U.S. stock indexes to records recently is that the U.S. economy can remain resilient and avoid a long-feared recession, in part because of the coming cuts to rates expected from the Fed.",
      "The broad U.S. stock market has historically risen regardless of which party wins  the White House. And in 2020, U.S. stocks climbed immediately after Election Day and kept going even after former President Donald Trump refused to concede  and challenged the results, creating plenty of uncertainty. A large part of that rally was due to excitement about the potential for a vaccine for COVID-19, which had just shut down the global economy.",
      "A Trump victory would be less of a surprise to markets this time around than in 2016, when Treasury yields soared on expectations for tax cuts that could further inflate the nation\u2019s debt or fuel a stronger U.S economy. Treasury yields have already climbed in recent weeks, in part due to rising expectations among some for a Trump win.",
      "On Monday, Treasury yields gave back a chunk of those gains. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.29% from 4.38% late Friday.",
      "Another investment that\u2019s become a barometer in the market for Trump\u2019s perceived chances of victory swung sharply through the day. After veering between losses and gains through the morning, Trump Media & Technology Group  ended up rising 12.4%.",

      "Brent crude, the international standard, added 12 cents to $75.20. It rose 2.7% a barrel on Monday. The price of Brent is still down for the year so far, in part because of worries about how much demand will come from China given its economic challenges.",

      "According to court documents, Skyler Philippi, 24, is accused of planning to attach several pounds of C-4 explosives to an aerial drone with the intent of destroying an electric substation in Nashville.",
      "The newly unsealed court records reveal that Philippi in July allegedly told a confidential source who was working with the FBI that he wanted to attack several substations to \u201cshock the system.\u201d That confidential source later introduced Philippi to an undercover FBI employee, who began to collect information about Philippi's plan with other undercover agents.",
      "\u201cPhilippi researched previous attacks on electric substations and concluded that attacking with firearms would not be sufficient,\u201d wrote Angelo DeFeo, an FBI special agent, in the court records released Monday. \u201cPhilippi, therefore, planned to use a drone with explosives attached to it and to fly the drone into the substation.\u201d",
      "Philippi allegedly told undercover law enforcement officials that he was affiliated with several white nationalist and extremist groups, including the National Alliance, which calls for eradicating the Jewish people and other races. Such extremist groups increasingly have viewed attacking the United States' power grid as a means of disrupting the country.",
      "The U.S. grid includes more than 6,400 power plants and 450,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines that span the country.",
      "In September, Philippi provided the undercover officials with excerpts of his so-called manifesto, which focused heavily on preserving the white race.",
      "On Saturday, Philippi and undercover employees drove to his intended Nashville launch site and prepared to fly a drone that authorities say Philippi believed had 3 pounds of C-4 attached to it. The material had been provided by the undercover employees, according to court documents.",
      "Law enforcement agents arrested Philippi shortly after arriving at the site.",
      "\u201cAs charged, Skyler Philippi believed he was moments away from launching an attack on a Nashville energy facility to further his violent white supremacist ideology \u2013 but the FBI had already compromised his plot,\u201d Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in a statement.",
      "A federal public defender was appointed to represent Philippi and a request for comment was sent to the attorney on Monday. Philippi is expected to appear in court on Nov. 13."

      "Trump has been drawing smaller crowds in the closing stretch of the campaign than he did in previous races.",

    "summary": "Florida&rsquo;s election will test whether the state maintains its new reputation as a Republican stronghold, as Democrats count on turnout for abortion rights and recreational marijuana ballot questions",
    "story": [
      "Florida\u2019s election will test whether the state maintains its new reputation as a Republican stronghold, as Democrats count on turnout for abortion rights and recreational marijuana ballot questions",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida's election will test whether the state maintains its new reputation as a Republican stronghold, or whether Democrats make some gains by tapping into the support for abortion and marijuana ballot questions and the new energy Vice President Kamala Harris brings to the race.",
      "Gone are the days when Florida was looked at as the biggest prize among swing states. After former President Barack Obama won Florida twice, former President Donald Trump carried the state by a whisker in 2016 and then by a much larger share in 2020. In 2022, Republicans took all five statewide seats on the ballot by landslide margins.",
      "Still, there is a lot of buzz over constitutional amendments that could protect abortion rights and legalize recreational marijuana, with both sides of each issue pumping millions of dollars into advertising. Democrats support the ballot measures and hope they boost turnout to give them at least a chance stopping Trump's third straight Florida victory and keeping U.S. Sen. Rick Scott from winning a second term.",
      "The only statewide office on the ballot is Scott\u2019s Senate seat. Scott is being challenged by former Democratic U.S. Rep. Debbie Murcarsel-Powell in a race that\u2019s been overshadowed by the presidential election and the abortion and marijuana ballot questions.",
      "Even if Trump and Scott are victorious in Florida, Democratic Party Chairwoman Nikki Fried said the election will be a huge success if the amendments pass and the party flips enough legislative seats to take away the Republicans' supermajority.",
      "\u201cLook where we were in of November 2022. We had the largest loss that Florida Democrats have ever experienced,\u201d Fried said. \u201cNobody anticipated that we would even have this conversation today, that the polls are showing that we are tight, that there was even a possibility that Florida would be in play. Everybody counted us out.\u201d",
      "Still, it's an uphill climb. The amendments need support from at least 60% of voters, and there's enough money being spent against them that it could create doubts among voters who normally support the issues, said Florida-based Republican political strategist Jamie Miller.",
      "\u201cAs a general rule, amendments pass if there\u2019s no real effort against them and they fail when there are real efforts against them,\" Miller said.",
      "Miller also believes Democrats are motivated to vote against the Republicans they don't like rather than be inspired by their own candidates.",
      "\u201cI see excitement against Donald Trump and against Rick Scott, but that as a general rule in the state the size of Florida is not enough to get you across the line,\u201d he said.",
      "Scott served two terms as governor, winning each with less than 50% of the vote. In 2018, he defeated incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in a race decided by 0.2 percentage points. But Florida politics changed. The last time Scott was on the ballot, Democrats outnumbered Republicans in the state. Republicans now have a million-voter advantage.",
      "Scott, one of the richest members of Congress, pumped millions of dollars of his own money into the race, as he has with his previous three elections. Far outspent, and with little money coming in from national Democrats until the last few weeks of the race, Murcarsel-Powell struggled to gain attention.",
      "While Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis wasn't on the ballot, he spent time campaigning against the abortion rights and marijuana amendments. DeSantis even used state agencies to fight the amendment, with the Agency for Health Care Administration set up a website and aired TV ads providing information on abortion and the Department of Health tried to stop television stations from airing a pro-amendment ad.",
      "The abortion amendment would protect the rights of women to have an abortion up to the point the fetus can survive outside the womb. Florida now bans abortion six weeks after conception, when many women don't realize they are pregnant.",
      "Voters overwhelming approved medical marijuana in 2016. This year they're being asked to legalize recreational marijuana. The marijuana industry has spent tens of millions of dollars on the campaign, while DeSantis has raised money against it and criticized it often during official events.",
      "Very few, if any, of Florida's 28 congressional seats are competitive, but the state will elect at least one new member to Congress. Former Senate President Mike Haridopolos is favored to replace retiring Republican Rep. Bill Posey. He's being challenged by Democrat Sandy Kennedy in a strong Republican district.",
      "Republicans will maintain firm control of the Legislature. Democrats will consider it a major victory if they flip enough seats to remove the supermajority GOP hold in the House and Senate.",
      "One of the legislative seats being heavily targeted is held by Republican Sen. Corey Simon, a former Florida State and NFL football star who is being challenged by nationally known civil rights lawyer Daryl Parks, who is the former partner of civil rights lawyer Ben Crump."

    "summary": "California has filed a lawsuit against a Los Angeles suburb over the city&rsquo;s recent moratorium on homeless shelters and temporary housing",
    "story": [
      "California has filed a lawsuit against a Los Angeles suburb over the city\u2019s recent moratorium on homeless shelters and temporary housing",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California filed a lawsuit against a Los Angeles suburb on Monday, alleging the city's recent moratorium on homeless shelters and temporary housing violates the state's fair housing and anti-discrimination laws.",
      "The lawsuit is part of an ongoing effort by Gov. Gavin Newsom to push back against what he sees as local resistance and defiance of state laws in the face of California\u2019s desperate need for new housing. The crisis has prompted a surge in the homeless population in the nation\u2019s most populous state.",
      "Norwalk, a city of 100,000 people some 15 miles (24 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles, becomes the latest city to face legal actions from the state over housing policies. That came after the city council voted in September to extend its temporary ban on new homeless shelters and emergency housing.",
      "City councilmembers in a recent statement said Norwalk has done its fair share to address the homeless crisis but previous state programs, including one that puts homeless people in motel rooms, have led to public safety concerns. The moratorium, which remains in effect until next year, already has blocked a plan by the County of Los Angeles in September to move homeless people into a hotel in the city.",
      "The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court argues that the city violated half a dozen housing laws by enacting such a moratorium. It is asking the court to halt the city\u2019s law.",
      "\u201cOur message is clear, our message is consistent.\" Attorney General Rob Bonta said Monday. \"If local governments attempt to skirt state housing laws, if they refuse to do the bare minimum to address the dire lack of affordable and accessible housing in California, we will hold them accountable.\u201d",
      "Monday's lawsuit comes after Newsom publicly blasted Norwalk and urged local elected officials to reconsider the policy. The state in September warned the city of potential legal action and last month revoked the city\u2019s housing plan, effectively disqualifying it from receiving state funding for homeless and housing programs. Bonta said state officials also met with the city last week but to no avail.",
      "\u201cThe Norwalk City Council\u2019s failure to reverse this ban, despite knowing it is unlawful, is inexcusable,\u201d Newsom said in a statement Monday. \u201cNo community should turn its back on its residents in need.\u201d",
      "The city mayor and a city spokesperson didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment about the lawsuit.",
      "California has ramped up enforcement of state housing laws in the last few years. It sued at least two cities last year for rejecting affordable housing projects and homes for homeless people. Last month, Newsom also signed a package of 32 housing bills to make it easier for the state to go after local cities that defy housing laws.",
      "The lawsuit will likely escalate the conflict between the state and local governments over how many housing projects cities should approve, and how fast they should build them. California needs to build 2.5 million homes by 2030 to keep up with demand, according to the California Department of Housing and Community Development. But the state only averages about 100,000 new homes per year, including only 10,000 affordable units.",
      "The Democratic governor, who has ambitions on the national stage, has made housing and homelessness a top priority as California\u2019s leader. His administration has spent roughly $40 billion to help build affordable housing and $27 billion in homelessness solutions. Earlier this summer, he started to pressure local governments to clean up encampments that have lined up the streets and crowded business\u2019 entrances, going as far as threatening to withhold state funding next year if he doesn\u2019t see results."

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks drifted lower Monday ahead of a momentous week  full of potential flashpoints in Washington, D.C., and around the world.",
      "The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, though it remains near its record  set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 257 points, or 0.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3%.",
      "Intel fell 2.9%, and chemical producer Dow sank 2.1% in their first trading since getting notified they\u2019ll no longer be included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway  dropped 2.2% and was one of the heaviest weights on the market after reporting a drop in operating profit for the latest quarter.",
      "But the majority of stocks within the S&P 500 rose, including a 2.8% gain for Fox after it reported a stronger profit than expected. That was despite increases in some costs, including for newsgathering at Fox News to cover this election cycle.",
      "Election Day will arrive Tuesday, though its result may not be known for some time as officials count all the votes. That\u2019s raised fears about the possibility of sharp swings around the world because markets infamously hate uncertainty.",
      "History may be less foreboding. The broad U.S. stock market has historically gone on to rise regardless of which party wins  the White House. And in 2020, U.S. stocks climbed immediately after Election Day and kept going even after former President Donald Trump refused to concede  and challenged the results, creating plenty of uncertainty. A large part of that rally was due to excitement about the potential for a vaccine for COVID-19, which had just shut down the global economy.",
      "\u201cBottom line \u2013 the US election is incredibly important, but the process is likely to be incredibly noisy,\u201d according to Michael Zezas, a strategist at Morgan Stanley.",
      "For markets, Zezas also points to how prices may have already moved ahead of expected outcomes from the election. A win for Trump this election could mean U.S. tariffs  on Mexican imports, for example, which could hurt the value of the Mexican peso. But the peso has already fallen against the U.S. dollar in recent months, which could limit further moves if a Trump win were actually to happen.",
      "A Trump victory would be less of a surprise to markets this time around than in 2016, when Treasury yields soared on expectations for tax cuts that could further inflate the nation\u2019s debt or fuel a stronger U.S economy. Treasury yields have already climbed in recent weeks, in part due to rising expectations in some market corners for a Trump win, along with a spate of data showing the U.S. economy has remained stronger than feared.",
      "On Monday, Treasury yields gave back a chunk of those gains. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.29% from 4.38% late Friday.",
      "Another investment that\u2019s become a barometer in the market for Trump\u2019s perceived chances of victory swung sharply through the day. After veering between losses and gains through the morning, Trump Media & Technology Group  ended up rising 12.4%.",
      "The stock of the company behind Trump\u2019s Truth Social platform had been ripping higher from a bottom in September, until it hit a wall last week and dropped at least 11% in three straight days.",
      "In the oil market, the price for a barrel of U.S. crude rose 2.8% to $71.03 after Saudi Arabia and other oil producers said they would delay plans  to increase the amount of crude they produced. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 2.7% to $75.08 for a barrel.",
      "The price of Brent is still down for the year so far, in part because of worries about how much demand will come from China given its economic challenges.",
      "The Standing Committee of China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress is meeting this week, and analysts say the government may endorse major spending initiatives to boost economic growth amid troubles for the country\u2019s real-estate industry.",
      "Beyond that meeting and Election Day in the United States, this week will also feature the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve, where the widespread expectation is for it to cut its main interest rate for a second straight time.",
      "The hope that\u2019s propelled U.S. stock indexes to records recently is that the U.S. economy can remain resilient and avoid a long-feared recession, in part because of the coming cuts to rates expected from the Fed.",
      "On Wall Street, Nvidia rose 0.5%, and Sherwin-Williams jumped 4.6% after learning they\u2019ll be replacing Intel and the parent of the Dow chemical company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.",
      "Stocks fell in the nuclear power industry after U.S. regulators denied a request that would have sent more electricity to an Amazon data center from a Pennsylvania nuclear plant run by Talen Energy. Companies across the power industry have been making deals with data center operators to feed their growing need for more electricity, and Talen fell 2.2%.",

Starting in 2020, he allegedly started working with unnamed co-conspirators and companies from Ukraine, China, Indonesia and elsewhere to transport Venezuela's crude oil at a time when most western buyers stayed clear of the South American country for fear of undermining U.S. sanctions aimed at removing President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Torlak and his associates allegedly hid the identities of transaction beneficiaries to enable U.S. banks to unknowingly process payments related to the illegal oil transports.",
      "\u201cWe could use one of the clean names to avoid money getting stuck somewhere,\u201d he allegedly wrote in communications with one of the co-conspirators.",
      "To evade detection, the chartered oil tankers frequently turned off their automated tracking systems, a mandatory safety device, when transporting the illegal Venezuelan crude. They also frequently changed the vessels' registry to fly so-called flags of convenience.",
      "It wasn't immediately possible to locate an attorney for Torlak.",
      "The U.S. started ratcheting up sanctions on Venezuela following Maduro\u2019s first re-election in 2018, in which several key opponents were barred from running. Since then, the self-declared socialist leader has deepened his grip on power and this year claimed he won a third, six-year term in the face of evidence presented by his opponents that the vote was stolen. The U.S. responded with another round of sanctions against officials accused of obstructing the vote and carrying out human rights abuses.",
      "\u201cThe Justice Department will continue to hold accountable those involved in criminal efforts to circumvent sanctions imposed on the Maduro regime,\" Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen said in a statement."

      "For decades, the cremated remains on more than two dozen American Civil War veterans languished in storage facilities Washington",
      "PAWTUCKET, R.I. -- For several decades, the cremated remains of more than two dozen American Civil War veterans languished in storage facilities at a funeral home and cemetery in Seattle.",
      "The simple copper and cardboard urns gathering dust on shelves only had the name of each of the 28 soldiers \u2014 but nothing linking them to the Civil War. Still, that was enough for an organization dedicated to locating, identifying and interring the remains of unclaimed veterans to conclude over several years that they were all Union soldiers deserving of a burial service with military honors.",
      "\u201cIt's amazing that they were still there and we found them,\u201d said Tom Keating, the Washington state coordinator for the Missing In America Project, which turned to a team of volunteers to confirm their war service through genealogical research. \u201cIt's something long overdue. These people have been waiting a long time for a burial.\u201d",
      "Most of the veterans were buried in August at Washington's Tahoma National Cemetery.",
      "In a traditional service offered to Civil War veterans, the historical 4th U.S. Infantry Regiment dressed in Union uniforms fired musket volleys and the crowd sang \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\u201d Names were called out for each veteran and their unit before their remains were brought forward and stories were shared about their exploits. Then, they were buried.",
      "Among them was a veteran held at a Confederate prison known as Andersonville. Several were wounded in combat and others fought in critical battles including Gettysburg, Stones River and the Atlanta campaign. One man survived being shot thanks to his pocket watch - which he kept until his death \u2014 and another deserted the Confederate Army and joined the Union forces.",
      "\u201cIt was something, just the finality of it all,\u201d Keating said, adding they were unable to find any living descendants of the veterans.",
      "While some remains are hidden away in funeral homes, others were found where they fell in battle or by Civil War re-enactors combing old graveyards.",
      "Communities often turn reburials into major events, allowing residents to celebrate veterans and remember a long-forgotten war. In 2016, a volunteer motorcycle group escorted the remains of one veteran cross country from Oregon to the final resting place in Maine. In South Carolina, the remains of 21 Confederate soldiers recovered from forgotten graves beneath the stands of a military college\u2019s football stadium were reburied in 2005.",
      "Sometimes reburials spark controversy. The discovery of the remains of two soldiers from the Manassas National Battlefield in Virginia prompted an unsuccessful attempt in 2018 by several families to have DNA tests done on them. The Army rejected that request and reburied them as unknown soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery.",
      "Along with those buried at Tahoma, Keating said, several others will be buried at Washington State Veterans Cemetery and a Navy veteran will be buried at sea. The remains of several more Civil War veterans were sent to Maine, Rhode Island and other places where family connections were found.",
      "Among them was Byron Johnson. Born in Pawtucket in 1844, he enlisted at 18 and served as a hospital steward with the Union Army. He moved out West after the war and died in Seattle in 1913. After his remains were delivered to Pawtucket City Hall, he was buried with military honors at his family's plot in Oak Grove Cemetery.",
      "Pawtucket Mayor Donald R. Grebien said Johnson's burial service was the right thing to do.",
      "\u201cWhen you have somebody who served in a war but especially this war, we want to honor them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt became more intriguing when you think this individual was left out there and not buried in his own community.\u201d",
      "Grebien said the burials recall important lessons about the 1861-1865 war to preserve the Union, fought between the North's Union Army and the Confederate States of America at a cost of hundreds of thousands of lives.",
      "\u201cIt was important to remind people not only in Pawtucket but the state of Rhode Island and nationwide that we have people who sacrificed their lives for us and for a lot of the freedoms we have,\u201d he said.",
      "Bruce Frail and his son Ben \u2014 both long active in the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War \u2014 were on hand for service. Ben Frail was also a re-enactor at Johnson's service, portraying a Union Army captain.",
      "\u201cIt's the best thing we can do for a veteran,\u201d said Bruce Frail, a former commander-in-chief with the Sons of Union Veterans and state coordinator for Missing In America Project.",
      "\u201cThe feeling that you get when you honor somebody in that way, it\u2019s indescribable,\u201d he said.",
      "The task of piecing together Johnson\u2019s life story was left to Amelia Boivin, the constituent liaison in the Pawtucket mayor's office. A history buff, she recalled getting the call requesting the city take possession of his remains and bury them with his family. She got to work and Johnson's story became the talk of City Hall.",
      "She determined Johnson grew up in Pawtucket, had two sisters and a brother and worked as a druggist after the war. He left to make his fortune out West, first in San Francisco and eventually in Seattle, where he worked nearly up until his death. It doesn't appear Johnson ever married or had children, and no living relatives were found.",
      "\u201cI felt like it was resolution of sorts,\u201d Boivin said. \u201cIt felt like we were doing right for someone who otherwise would have been lost to history.\""

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 13:38:17 -0500",
    "summary": "It&rsquo;s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too",
      "It\u2019s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too.",
      "Returnless refunds are a tool that more retailers are using to keep online shoppers happy and to reduce shipping fees, processing time and other ballooning costs from returned products.",
      "Companies such as Amazon, Walmart and Target have decided some items are not worth the cost or hassle of getting back. Think a $20 T-shirt that might cost $30 in shipping and handling to recover. There are also single-use items, such as a package of plastic straws, that might be difficult to resell or medicines that could be unsafe to market again.",
      "Analysts say the companies offering returnless refunds do it somewhat sporadically, typically reserving the option for low-cost objects or ones with limited resale value. But some online shoppers said they've also been allowed to keep more pricey products.",
      "Dalya Harel, 48, received a return-free refund recently after ordering a desk from Amazon that cost roughly $300. When the desk arrived, she noticed it was missing some key pieces and would be impossible to put together, Harel said. She couldn't request a replacement and have it within a reasonable time for the office of her New York lice detection removal service because the item was out of stock.",
      "Harel, who routinely buys towels and other products from Amazon for her business, said her team reached out to the company's customer service line. She was pleasantly surprised to hear she would get a refund without having to send back the desk.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one less headache to deal with,\u201d Harel said. \u201cIt was really nice for us to not have to make an extra trip up to the post office.\u201d",
      "She used the desk pieces to create makeshift shelves in her office in Brooklyn.",
      "While the retail practice of letting customers keep merchandise and get their money back is not exactly a trade secret, the way it works is shrouded in mystery. Companies are not keen to publicize the circumstances in which they issue returnless refunds due to concerns over the potential for return fraud.",
      "Even if brands don't provide details about such policies on their websites, returnless refunds are expanding in at least some retail corners.",
      "Amazon, which industry experts say has engaged in the practice for years, announced in August that it would extend the option to the third-party sellers who drive most of the sales on the e-commerce giant's platform. Under the program, sellers who use the company\u2019s fulfillment services in the U.S. could choose to offer customers a traditional refund for purchases under $75 along with no obligation to return what they ordered.",
      "Amazon did not immediately respond to questions about how the program works. But publicly, it has pitched returnless refunds more directly to international sellers and those who offer cheaper goods. Items sold in an upcoming section of Amazon's website, which will allow U.S. shoppers to buy low-cost goods shipped directly from China, will also be eligible for returnless refunds, according to documents seen by The Associated Press.",
      "In January, Walmart gave a similar option to merchants who sell products on its growing online marketplace, leaving it up to sellers to set price limits and determine if or how they want to participate.",
      "China-founded e-commerce companies Shein and Temu say they also offer returnless refunds on a small number of orders, as does Target, the online shopping site Overstock and pet products e-tailer Chewy, which some customer said had encouraged them to donate unwanted items to local animal shelters.",
      "Wayfair, another online retailer cited by some customers as offering returnless refunds, did not reply to a request for comment on its policies.",
      "Overall, retailers and brands tend to be careful about how often they let customers keep items for free. Many of them are deploying algorithms to determine who should be given the option and who should not.",
      "To make the decision, the algorithms assess multiple factors, including the extent to which a shopper should be trusted based on prior purchasing \u2013 and returning \u2013 patterns, shipping costs and the demand for the product in the customer\u2019s hands, according to Sender Shamiss, CEO of goTRG, a reverse logistics company that works with retailers like Walmart.",
      "Optoro, a company that helps streamline returns for Best Buy, Staples and Gap Inc., has observed retailers assessing the lifetime value of a customer and extending returnless refunds as a type of unofficial, discreet loyalty benefit, according to CEO Amena Ali.",
      "The king of online retail appeared to verify the process works that way.",
      "In a statement, Amazon said it offers returnless refunds on a \u201cvery small number\u201d of items as a \u201cconvenience to customers.\u201d",
      "The company also said it's hearing positive feedback from sellers about its new program that authorized them to tell customers they could keep some products and still be reimbursed. Amazon said it was monitoring for signs of fraud and setting eligibility criteria for sellers and customers. It didn't provide additional details on what that encompassed.",
      "Some retailers also are stiffening the liberal return policies they long employed to encourage online orders. Shoppers who enjoyed making purchases on their computers or cellphones became accustomed to loading up their digital shopping baskets with the intent of returning items they ended up not liking.",
      "Shopping online also grew significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homebound consumers reduced their trips to stores and relied on sites like Amazon for everyday items. Retail companies have talked in recent years about returns becoming more expensive to process due to the growing volume, rising inflation and labor costs.",
      "Last year, U.S. consumers returned $743 billion worth of merchandise, or 14.5% of the products they purchased - up from 10.6% in 2020, according to the National Retail Federation. In 2019, returned merchandise was valued at $309 billion, according to loss prevention company Appriss Retail.",
      "Last year, roughly 14% of returns were fraudulent, costing retailers $101 billion in losses, according to a joint report from the National Retail federation and Appriss Retail. The problem spans from low-level forms of fraud - such as shoppers returning already worn clothing - to more complicated schemes by fraudsters who return shoplifted merchandise or items purchased on stolen credit cards.",
      "To deter excessive returns, some retailers, including H&M, Zara and J. Crew, started charging customers return fees in the past year. Others have shortened their return windows. Some shopping sites, such as the Canadian retailer Ssense, have threatened to kick frequent returners off their platforms if they suspect abuse of their policies.",
      "However, retailers don't all view frequent returners in the same way. Such customers could be seen as \u201cgood returners\u201d if they purchase \u2013 and keep \u2013 many more items than they send back, Ali said.",
      "\u201cOftentimes, your most profitable customers tend to be high returners,\u201d she said."

      "Virginia Chau, a lawyer who worked as a polling center supervisor during elections, spoke in 2022 about threats made against election workers and the lack of training for them during a panel discussion on the short-lived streaming show \u201cThe Problem with Jon Stewart.\u201d",
      "Nationally, election officials have increased security in the lead-up to Election Day both to protect their workers and to protect voting procedures and ballots. Election offices and workers have been the target of harassment and threats since the 2020 presidential election, mainly by people supporting former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies that the election was stolen from him because of fraud.",
      "According to Chau's lawsuit, the Denver elections division director R. Todd Davidson told her she was being removed as a supervisor because of her comments on the show and said she could be a hotline representative instead because no one from the public would recognize her in that job. The move would have been a demotion, the lawsuit said, and Chau refused to accept the new position.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Denver clerk and recorder Paul Lopez did not respond to Chau's request to reconsider her termination.",
      "\u201cInstead of heeding Ms. Chau\u2019s call for more resources and training for election officials facing threats to their personal safety, Defendants decided instead to retaliate against one of their best, and most passionate, election workers,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The suit was filed against the city, its elections director and clerk and recorder. It asks for Chau to be reinstated and for unspecified damages.",
      "A spokesperson for Lopez's office, Mikayla Ortega, and a representative of the city attorney's office, Melissa Sisneros, said their offices do not comment on pending litigation."

      "DETROIT -- The U.S. government's auto safety regulator has ended a 2 1/2-year investigation into Ford engine failures after the company replaced engines or extended the warranty on some vehicles.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says in documents posted Monday on its website that its analysis traced the problem to intake valves that can fracture inside some 2.7-liter and 3-liter turbocharged engines.",
      "Documents say the probe opened in May of 2022 ended up covering more than 411,000 vehicles from the 2021 and 2022 model years including the Ford F-150 Bronco, Edge and Explorer as well as the Lincoln Aviator and Nautilus.",
      "The agency was looking into catastrophic engine failures caused by intake valves fracturing, dropping into the cylinder and hitting the piston.",
      "The documents say a forensic analysis of fractured valves found that when the they were made by a parts supplier, the temperature got too high, making them brittle and likely to fracture during normal engine use.",
      "An analysis of failure report data found that the faulty valves were made from May through October of 2021, the agency said. Ford contended that not all valves produced during this period were faulty and that a vast majority of the failures happened before the vehicles were driven 20,000 miles.",
      "An agency statistical analysis to predict the number of failures, and an analysis of failure reports \u201care generally consistent\u201d with Ford's determination that the valves would fail at low mileage, and the majority of vehicles with the faulty valves \u201chave already experienced a failure,\u201d the agency said.",
      "Earlier this year Ford recalled about 91,000 vehicles with valves made during the suspect period. They'll be tested and get a new engine if necessary. The company also extended the warranty on vehicles with valves made during the period to 10 years or 150,000 miles, the documents said.",

      "ATLANTA -- Thousands of voters in Georgia's third-largest county who received their absentee ballots late will not get an extension to return them, the state's highest court decided on Monday.",
      "Cobb County, just north of Atlanta, didn't mail out absentee ballots to some 3,400 voters who had requested them until late last week. Georgia law says absentee ballots must be received by the close of polls on Election Day. But a judge in a lower court ruled last week that the ballots at issue could be counted if they're received by this Friday, three days after Election Day, as long as they were postmarked by Tuesday.",
      "The Georgia Supreme Court ruling means the affected Cobb County residents must vote in person on Election Day, which is Tuesday, or bring their absentee ballots to the county elections office by 7 p.m. that day.",
      "The high court ruling instructs county election officials to notify the affected voters by email, text message and in a public message on the county election board's website. And it orders officials to keep separate and sealed any ballots received after the Election Day deadline but before 5 p.m. Friday.",
      "Board of elections Chair Tori Silas said the board will comply with the Supreme Court order, but it's still up in the air whether ballots received after Election Day will be counted. The order only addressed a motion for a stay, so election officials will have to wait for the court's final ruling to see whether votes received after Tuesday will be counted, she said in a statement.",
      "To deliver the ballots on time, election officials in Cobb County were using U.S. Postal Service express mail and UPS overnight delivery, and sending the ballots with prepaid express return envelopes. The Board of Elections said that more than 1,000 of the absentee ballots being mailed late were being sent to people outside of Georgia.",
      "Silas last week blamed the delay in sending out the ballots on faulty equipment and a late surge in absentee ballot requests during the week before the Oct. 25 deadline.",
      "The original ruling extending the deadline stemmed from a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center on behalf of three Cobb County voters who said they had not received absentee ballots by mail as of Friday."

    "title": "Mpox cases in Congo may be stabilizing. Experts say more vaccines are needed to stamp out virus",
    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 16:02:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Some health officials say mpox cases in Congo appear to be &ldquo;stabilizing.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "Some health officials say mpox cases in Congo appear to be \u201cstabilizing.\u201d",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Some health officials say mpox cases in Congo appear to be \u201cstabilizing\u201d \u2014 a possible sign that the main epidemic for which the World Health Organization made a global emergency declaration in August might be on the decline.",
      "In recent weeks, Congo has reported about 200 to 300 lab-confirmed mpox cases every week, according to WHO. That\u2019s down from nearly 400 cases a week in July. The decline is also apparent in Kamituga, the mining city in the eastern part of Congo where the new, more infectious variant of mpox first emerged.",
      "But the U.N. health agency acknowledged Friday that only 40% to 50% of suspected infections in Congo were being tested \u2014 and that the virus is continuing to spread in some parts of the country and elsewhere, including Uganda.",
      "While doctors are encouraged by the drop in infections in some parts of Congo, it's still not clear what kinds of physical contact is driving the outbreak. Health experts are also frustrated by the low number of vaccine doses the central African nation has received \u2014 265,000 \u2014 and say that delivering the vaccine to where it's needed in the sprawling country is proving difficult. WHO estimates 50,000 people have been immunized in Congo, which has a population of 110 million.",
      "Scientists also say there needs to be an urgent, broader vaccination effort for the entire continent to halt mpox's spread and avoid further worrisome genetic mutations, like the one detected earlier this year in Congo after months of low-level circulation.",
      "\u201cIf we miss this opportunity, the likelihood of another significant outbreak increases substantially,\u201d said Dr. Zakary Rhissa, who heads operations in Congo for the charity Alima.",
      "So far this year, there have been roughly 43,000 suspected cases in Africa and more than 1,000 people have died, mostly in Congo.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how past outbreaks, such as the one in Nigeria in 2017, can lead to larger global events if not effectively contained,\u201d he said. The 2017 epidemic ended up leading to the 2022 global outbreak of mpox that affected more than 100 countries.",
      "Rhissa said the decline in cases in Kamituga \u2014 where mpox initially spread among sex workers and miners \u2014 is an opening to put more programs in place for vaccination, surveillance and education.",
      "Georgette Hamuli, an 18-year-old sex worker, hadn\u2019t been aware of mpox until immunization teams arrived last week in the poor neighborhood where she works in Goma, the biggest city in eastern Congo.",
      "\u201cThey told us we're highly exposed to the the risk of infection,\u201d she said. \u201cWe insist on condoms with our clients, but some refuse ... if they don\u2019t want to use a condom, they double the amount they pay.\u201d",
      "Hamuli said she and other friends who are sex workers each received 2,000 Congolese francs ($0.70) from a charity to get vaccinated against mpox \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t the money that swayed her.",
      "\u201cThe vaccine is also necessary,\" she said. \"I think we\u2019re now protected.\u201d",
      "The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated Congo needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the virus, and another 7 million for the rest of Africa. So far, WHO and partners have allocated 900,000 vaccines to nine African countries affected by mpox and expect 6 million vaccines to be available by the end of this year.",
      "Mpox epidemics in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda had their origins in Congo, and a number of cases in travelers have also been identified in Sweden, Thailand, Germany, India and Britain.",
      "Fewer than half of the people who are most at risk in Congo have been vaccinated, according to Heather Kerr, Congo director for the the International Rescue Committee.",
      "\u201cWe only have a tiny amount of vaccines, and nothing for the kids,\u201d she said.",
      "The vaccines for Congo are largely coming from donor countries like the U.S and through UNICEF, which mainly uses taxpayer money to buy the shots.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting a charitable approach where we only see very small donations of vaccines to Africa,\u201d said Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University. \u201cWhat we need is a public health approach where we immunize populations at scale.\u201d",
      "Drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, which makes the most widely used mpox vaccine, said it would sell shots destined for Africa at the lowest price possible.",
      "The advocacy group Public Citizen published an analysis showing that UNICEF paid $65 per dose of the Jynneos mpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic, far higher than nearly all other vaccines used in public health programs.",
      "Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, an infectious diseases expert at South Africa\u2019s University of KwaZulu-Natal, said mpox outbreaks typically peak and disappear quickly because of how the virus spreads. This time, however, he said there are two complicating factors: the virus\u2019 transmission via sex and the continued spillover from infected animals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in new territory with mpox this time,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we\u2019re never going to solve this until we vaccinate most of our people.\u201d",

      "Orlando Harris\u2019 family pleaded with police to confiscate the 19-year-old\u2019s bullet-proof vest, ammunition and AR-15-style rifle",
      "Orlando Harris\u2019 family pleaded with Missouri police to confiscate the 19-year-old\u2019s bullet-proof vest, ammunition and AR-15-style rifle. They knew his mental health was fragile after more than one suicide attempt. But the best officers could do in a state with some of the most expansive gun rights is suggest Harris keep the weapon in a storage unit.",
      "Nine days later, Harris entered his former St. Louis high school and declared, \u201cAll of you are going to die.\u201d",
      "A new 456-page police report details the efforts Harris' family took to try to take his gun away in the days before he walked into Central Visual Arts and Performing Arts High School on Oct. 24, 2022, when he killed a student and a teacher and wounded seven others before he was fatally shot by police.",
      "Missouri is not among the 21 states with a red-flag law. Also known as extreme risk protection orders, red-flag laws are intended to restrict the purchase of guns or temporarily remove them from people who may hurt themselves or someone else.",
      "The case highlights how hard it is for law enforcement to restrict gun access, even when there are clues something is deeply amiss.",
      "After an Army reservist killed 18 people in October 2023 in Lewiston, Maine, an investigation found missed opportunities to intervene in the shooter\u2019s psychiatric crisis. And before a 14-year-old was charged in a deadly shooting this fall at his Georgia high school, a deputy talked to him about an online threat and family warned of an \u201cextreme emergency.\u201d",
      "The investigation report in Harris' case shows the first time he attempted suicide was in the fall of 2021, just before he was scheduled to leave for college. Pandemic disruptions, the arrest of a friend in a homicide and a car wreck all may have contributed to his depression, his family and former boss told investigators.",
      "The police report makes no mention of him attending college. Instead, he worked in the cafeteria at a senior facility, where he sometimes discussed guns with coworkers.",
      "The following August he met with a Washington University psychiatry resident, telling her he thought about shooting people at his old school. He said those thoughts lasted for just one evening and went away, and that there was no planning and he didn\u2019t want to do it.",
      "But soon after, Harris began a countdown to the shooting. His plans included detailed maps of the school and a plan to target teachers, students and the LGBTQ community. He also had plans to burn down his family's home with them inside.",
      "The psychiatrist prescribed medications, but Harris didn\u2019t fill the prescriptions. The report says they developed an emergency plan.",
      "Washington University did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Harris then stopped showing up for appointments.",
      "On Oct. 8, he tried to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer in St. Charles, Missouri, but the transaction was blocked by an FBI background check. The report doesn't explain why, and police didn't respond to an email from the AP. The FBI merely provided a list of the 12 reasons for a denial with no other details.",
      "Then on Oct. 10, Harris drove to a nearby suburb to pay a man $580 in cash for the rifle used in the shooting.",
      "Harris\u2019 family grew more concerned on Oct. 15, when two packages from gun and ammunition suppliers arrived. One of his sisters, Noneeka Harris, opened them, finding a body armor vest, magazine holsters and magazines. She then searched his bedroom and found the rifle inside an old TV box.",
      "Harris' mother, Tanya Ward, called BJC Mental Health Services and staff there \u201cdeemed the situation as an immediate threat.\u201d They advised her to take the items to the police department and tell officers about her son\u2019s mental illness.",
      "Police at the station told her they couldn\u2019t take the firearm because Harris was of legal age to possess it. They said she should head home and an officer would meet them there. By the time she returned, Harris was home and insistent that he keep the gun.",
      "His mother was adamant that the gun not be in the house, so the officers suggested a storage unit. The report said the officers also advised her on steps she needed to take to have her son deemed mentally unstable.",
      "Federal law has banned some mentally ill people from buying guns since 1968, including those deemed a danger to themselves or others, who have been involuntarily committed, or judged not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.",
      "Ultimately, the firearm and other items were loaded into the trunk of Harris' sister's vehicle, including a box of ammunition that arrived the next day. She later drove her brother to a storage facility, which was about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the high school.",
      "She told police she \u201cknew something was going to happen.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 24, shots rang out as Harris entered his former high school.",
      "It is unclear why Harris targeted the school. A security officer recalled him as somewhat popular and his grade school principal said he wasn\u2019t bullied, according to the investigative report. But as he fired at a dance class, one student told police she heard someone yell, \u201cI hate this school. I hate everybody.\u201d",
      "Fatally wounded, Alexzandria Bell initially ran toward the entrance before slumping to the ground, a security officer reassuring the 10th grader that help was on the way. But then she went quiet.",
      "One class jumped out a window to escape after their physical education teacher, 61-year-old Jean Kuczka, stood between them and Harris. Kuckza was killed.",
      "Harris eventually made his way to the third floor, hiding in a computer lab. The first officer to charge into the lab had a daughter at the school.",
      "\u201cI had everything to lose,\u201d the officer, who was among those to open fire, recalled in the police report. He texted his daughter afterward, telling her, \u201cI killed him.\u201d",
      "Harris' sister told investigators that when she heard about the shooting, she started driving toward the school but then went home instead, waking up her mother who had worked overnight.",
      "Harris' mother later checked her voicemail. There was a message from a hospital asking if she still needed help with her son."

      "The debate over abortion rights is leading to expensive campaigns for state Supreme Courts in several states this year",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Abortion and reproductive rights have been central to the races for president and governor in North Carolina, a battleground state that has more moderate abortion restrictions than elsewhere across the South.",
      "That's been even truer in the fight for a seat on the state Supreme Court that abortion rights supporters say will play an important role in determining whether Republicans can enact even more restrictions. Registered Republicans currently hold five of seven seats and could expand that majority even further in Tuesday's election.",
      "Justice Allison Riggs, a Democrat who is running for reelection, is focusing heavily on the issue and touts her support for reproductive rights. Her first television ad featured images of Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the Republican nominee for governor, who prefers to restrict abortions earlier than the current 12 weeks. She says her GOP rival for the court could be a deciding vote on the bench for such restrictions.",
      "\u201cThis is an issue that is landing in front of state Supreme Courts, and it is one that is very salient to voters now,\u201d Riggs said in an interview.",
      "Her Republican opponent, Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin, said Riggs is saying too much about an issue that could come before the court.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an inappropriate manner, a clear violation of our judicial standards, our code of conduct,\u201d he said.",
      "The North Carolina race emphasizes how much abortion is fueling expensive campaigns for Supreme Courts in several states this year. Groups on the right and left are spending heavily to reshape courts that could play deciding roles in legal fights over abortion, reproductive rights, voting rights, redistricting and other hot-button issues for years to come.",
      "Experts say the campaigns show how the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning constitutional abortion protections that had been in place for half a century has transformed races for state high courts.",
      "\u201cWhat Dobbs did was made clear to both political stakeholders and the public that these state courts that hadn't got a lot of attention are actually going to be really important and they're going to be deciding some of the biggest cases that people might have expected to go to the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d said Douglas Keith, senior counsel in the judiciary program at the Brennan Center, which has tracked spending on state court races.",
      "Thirty-three states are holding elections for 82 Supreme Court seats this year. The 2024 election cycle follows record-breaking spending for judicial races in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania last year.",
      "Groups on the left have ramped up their spending on state courts considerably this year. The American Civil Liberties Union has spent $5.4 million on court races in Montana, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Planned Parenthood and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee earlier this year announced they were collectively spending $5 million, focusing on court races in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.",
      "\u201cWe have never invested this heavily in state Supreme Courts before,\u201d said Katie Rodihan, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Votes. \u201cThis is really a groundbreaking move for us, and I expect this will be the norm for us moving forward.\u201d",
      "The targets include Ohio, where Republicans hold a 4-3 majority on the court. Democrats are defending two seats on the court, while a third is open, and Democratic victories in all three races are considered a longshot in the Republican-leaning state.",
      "Control of the court could be key if the state appeals a judge's ruling that struck down the most far-reaching of the state's abortion restrictions. The ruling said the law banning most abortions once cardiac activity is detected \u2014 as early as six weeks into pregnancy and before many women know they\u2019re pregnant \u2014 violated a constitutional amendment approved by voters last year that protected reproductive rights.",
      "Two seats are up for election on Michigan's court, where Democratic-backed justices hold a 4-3 majority. Court races are technically nonpartisan, but candidates are nominated at party conventions. Republicans would need to win both seats to flip the court in their favor.",
      "Justice Kyra Harris Bolden is defending the seat she was appointed to two years ago by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Bolden was the first Black woman to sit on Michigan\u2019s bench. She faces Republican-backed circuit court Judge Patrick O\u2019Grady for the remaining four years of the eight-year term.",
      "Republican state Rep. Andrew Fink is competing against University of Michigan law professor Kimberly Anne Thomas, who was nominated by Democrats, for the other open seat that is being vacated by a Republican-backed justice.",
      "Michigan voters already have locked abortion rights in the state constitution, though groups backing Bolden and Thomas are framing the races as crucial to defending those rights, with one group\u2019s ad warning that \u201cthe Michigan state Supreme Court can still take abortion rights away.\u201d",
      "The most heated races are for two seats on the Montana Supreme Court, which has come under fire from GOP lawmakers over rulings against laws that would have restricted abortion access or made it more difficult to vote.",
      "Former U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerry Lynch is running against county attorney Cory Swanson for chief justice, while state judge Katherine Bidegaray is running against state judge Dan Wilson for another open seat on the court.",
      "Progressive groups have been backing Lynch and Bidegaray. Both said in an ACLU questionnaire that they agreed with the reasoning and holding of a 1999 state Supreme Court ruling that the constitutional right to privacy includes the right to obtain a pre-viability abortion.",
      "Groups on the right have been painting them both as too liberal and echoing national Republicans' rhetoric, with text messages invoking the debate over transgender athletes on women's sports teams.",
      "The Republican State Leadership Committee, a longtime player in state court races, said its Judicial Fairness Initiative planned to spend seven figures in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.",
      "The group's ads are focusing on issues other than abortion. In one touting three Republicans running for Ohio's court, the group shows images of President Donald Trump along with images related to immigration.",
      "A super PAC backed by conservative donor and shipping executive Richard Uihlein also has given to groups involved in state Supreme Court races in Montana and Ohio.",
      "Progressive groups are even focusing attention on longshot states such as Texas, where Republicans hold all the seats on the Supreme Court. They're trying to unseat three GOP justices who were part of unanimous rulings rejecting challenges to the state's abortion ban.",
      "One group, Find Out PAC, has been running digital ads in San Antonio, Dallas and Houston criticizing justices Jimmy Blacklock, John Devine and Jane Bland. In its ad, the group accuses the three of \u201cplaying doctor from the bench.\u201d",
      "In North Carolina, Riggs' campaigning on abortion rights has prompted complaints from Republicans who say she's stepping outside the bounds of judicial ethics. But Riggs said she's not saying how she would rule in any case and is merely sharing her values with voters.",
      "\u201cI'm going to keep talking about my values because, at the core, our democracy works best when people cast informed votes,\u201d she said.",

      "The last three hospitals still partially functioning in northern Gaza have been encircled by Israeli troops and caught amid fighting for weeks",
      "JERUSALEM -- They were built to be places of healing. But once again, three hospitals in northern Gaza are encircled by Israeli troops and under fire.",
      "Bombardment is pounding around them as Israel wages a new offensive against Hamas fighters that it says have regrouped nearby. As staff scramble to treat waves of wounded, they remain haunted by a war that has seen hospitals targeted with an intensity and overtness rarely seen in modern warfare.",
      "All three were besieged and raided by Israeli troops some 10 months ago. The Kamal Adwan, al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals still have not recovered from the damage, yet are the only hospitals even partially operational in the area.",
      "Medical facilities often come under fire in wars, but combatants usually depict such incidents as accidental or exceptional, since hospitals enjoy special protection under international law. In its yearlong campaign in Gaza, Israel has stood out by carrying out an open campaign on hospitals, besieging and raiding at least 10 of them across the Gaza Strip, some several times, as well as hitting multiple others in strikes.",
      "It has said this is a military necessity in its aim to destroy Hamas after the militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. It claims Hamas uses hospitals as \u201ccommand and control bases\u201d to plan attacks, to shelter fighters and to hide hostages. It argues that nullifies the protections for hospitals.",
      "\u201cIf we intend to take down the military infrastructure in the north, we have to take down the philosophy of (using) the hospitals,\u201d Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said of Hamas during an interview with The Associated Press in January after the first round of hospital raids.",
      "Most prominently, Israel twice raided Gaza City\u2019s Shifa Hospital, the biggest medical facility in the strip, producing a video animation depicting it as a major Hamas base, though the evidence it presented remains disputed.",
      "But the focus on Shifa has overshadowed raids on other facilities. The AP spent months gathering accounts of the raids on al-Awda, Indonesian and Kamal Adwan Hospitals, interviewing more than three dozen patients, witnesses and medical and humanitarian workers as well as Israeli officials.",
      "It found that Israel has presented little or even no evidence of a significant Hamas presence in those cases. The AP presented a dossier listing the incidents reported by those it interviewed to the Israeli military spokesman\u2019s office. The office said it could not comment on specific events.",
      "The Israeli military has never made any claims of a Hamas presence at al-Awda. When asked what intelligence led troops to besiege and raid the hospital last year, the military spokesman\u2019s office did not reply.",
      "In recent weeks, the hospital has been paralyzed once again, with Israeli troops fighting in nearby Jabalia refugee camp and no food, water or medical supplies entering areas of northern Gaza. Its director Mohammed Salha said last month that the facility was surrounded by troops and was unable to evacuate six critical patients. Staff were down to eating one meal a day, usually just a flat bread or a bit of rice, he said.",
      "As war-wounded poured in, exhausted surgeons were struggling to treat them. No vascular surgeons or neurosurgeons remain north of Gaza City, so the doctors often resort to amputating shrapnel-shattered limbs to save lives.",
      "\u201cWe are reliving the nightmares of November and December of last year, but worse,\u201d Salha said. \u201cWe have fewer supplies, fewer doctors and less hope that anything will be done to stop this.\u201d",
      "The military, which did not respond to a specific request for comment on al-Awda hospital, says it takes all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties.",
      "Last year, fighting was raging around al-Awda when, on Nov. 21, a shell exploded in the facility's operating room. Dr. Mahmoud Abu Nujaila, two other doctors and a patient\u2019s uncle died almost instantly, according to international charity Doctors Without Borders, which said it had informed the Israeli military of its coordinates.",
      "Dr. Mohammed Obeid, Abu Nujaila\u2019s colleague, recalled dodging shellfire inside the hospital complex. Israeli sniper fire killed a nurse and two janitors and wounded a surgeon, hospital officials said.",
      "By Dec. 5, al-Awda was surrounded. For 18 days, coming or going became \u201ca death sentence,\u201d Obeid said.",
      "Survivors and hospital administrators recounted at least four occasions when Israeli drones or snipers killed or badly wounded Palestinians trying to enter. Two women about to give birth were shot and bled to death in the street, staff said. Salha, the administrator, watched gunfire kill his cousin, Souma, and her 6-year-old son as she brought the boy for treatment of wounds.",
      "Shaza al-Shuraim said labor pains left her no choice but to walk an hour to al-Awda to give birth. She, her mother-in-law and 16-year-old brother-in-law raised flags made of white blouses. \u201cCivilians!\u201d her mother-in-law, Khatam Sharir, kept shouting. Just outside the gate, a burst of gunfire answered, killing Sharir.",
      "On Dec. 23, troops stormed the hospital, ordering men ages 15 to 65 to strip and undergo interrogation in the yard. Mazen Khalidi, whose infected right leg had been amputated, said nurses pleaded with soldiers to let him rest rather than join the blindfolded and handcuffed men outside. They refused, and he hobbled downstairs, his stump bleeding.",
      "\u201cThe humiliation scared me more than death,\u201d Khalidi said.",
      "The hospital\u2019s director, Ahmed Muhanna, was seized by Israeli troops; his whereabouts remain unknown. One of Gaza\u2019s leading doctors, orthopedist Adnan al-Bursh, was also detained during the raid and died in Israeli custody in May.",
      "In the wreckage from the November shelling, staff found a message that Abu Nujaila had written on a whiteboard in the previous weeks.",
      "\u201cWhoever stays until the end will tell the story,\u201d it read in English. \u201cWe did what we could. Remember us.\u201d",
      "Several blocks away, on Oct. 18, artillery hit the upper floors of Indonesian Hospital, staff said. People fled for their lives. They'd already been surrounded by Israeli troops, leaving doctors and patients inside without enough food, water and supplies.",
      "\u201cThe bombing around us has increased. They\u2019ve paralyzed us,\" said Edi Wahyudi, an Indonesian volunteer.",
      "Two patients died because of a power outage and lack of supplies, said Muhannad Hadi, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Palestinian territories.",
      "Tamer al-Kurd, a nurse at the hospital, said around 44 patients and only two doctors remain. He said he was so dehydrated he was starting to hallucinate. \u201cPeople come to me to save them. \u2026 I can\u2019t do that by myself, with two doctors,\u201d he said in a voice message, his voice weak. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, the Israeli military said it had facilitated the evacuation of 29 patients from Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals.",
      "The Indonesian is Northern Gaza\u2019s largest hospital. Today its top floors are charred, its walls pockmarked by shrapnel, its gates strewn with piled-up rubble \u2014 all the legacy of Israel's siege in the autumn of 2023.",
      "Before the assault, the Israeli army claimed an underground command-and-control center lay beneath the hospital. It released blurry satellite images of what it said was a tunnel entrance in the yard and a rocket launchpad nearby, outside the hospital compound.",
      "The Indonesia-based group that funds the hospital denied any Hamas presence. \u201cIf there\u2019s a tunnel, we would know. We know this building because we built it brick by brick, layer by layer. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Arief Rachman, a hospital manager from the Indonesia-based Medical Emergency Rescue Committee, told the AP last month.",
      "After besieging and raiding the hospital, the military did not mention or show evidence of the underground facility or tunnels it had earlier claimed. When asked if any tunnels were found, the military spokesman's office did not reply.",
      "It released images of two vehicles found in the compound \u2014 a pickup truck with military vests and a bloodstained car belonging to an abducted Israeli, suggesting he had been brought to the hospital on Oct. 7. Hamas has said it brought wounded hostages to hospitals for treatment.",
      "During the siege, Israeli shelling crept closer and closer until, on Nov. 20, it hit the Indonesian\u2019s second floor, killing 12 people and wounding dozens, according to staff. Israel said troops responded to \u201cenemy fire\u201d from the hospital but denied using shells.",
      "Gunfire over the next days hit walls and whizzed through intensive care. Explosions sparked fires outside the hospital courtyard where some 1,000 displaced Palestinians sheltered, according to staff. The Israeli military denied targeting the hospital, although it acknowledged nearby bombardment may have damaged it.",
      "For three weeks, wounded poured in \u2014 up to 500 a day to a facility with capacity for 200. Supplies hadn\u2019t entered in weeks. Bloodstained linens piled up. Doctors, some working 24-hour shifts, ate a few dates a day. The discovery of moldy flour on Nov. 23 was almost thrilling.",
      "Without medicines or ventilators, there was little doctors could do. Wounds became infected. Doctors said they performed dozens of amputations on infected limbs. Medics estimated a fifth of incoming patients died. At least 60 corpses lay in the courtyard. Others were buried beneath a nearby playground.",
      "\u201cTo see patients dying before your eyes because you don\u2019t have the ability to help them, you have to ask yourself: \u2018Where is humanity?\u2019\u201d asked Dergham Abu Ibrahim, a volunteer.",
      "Kamal Adwan Hospital, once a linchpin of northern Gaza\u2019s health system, was burning on Thursday of last week.",
      "Israeli shells crashed into the third floor, igniting a fire that destroyed medical supplies, according to the World Health Organization, which had delivered the equipment just days before. The artillery hit water tanks and damaged the dialysis unit, badly burning four medics who tried to extinguish the blaze, said the hospital\u2019s director, Hossam Abu Safiya.",
      "In videos pleading for help over the past weeks, Abu Safiya had fought to maintain his composure as Israeli forces surrounded the hospital. But last weekend, there were tears in his eyes.",
      "\u201cEverything we have built, they have burned,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201cThey burned our hearts. They killed my son.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 25, Israeli troops stormed the hospital after what an Israeli military official described as an intense fight with militants nearby. During the battle, Israeli fire targeted the hospital\u2019s oxygen tanks because they \u201ccan be booby traps,\u201d the official said.",
      "Israeli forces withdrew after three days, during which Palestinian health officials said nearly all of Kamal Adwan's medical workers were detained, an Israeli drone killed at least one doctor and two children in intensive care died when generators stopped working.",
      "Days later, a drone struck Abu Safiya\u2019s son in nearby Jabalia. The 21-year-old had been wounded by Israeli snipers during the first military raid on Kamal Adwan last December. Now he is buried in the yard of the hospital, where just Abu Safiya and one other doctor remain to treat the dozens of wounded pouring in each day from new strikes in Jabalia.",
      "The Israeli military said troops detained 100 people, some who were \u201cposing as medical staff.\u201d Soldiers stripped the men to check for weapons, the military said, before those deemed militants were sent to detention camps. The military claimed that the hospital was \"fully operational, with all departments continuing to treat patients.\u201d It released footage of several guns and an RPG launcher with several rounds it said it found inside the hospital.",
      "Kamal Adwan staff say more than 30 medical personnel remain detained, including the head of nursing, who is employed by MedGlobal, an American organization that sends medical teams to disaster regions, and Dr. Mohammed Obeid, the surgeon employed by Doctors without Borders who previously worked at al-Awda Hospital and had moved to Kamal Adwan.",
      "The turmoil echoed Israel\u2019s nine-day siege of Kamal Adwan last December. On Dec. 12, soldiers entered and allowed police dogs to attack staff, patients and others, multiple witnesses said. Ahmed Atbail, a 36-year-old who had sought refuge at the hospital, said he saw a dog bite off one man\u2019s finger.",
      "Witnesses said the troops ordered boys and men, ranging from their mid-teens to 60, to line up outside crouched in the cold, blindfolded and nearly naked for hours of interrogation. \u201cEvery time someone lifted their heads, they were beaten,\u201d said Mohammed al-Masri, a lawyer who was detained.",
      "The military later published footage of men exiting the hospital. Al-Masri identified himself in the footage. He said soldiers staged the images, ordering men to lay down rifles belonging to the hospital guards as if they were militants surrendering. Israel said all photos released are authentic and that it apprehended dozens of suspected militants.",
      "As they released some of the men after interrogation, soldiers fired on them as they tried to reenter the hospital, wounding five, three detainees said. Ahmed Abu Hajjaj recalled hearing bursts of gunfire as he made his way back in the dark. \u201cI thought, this makes no sense \u2014 who would they be shooting at?\u201d",
      "Witnesses also said a bulldozer lumbered into the hospital compound, plowing into buildings. Abu Safiya, Abu Hajjaj and al-Masri described being held by soldiers inside the hospital as they heard people screaming outside.",
      "After the soldiers withdrew, the men saw the bulldozer had crushed tents that previously sheltered some 2,500 people. Most of the displaced had evacuated, but Abu Safiya said he found bodies of four people crushed, with splints from recent treatment in the hospital still on their limbs.",
      "Asked about the incident, the Israeli military spokesman\u2019s office said: \u201cLies were spread on social media\u201d about troops\u2019 activities at the hospital. It said bodies were discovered that had been buried previously, unrelated to the military\u2019s activities.",
      "Later, the military said Hamas used the hospital as a command center but produced no evidence. It said soldiers uncovered weapons, but it showed footage only of a single pistol.",
      "The hospital\u2019s director, Dr. Ahmed al-Kahlout, remains in Israeli custody. The military released footage of him under interrogation saying he was a Hamas agent and that militants were based in the hospital. His colleagues said he spoke under duress.",
      "Hagari, the military spokesperson, said hospitals \u201cprovide a life of their own ... to the (Hamas) war system.\u201d He said hospitals were linked to tunnels allowing fighters movement. \u201cAnd when you take it, they have no way to move. Not from the south to the north.\u201d",
      "Despite often suggesting hospitals are linked to Hamas' underground networks, the military has shown only one tunnel shaft from all the hospitals it raided \u2014 one leading to Shifa's grounds.",
      "In a report last month, a U.N. investigation commission determined that \u201cIsrael has implemented a concerted policy to destroy the health-care system of Gaza.\u201d It described Israeli actions at hospitals as \u201ccollective punishment against the Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Some patients now fear hospitals, refusing to go to them or leaving before treatment is complete. \u201cThey are places of death,\u201d Ahmed al-Qamar, a 35-year-old economist in Jabalia refugee camp, said of his fear of taking his children to the hospital. \u201cYou can feel it.\u201d",
      "Zaher Sahloul, the president of MedGlobal who has also worked in Gaza during the war, said the sense of safety that should surround hospitals has been destroyed.",

      "PHOENIX -- PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent proponent of debunked public health claims whom Donald Trump has promised to put in charge of health initiatives, said Saturday that Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected president.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Kennedy made the declaration Saturday on the social media platform X alongside a variety of claims about the heath effects of fluoride.",
      "\u201cOn January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S\u200b. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,\u201d Kennedy wrote. Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, \u201cwant to Make America Healthy Again,\u201d he added, repeating a phrase Trump often uses and links to Kennedy.",
      "Trump told NBC News on Sunday that he had not spoken to Kennedy about fluoride yet, \u201cbut it sounds OK to me. You know it\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "The former president declined to say whether he would seek a Cabinet role for Kennedy, a job that would require Senate confirmation, but added, \"He\u2019s going to have a big role in the administration.\u201d",
      "Asked whether banning certain vaccines would be on the table, Trump said he would talk to Kennedy and others about that. Trump described Kennedy as \"a very talented guy and has strong views.\u201d",
      "The sudden and unexpected weekend social media post evoked the chaotic policymaking that defined Trump\u2019s White House tenure, when he would issue policy declarations on Twitter at virtually all hours. It also underscored the concerns many experts have about Kennedy, who has long promoted debunked theories about vaccine safety, having influence over U.S. public health.",
      "In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and continued to promote it even after fluoride toothpaste brands hit the market several years later. Though fluoride can come from a number of sources, drinking water is the main source for Americans, researchers say.",
      "Officials lowered their recommendation for drinking water fluoride levels in 2015 to address a tooth condition called fluorosis, that can cause splotches on teeth and was becoming more common in U.S. kids.",
      "In August, a federal agency determined \u201cwith moderate confidence\u201d that there is a link between higher levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQ in kids. The National Toxicology Program based its conclusion on studies involving fluoride levels at about twice the recommended limit for drinking water.",
      "A federal judge later cited that study in ordering the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to further regulate fluoride in drinking water. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen cautioned that it\u2019s not certain that the amount of fluoride typically added to water is causing lower IQ in kids, but he concluded that mounting research points to an unreasonable risk that it could be. He ordered the EPA to take steps to lower that risk, but didn\u2019t say what those measures should be.",
      "In his X post Saturday, Kennedy tagged Michael Connett, the lead attorney representing the plaintiff in that lawsuit, the environmental advocacy group Food & Water Watch.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine organization has a lawsuit pending against news organizations including The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy is on leave from the group but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",
      "What role Kennedy might hold if Trump wins on Tuesday remains unclear. Kennedy recently told NewsNation that Trump asked him to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and some agencies under the Department of Agriculture.",
      "But for now, the former independent presidential candidate has become one of Trump's top surrogates. Trump frequently mentions having the support of Kennedy, a scion of a Democratic dynasty and the son of former Attorney General Robert Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy.",
      "Kennedy traveled with Trump Friday and spoke at his rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin.",
      "Trump said Saturday that he told Kennedy: \u201cYou can work on food, you can work on anything you want\" except oil policy.",
      "\u201cHe wants health, he wants women\u2019s health, he wants men\u2019s health, he wants kids, he wants everything,\" Trump added."

      "A pig at an Oregon farm was found to have bird flu",
      "NEW YORK -- A pig at an Oregon farm was found to have bird flu, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday. It's the first time the virus has been detected in U.S. swine and raises concerns about bird flu's potential to become a human threat.",
      "The infection happened at a backyard farm in Crook County, in the center of the state, where different animals share water and are housed together. Last week, poultry at the farm were found to have the virus, and testing this week found that one of the farm's five pigs had become infected.",
      "The farm was put under quarantine and all five pigs were euthanized so additional testing could be done. It's not a commercial farm, and U.S. agriculture officials said there is no concern about the safety of the nation's pork supply.",
      "But finding bird flu in a pig raises worries that the virus may be hitting a stepping stone to becoming a bigger threat to people, said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University pandemic researcher.",
      "Pigs can be infected with multiple types of flu, and the animals can play a role in making bird viruses better adapted to humans, she explained. The 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic had swine origins, Nuzzo noted.",
      "\u201cIf we're trying to stay ahead of this virus and prevent it from becoming a threat to the broader public, knowing if it's in pigs is crucial,\u201d Nuzzo said.",
      "The USDA has conducted genetic tests on the farm's poultry and has not seen any mutations that suggest the virus is gaining an increased ability to spread to people. That indicates the current risk to the public remains low, officials said.",
      "A different strain of the bird flu virus has been reported in pigs outside the U.S. in the past, and it did not trigger a human pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt isn\u2019t a one-to-one relationship, where pigs get infected with viruses and they make pandemics,\u201d said Troy Sutton, a Penn State researcher who studies flu viruses in animals.",
      "This version of bird flu \u2014 known as Type A H5N1 \u2014 has been spreading widely in the U.S. among wild birds, poultry, cows and a number of other animals. Its persistence increases the chances that people will be exposed and potentially catch it, officials say.",
      "It isn't necessarily surprising that a pig infection was detected, given that so many other animals have had the virus, experts said.",
      "The Oregon pig infection \"is noteworthy, but does it change the calculation of the threat level? No it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Sutton said. If the virus starts spreading more widely among pigs and if there are ensuing human infections, \"then we\u2019re going to be more concerned.\u201d",
      "So far this year, nearly 40 human cases have been reported \u2014 in California, Colorado, Washington, Michigan, Texas and Missouri \u2014 with mostly mild symptoms, including eye redness, reported. All but one of the people had been to contact with infected animals.",

      "Louisiana\u2019s new law categorizing two widely used abortion drugs as controlled dangerous substances is being challenged in a state court lawsuit by a physician, a pharmacist, two women who had difficult pregnancies and others",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana's new law categorizing two widely used abortion drugs as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances\u201d was challenged in a state court lawsuit Thursday by a physician, a pharmacist and others who say the legislation sets up needless, dangerous delays in treatment during medical emergencies.",
      "Although there already was a near-total abortion ban in Louisiana, including by medication, the reclassification of the drugs \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol, which have other critical reproductive health care uses \u2014 went into effect earlier this month. Proponents of the law said more oversight and control over the drugs was needed to prevent coerced abortions. They have used as an example a Texas case in which a pregnant woman was given seven misoprostol pills by her husband without her knowledge. The baby survived.",
      "Doctors critical of the law have said it could harm patients facing emergency complications such as postpartum hemorrhages by requiring medical personnel to go through extra steps and more stringent storage requirements to use the drugs.",
      "\u201cEven short delays in accessing misoprostol can be life-threatening for postpartum hemorrhage patients,\u201d says the lawsuit. It says the law violates the Louisiana Constitution in multiple ways, including a prohibition on discrimination based on a person's physical condition.",
      "Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill said she had not seen the lawsuit as of Thursday afternoon. \u201cI can\u2019t respond to a lawsuit we have not seen, but I\u2019m confident this law is constitutional,\" she said in a statement. \"We will vigorously defend it.\u201d",
      "In addition to the physician and the pharmacist, who the lawsuit says is pregnant, the plaintiffs in the case include the Birthmark Doula Collective, an organization of people trained to provide pregnancy care before, during and after birth.",
      "Other plaintiffs include Nancy Davis, a woman who was denied an abortion in Louisiana and traveled out of state for one after learning her fetus would not survive. A woman who said she was turned away from two emergency rooms instead of being treated for a miscarriage is also part of the lawsuit.",
      "Prior to the reclassification, a prescription was still needed to obtain mifepristone and misoprostol in Louisiana. The new law reclassified the pills as \u201cSchedule IV drugs,\u201d putting them in the same category as the opioid tramadol and other substances that can be addictive.",
      "The new classification means that if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years.",
      "The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "The legislation is a first-of-its-kind law in the U.S. While GOP Gov. Jeff Landry, many Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion groups have touted the new classification, doctors have warned of deadly delays that the law could cause.",
      "Under the new classification, doctors say there are extra steps and more stringent storage requirements, which could slow access to the drugs in emergency situations. Beyond inducing abortions, the pills are also used to treat miscarriages, induce labor and stop hemorrhaging.",
      "Prior to the law, some doctors said that misoprostol would be stored in a box in the hospital room, on the delivery table or in a nurse's pocket. But under the new requirements of the classification, the drugs may be down the hall in a locked container or potentially in-house pharmacy at smaller hospitals.",

      "A thick layer of toxic smog is cloaking India\u2019s capital as smoke from firecrackers used to celebrate Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, pushes air pollution to hazardous levels",
      "NEW DELHI -- A thick layer of toxic smog cloaked India\u2019s capital on Friday as smoke from firecrackers used to celebrate Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, pushed air pollution to hazardous levels.",
      "New Delhi's air quality index plunged into the \u201csevere\u201d category, according to SAFAR, India\u2019s main environmental monitoring agency. In many areas, levels of deadly particulate matter reached seven times the World Health Organization's safety limit.",
      "Authorities in the capital have banned the use and sale of traditional firecrackers since 2017, asking people to opt for environmentally friendly ones or light shows instead, but the rule is often flouted.",
      "New Delhi, home to more than 33 million people, is regularly ranked one of the most polluted cities in the world.",
      "The air pollution crisis deepens particularly in the winter when the burning of crop residue in neighboring states coincides with cooler temperatures that trap deadly smoke. That smoke travels to New Delhi, leading to a surge in pollution and worsening the public health crisis.",
      "Emissions from industries without pollution controls and the use of coal, which produces most of the country\u2019s electricity, are also linked to poor air quality in urban areas.",
      "\u201cWe may not realize it now, but later we will face lung problems,\u201d said Manoj Kumar, a New Delhi resident who does his morning runs around the capital's iconic India Gate monument.",
      "Several studies have estimated that more than a million Indians die each year from air pollution-related diseases. Tiny particulate matter in polluted air can lodge deep in the lungs and cause a variety of major health problems."

      "QUETTA, Pakistan -- A powerful bomb attached to a motorcycle exploded near a vehicle carrying police officers assigned to protect polio workers in restive southwest Pakistan on Friday, killing nine people including five nearby children, and wounding 17 other people, officials said.",
      "Local police chief Fateh Mohammad said the attack occurred in Mastung, a district in Balochistan province. He said a motorized rickshaw carrying schoolchildren was nearby when the bombing happened, resulting in the deaths of five children, a police officer and two passersby.",
      "Some of the wounded were moved to a hospital in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, said Wasim Baig, a spokesman for the health department. He said seven people died on the spot, while two men who had been critically wounded died at a hospital.",
      "No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack on police, but suspicion is likely to fall on separatist groups and Pakistani Taliban that have stepped up attacks on security forces and civilians in recent months.",
      "The police chief in Mastung, Rehmat Ullah, said a police van came under attack when it was heading to a health center to escort polio workers for the door-to-door campaign that began on Monday to vaccinate 45 million children under 5, following a surge in new cases.",
      "Pakistan has recorded 41 polio cases across 71 districts so far this year.",
      "The latest attack came days after militants attacked a health center used in the ongoing anti-polio campaign in northwestern district of Orakzai, triggering a shootout that left two policemen dead. Three of the attackers were also killed in the exchange of fire.",
      "Militants in Pakistan often target police and health workers during campaigns against polio, claiming the vaccination drives are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped.",
      "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the chief minister of Balochistan, Sarfraz Bugti, both denounced the bombing and vowed to continue the war against insurgents until they are eliminated from the country.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the attack, calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d and urging the government to investigate and ensure those responsible are brought to justice and held accountable, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.",
      "Balochistan is the site of a long-running insurgency, with an array of separatist groups staging attacks mainly on security forces. The groups, including the Baloch Liberation Army, demand independence from the central government.",
      "The BLA has also attacked foreigners. Last month, it claimed responsibility for a bombing that targeted Chinese nationals outside an airport in the southern city of Karachi, killing two workers from China and wounding eight people.",
      "Thousands of Chinese workers are in Pakistan as part of Beijing\u2019s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which is building major infrastructure projects.",
      "Beijing has frequently demanded better security for its nationals in Pakistan.",
      "China's ambassador to Pakistan, Jiang Zaidong, urged Pakistan at a seminar this week to take action against the insurgents responsible for \u201cunacceptable\u201d attacks on Chinese working on projects related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a sprawling package that includes road construction, power plants and agriculture.",
      "Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch on Thursday expressed her surprise over the ambassador's remarks, saying that Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who also attended the seminar, had said \u201cPakistan is committed to providing full security to Chinese nationals, projects and institutions in Pakistan. Our commitment has been conveyed at the senior most levels of the Chinese government.\u201d",
      "She said Jiang's statement was \u201cperplexing in view of the positive diplomatic traditions.\u201d",
      "One Pakistani hotel chain, Avari, said the government has instructed that transportation and airport transfers for Chinese guests must be arranged by the host or sponsor \u201cvia a bomb/bullet-proof vehicle\u201d with security protocols.",

      "JACKSON, Miss. -- Mississippi's Republican legislative leaders said Thursday that they plan to push for Medicaid expansion to cover working people who earn too little to afford private insurance \u2014 a position that business groups have advocated but that Republican Gov. Tate Reeves opposes.",
      "House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann spoke about their 2025 policy priorities to hundreds of business people and community leaders at Hobnob, a social gathering hosted by Mississippi Economic Council, the state chamber of commerce.",
      "Medicaid expansion is an option under the health overhaul that then-President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the U.S., and it\u2019s one of 10 states that have not expanded the program. The vast majority of funding for the expansion would come from the federal government, but the state would have to cover some costs.",
      "Reeves, though, refers to Medicaid as \u201cwelfare\u201d and has frequently said he does not want more people to enroll. The governor usually speaks at Hobnob, which is held at the Mississippi Coliseum on the state fairgrounds. But he did not appear at the event this year.",
      "MEC and two other business groups \u2014 the Mississippi Manufacturers Association and the Business and Industry Political Education Committee \u2014 released a joint statement in April when legislative leaders were negotiating over the possibility of Medicaid expansion. The groups said expanding access to health care would lead to \u201ca healthier population, a healthier workforce, and an improved quality of life, all of which contribute to stronger Mississippi communities.\u201d",
      "The three groups said they trust elected officials and state agencies \u201cto use federal dollars responsibly.\u201d",
      "Reeves is in his second term as governor after two terms as lieutenant governor.",
      "Hosemann said Thursday that Medicaid expansion could help about 75,000 working people who can\u2019t afford insurance, and he noted: \u201cThere\u2019s a governor that doesn\u2019t necessarily agree with some of our proposals.\"",
      "White said he has heard politicians say elected officials should run the state like a business.",
      "\u201cProviding affordable access to health care for low-income workers is a smart investment in our workforce, and it is exactly the business-minded approach that all of you would take in your own individual businesses,\u201d White said.",

      "Hosemann said the Senate will propose a reduction in the grocery tax. He did not list a phase-out of the income tax or a school choice plan among his policy priorities.

      "Some people who took a new schizophrenia drug for one year improved with only a few side effects, but many dropped out of the research",
      "Some people who took a new schizophrenia drug for a year improved with only a few side effects, but many dropped out of the research, the company announced Thursday.",
      "The results underscore the difficulties in treating schizophrenia, a severe mental illness that can cause people to hear voices, feel paranoid and withdraw from others. High dropout rates are typical in schizophrenia drug studies.",
      "Finding a drug that works can be a long ordeal punctuated by crises and hospitalizations. Side effects of existing medications \u2014 weight gain, tremors, restlessness \u2014 cause some people to stop taking medicine and relapse.",
      "There's been great hope among doctors for Cobenfy, which was approved in September, because it acts in the brain differently than other schizophrenia drugs. Instead of blocking dopamine receptors, Cobenfy\u2019s main ingredient, xanomeline, works on a different receptor that indirectly blocks dopamine release.",
      "Cobenfy also contains trospium, which blocks some of the side effects. The most common are nausea, vomiting and indigestion. In contrast to the weight gain seen with other schizophrenia drugs, people lost a few pounds while taking Cobenfy, made by Bristol Myers Squibb.",
      "Dr. John Krystal of Yale University has led research on other schizophrenia drugs but was not involved in the new studies. He noted that just 10% to 20% of participants in the new studies dropped out because of side effects.",
      "\u201cThat is pretty good,\u201d he said, noting that fewer or milder side effects could mean people will stay in treatment longer. That could mean fewer problems associated with untreated mental illness: substance use, homelessness and unemployment.",
      "So why did some patients stick with treatment while others dropped out? Krystal said it will be important to understand more about that as doctors start prescribing the drug.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved Cobenfy on the strength of two encouraging company-sponsored five-week trials and other safety data. The latest results announced Thursday at the Psych Congress meeting in Boston come from two longer studies, providing a fuller picture.",
      "In one study, focused on severely ill patients, 78% dropped out, leaving only 35 people for the final analysis. In the other, focused on more stable people, 51% left the study, leaving 283 who took the drug for a year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not any higher or any lower than what we typically see\u201d in schizophrenia studies, said Dr. Greg Mattingly of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Mattingly is a consultant for Bristol Myers Squibb and a researcher on one of the studies.",
      "In the more severely ill group, 69% of people had a meaningful improvement in their symptoms at the end of the year. In the other group, 30% saw a meaningful benefit.",
      "Results of interviews with a sample of study participants conducted by an independent research team and shared by Bristol Myers Squibb showed the likelihood of continuing treatment. After six months, 36 said they would continue taking Cobenfy after the trial if given the option; 10 said they would not. Some participants said the drug reduced the voices while others said it didn't work for them.",
      "The estimated yearly cost for Cobenfy is $22,500 compared to $540 for a generic antipsychotic. Krystal and others worry that insurers will require people to try cheaper drugs first before covering Cobenfy. Most patients\u2019 out-of-pocket costs will be much lower, depending on insurance and other factors.",
      "One cheaper generic called clozapine is widely considered one of the best treatments for schizophrenia, Krystal said. It is underused in the U.S. compared to some other countries because of a cumbersome blood testing program.",
      "The FDA started the blood tests to watch for the risk of severe neutropenia, a rare side effect which can be fatal. But doctors and families have told the FDA that patients have relapsed when their clozapine was withheld or delayed because of the testing requirements.",
      "Sally Littlefield, 29, of Alameda, California, said what works for her is a monthly injection of a long-acting antipsychotic medication. Littlefield, who has schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, wants to learn more about the experiences of people who've taken Cobenfy and not just from players with a financial stake.",
      "Mindy Greiling of Roseville, Minnesota, wants to see data on how Cobenfy compares to clozapine, which works for her 47-year-old son, Jim. Weight gain was a problem for him, but since taking diabetes medication, he\u2019s back to his normal weight, Greiling said.",
      "Cobenfy \u201cis getting a lot of ballyhoo, as any new drug does,\u201d Greiling said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a nonstarter for me unless it turns out that it\u2019s better than clozapine.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- The British government has apologized for the death of a 9-year-old girl who is believed to be the first person in the U.K. to have air pollution listed on her death certificate, after a decade-long battle that highlighted the risks vehicle emissions pose to children in low-income communities.",
      "The apology was part of a settlement announced Thursday in a lawsuit filed by the mother of Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who developed severe asthma just before her 7th birthday and suffered severe seizures before she died on Feb. 15, 2013. The government also made an undisclosed financial settlement.",
      "\u201cAlthough this isn\u2019t going to bring Ella back, we finally accept this is acknowledgement of what happened to her, and to put the issue of air pollution firmly on the map, that it\u2019s a public health crisis \u2026 and something needs to be done about it,\u2019\u2019 Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, Ella\u2019s mother, said after meeting with government officials. \u201cToday it is finally over, but I am going to continue, and I have been reassured by the government that they\u2019re going to be continuing to work with me to clean up the air.\u201d",
      "Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah fought to reopen the coroner\u2019s inquest into Ella\u2019s death after the so-called Dieselgate scandal revealed how Volkswagen obscured the true level of emissions released by its diesel-powered vehicles. Research by the Royal College of Physicians later showed that about 40,000 deaths can be attributed to outdoor air pollution each year in the U.K., with the burden falling most heavily on low-income communities close to busy roads and other major sources of emissions.",
      "Ella grew up just 25 meters (yards) from the South Circular Road, a major conduit for traffic along the southern edge of central London.",
      "Britain\u2019s High Court in May 2019 set aside the findings of the original inquest, which attributed Ella\u2019s death to asthma.",
      "In December 2020, a second inquest found that air pollution was a contributing factor in Ella\u2019s death, along with acute respiratory failure and severe asthma.",
      "Throughout her illness, Ella was exposed to levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter that exceeded World Health Organization guidelines, Deputy Coroner Philip Barlow ruled. There was also a \u201crecognized failure\u201d to bring nitrogen dioxide levels within the limits set by European Union and domestic law.",
      "\u201cElla\u2019s mother was not given information by health professionals about the health risks of air pollution and its potential to exacerbate asthma,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cIf she had been given this information, she would have taken steps which might have prevented Ella\u2019s death.\u201d",
      "The child's estate, which is administered by her mother, sued the Environment Department, the Department for Transport and the Department of Health and Social Care for compensation over Ella\u2019s illness and premature death.",
      "The government on Thursday described Ella\u2019s death as a \u201ctragedy,\u201d and said her mother\u2019s public campaign for better air quality had \u201cmade a considerable impact.\u201d",

      "RWAMWANJA, Uganda -- For months, Agnes Bulaba, a Congolese refugee in Uganda, has had to get by without the food rations she once depended on. Her children scavenge among local communities for whatever they can find to eat.",
      "\u201cAs a woman who\u2019s not married, life is hard,\u201d Bulaba told The Associated Press. Some locals \u201ckeep throwing stones at us, but we just want to feed our kids and buy them some clothes,\u201d said the mother of six, who often works as a prostitute to fend for her family.",
      "Uganda is home to more than 1.7 million refugees, the largest refugee-hosting country in Africa, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Despite being renowned for welcoming those fleeing neighboring violence, Ugandan officials and humanitarians say dwindling international support coupled with high numbers of refugees have put much pressure on host communities.",
      "Approximately 10,000 new arrivals enter Uganda each month, according to U.N. figures. Some have recently fled the war in Sudan, but most are from neighboring South Sudan and Congo.",
      "Bulaba is among tens of thousands in Rwamwanja, a refugee settlement in southwestern Uganda. As in other settlements across the east African country, refugees there are given small plots of land to cultivate as they are slowly weaned off total dependence on humanitarian food rations.",
      "Since 2021, as funding consistently declined, the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program has prioritized the most vulnerable groups for food assistance, in food items or cash, which can be as little as $3. After spending three months in Uganda, refugees are eligible to get 60% rations, and the number falls by half after six months. Only new arrivals get 100% food assistance, leaving the vast majority of some 99,000 refugees in Bulaba's settlement vulnerable to hunger and other impoverishment.",
      "In 2017, the Ugandan government and the U.N. held a summit in Kampala, the capital, and appealed for $8 billion to deal with the sharp influx of refugees from South Sudan at the time. Only $350 million was pledged.",
      "Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, visited Uganda last week in a trip partly aimed to underscore the funding shortage.",
      "The international community \u201cshould not take Uganda\u2019s generosity and the global public good it provides for granted,\u201d Grandi said in a statement at the end of his visit. \u201cServices here are overstretched. Natural resources are limited, and financial support is not keeping pace with the needs.\u201d",
      "He also said international support \"is urgently needed to sustain Uganda\u2019s commitment to refugees,\u201d urging donors and humanitarian partners to \u201ccome together with the government to address the needs of refugees and the generous communities hosting them.\u201d",
      "Refugees in Uganda have access to the same hospitals as locals, and their children can attend school. While this helps integrate them into the Ugandan community, sometimes the competition for limited resources sparks tension. However, violence is rarely reported.",
      "Hillary Onek, the Ugandan government minister in charge of refugees, said during Grandi\u2019s visit that local officials need support to help refugees become more self-reliant. Though he said the country was \u201coverloaded\u201d with refugees, he cited several training options to help refugees become self-sufficient, including carpentry, bricklaying and metal welding.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to be innovative,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the fact that funding for refugee programs dwindled over the years, there is not enough money to meet their demands, not even giving them enough food to eat.\u201d",
      "Onek said the alternative is \u201cto survive on your own, using your skills, using whatever capacity you have.\u201d",
      "But Bulaba, the Congolese refugee who has been in Uganda since 2014 after fleeing violence in her home country with her two children, said she can't find a job. She has since had four other children who often go barefoot and without appropriate clothing. She misses the cash-for-food stipend she used to get.",

      "\u201cOur request of the board is that we would be able to carry and offer those (vaccines), recognizing that we always have these discussions of risks and benefits,\u201d Dr. Perry Jansen said at the meeting. \u201cThis is not a blind, everybody-gets-a-shot approach. This is a thoughtful approach.\u201d",
      "Opposite Jansen's plea were more than 290 public comments, many of which called for an end to vaccine mandates or taxpayer funding of the vaccines, neither of which are happening in the district. At the meeting, many people who spoke are nationally known for making the rounds to testify against COVID vaccines, including Dr. Peter McCullough, a Texas cardiologist who sells \u201ccontagion emergency kits\u201d that include ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine \u2014 drugs that have not been approved to treat COVID-19 and can have dangerous side effects.",
      "Board Chairman Kelly Aberasturi was familiar with many of the voices who wanted the ban, especially from earlier local protests of pandemic measures.",
      "Aberasturi, who told The Associated Press that he's skeptical of COVID-19 vaccines and national public health leaders, said in the meeting and in an interview with the AP that he was supportive of but \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the board's decision.",
      "He said the board had overstepped the relationship between patients and their doctors \u2014 and possibly opened a door to blocking other vaccines or treatments.",
      "Board members in favor of the decision argued people can get vaccinated elsewhere, and that providing the shots was equivalent to signing off on their safety. (Some people may be reluctant to get vaccinated or boosted because of misinformation about the shots despite evidence that they\u2019re safe and have saved millions of lives.)",
      "The people getting vaccinated at the health department \u2014 including people without housing, people who are homebound and those in long-term care facilities or in the immigration process \u2014 had no other options, Jansen and Aberasturi said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been homeless in my lifetime, so I understand how difficult it can be when you\u2019re ... trying to get by and get ahead,\u201d Aberasturi said. \u201cThis is where we should be stepping in and helping.",
      "\"But we have some board members who have never been there, so they don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like.\u201d",
      "State health officials have said that they \u201crecommend that people consider the COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d Idaho health department spokesperson AJ McWhorter declined to comment on \u201cpublic health district business,\u201d but noted that COVID-19 vaccines are still available at community health centers for people who are uninsured.",
      "Aberasturi said he plans to ask at the next board meeting if the health department can at least be allowed to vaccinate older patients and residents of long-term care facilities, adding that the board is supposed to be caring for the \u201chealth and well-being\u201d of the district's residents. \"But I believe the way we went about this thing is we didn't do that due diligence.\u201d",

      "Americans can start signing up Friday for health care coverage offered through the Affordable Care Act marketplace for 2025",
      "WASHINGTON -- Americans can start signing up Friday for health care coverage offered through the Affordable Care Act marketplace for 2025, days before a presidential election that could threaten eligibility and raise costs for millions of those in the program.",
      "The future of \u2018Obamacare\u2019 has emerged as a key issue in the closing days of the presidential campaign, with a top GOP leader promising this week to overhaul the program should Republican Donald Trump win the presidency.",
      "Billions of dollars in tax credits are also at stake. Established during the COVID-19 pandemic, the money has expanded eligibility for millions of Americans, made health insurance coverage more affordable for many and dramatically boosted enrollment.",
      "Nearly all of the 21 million people in the program have benefited from those subsidies, which expire next year, the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cAmericans can actually look at health care not as a privilege, but now as a right,\u201d said Becerra, who is going to the political swing state of Arizona on Friday to mark the beginning of open enrollment. \u201cI don't think anyone wants to have a right yanked away from them to have affordable health insurance coverage.\u201d",
      "But significant changes to the program are almost certain if Trump wins the White House and Republicans take control of Congress in Tuesday's contentious elections. They are threatening to scale back \u201cObamacare,\u201d a signature achievement of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat.",
      "On Monday, a key Trump ally, House Speaker Mike Johnson, declared \u201cNo Obamacare\u201d during a Pennsylvania campaign stop, promising \u201cmassive reform\u201d under a Trump presidency with a Republican-controlled Congress.",
      "\u201cHealth care reform\u2019s going to be a big part of the agenda,\u201d Johnson said in a video first obtained by NBC News.",
      "Johnson\u2019s office later issued a statement saying that he had no plans to completely repeal the landmark legislation, but the comments still underscored how Johnson is working closely with Trump to potentially remake the federal government and its social programs if Republicans sweep into power.",
      "Trump has only said that he has \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d to change the Affordable Care Act, which he was unable to successfully scuttle altogether during his previous term in office. In recent months, Republicans have raised concerns about spending and fraud.",
      "Enrollment under the Biden administration surged, after years of declines during the Trump administration, dropping to a low of 11 million on Trump's watch. But taxpayers have had to pour billions of dollars more into the Affordable Care Act to achieve that increase. That money has helped pay for subsidies to cut premiums by nearly half for many of those enrolled in the program.",
      "Congress would need to pass a new law to continue offering those subsidies, which could cost as much as $335 billion over the next decade. Some Republicans have already balked at that figure.",
      "Democrats have cautioned voters that Republicans will try to revive an attempt to kill the Affordable Care Act altogether, with the warnings growing more dire as Election Day nears.",
      "In Wisconsin, Vice President Kamala Harris issued the warning again, telling reporters that Johnson's remarks prove Republicans plan to gut the health care coverage. \u201c It has been a part of Donald Trump\u2019s agenda for a very long time,\" Harris said. \u201cHe has made dozens of attempts to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And now we have further validation of that agenda from his supporter, the speaker of the House.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration has expanded the program in other ways that Harris is likely to continue, but Trump is sure to pull back on. For example, the administration poured more money into hiring health insurance navigators who help enroll people into coverage.",
      "The White House also implemented a new rule that expands eligibility for the program to immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. About 100,000 of those immigrants, also called \u201cDreamers\u201d are expected to sign up for the coverage for the first time during enrollment this year.",
      "Republican attorneys general in 15 states have sued to block their enrollment.",
      "Open enrollment for the coverage ends on Jan. 15, but to have coverage in the new year you must enroll by Dec. 15.",

      "Florida is the behemoth in this year\u2019s abortion ballot-measure campaigns.",
      "Proponents of the measure have raised more than $75 million and opponents $10 million. Combined, that's nearly half the national total.",
      "The state Republican Party is using additional funds, including from corporations across the country, to urge voters to reject the measure. Including that, supporters still lead in ad-buying: $60 million to $27 million.",

      "The amendment would overturn a ban on most abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 when women often don't know they're pregnant \u2014 that was signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and took effect in May. DeSantis' administration has taken steps to thwart the campaign for the amendment.",

      "According to an Associated Press analysis of state campaign disclosures, they've raised about $2 million compared with abortion-rights supporters\u2019 $1 million.",
      "There was a big change last week when the abortion-rights group Dakotans for Health reported that it had received $540,000 from Think Big America, a fund launched by Illinois Gov. Jay Pritzker, a Democrat. The fund's director, Mike Ollen, said that's helping ads get seen more widely in what could be a close race.",
      "Before that, national abortion-rights groups, including the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, had mostly ignored South Dakota because, they said, the ballot measure doesn't go far enough. It would allow regulations of abortions after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy if they relate to the health of the woman.",
      "\u201cWe find ourselves being caught between being way too extreme on the right end of the spectrum and not extreme enough on the left end of the spectrum,\u201d said Rick Weiland, co-founder of Dakotans for Health. \u201cWe think we're right in the middle.\u201d",

      "The side pushing to keep restrictions is leading the fundraising race, with at least $9.8 million. One prominent family has supplied more than half of that. Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts has contributed more than $1 million, and his mother, Marlene Ricketts, has chipped in $4 million.",
      "The campaign for more access has raised at least $6.4 million.",
      "In most places, abortion-rights supporters have a big fundraising lead.",

      "Meanwhile, the groups promoting the questions in those states have all collected at least $5 million.",
      "The ballot questions have different circumstances.",
      "Missouri's amendment would open the door to blocking the state's current ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Proponents of the measure have raised more than $30 million to opponents' $1.5 million.",
      "In Arizona, passing the abortion amendment would roll back a ban after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy and instead allow it until fetal viability, and later in some cases. The state's Supreme Court ruled this year that an 1864 ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy could be enforced, but the Legislature promptly repealed it.",
      "Colorado is one of the few states that already has no gestational limits on when during pregnancy abortion can be obtained. Montana allows abortion until viability.",

      "Fundraising has been low on both sides in Maryland, though Pritzker's fund says it's sending money there, and New York, where a ballot measure doesn't mention abortion specifically but would bar discrimination based on \"pregnancy outcomes and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\"",

      "The Concord Fund, part of a network of political groups centered around conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, didn't show up in campaign finance reports until Wednesday, when a Missouri filing showed the group gave $1 million the day before to a group opposing the ballot measure there. Leo was a driving force in securing nominations of Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe.",
      "Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America has not been active on abortion ballot measures this year, but it is pumping money into the presidential race in support of Republican Donald Trump.",

      "A New York City judge has ruled that a law the city has relied on to padlock suspected unlicensed marijuana shops is unconstitutional",
      "A law that New York City has relied on to padlock scores of suspected unlicensed marijuana shops is unconstitutional because it violates the rights of store owners, a judge ruled Tuesday.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams' administration moved immediately to appeal, saying the city had successfully shut down more than 1,200 illegal shops in a crackdown on the thousands of stores that opened without a license after the state legalized recreational use of the drug.",
      "The ruling was made in the case of a Queens business padlocked in September following an inspection by the sheriff's office that found suspected cannabis and cannabis products for sale without a license.",
      "New powers passed in the state budget earlier this year gave local authorities the ability to inspect and immediately shut down suspected illegal stores while administrative hearings play out. But the final decision remains with the sheriff\u2019s office, meaning it can keep a store closed even if a hearing officer recommends otherwise.",
      "That's what happened in the Queens case \u2014 and in many others, attorneys for the businesses say, leading Judge Kevin Kerrigan in his ruling Tuesday to characterize the administrative hearings as \u201cuseless, or even a potential farce.\u201d",
      "\u201cIndeed, if the final arbiter has the authority to confer no weight to the hearing, there is no real meaningful \u2018opportunity to be heard,\u2019 which vastly increases the risk of erroneous deprivation and raises a due process concern,\" he wrote.",
      "Adams' spokesperson, Liz Garcia, said the city's law department had filed a notice of appeal.",
      "\u201cIllegal smoke shops and their dangerous products endanger young New Yorkers and our quality of life, and we continue to padlock illicit storefronts and protect communities from the health and safety dangers posed by illegal operators,\" she said in an emailed statement.",
      "Attorney Lance Lazzaro predicted the ruling would allow every store that has been shut down to reopen and sue for damages, including for lost business and reputational harm.",
      "\u201cThe damages will be astronomical,\u201d said Lazzaro, who represents the Queens store, Cloud Corner.",
      "\u201cThe City of New York should be ashamed for allowing this process to happen in the first place,\u201d he said via email.",
      "At an administrative hearing following its closure, Cloud Corner's owner argued that the store was closed when the sheriff entered to conduct the inspection, so no cannabis products were being sold. The hearing officer agreed but despite his dismissal of the summons, the sheriff's office opted to keep the closure order in place for one year."

    "story": [
      "People prone to seasonal depression are bracing themselves as winter approaches",
      "As winter approaches and daylight hours grow shorter, people prone to seasonal depression can feel it in their bodies and brains.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a feeling of panic, fear, anxiety and dread all in one,\u201d said Germaine Pataki, 63, of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.",
      "She\u2019s among the millions of people estimated to have seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. Her coping strategies include yoga, walking and an antidepressant medication. She\u2019s also part of a Facebook group for people with SAD.",
      "\u201cI try to focus on helping others through it,\u201d Pataki said. \u201cThis gives me purpose.\u201d",
      "People with SAD typically have episodes of depression that begin in the fall and ease in the spring or summer. Changing the clocks back to standard time, which happens this weekend, can be a trigger for SAD. A milder form, subsyndromal SAD, is recognized by medical experts, and there\u2019s also a summer variety of seasonal depression, though less is known about it.",
      "In 1984, a team led by Dr. Norman Rosenthal, then a researcher at the National Institutes of Health, first described SAD and coined the term. \u201cI believe that because it is easy to remember, the acronym has stuck,\" he said.",
      "Scientists are learning how specialized cells in our eyes turn the blue wavelength part of the light spectrum into neural signals affecting mood and alertness.",
      "Sunlight is loaded with the blue light, so when the cells absorb it, our brains\u2019 alertness centers are activated and we feel more wakeful and possibly even happier.",
      "Researcher Kathryn Roecklein at the University of Pittsburgh tested people with and without SAD to see how their eyes reacted to blue light. As a group, people with SAD were less sensitive to blue light than others, especially during winter months. That suggests a cause for wintertime depression.",
      "\u201cIn the winter, when the light levels drop, that combined with a lower sensitivity, might be too low for healthy functioning, leading to depression,\u201d Roecklein said.",
      "Miriam Cherry, 50, of Larchmont, New York, said she spent the summer planning how she would deal with her winter depression. \u201cIt\u2019s like clockwork,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cThe sunlight is low. The day ends at 4:45, and suddenly my mood is horrible.\u201d",
      "Many people with SAD respond to light therapy, said Dr. Paul Desan of Yale University\u2019s Winter Depression Research Clinic.",
      "\u201cThe first thing to try is light,\u201d Desan said. \u201cWhen we get patients on exposure to bright light for a half an hour or so every morning, the majority of patients get dramatically better. We don\u2019t even need medications.\u201d",
      "The therapy involves devices that emit light about 20 times brighter than regular indoor light.",
      "Research supports using a light that\u2019s about 10,000 lux, a measure of brightness. You need to use it for 30 minutes every morning, according to the research. Desan said this can help not only people with SAD but also those with less-severe winter blahs.",
      "Special lights run from $70 to $400. Some products marketed for SAD are too dim to do much good, Desan said.",
      "Yale has tested products and offers a list of recommendations, and the nonprofit Center for Environmental Therapeutics has a consumer guide to selecting a light.",
      "If your doctor diagnosed you with SAD, check with your insurance company to see if the cost of a light might be covered, Desan suggested.",
      "Antidepressant medications are a first-line treatment for SAD, along with light therapy. Doctors also recommend keeping a regular sleep schedule and walking outside, even on cloudy days.",
      "Light therapy\u2019s benefits can fade when people stop using it. One type of talk therapy \u2014 cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT \u2014 has been shown in studies to have more durable effects, University of Vermont researcher Kelly Rohan said.",
      "CBT involves working with a therapist to identify and modify unhelpful thoughts.",
      "\u201cA very common thought that people have is \u2018I hate winter,'\" Rohan said. \u201cReframe that into something as simple is \u2018I prefer summer to winter,'\" she suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s a factual statement, but it has a neutral effect on mood.\u201d",
      "Working with a therapist can help people take small steps toward having fun again, Rohan said. Try planning undemanding but enjoyable activities to break out of hibernation mode, which \"could be as simple as meeting a friend for coffee,\u201d Rohan said.",
      "People with SAD have half the year to create coping strategies, and some have found hacks that work for them \u2014 though there may be scant scientific support.",
      "Elizabeth Wescott, 69, of Folsom, California, believes contrast showers help her. It\u2019s a water therapy borrowed from sports medicine that involves alternating hot and cold water while taking a shower. She also uses a light box and takes an antidepressant.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always looking for new tools,\u201d Wescott said.",
      "Cherry in New York is devoting a corner of her garden to the earliest blooming flowers: snowdrops, winter aconite and hellebores. These bloom as early as February.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a sign to me that this isn\u2019t going to last forever,\" Cherry said. \"It will get better, and spring is on its way.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Shares were mixed in Asia early Tuesday after U.S. stock indexes drifted lower a day ahead of the U.S. presidential election.",
      "This week will bring various potential flashpoints, among them Election Day in the United States. But the results may not be known for some time as officials count all the votes, and that could bring sharp swings since markets hate uncertainty.",
      "U.S. futures were virtually unchanged early Tuesday.",
      "Adding to the potential for volatility, the Federal Reserve will also be meeting on interest rates later this week. The widespread expectation is for it to cut its main interest rate for a second straight time.",
      "Investors also hope the Chinese government may announce stimulus for the world\u2019s second-largest economy.",
      "Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.3% to 38,552.67, reopening after a holiday on Monday.",
      "South Korea's Kospi fell 0.7% to 2,569.75, while the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia dropped 0.6% to 8,117.30.",
      "The Standing Committee of China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress is meeting this week, and analysts say the government may endorse major spending initiatives to boost economic growth amid troubles for the country\u2019s real-estate industry.",
      "The official Xinhua News Agency reported that the lawmakers had reviewed legislation to raise ceilings on local government debt to replace existing hidden debts, part of a process to arrange debt swaps to help resolve the financial woes brought on by the pandemic and by a collapse in the property market in recent years.",
      "Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 0.1% at 20,597.30 and the Shanghai Composite index picked up 0.4% to 3,323.26.",
      "On Monday, the S&P 500 slipped 0.3% to 5,712.69, remaining near its record  set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6% to 41,794.60, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3% to 18,179.98.",

Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway  dropped 2.2% and was one of the heaviest weights on the market after reporting a drop in operating profit for the latest quarter.",
      "But the majority of stocks within the S&P 500 rose, including a 2.8% gain for Fox after it reported a stronger profit than expected.",
      "The hope that\u2019s propelled U.S. stock indexes to records recently is that the U.S. economy can remain resilient and avoid a long-feared recession, in part because of the coming cuts to rates expected from the Fed.",
      "The broad U.S. stock market has historically risen regardless of which party wins  the White House. And in 2020, U.S. stocks climbed immediately after Election Day and kept going even after former President Donald Trump refused to concede  and challenged the results, creating plenty of uncertainty. A large part of that rally was due to excitement about the potential for a vaccine for COVID-19, which had just shut down the global economy.",
      "A Trump victory would be less of a surprise to markets this time around than in 2016, when Treasury yields soared on expectations for tax cuts that could further inflate the nation\u2019s debt or fuel a stronger U.S economy. Treasury yields have already climbed in recent weeks, in part due to rising expectations among some for a Trump win.",
      "On Monday, Treasury yields gave back a chunk of those gains. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.29% from 4.38% late Friday.",
      "Another investment that\u2019s become a barometer in the market for Trump\u2019s perceived chances of victory swung sharply through the day. After veering between losses and gains through the morning, Trump Media & Technology Group  ended up rising 12.4%.",
      "In the oil market early Tuesday, the price for a barrel of U.S. crude fell 7 cents to $71.40. On Monday, it rose 2.8% after Saudi Arabia and other oil producers said they would delay plans  to increase the amount of crude they produced.",
      "Brent crude, the international standard, added 12 cents to $75.20. It rose 2.7% a barrel on Monday. The price of Brent is still down for the year so far, in part because of worries about how much demand will come from China given its economic challenges.",
      "In currency dealings, the dollar rose to 152.33 Japanese yen from 152.10 yen. The euro fell to $1.0876 from $1.0880.",

      "State police have destroyed tens of thousands of pounds of marijuana plants at greenhouses in northwestern New Mexico",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- State police have destroyed tens of thousands of pounds of marijuana plants at greenhouses in northwestern New Mexico, marking what regulators say is the largest seizure and destruction of cannabis in New Mexico since new possession and cultivation laws took effect in 2021.",
      "Authorities announced the operation Monday, saying dozens of agents were assigned to eradicate the plants in October. The state Cannabis Control Division had started the process of revoking the license of NNK Equity LLC, having filed a noncompliance order and a default order earlier this year.",
      "The company was accused of not posting its licenses on site, failing to obtain water rights for cultivation, not having cameras that could monitor certain areas of its operation and violating sanitation and health requirements.",
      "\u201cThe organization involved showed a blatant disregard for the laws of this state and we will prove that once this investigation is over,\u201d New Mexico State Police Chief Troy Weisler said in a statement.",
      "Jacob Candelaria, an Albuquerque attorney who represents NNK Equity, disputed the state's claims and accused regulators and state police of violating his client's civil rights. He said the state failed to properly serve notice of its intent to revoke the company's license and subsequently denied a request for a hearing on the merits of the case.",
      "He said clients Irving Lin and Bao Xue speak Mandarin Chinese and have limited ability to understand the written English language. Lin asked for a Chinese translation, but the attorney said regulators did not respond to his request.",
      "The Cannabis Control Division stated in filings related to the case that it complied with notice and hearing requirements and had afforded the company its due process rights.",
      "The company plans to ask a state district judge to set aside the order revoking the license and to order state regulators to hold a hearing, Candelaria said. He added that NNK Equity also plans to sue the state for destroying what he said amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars of private property.",
      "\u201cThe idea that law enforcement officers can destroy public property based upon a temporary restraining order \u2014 which can be entered without notice to all parties and before a hearing on the evidence \u2014 which was the case here, should concern all of us who believe in the Constitution.\u201d",
      "According to state regulators, NNK Equity was issued a license in December 2023 for a marijuana growing operation at a property in Waterflow, a rural area on the edge of the Navajo Nation and just south of the Colorado border. The region also made headlines earlier this year when state regulators cracked down on two other operations and Navajo Nation authorities ended up filing their own charges against two tribal members.",
      "In the latest case, the Cannabis Control Division conducted a compliance check in June and determined that NNK Equity had exceeded its allotted plant count. The New Mexico State Police Special Investigations Unit was brought in and later found plants at a second location that was not licensed.",
      "The violations outlined by state regulators also involve transportation and tracking requirements, which include assigning identifying numbers to each plant."

      "Cheers and sobs of relief broke out in a federal courtroom in Kansas as dozens of people whose life savings had been embezzled by a bank CEO learned federal law enforcement had recovered their money",
      "WICHITA, KANSAS -- Sobs of relief broke out in a federal courtroom in Kansas on Monday as dozens of people whose life savings had been embezzled by a bank CEO learned that federal law enforcement had recovered their money.",
      "\"I just can\u2019t describe the weight lifted off of us,\u201d said Bart Camilli, 70, who with his wife Cleo had just learned they\u2019d recover close to $450,000 \u2014 money Bart began saving at 18 when he bought his first individual retirement account. \u201cIt\u2019s life-changing.\u201d",
      "In August, former Kansas bank CEO Shan Hanes was sentenced to 24 years after stealing $47 million from customer accounts and wiring the money to cryptocurrency accounts run by scammers. Prosecutors said Hanes also stole $40,000 from his church, $10,000 from an investment club and $60,000 from his daughter\u2019s college fund and lost $1.1 million of his own in the scheme. Deposits were \u201cjettisoned into the ether,\u201d said prosecutor Aaron Smith.",
      "Hanes' Heartland Tri-State Bank, drained of cash, was shut down by federal regulators and sold to another financial institution. Customers\u2019 savings and checking accounts amounting to $47.1 million were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which paid off their losses.",
      "But there were still 30 shareholders of the community-owned rural bank Hanes helped found \u2014 including his close family friends and neighbors \u2014 who thought they lost $8.3 million in investments: well-planned retirements were upended, funds for long-term eldercare gone, education funds and bequests for children and grandchildren zeroed out.",
      "On Monday the shareholders stood to cheer federal Judge John W. Broomes in Wichita after he told them, one at a time, that they\u2019d be paid back in full. The FBI recovered the funds from a cryptocurrency account held by Tether Ltd. in the Cayman Islands.",
      "During an earlier sentencing hearing, these victims had called Hanes a \u201cdeceitful cheat and a liar,\u201d and \u201cpure evil.\u201d",
      "Margaret Grice came to court Monday figuring she\u2019d get $1,000 back. Instead, she learned she\u2019d be recovering almost $250,000, her entire 401(k).",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just really thrilled,\u201d she said. \u201cI can breathe.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said Hanes, who was the CEO of Heartland Tri-State Bank in Elkhart, Kansas, lost the money in a scam referred to as \u201cpig butchering,\u201d or the way pigs are fattened before slaughter. In the scam, a third party gains a victims' trust and, over time, convinces them to invest all of their money into cryptocurrency, which immediately disappears. U.S. and U.N. officials say these schemes are proliferating, with scammers largely in Southeast Asia increasingly taking advantage of Americans.",
      "Hanes started buying what he thought was $5,000 in cryptocurrency in late 2022, communicating with someone who had reached out on WhatsApp, according to court records. A few months later he transferred over his church and investment club funds. Records show the scam accelerated in the summer of 2023, when Hanes wired $47.1 million out of customer accounts in 11 wire transfers over just eight weeks. Each transfer, he thought, was necessary to end the investment and cash out, court records said. He watched, on a fake website, as the money appeared to grow to more than $200 million.",
      "\u201cHe was to take some of the money, and the rest of the money was supposed to go back to the bank,\u201d his attorney John Stang explained. \u201cNow it's fiction, it didn't exist. We all know that now ... It failed big time.\u201d",
      "Hanes, who was not in court Monday, apologized at an earlier sentencing hearing.",
      "\u201cFrom the deepest depth of my soul, I had no intention of ever causing the harm that I did,\" he said. \u201dI\u2019ll forever struggle to understand how I was duped and how what I thought was just getting the money back was making it worse.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Hanes wasn\u2019t just the victim of a scam, he crossed a line when he began taking customers' money and violating banking regulations. He pleaded guilty to embezzlement by a bank officer in May.",
      "His prominent standing in his hometown of 2,000 made it easier for him to get away with it, a Federal Reserve System investigation found; he had been on the school board, volunteered as a swim meet official, and served on the Kansas Bankers Association.",
      "He also was a banking leader beyond his rural community. In recent years, he testified to Congressional committees about the importance of local banks in farming communities, and he served as a director for the American Bankers Association, which represents almost all banking assets in the U.S.",
      "On Monday, prosecutors said the FDIC wanted to be paid back for the insurance claims it reimbursed to bank customers. But Judge Broomes said the economic circumstances of shareholders \u201cwho became insolvent because of a fraud scheme\u201d justified paying them back first, before the FDIC recovers anything.",
      "Hanes, 53, may be in his late 70s when he is released and is unlikely to be able to pay the FDIC the $47.1 million still owed.",
      "In a court filing, Hanes and his attorney tried to explain what had happened.",
      "\u201cMr. Hanes made some very bad choices after being caught up in an extremely well-run cryptocurrency scam,\u201d they said. \u201cHe was the pig that was butchered.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "U.S. auto safety regulators have ended an investigation into Ford engine failures after the company replaced engines or extended the warranty on some vehicles",
      "DETROIT -- The U.S. government's auto safety regulator has ended a 2 1/2-year investigation into Ford engine failures after the company replaced engines or extended the warranty on some vehicles.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says in documents posted Monday on its website that its analysis traced the problem to intake valves that can fracture inside some 2.7-liter and 3-liter turbocharged engines.",
      "Documents say the probe opened in May of 2022 ended up covering more than 411,000 vehicles from the 2021 and 2022 model years including the Ford F-150 Bronco, Edge and Explorer as well as the Lincoln Aviator and Nautilus.",
      "The agency was looking into catastrophic engine failures caused by intake valves fracturing, dropping into the cylinder and hitting the piston.",
      "The documents say a forensic analysis of fractured valves found that when the they were made by a parts supplier, the temperature got too high, making them brittle and likely to fracture during normal engine use.",
      "An analysis of failure report data found that the faulty valves were made from May through October of 2021, the agency said. Ford contended that not all valves produced during this period were faulty and that a vast majority of the failures happened before the vehicles were driven 20,000 miles.",
      "An agency statistical analysis to predict the number of failures, and an analysis of failure reports \u201care generally consistent\u201d with Ford's determination that the valves would fail at low mileage, and the majority of vehicles with the faulty valves \u201chave already experienced a failure,\u201d the agency said.",
      "Earlier this year Ford recalled about 91,000 vehicles with valves made during the suspect period. They'll be tested and get a new engine if necessary. The company also extended the warranty on vehicles with valves made during the period to 10 years or 150,000 miles, the documents said.",
      "During the investigation, the agency said it found 396 customer complaints, 825 warranty claims and 936 engine replacements. There were no reported crashes or injuries."

    "title": "Many retailers offer 'returnless refunds.' Just don't expect them to talk about it",
    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 13:38:19 -0500",
    "summary": "It&rsquo;s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too",
      "It\u2019s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too.",
      "Returnless refunds are a tool that more retailers are using to keep online shoppers happy and to reduce shipping fees, processing time and other ballooning costs from returned products.",
      "Companies such as Amazon, Walmart and Target have decided some items are not worth the cost or hassle of getting back. Think a $20 T-shirt that might cost $30 in shipping and handling to recover. There are also single-use items, such as a package of plastic straws, that might be difficult to resell or medicines that could be unsafe to market again.",
      "Analysts say the companies offering returnless refunds do it somewhat sporadically, typically reserving the option for low-cost objects or ones with limited resale value. But some online shoppers said they've also been allowed to keep more pricey products.",
      "Dalya Harel, 48, received a return-free refund recently after ordering a desk from Amazon that cost roughly $300. When the desk arrived, she noticed it was missing some key pieces and would be impossible to put together, Harel said. She couldn't request a replacement and have it within a reasonable time for the office of her New York lice detection removal service because the item was out of stock.",
      "Harel, who routinely buys towels and other products from Amazon for her business, said her team reached out to the company's customer service line. She was pleasantly surprised to hear she would get a refund without having to send back the desk.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one less headache to deal with,\u201d Harel said. \u201cIt was really nice for us to not have to make an extra trip up to the post office.\u201d",
      "She used the desk pieces to create makeshift shelves in her office in Brooklyn.",
      "While the retail practice of letting customers keep merchandise and get their money back is not exactly a trade secret, the way it works is shrouded in mystery. Companies are not keen to publicize the circumstances in which they issue returnless refunds due to concerns over the potential for return fraud.",
      "Even if brands don't provide details about such policies on their websites, returnless refunds are expanding in at least some retail corners.",
      "Amazon, which industry experts say has engaged in the practice for years, announced in August that it would extend the option to the third-party sellers who drive most of the sales on the e-commerce giant's platform. Under the program, sellers who use the company\u2019s fulfillment services in the U.S. could choose to offer customers a traditional refund for purchases under $75 along with no obligation to return what they ordered.",
      "Amazon did not immediately respond to questions about how the program works. But publicly, it has pitched returnless refunds more directly to international sellers and those who offer cheaper goods. Items sold in an upcoming section of Amazon's website, which will allow U.S. shoppers to buy low-cost goods shipped directly from China, will also be eligible for returnless refunds, according to documents seen by The Associated Press.",
      "In January, Walmart gave a similar option to merchants who sell products on its growing online marketplace, leaving it up to sellers to set price limits and determine if or how they want to participate.",
      "China-founded e-commerce companies Shein and Temu say they also offer returnless refunds on a small number of orders, as does Target, the online shopping site Overstock and pet products e-tailer Chewy, which some customer said had encouraged them to donate unwanted items to local animal shelters.",
      "Wayfair, another online retailer cited by some customers as offering returnless refunds, did not reply to a request for comment on its policies.",
      "Overall, retailers and brands tend to be careful about how often they let customers keep items for free. Many of them are deploying algorithms to determine who should be given the option and who should not.",
      "To make the decision, the algorithms assess multiple factors, including the extent to which a shopper should be trusted based on prior purchasing \u2013 and returning \u2013 patterns, shipping costs and the demand for the product in the customer\u2019s hands, according to Sender Shamiss, CEO of goTRG, a reverse logistics company that works with retailers like Walmart.",
      "Optoro, a company that helps streamline returns for Best Buy, Staples and Gap Inc., has observed retailers assessing the lifetime value of a customer and extending returnless refunds as a type of unofficial, discreet loyalty benefit, according to CEO Amena Ali.",
      "The king of online retail appeared to verify the process works that way.",
      "In a statement, Amazon said it offers returnless refunds on a \u201cvery small number\u201d of items as a \u201cconvenience to customers.\u201d",
      "The company also said it's hearing positive feedback from sellers about its new program that authorized them to tell customers they could keep some products and still be reimbursed. Amazon said it was monitoring for signs of fraud and setting eligibility criteria for sellers and customers. It didn't provide additional details on what that encompassed.",
      "Some retailers also are stiffening the liberal return policies they long employed to encourage online orders. Shoppers who enjoyed making purchases on their computers or cellphones became accustomed to loading up their digital shopping baskets with the intent of returning items they ended up not liking.",
      "Shopping online also grew significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homebound consumers reduced their trips to stores and relied on sites like Amazon for everyday items. Retail companies have talked in recent years about returns becoming more expensive to process due to the growing volume, rising inflation and labor costs.",
      "Last year, U.S. consumers returned $743 billion worth of merchandise, or 14.5% of the products they purchased - up from 10.6% in 2020, according to the National Retail Federation. In 2019, returned merchandise was valued at $309 billion, according to loss prevention company Appriss Retail.",
      "Last year, roughly 14% of returns were fraudulent, costing retailers $101 billion in losses, according to a joint report from the National Retail federation and Appriss Retail. The problem spans from low-level forms of fraud - such as shoppers returning already worn clothing - to more complicated schemes by fraudsters who return shoplifted merchandise or items purchased on stolen credit cards.",
      "To deter excessive returns, some retailers, including H&M, Zara and J. Crew, started charging customers return fees in the past year. Others have shortened their return windows. Some shopping sites, such as the Canadian retailer Ssense, have threatened to kick frequent returners off their platforms if they suspect abuse of their policies.",
      "However, retailers don't all view frequent returners in the same way. Such customers could be seen as \u201cgood returners\u201d if they purchase \u2013 and keep \u2013 many more items than they send back, Ali said.",
      "\u201cOftentimes, your most profitable customers tend to be high returners,\u201d she said."

      "ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates -- The United Arab Emirates opened its annual oil-and-gas summit on Monday as it plans to increase the country's energy output as global prices stay volatile and world politics remain uncertain ahead of the U.S. presidential election.",
      "The massive Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference comes after the UAE just last year hosted the United Nations COP28 climate talks. Those talks ended with a call by nearly 200 countries to move away from planet-warming fossil fuels \u2014 the first time the conference made that crucial pledge.",
      "But the UAE as a whole still plans to increase its production capacity of oil to 5 million barrels a day in the coming years as it pursues more cleaner energies at home. Meanwhile, UAE officials have made a point to dodge any questions about the U.S. election while maintaining their close ties to Russia despite Moscow's war on Ukraine.",
      "\u201cAllow me to say that we in the United Arab Emirates will always choose partnership over polarization, dialogue over division and peace over provocation,\u201d said Sultan al-Jaber, who heads the state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or ADNOC, and who also led the COP28 talks in Dubai.",
      "Crude oil prices have been depressed this year. Benchmark Brent crude traded around $74 a barrel on Monday as prices have dropped after concerns over the ongoing Mideast wars growing into a regional conflict faded in recent days.",
      "Slowing economic growth in China and ample supply in the market are additionally dragging down prices.",
      "In his speech opening the summit, al-Jaber pointed to artificial intelligence as a future technology that could be deployed by the energy industry \u2014 and one with a voracious appetite for electricity.",
      "\u201cNo single source of energy is going to be enough to meet this demand,\u201d he said. He called for a variety of energy sources to meet that challenge, including fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cOil will continue to be used for fuel and as a building block for many essential products,\u201d al-Jaber added.",
      "Scientists have called for drastically slashing the world\u2019s emissions by nearly half in the coming years to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with pre-industrial times.",
      "The 2015 Paris Agreement mentions that limit without specifically calling for a stop on using fossil fuels \u2014 something that OPEC Secretary-General Haitham al-Ghais seized on in remarks.",
      "\u201cThe Paris Agreement, ladies and gentlemen, is about the reduction of emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about phasing out or phasing down or keeping the oil under the ground.\u201d",
      "Suhail al-Mazrouei, the Emirates\u2019 minister of energy and infrastructure, separately stressed that \u201cinvestments in the oil and gas need to be taken care of\u201d to support demand in the market.",
      "\u201cWe are committed to invest in making more resources in the future to ensure the world will have adequate oil and gas resources,\u201d he said.",
      "Hardeep Singh Puri, India's minister of petroleum and natural gas, separately made a point to criticize what he described as his \u201cideologically motivated colleagues\u201d who sought an end to fossil fuel production.",
      "\u201cAs we accelerate other green energy transition, we will still need affordable traditional energy at least for two decades, if not longer,\u201d he said.",
      "Politics was also close at hand at the summit on Monday. Whispers among the crowd attending the opening pondered who would be better for their businesses, Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump.",
      "Al-Mazrouei dodged the first question by a presenter over whether his country preferred Trump or Harris.",
      "\u201cOf course, we will be discussing energy politics here and I (would) rather not ... talk about the election in the United States,\u201d al-Mazrouei said. \u201cAs a political contest, we wish both candidates the best.\u201d",

      "Meanwhile, the Mideast wars remain a top concern.",
      "\u201cI think the conflict in the Middle East is probably the top risk,\u201d U.K.-based BP CEO Murray Auchincloss said. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about the safety and security of our people and the security of energy flows.\u201d"

And in 2020, U.S. stocks climbed immediately after Election Day and kept going even after former President Donald Trump refused to concede  and challenged the results, creating plenty of uncertainty. A large part of that rally was due to excitement about the potential for a vaccine for COVID-19, which had just shut down the global economy.",

A win for Trump this election could mean U.S. tariffs  on Mexican imports, for example, which could hurt the value of the Mexican peso. But the peso has already fallen against the U.S. dollar in recent months, which could limit further moves if a Trump win were actually to happen.",
      "A Trump victory would be less of a surprise to markets this time around than in 2016, when Treasury yields soared on expectations for tax cuts that could further inflate the nation\u2019s debt or fuel a stronger U.S economy. Treasury yields have already climbed in recent weeks, in part due to rising expectations in some market corners for a Trump win, along with a spate of data showing the U.S. economy has remained stronger than feared.",

    "story": [
      "The voting has closed for unionized factory workers at Boeing who were deciding whether to accept a contract offer or to extend their strike",
      "SEATTLE -- The voting has closed for unionized factory workers at Boeing who were deciding Monday whether to accept a contract offer or to extend their strike, which has lasted more than seven weeks and shut down production of most Boeing passenger planes.",
      "A vote to ratify the contract on the eve of Election Day would clear the way for a major U.S. manufacturer and government contractor to resume airplane production. If members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers vote for a third time to reject Boeing's offer, it would plunge the aerospace giant into further financial peril and uncertainty.",
      "In its latest proposed contract, Boeing is offering pay raises of 38% over four years plus ratification and productivity bonuses. IAM District 751, which represents Boeing workers in the Pacific Northwest, endorsed the proposal, which is slightly more generous than one the machinists voted down nearly two weeks ago.",
      "Union officials said they achieved all they could though bargaining and the strike, and that if the current proposal is rejected, future offers from Boeing might be worse. They expect to announce the result of the vote late Monday.",
      "Boeing says average annual pay for machinists is $75,608 and would rise to $119,309 in four years under the current offer.",
      "Pensions were a key issue for workers who rejected the company's previous offers in September and October. In its new offer, Boeing did not meet their demand to restore a pension plan that was frozen nearly a decade ago.",
      "If machinists ratify the contract now on the table, they would return to work by Nov. 12, according to the union.",
      "The workers got their last paychecks in mid-September, a few days after the strike started, and are likely facing more pressure on their personal financial well-being.",
      "Bernadeth Jimenez, who has worked in quality assurance at the Boeing plant in Everett, Washington, since 2022, said she voted \u201cyes\u201d on Monday after voting against previous company offers. She was satisfied with the proposed wage increases, and said she never expected a pension anyway \u2014 she's putting money in a 401(k) plan.",
      "\u201cThis (offer) is good, and I really want to go back to work,\u201d she said. \u201cThis time we're ready.\u201d",
      "Theresa Pound isn't ready. The 16-year company veteran said she voted \u201cno\u201d just as she did on the two earlier offers that went to a vote.",
      "\u201cAdding 3% (to the previous offer) doesn\u2019t change anything for my future. It still doesn\u2019t solidify that when I retire I\u2019m going to have a comfortable living, and that\u2019s the bottom line,\" she said. \u201cInstant gratification is not going to save me.\u201d",
      "Both Jimenez and Pound have husbands who also work at Boeing, and both couples anticipated the strike and worked overtime before it started. Still, money is getting tight.",
      "\u201cWe're making it by the best we can,\" Pound said. \"We're going to run out soon, but it\u2019s not going to be a stopping point for me to say, \u2018Well, I\u2019m out of money. I need to go back.\u2019 I\u2019m going to find other ways to make it work.\u201d",
      "There were fewer pro-strike protesters in Everett than during the Oct. 23 vote.",
      "At a union hall in Renton, also near Seattle, signs warning against campaigning had been moved from inside to outside, and there was no table with workers handing out \u201cVote No\u201d material, like the last time. A small knot of workers gathered around a burn barrel to talk and keep warm. The mood was subdued.",
      "The strike began Sept. 13 with an overwhelming 94.6% rejection of Boeing's offer to raise pay by 25% over four years \u2014 far less than the union\u2019s original demand for 40% wage increases over three years.",
      "Machinists voted down another offer \u2014 35% raises over four years, and still no revival of pensions \u2014 on Oct. 23, the same day that Boeing reported a third-quarter loss of more than $6 billion. However, the offer received 36% support, up from 5% for the mid-September proposal, making Boeing leaders believe they were close to a deal.",
      "The contract rejections reflected bitterness that built up after union concessions and small pay increases over the past decade.",
      "The new proposal that Boeing made last week offered slightly larger pay increases plus a $12,000 contract-ratification bonus, up from $7,000 in the previous offer, and larger company contributions to employees\u2019 401(k) retirement accounts.",
      "Boeing also promises to build its next airline plane in the Seattle area. Union officials fear the company might withdraw the pledge if workers reject the new offer.",
      "Robert Helgeson has been repairing machines in the Renton plant for 34 years. He said he voted to approve the offer on Monday after voting no on the first proposal and skipping the second vote.",
      "\u201cI think this is fair,\" Helgeson said, citing the better pay. \"It\u2019s as good as it\u2019s going to get. I know everyone wanted the pension back, but we\u2019re just not going to get that.\u201d",
      "The strike drew the attention of the Biden administration. Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su intervened in the talks several times, including last week.",
      "The labor standoff \u2014 the first strike by Boeing machinists since an eight-week walkout in 2008 \u2014 is the latest setback in a volatile year for the company.",
      "Boeing came under several federal investigations after a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Federal regulators put limits on Boeing airplane production that they said would last until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at the company.",
      "The door-plug incident renewed concerns about the safety of the 737 Max. Two of the plane's crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. The CEO whose effort to fix the company failed announced in March that he would step down. In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving regulators who approved the 737 Max.",
      "As the strike dragged on, new CEO Kelly Ortberg announced about 17,000 layoffs and a stock sale to prevent the company\u2019s credit rating from being cut to junk status. S&P and Fitch Ratings said last week that the $24.3 billion in stock and other securities will cover upcoming debt payments and reduce the risk of a credit downgrade.",
      "The strike has created a cash crunch by depriving Boeing of money it gets when delivering new planes to airlines. The walkout at Seattle-area factories stopped production of the 737 Max, Boeing\u2019s best-selling plane, and the 777, or \u201ctriple-seven,\u201d jet and the cargo-carrying version of its 767 plane.",
      "Ortberg has conceded that trust in Boeing has declined, the company has too much debt, and \u201cserious lapses in our performance\u201d have disappointed many airline customers. But, he says, the company\u2019s strengths include a backlog of airplane orders valued at a half-trillion dollars.",

      "\u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d enjoyed another weekend at the top of the box office. The Sony release starring Tom Hardy added $26.1 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "It was a relatively quiet weekend for North American movie theaters leading up to the presidential election. Charts were dominated by big studio holdovers, like \u201cVenom 3,\u201d \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d and \u201cSmile 2,\u201d while audiences roundly rejected the Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and Robert Zemeckis reunion \u201cHere.\u201d Thirty years after \u201cForrest Gump,\u201d \u201cHere\u201d opened to only $5 million from 2,647 locations.",
      "\u201cVenom 3\u201d only fell 49% in its second weekend, which is a notably small drop for a superhero film, though it didn\u2019t exactly open like one either. In two weeks, the movie has made over $90 million domestically; The first two opened to over $80 million. Globally, the picture is brighter given that it has already crossed the $300 million threshold.",
      "Meanwhile, Universal and Illumination\u2019s \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d continues to attract moviegoers even six weeks in (and when it\u2019s available by video on demand), placing second with $7.6 million. That's up 11% from last weekend. The animated charmer has made over $121 million in North America and $269 million worldwide.",
      "\"'The Wild Robot' has quietly been this absolute juggernaut for the fall season,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cFor that film to see an increase after six weeks is astounding.\u201d",
      "\u201cSmile 2\u201d landed in third place with $6.8 million, helping to push its worldwide total to $109.7 million.",
      "The time-hopping \u201cHere,\u201d a graphic novel that was adapted by \u201cForrest Gump\u201d screenwriter Eric Roth, was financed by Miramax and distributed by Sony\u2019s TriStar. With a fixed position camera, it takes audiences through the years in one living room. Critics were not on board: In aggregate it has a lousy 36% on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cIt was a slow weekend anyway, but it didn\u2019t resonate in a way that many thought it might,\" Dergarabedian said. \"There are a lot of films out there for the audience that \u2018Here\u2019 was chasing.\"",
      "Despite playing in almost 1,000 more locations, \u201cHere\u201d came in behind Focus Features' papal thriller \u201cConclave,\u201d which earned $5.3 million. Playing in 1,796 theaters, \u201cConclave\u201d dropped only 20% from its debut last weekend and has made $15.2 million so far. Two Indian films also cracked the top 10 in their debuts, \u201cBhool Bhulaiyaa 3\u201d and \u201cSingham Again.\u201d",
      "Overall box office continues to lag behind 2023 by almost 12%. But holiday moviegoing will likely give the industry an end-of-year boost with titles like \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d on the way.",
      "\u201cIn a couple of weeks, it\u2019ll get a lot more competitive,\u201d Dergarabedian said.",
      "Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s film \u201cA Real Pain,\u201d a comedic drama about cousins on a Holocaust tour in Poland, launched in four theaters this weekend in New York and Los Angeles. It made an estimated $240,000, or $60,000 per screen, which is among the top three highest per theater averages of the year. Searchlight Pictures will be expanding the well-reviewed film nationwide in the coming weeks, going wide on Nov. 15 to over 800 theaters.",
      "Box office charts don\u2019t always paint a full picture of the moviegoing landscape, however. This weekend several relatively high-profile films playing in theaters did not report full grosses for various reasons, including the Clint Eastwood film \u201cJuror #2,\u201d Steve McQueen\u2019s WWII film \u201cBlitz\u201d and the Cannes darling \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d Netflix, which is handling \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d never reports box office. Apple Original Films is following suit with \u201cBlitz,\u201d a likely awards contender, which is in theaters before hitting Apple TV+ on Nov. 22.",
      "\u201cJuror No. 2\u201d is a Warner Bros. release, and a well-reviewed one at that. The film directed by Eastwood stars Nicholas Hoult as a juror on a murder case who faces a big moral dilemma. Domestic ticket sales were withheld. The studio did say that it earned $5 million from international showings, where it played on 1,348 screens.",
      "Even major studios withhold box office numbers occasionally. Earlier this year, Disney did not report on the Daisy Ridley movie \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea.\u201d Results were most notably withheld during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"It\u2019s really up to the distributors,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cOften times the reason that certain movies may not be reported is that there\u2019s a chance that the quality of the movie will be conflated with the box office number.\u201d",
      "Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore, were:",
      "1. \u201cVenom: The Last Dance,\u201d $26.1 million.",

      "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
      "NEW YORK -- For some television viewers, size apparently does matter.",
      "Forget the 65-inch TVs that were considered bigger than average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 8 feet across. That's wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a king-size bed.",
      "Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year, according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise tepid television market, according to analysts.",
      "The 38.1 million televisions sold with a width of at least 97 inches between January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs \u2014 the 19 models range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 \u2014 and introduced displays in roughly 70% of its stores.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really taken off this year,\" Blake Hampton, Best Buy's senior vice president of merchandising, said.",
      "Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at least 97 inches was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its first 98-inch TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said.",
      "Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling business, recently bought a 98-inch Sony for his 14,000-square-foot house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 85\u201d TV in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home and uses some to display digital art.",
      "\u201cWe just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking for and thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony. \u201cYou get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You\u2019re sitting watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can put yourself in the scene.\u201d",
      "The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through September period, Circana said.",
      "Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski, the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a year, Kowalski said.",
      "The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of two inches in both 2021 and 2022, and 85-inch TVs began gaining traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 98-inch TVs to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 110-115 inches are on the market right now, he said.",
      "\u201cYou get better resolution over time,\" Kowalski said. \"You get better picture quality. And so just over time, it\u2019s easier to produce those sets and improve the technology.\"",
      "Best Buy's Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as \u201cincredible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re watching YouTube TV content or \u2018 NFL Sunday Ticket,\u2019 you can actually get four screens up, and that\u2019s four 48-inch screens on it,\u201d he said.",
      "Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed its 98-inch lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every scene.",
      "James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment division of Samsung's U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and experience content is shifting.",
      "\u201cIt's even more so about watching TV as a shared experience,\u201d Fishler said. \u201cThey want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at home. \u201d",
      "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, its Sam\u2019s Club division, and Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens.",
      "TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach on home theater projectors, which create a 100- to 120-inch image that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without windows.",
      "\u201cA dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the purview of projectors,\u201d Andrew Sivori, vice president in the entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer. \"But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV.\"",
      "Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd. But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, \u201cIt\u2019s still a niche business.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of people just don\u2019t have the space to put one of those in,\u201d he added.",
      "Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make sure a 98-inch TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said.",
      "But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good news is that the recommended distance for a 98-inch TV is actually just 6-12 feet from the seating area. The rule of thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine the ideal viewing distance, Samsung's Fishler said.",
      "If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go?",
      "\u201cI think we'll have to wait and see,\u201d Fishler said."

      "The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.",
      "The new lawsuit says the Interior Department\u2019s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat was \u201cin danger of extinction now\u201d when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.",
      "\u201cOne cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,\u201d said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno.",
      "\u201cThe use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,\u201d said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.",
      "Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.",

      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",
      "When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said \"this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat.\u201d The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status.",
      "\u201cWe find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\u201d the agency concluded.",
      "The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion.",
      "The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project \u201cwill result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.\u201d",

      "The decision eased pressure on authorities who spend scarce foreign currency to subsidize the cost of fuel, but it also reflected growing enthusiasm for electric vehicles as the world demands more green technologies to reduce climate-changing emissions.",
      "Earlier this month, Ethiopia's government raised the price of fuel by up to 8% as part of a plan to gradually end all fuel subsidies in Africa's second-most populous country.",
      "Authorities have claimed some success in enforcing the ban on non-electric vehicles entering Ethiopia, and more than 100,000 electric cars are now being imported into the country each month.",
      "The official target is to increase the monthly import figure to 500,000 by 2030. By that time, a big new dam Ethiopia has built on the Nile River is expected to be producing power at full capacity.",
      "Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, in a televised address earlier this year, said the Grand Renaissance Dam will start generating more than 5,000 megawatts of electric power within a year. Authorities say such capacity would support the transition to electric vehicles.",
      "For now, many in Addis Ababa, a city of more than 5 million people, are doubtful the country can achieve its ambitious goals for electric vehicles without further needed infrastructure and services.",
      "The few garage owners who can fix broken electric cars say they are overwhelmed, while customers say they are being overcharged amid an apparent lack of competition.",
      "\u201cThere are two or three garages that can fix new energy vehicles in Ethiopia and many consumers lack awareness on how to take care of such vehicles,\" said Yonas Tadelle, a mechanic in Addis Ababa. \u201cAs mechanics, we also lack the tools, the spare parts and the know-how to fix such cars.\u201d",
      "Many EVs are now parked in garages and parking lots awaiting parts expected to come from China.",
      "Ethiopia's minister in charge of transport, Bareo Hassen Bareo, has said he believes the country can be a model nation with a green economy legacy, with the prioritization of electric vehicles a key component.",
      "The government will invest in public charging stations, he told The Associated Press, and there are plans to create a plant manufacturing EV batteries locally to reduce reliance on imports.",
      "Private efforts have included a collaboration, which has since fizzled, between Olympian Haile Gebreselassie and South Korean carmaker Hyundai to make electric vehicles in Ethiopia. That effort is believed to have collapsed over the sourcing of materials.",
      "Samson Berhane, an economist based in Addis Ababa, said the sudden flood of electric vehicles into the local market despite poor infrastructure is making it difficult for customers to adapt comfortably. Some EVs sell for about $20,000.",
      "\u201cVery few people are willing to take the risk of buying electric cars due to the lack of infrastructure, shortage of mechanics specialized in EV maintenance and the flooding of the market with Chinese brands that have questionable details and long-term visibility,\" Berhane said.",
      "But he said he believes that Ethiopia is more than able to provide electricity to the expected 500,000 EV\u2019s there within the next decade while fulfilling its industrial ambitions.",
      "Some Ethiopians are already giving up on electric vehicles, and the secondhand trade in gasoline-powered vehicles continues. There are at least 1.2 million vehicles across Ethiopia, and only a small fraction are electric ones.",
      "Businessman Yared Alemayehu bought a Chinese-made electric vehicle that he had hoped to use for a taxi service. He knew the car had a mechanical defect, but he believed it could be fixed. A mechanic disagreed.",
      "In the end, he sold the car at a loss and bought a Toyota Corolla \u2014 a car made in 2007 that he felt was more reliable \u2014 for the equivalent of $20,000, a sum that included the hefty taxes imposed on gasoline vehicles. Taxes can be higher than the cost of importing the vehicle.",

      "Taxi driver Dereje Hailu, who had high hopes for his Chinese-made E-Star electric vehicle when he purchased it earlier this year, said his expectations had been dashed.",

    "story": [
      "No one knows how Tuesday\u2019s presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve\u2019s move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- No one knows how Tuesday's presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve's move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year.",
      "The presidential contest might still be unresolved when the Fed ends its two-day meeting Thursday afternoon, yet that uncertainty would have no effect on its decision to further reduce its benchmark rate. The Fed's future actions, though, will become more unsettled once a new president and Congress take office in January, particularly if Donald Trump were to win the White House again.",
      "Trump's proposals to impose high tariffs on all imports and launch mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants and his threat to intrude on the Fed's normally independent rate decisions could send inflation surging, economists have said. Higher inflation would, in turn, compel the Fed to slow or stop its rate cuts.",
      "On Thursday, the Fed's policymakers, led by Chair Jerome Powell, are on track to cut their benchmark rate by a quarter-point, to about 4.6%, after having implemented a half-point reduction in September. Economists expect another quarter-point rate cut in December and possibly additional such moves next year. Over time, rate cuts tend to lower the costs of borrowing for consumers and businesses.",
      "The Fed is reducing its rate for a different reason than it usually does: It often cuts rates to boost a sluggish economy and a weak job market by encouraging more borrowing and spending. But the economy is growing briskly, and the unemployment rate is a low 4.1%, the government reported Friday, even with hurricanes and a strike at Boeing having sharply depressed net job growth last month.",
      "Instead, the central bank is lowering rates as part of what Powell has called \u201ca recalibration\u201d to a lower-inflation environment. When inflation spiked to a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, the Fed proceeded to raise rates 11 times \u2014 ultimately sending its key rate to about 5.3%, also the highest in four decades.",
      "But in September, year-over-year inflation dropped to 2.4%, barely above the Fed's 2% target and equal to its level in 2018. With inflation having fallen so far, Powell and other Fed officials have said they think high borrowing rates are no longer necessary. High borrowing rates typically restrict growth, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as housing and auto sales.",
      "\u201cThe restriction was in place because inflation was elevated,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed economist. \u201cInflation is no longer elevated. The reason for the restriction is gone.\u201d",
      "Fed officials have suggested that their rate cuts would be gradual. But nearly all of them have expressed support for some further reductions.",
      "\u201cFor me, the central question is how much and how fast to reduce the target for the (Fed's key) rate, which I believe is currently set at a restrictive level,\u201d Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Directors, said in a speech last month.",
      "Jonathan Pingle, an economist at Swiss bank UBS, said that Waller's phrasing reflected \u201cunusual confidence and conviction that rates were headed lower.\"",
      "Next year, the Fed will likely start to wrestle with the question of just how low their benchmark rate should go. Eventually, they may want to set it at a level that neither restricts nor stimulates growth \u2014 \u201cneutral\u201d in Fed parlance.",
      "Powell and other Fed officials acknowledge that they don't know exactly where the neutral rate is. In September, the Fed's rate-setting committee estimated that it was 2.9%. Most economists think it's closer to 3% to 3.5%.",
      "The Fed chair said the officials have to assess where neutral is by how the economy responds to rate cuts. For now, most officials are confident that at 4.9%, the Fed's current rate is far above neutral.",
      "Some economists argue, though, that with the economy looking healthy even with high borrowing rates, the Fed doesn't need to ease credit much, if at all. The idea is that they may already be close to the level of interest rates that neither slows nor stimulates the economy.",
      "\u201cIf the unemployment rate stays in the low 4's and the economy is still going to grow at 3%, does it matter that the (Fed's) rate is 4.75% to 5%?\u201d said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, asked. \u201cWhy are they cutting now?\u201d",
      "With the Fed's latest meeting coming right after Election Day, Powell will likely field questions at his news conference Thursday about the outcome of the presidential race and how it might affect the economy and inflation. He can be expected to reiterate that the Fed's decisions aren't affected by politics at all.",
      "During Trump's presidency, he imposed tariffs on washing machines, solar panels, steel and a range of goods from China, which President Joe Biden maintained. Though studies show that washing machine prices rose as a result, overall inflation did not rise much.",
      "But Trump is now proposing significantly broader tariffs \u2014 essentially, import taxes \u2014 that would raise the prices of about 10 times as many goods from overseas.",
      "Many mainstream economists are alarmed by Trump\u2019s latest proposed tariffs, which they say would almost certainly reignite inflation. A report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics concluded that Trump\u2019s main tariff proposals would make inflation 2 percentage points higher next year than it otherwise would have been.",
      "The Fed could be more likely to raise rates in response to tariffs this time, according to economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics, \"given that Trump is threatening much bigger increases in tariffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cAccordingly,\" they wrote, \u201cwe will scale back the reduction in the funds rate in our 2025 forecasts if Trump wins.\u201d"

      "Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has approved a revised plan for a massive proposed wind farm after he rejected a slimmed-down version earlier this year",
      "OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has approved a revised plan for a massive proposed wind farm after he rejected a sharply slimmed-down version earlier this year.",
      "Inslee urged permitting officials to work quickly to allow the construction of as many Horse Heaven Wind Farm turbines as possible, The Seattle Times reported. Washington state won't meet its \u201curgent clean energy needs\u201d if officials take years to authorize the turbines, he said.",
      "The original $1.7 billion project included up to 222 wind turbines across 24 miles (38.6 kilometers) of hillsides in the Tri-Cities area of eastern Washington and three solar arrays covering up to 8.5 square miles (22 square kilometers).",
      "But then Washington\u2019s Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, a clearinghouse for permits required by large projects, recommended slashing the proposal in half because nests of the endangered ferruginous hawk were found in the area. It wanted a 2-mile (3.2-kilometer) buffer around each nest.",
      "Most nests were empty, but the hawks can return to them years later.",
      "In May, Inslee rejected the council's recommendation to shrink the project, prompting the panel to suggest a compromise that would examine turbines and nests on a case-by-case basis. Under this plan, which Inslee formally approved Oct. 18, a technical advisory group would recommend whether to reduce individual nest setbacks to 1 kilometer (0.6 mile.)",
      "This could allow the developer, Boulder, Colorado-based Scout Clean Energy, to build all but 30 of the turbines originally proposed.",
      "Inslee, a Democrat, has sought to make climate initiatives key to his legacy. He is not seeking reelection after three terms in office.",
      "The wind farm project has pitted local opponents against the state\u2019s ever-growing need for renewable energy since it was first proposed in 2021. In a letter to the site evaluation council, Inslee noted that Washington\u2019s energy demands could nearly double by 2050."

      "About a dozen cars await servicing in the shop as a dog Hooks adopted the day before barks in its new cage. Exercise equipment, motorcycles and power tools abut the kitchen on the side of the renovated building where his wife cooks a meal. At 6 feet, 2 inches, and with a sturdy build, Hooks has a graying beard and a head of curls he says could be laced with snow flurries by this time of year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got to be one of the only Black businesses on this street,\u201d he says, noting that his repair shop stands on Peach Street, one of the city's main traffic arteries. He appreciates the greetings from passersby. But he says many people who know him from the neighborhoods where he grew up will never step foot in the shop. Almost all his customers are white.",
      "Hooks, 58, is a member of a coveted demographic in this year's election \u2014 a Black man and a business owner in a swing state. Both presidential campaigns have targeted Black entrepreneurs with their messaging, offering a range of economic policies and legislation that each side says will boost the careers and lives of African Americans.",
      "How Erie business owners and voters such as Hooks view each candidate's economic vision could determine control of the White House. Erie County has gone for the candidate who won Pennsylvania in every presidential election since 1992.

From population rates to business startups, the future of Erie's economy and politics have shown where the country may be heading. \u201cI think if you want to know about what's happening economically writ large in the country, you can look and see what's happening in Erie.\"",
      "Harris has rolled out a series of economic proposals meant to tackle affordability and boost small businesses. Trump has stressed his promise of sweeping tariffs, new corporate tax cuts and an unprecedented crackdown on illegal and legal immigration to the country.",
      "Local leaders are weighing the impact of each agenda on their plans to renew the Rust Belt.",
      "\u201cA lack of predictability would be the worst possible thing,\u201d said Drew Whiting, CEO of the Erie Downtown Development Corporation, which is directing more than $100 million in private investment to the downtown area.",
      "Whiting praised federal policies such as Qualified Opportunity Zones, which are meant to spur economic development in low-income communities and were created as part of the Trump administration\u2019s 2017 tax overhaul, as well as the investments in Erie enabled by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law spearheaded by Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "But Whiting added that \u201cbroad brush\u201d policies such as Trump\u2019s proposed 20% tariffs on all foreign goods threatened to be \u201can inflation bomb that would crush small businesses\u201d like those he works with. Whiting viewed Harris\u2019 proposed investments for small businesses to be a potential boon. A no tax on tips policy, which both Harris and Trump favor, would be a welcome innovation for workers, he said.",
      "The Harris campaign has zeroed in on affordability as a key concern of voters amid rising inflation. Her proposals to punish companies that gouge prices and her promises to expand support for health care and child care are issues where the campaign believes they can lower costs for working families. Trump, by contrast, would lower the corporate tax rate to 15%, extend his tax cuts and further cut other individual and family taxes, including by eliminating taxes on Social Security.",
      "Most mainstream economists agree that Trump\u2019s proposals would worsen inflation.",

Paliouras\u2019 family immigrated to the United States from Greece and bought the diner in 1970, when it was one of dozens of bustling businesses on top of a post office, school and church. Now Paliouras\u2019 diner is the only storefront left on the block.",
      "\u201cI try to keep it like Geneva in here,\u201d he said, referring to the city in famously neutral Switzerland. \u201cIn this town, we could have Trump, Kamala and Kennedy supporters sitting right next to each other at the bar.\u201d Independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was in the race until August, when he suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump.",
      "Hooks considers himself a survivor.",
      "Born and raised in Erie, Hooks grew up in poverty and with few options, support or direction for his life. At 23, he was sentenced to 30 years for dealing marijuana. He served eight years in prison, an experience he described as \u201cthe best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d",
      "Prison was the first place Hooks was exposed to scripture \u2014 the Bible and Quran \u2014 as well as stories about travel, business and history.",
      "While he has transformed his circumstances and overcome \u201ctrials and tribulations that made me a better man,\u201d he finds the distinctions that some draw between poor, working and middle-class people to be meaningless.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s because we have people in this country that want to be better than someone else,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cYou drive a Toyota Camry, I drive the Lexus. It\u2019s the same ... car. It\u2019s just a different name, but it\u2019s a higher status.\u201d",

      "So the trial is less about the murder itself,  and more about the circumstances that led to it.",
      "Over seven weeks, the court will hear how a 13-year-old\u2019s schoolgirl lie span out of control thanks to social media, triggering an international hate campaign, and inspiring a lone mission of vengeance from a self-styled defender of Islam.",
      "On trial are two men accused of identifying Mr Paty as a \u201cblasphemer\u201d over the Internet, two friends of Anzorov who allegedly gave him logistical help, and four others who offered support on chatlines.",
      "Mr Paty\u2019s murder horrified \u2013 and petrified \u2013 France.",
      "He was a conscientious and much-liked history teacher in a secondary school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, in the prosperous western suburbs of Paris.",
      "On 6 October 2020 he gave a lesson on freedom of speech \u2013 the same lesson he had given several times before \u2013 to a class of young teenagers.",
      "Drawing on the tragically famous episode of Charlie Hebdo magazine \u2013 how publication of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad had led to the 2015 murder of most of its staff \u2013 he briefly showed an example of the cartoons.",
      "Before doing so he recommended that those who feared being offended avert their eyes.",
      "The next day one of his pupils \u2013 the 13-year-old girl \u2013 was asked by her father why she was not going to school.",
      "She told him she had been disciplined because she dared to stand up to Mr Paty when he told Muslims to leave the class so he could show a naked picture of the prophet.",
      "It was a triple lie.",
      "Mr Paty had not told Muslims to leave the class. The girl had been disciplined, but not for the reason she said. She had not even been in the room on the day Mr Paty gave the lesson on freedom of speech.",
      "But with the Internet to send it on its way, the lie spread... and spread.",
      "First the girl\u2019s father \u2013 Brahim Chnina - made her repeat the claim on videos, which he posted on Facebook, naming the teacher.",
      "Then, a local Islamist - Abdelhakim Sefrioui - created a 10-minute online video entitled \u201cIslam and the prophet insulted in a public college.\u201d",
      "Within a couple of days the school was inundated with threats and messages of hate from around the world. Paty told colleagues that he was living through a difficult time because of the campaign against him.",
      "Meanwhile, the denunciation had reached the attention of an 18-year-old Chechen refugee living in Rouen, 80km (50 miles) to the west.",
      "Anzorov made an initial note on his telephone that read: \u201cA teacher has shown his class a picture of the messenger of Allah naked.\u201d",
      "Anzorov then sought the help of two friends, who are now on trial.",
      "One of them was allegedly present when he bought a knife in a Rouen shop. The other helped him buy two replica pistols on 16 October, the day of the attack, and then drove him to the school.",
      "The four last defendants - including one woman - are people with whom Anzorov conversed on Snapchat and Twitter and who allegedly offered him encouragement.",
      "The defendants admit their connection to the case, but they contest the charges of \"terrorist association\" or \"complicity to commit terrorist murder\".",
      "Lawyers for the girl\u2019s father and the Islamist preacher will argue that though they publicly condemned Mr Paty, they never called for his murder.",
      "In a similar vein, lawyers for Anzorov\u2019s friends \u2013 actual and online \u2013 will say they had no notion he planned a killing.",
      "For the prosecution, context is key. Samuel Paty\u2019s murder took place at a time of heightened awareness of the jihadist threat. In October 2020, Charlie Hebdo had just re-published some of the cartoons, to mark the start of a trial resulting from the original attack.",
      "The internet was full of new Islamist threats against France, and in late September a Pakistani man had wounded two people with a machete at Charlie Hebdo\u2019s former offices.",
      "In that climate, publicly denouncing a man for blasphemy was tantamount to designating a terrorist target, prosecutors will argue.",
      "A year ago the girl at the heart of the case was convicted in a minors\u2019 court of making false accusations and given a suspended prison term.",

      "Female mosquitoes are the ones that spread diseases to people, and so trying to prevent them having babies would help reduce overall numbers.",
      "The team from the University of California, Irvine studied Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which spread viruses to around 400 million people a year.",
      "They closely observed the insects' aerial mating habits - that can last between a few seconds to just under a minute - and then figured out how to disrupt it using genetics.",

      "Dr Joerg Albert, from the University of Oldenburg in Germany, is an expert on mosquito mating and I asked him what he made of the research.",

      "Speaking at a protest in Tel Aviv, Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan has been held by Hamas for over a year, said the stories \u201csupported Netanyahu\u2019s propaganda lies to torpedo the deal\".",
      "The documents claimed Hamas was planning to smuggle Israeli hostages to Egypt  - intent on scuppering any proposed ceasefire deal.",
      "Some commentators say the revelations were politically useful for Netanyahu\u2019s hardline position on the talks, which have made almost no progress.",
      "Over 100 hostages out of 251 taken by Hamas on 7 October 2023 remain unaccounted for.",

      "Turnout at 54% was high, especially among expat voters at polling stations abroad.",
      "Stoianoglo took an initial lead on the night and was the more successful candidate in Moldova itself with more than 51% of the vote. Sandu won in the capital Chisinau, and she was completely dominant among expat voters.",
      "As she overtook her challenger late on Sunday night, there was cheering at her campaign headquarters and chants of \"victory\".",
      "In a hoarse voice she praised her compatriots for saving Moldova and giving \"a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books\".",
      "Then, moving into Russian, she said: \"I have heard your voice \u2013 both those who supported me and those who voted for Mr. Stoianoglo. In our choice for a dignified future, no-one lost... we need to stand united.\"",
      "Maia Sandu\u2019s foreign policy adviser, Olga Rosca, told the BBC she was proud of the result.",
      "Asked whether she was surprised that Stoianoglo had won in Moldova itself, she said the vote in Moldova and abroad should be seen as one and the same: \u201cWe never divide people into Moldovans at home and expatriates - we see Moldovans as one family.\u201d",
      "With elections coming next year she said the president had \u201cclearly indicated she has heard the mood for change. On several occasions between the [two presidential] votes she said the fight against corruption must be intensified and justice reform must be accelerated \u2013 she\u2019s committed to this work\u201d.",
      "The final result will be declared on Monday.",
      "EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Sandu, saying \"it takes a rare kind of strength to overcome the challenges you've faced in this election.",
      "\"I'm glad to continue working with you towards a European future for Moldova and its people,\" her message on X said.",
      "Casting his ballot, Alexandr Stoianoglo had promised to be an \"apolitical president\", and that he had voted for \"a Moldova that should develop in harmony with both the West and the East\".",
      "Stoianoglo polled particularly well in rural areas and the south, while Sandu was ahead in the cities and with young voters.",
      "After casting her ballot, Sandu had warned of \"thieves\" who sought to buy their vote and their country.",
      "Presidential national security adviser Stanislav Secrieru said Russia had organised buses and large charter flights to bring voters to polling stations.",
      "Bomb scares had briefly disrupted voting in Moldova, at UK polling stations in Liverpool and Northampton and at Frankfurt and Kaiserslautern in Germany, he added.",
      "A Soviet republic for 51 years, Moldova is flanked by Ukraine and Romania and one of Europe's poorest countries. It has a population of 2.5 million and an expat population of 1.2 million.",
      "Moldova's authorities have long warned that a fugitive oligarch called Ilan Shor has spent $39m (\u00a330m) trying to buy the election for Moscow with handouts to 138,000 Moldovans.",
      "Shor, who is based in Moscow, denies wrongdoing but did promise cash payments to anyone prepared to back his call for a \"firm No\" to the EU.",
      "Commentators and politicians had warned that a Stoianoglo victory could radically change the political landscape in the Danube and Black Sea region, not because he was some kind of \"Trojan horse\", but rather because Russia has thrown its weight behind him.",
      "There were queues at polling stations in Moscow, Italy and among voters from a mainly Russian-speaking breakaway region of Transnistria, who had to cross the River Dniester into Moldovan-controlled territory to vote. Transnistria is home to a Russian military base and a huge arms depot.",
      "Moldova's election commission said it was aware of reports of organised and illegal transports of voters by air and land in Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Turkey, and appealed to the public to report further violations.",
      "Although Sandu had easily won the first round of the vote, several candidates swung behind Stoianoglo, although the third-placed candidate refused to back either of the two.",
      "The first round coincided with a nail-biting referendum on backing a change to the constitution embracing the commitment to join the EU.",
      "In the end the vote passed by a tiny margin in favour, and Maia Sandu said there had been clear evidence of attempts to buy 300,000 votes."

      "When will we know if Harris or Trump has won?",
      "1. He\u2019s not in power",
      "The economy is the number one issue for voters, and while unemployment is low and the stock market is booming, most Americans say they are struggling with higher prices every day.",
      "Inflation hit levels not seen since the 1970s in the aftermath of the pandemic, giving Trump the chance to ask \u201cAre you better off now than you were four years ago?\u201d",

      "Only a quarter of Americans say they are satisfied with the direction the country is going in and two-thirds have a poor economic outlook.",
      "Harris has tried to be the so-called change candidate, but as vice-president has struggled to distance herself from an unpopular Joe Biden.",
      "2. He seems impervious to bad news",
      "Despite the fallout from the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol, a string of indictments and an unprecedented criminal conviction, Trump\u2019s support has remained stable all year at 40% or above.",
      "While Democrats and \u201cNever-Trump\u201d conservatives say he is unfit for office, most Republicans agree when Trump says he\u2019s the victim of a political witch-hunt.",
      "With both sides so dug in, he just needs to win over enough of the small slice of undecided voters without a fixed view of him.",
      "3. His warnings on illegal immigration resonate",
      "Beyond the state of the economy, elections are often decided by an issue with an emotional pull.",
      "Democrats will hope it\u2019s abortion, while Trump is betting it\u2019s immigration.",
      "After encounters at the border hit record levels under Biden, and the influx impacted states far from the border, polls suggest voters trust Trump more on the immigration - and that he\u2019s doing much better with Latinos than in previous elections.",
      "4. A lot more people don\u2019t have a degree than do",
      "Trump\u2019s appeal to voters who feel forgotten and left behind has transformed US politics by turning traditional Democratic constituencies like union workers into Republicans and making the protection of American industry by tariffs almost the norm.",
      "If he drives up turnout in rural and suburban parts of swing states this can offset the loss of moderate, college-educated Republicans.",
      "5. He\u2019s seen as a strong man in an unstable world",
      "Trump\u2019s detractors say he undermines America\u2019s alliances by cosying up to authoritarian leaders.",
      "The former president sees his unpredictability as a strength, however, and points out that no major wars started when he was in the White House.",
      "Many Americans are angry, for different reasons, with the US sending billions to Ukraine and Israel - and think America is weaker under Biden.",
      "A majority of voters, especially men who Trump has courted through podcasts like Joe Rogan's, see Trump as a stronger leader than Harris.",
      "1. She\u2019s not Trump",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s advantages, he remains a deeply polarising figure.",
      "In 2020, he won a record number of votes for a Republican candidate, but was defeated because seven million more Americans turned out to support Biden.",
      "This time, Harris is playing up the fear factor about a Trump return. She\u2019s called him a \u201cfascist\u201d and a threat to democracy, while vowing to move on from \u201cdrama and conflict\u201d.",

      "2. She\u2019s also not Biden",
      "Democrats were facing near-certain defeat at the point Biden dropped out of the race. United in their desire to beat Trump, the party quickly rallied around Harris. With impressive speed from a standing start, she delivered a more forward-looking message that excited the base.",
      "While Republicans have tied her to Biden\u2019s more unpopular policies, Harris has rendered some of their Biden-specific attack lines redundant.",
      "The clearest of these is age - polls consistently suggested voters had real concerns about Biden\u2019s fitness for office. Now the race has flipped, and it is Trump who\u2019s vying to become the oldest person to ever win the White House.",
      "3. She's championed women's rights",
      "This is the first presidential election since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade and the constitutional right to an abortion.",
      "Voters concerned about protecting abortion rights overwhelmingly back Harris, and we\u2019ve seen in past elections - notably the 2022 midterms - that the issue can drive turnout and have a real impact on the result.",
      "This time around, 10 states, including the swing state Arizona, will have ballot initiatives asking voters how abortion should be regulated. This could boost turnout in Harris\u2019s favour.",
      "The historic nature of her bid to become the first female president may also strengthen her significant lead among women voters.",
      "4. Her voters are more likely to show up",
      "The groups Harris is polling more strongly with, such as the college-educated and older people, are more likely to vote.",
      "Democrats ultimately perform better with high-turnout groups, while Trump has made gains with relatively low-turnout groups such as young men and those without college degrees.",
      "Trump, for example, holds a huge lead among those who were registered but didn\u2019t vote in 2020, according to a New York Times/Siena poll.",
      "A key question, then, is whether they will show up this time.",
      "5. She\u2019s raised - and spent - more money",
      "It\u2019s no secret that American elections are expensive, and 2024 is on track to be the most expensive ever.",
      "But when it comes to spending power - Harris is on top. She\u2019s raised more since becoming the candidate in July than Trump has in the entire period since January 2023, according to a recent Financial Times analysis, which also noted that her campaign has spent almost twice as much on advertising.",

      "\u201cIt was all black, smoke everywhere,\u201d he says in a low voice. \u201cIt took about a minute. Then I started to recognise what is around me. I noticed my two friends were still alive but bleeding a lot. It took about five minutes for the people to get us out.\u201d",
      "Mohammed recounts the horrors from his bed in the Nabih Berri government hospital, which is perched on a hilltop in Nabatieh. It is one of the biggest cities in the south, and just 11km (seven miles) from the border with Israel, as the crow flies. Before the war it was home to about 80,000 people.",

      "Shortly afterwards, a few floors down in the emergency room, the wail of a siren warns of casualties arriving \u2013 from that air strike. It had hit Mohammed\u2019s village, Arab Salim.",
      "A woman is rushed in on a stretcher, with blood streaming down her face. She is followed by her husband, who hits a wall in frustration before slumping over in shock. Doctors disappear behind closed doors to examine her.",
      "Within minutes the hospital director, Dr Hassan Wazni, tells staff she has a ruptured artery and must be moved to a specialised vascular centre in a hospital further north.",
      "\"She needs it immediately,\" he says, as cries of pain come from the examining room. \"Talk to Saida [a nearby town]. If it\u2019s OK, let\u2019s take her immediately, because she can\u2019t wait.\"",
      "The hospital receives 20-30 casualties from Israeli air strikes a day. Most are civilians, but no-one is turned away. \u201cWe take all patients, and all injured, and all martyrs who come,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don't discriminate between them.\u201d",
      "Dr Wazni has not left the hospital since the war began. Behind his desk in his office, he opens a packet of cigarillos. \u201cI think it\u2019s OK to break some rules in a war,\u201d he says with an apologetic smile.",
      "He is struggling to pay wages and come up with 1,200 litres of fuel per day to run the generators that power the hospital. \u201cWe get nothing from the government,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have it.\u201d",
      "His fuel is espresso, which he offers us repeatedly.",

The sick and the wounded brought here are transferred quickly to hospitals in safer areas further North. Staff say there have been \u201cmany strikes \u201cclose to Nabih Berri. During our visit there\u2019s broken glass inside the foyer.",
      "Nabatieh has been under fire for more than a month.",

      "The old market, or souk, was treasured by Hussein Jaber, 30, who is part of the government\u2019s emergency services. He and his men, some of them volunteers, take us there for a brief visit. They drive at speed - the only way to travel in Nabatieh.",
      "\u201cWe were born and raised here,\u201d Hussein says, gesturing around at slabs of concrete and twisted metal. \u201cWe have been here since we were children. The souk means a great deal to us. It is really sad to see it like this. It holds memories of the past and the beautiful days we spent with the people of this city.\u201d",
      "Like Dr Wazni, Hussein and his colleagues have remained with the people, despite the risks. More than 110 paramedics and first responders have been killed in Israeli attacks in Lebanon in the past year, according to Lebanese government figures \u2013 most of them in the past month. Some attacks involve \u201capparent war crimes\u201d, according to the international campaign group, Human Rights Watch.",

      "He died, as he lived.",
      "When the air strike happened, Naji Fahes was standing outside the station, ready to go on a mission.",

The insistent buzzing of the drone competes with his voice. \u201cWe hear it 90% of the time,\u201d he says. \u201cWe think it\u2019s directly above us now.

    "story": [
      "In a small corner of rural Taiwan, set amongst other dye houses and small factories, the start-up Alchemie Technology is in the final phase of rolling out a project it claims will upend the global apparel industry and slash its carbon footprint.",
      "The UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\u2019s first digital dyeing process.",
      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",
      "NTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\u2019s interview request.",
      "Kirsi Niinim\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \u201cquite promising\u201d \u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.",
      "But even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.",
      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",
      "The company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.",
      "They will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.",
      "Big fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.",

      "Legal challenges are also possible. More than 100 pre-election lawsuits have already been filed, including challenges to voter eligibility and voter roll management, by Republicans.",
      "Other scenarios that could cause delays include any election-related disorder, particularly at polling locations.",
      "On the other hand, vote-counting has sped up in some areas, including the crucial state of Michigan, and far fewer votes will be cast by mail than in the last election, which was during the Covid pandemic.",

State-specific rules could prolong counting in some states, while other states may report partial figures moments after the last in-person vote is cast. Also, some absentee and mail-in ballots, including votes by members of the military and Americans living overseas, are normally among the last to be counted.",
      "Georgia - Polls close in the Peach State at 19:00 EST (00:00 GMT). Early and mail-in ballots will be counted first, ahead of in-person votes.

Experts agree that it may take at least 24 hours before enough votes are counted for a winner to emerge.",

The state's largest county says not to expect results until early Wednesday morning. On top of that, postal ballots dropped off on election day could take up to 13 days to count, according to officials in Maricopa County, the largest district in the state.",
      "Nevada - Votes here could also take days to count, because the state allows mail-in ballots to qualify as long as they were sent on election day and arrive no later than 9 November.",

      "\"Do you know who I am?... I can make you disappear in this whole country, and nothing will happen,\" Ikwechegh was heard saying in the video that went viral.",
      "The altercation apparently started after the driver asked Ikwechegh to go outside to collect the food, rather than him taking it inside.",
      "Shocked Nigerians shared the clip widely, forcing Ikwechegh, a member of the opposition All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) party who represents the south-eastern town of Aba in the House of Representatives, to issue a formal apology - a stark contrast to his arrogant and intimidating tone in the video.",
      "Unfortunately, it is common in Nigeria for officials and other \"big men\" to use their power to intimidate ordinary citizens with the familiar phrase: \"Do you know who I am?\" - a reminder of the untouchable status they believe they hold.",
      "Politicians, including many MPs, often also intimidate the public by travelling in large convoys, with police escorts and blaring sirens.",
      "Their convoys are given priority over regular traffic, with security officers sometimes reacting aggressively towards anyone who fails to make way for them.",
      "But this latest case is especially disappointing because Ikwechegh, at 42, is part of a younger generation of politicians.",
      "The \"Not Too Young to Run\" campaign was started a few years ago by civil society organisations to encourage more young people to become involved in Nigerian politics.",
      "With 70% of the country's population under 35, the initiative aimed to lower the age limits for running for office, allowing younger Nigerians to bring new ideas and a fresh approach to leadership.",
      "It succeeded in 2018, reducing the minimum age requirements for various offices and raising the number of young candidates from 6% to 27% in just one year.",
      "The age of running for the House of Representatives - the lower chamber of parliament - was reduced from 30 to 25, the Senate and governorship from 35 to 30, and president from 40 to 30.",
      "Since Nigeria's median age is only 18, many hoped younger leaders would break the old patterns of oppression and entitlement.",
      "But Ikwechegh's actions exhibit some of the same old behaviours that many young Nigerians had hoped would be left behind.",
      "Sadly, his case isn't unique. Two years ago, Nigeria's then-youngest senator, Elisha Abbo, who was 41 at the time, was filmed slapping a shop assistant after accusing her of \"insulting\" him.",
      "He threatened her with arrest, and even called over a police officer to carry it out.",
      "The incident was caught on CCTV and eventually led to Abbo, who is no longer a senator after losing elections last year, apologising. But it exposed just how deeply rooted this culture of abuse of power is.",
      "All this has left many Nigerians wondering if younger leaders are falling into the same traps as the older generation.",
      "The situation takes me back to my boarding school days, where senior students regularly bullied juniors.",
      "As juniors, my classmates and I would eagerly talk about what we'd do once it was our turn to be seniors, picturing the punishments we'd hand down to those younger than us.",
      "It felt like a right, something to look forward to - a small comfort amid the hardships of being a junior - that someday, we would be the ones with the power, not the ones on the receiving end.",
      "But by the time we made it to senior year, the school introduced new rules against bullying, and we felt robbed.",
      "We had waited our turn, and now that right was being taken from us. The school stuck with its new rules although many seniors still found ways to circumvent them.",
      "It feels like this same cycle is playing out on a national level.",
      "When a 42-year-old politician, active on social media, can slap a taxi driver - three times - on camera without a second thought, it forces us to wonder if the younger generation of politicians are simply waiting to inherit, rather than break, the cycle of privilege, whether they truly want a fresh start or are just waiting for their turn to wield power without any restraint.",

      "\"Music is sacred to me,\" Quincy Jones once said. \"Melody is God's voice.\"",
      "He certainly had the divine touch.",
      "Jones, who has died at the age of 91, was the right-hand man to both Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson, and helped to shape the sound of jazz and pop over more than 60 years.",
      "His recordings revolutionised music by crossing genres, promoting unlikely collaborations and shaping modern production techniques.",
      "Here are 10 songs that showcase his versatility and brilliance in the studio, and his ability to draw the best out of the musicians he worked with.",
      "1) Michael Jackson - Billie Jean",
      "Michael Jackson met Quincy Jones on the set of the 1978 movie The Wiz, and asked him to produce his next album. That record was Off The Wall - a disco extravaganza that established Jackson as a solo star.",
      "They teamed up again for 1982's Thriller, which arguably remade the pop business. Not only did it produce seven top 10 singles; but it crossed racial barriers, appealing equally to black and white audiences.",
      "Key to the success was Billie Jean, a dark tale about the groupies Jackson met while touring with his brothers. As a producer, Jones wasn't keen on the track at first - arguing with Jackson about the long instrumental opening.",
      "\"I said, \u2018Michael we\u2019ve got to cut that intro,\u2019\u201d he later recalled.",
      "\"He said, \u2018But that\u2019s the jelly! That\u2019s what makes me want to dance.' And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That\u2019s what makes me want to dance,' well, the rest of us just have to shut up.\"",
      "With those words ringing in his ears, Jones kept the arrangement lean and funky. He even instructed sound engineer Bruce Swedien to create a drum sound with a \"sonic personality\" that no-one had ever heard before. The result is one of the most recognisable intros in the history of pop.",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "2) Frank Sinatra - Come Fly With Me (Live at The Sands)",
      "\"The friendship was so strong. You can't describe it,\" said Jones of his partnership with Frank Sinatra - which extended far beyond the recording studio.",
      "\u201cSeven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying.\"",
      "After establishing their relationship on 1964's It Might As Well Be Swing, Jones helped Sinatra re-arrange his signature songs for a four-week residency at the Copa Room in The Sands hotel, Las Vegas.",
      "\"It was probably the most exciting engagement I have ever done in my life, since I started performing,\" Sinatra later recalled.",
      "Accompanied by the Count Basie Orchestra, the star sounds perfectly at ease, breezing around standards like I've Got You Under My Skin, Fly Me To The Moon and You Make Me Feel So Young.",
      "But it's Come Fly With Me that most perfectly captures the vitality of Jones's new arrangements, especially in the charismatic interplay between Sinatra and the brass section.",

      "3) Lesley Gore - It's My Party",
      "Lesley Gore was just a teenager when her vocal demos made their way into Quincy Jones's hands in the early 1960s. Up to that point, he'd been working with jazz singers like Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan - but he heard something he liked on Gore's tape.",
      "\"She had a mellow, distinctive voice and sang in tune, which a lot of grown up rock \u2018n\u2019 roll singers couldn\u2019t do, so I signed her,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography.",
      "For their first session, Jones picked It's My Party out of a pile of 200 demos and got to work. He double-tracked Gore's voice, adding little flourishes of brass and unexpected chord changes that perfectly evoke the song's adolescent angst.",
      "He then rush-released the single, after discovering that Phil Spector had plans to record the same song with the Crystals. It duly topped the US charts and went to number nine in the UK.",

      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "4) Quincy Jones - Summer In The City",
      "Recorded by The Lovin' Spoonful, Summer In The City is a 1960s rock classic, full of ominous organ chords and powerful drum hits that capture the sticky filth of an oppressive heatwave.",
      "Quincy Jones version, recorded for his 1973 album You've Got It Bad Girl, is almost unrecognisable as the same song. Lazily chilled-out, the Hammond organ is played with a featherlight touch, and the drums are gently brushed.",
      "Most of the lyrics are excised and, when they arrive at the 2'30\" mark, they're sung with almost heavenly serenity by Valerie Simpson (of Ashford and Simpson fame).",
      "Originally released as a b-side, it's become one of Jones's most influential songs. According to WhoSampled.com, it's been sampled on 87 other songs, including tracks by Massive Attack, Eminem, Nightmares on Wax and The Roots.",

      "5) Dinah Washington - Mad About The Boy",
      "Another example of how Jones's skill as an arranger could completely change a song.",
      "Mad About The Boy was written by Sir No\u00ebl Coward, for the 1932 revue Words and Music. In the original, it was sung by four different women, each expressing their love for an unnamed film star (rumoured to be Douglas Fairbanks Jr) as they wait in line to see one of his films.",
      "It's funny and quirky and clever - but when Dinah Washington covered the song in 1961, Jones slowed it down and switched the time signature from 4/4 to 6/8, allowing the singer to prowl through the lyrics with a newfound carnality.",
      "Overlooked at the time, it gained a new lease of life in 1992 when it was used to soundtrack a Levis advert and crept into the UK charts for the first time.",

      "6) Quincy Jones - Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Written in just 20 minutes, Soul Bossa Nova was inspired by an early-60s fad for Brazilian music, sparked by the success of Jo\u00e3o Gilberto and Stan Getz's Desafinado.",
      "Jones is in his element here - with chirruping flutes and big trombone slides that capture the joie de vivre of the carnival. He also makes prominent use of a cu\u00edca, the Brazilian drum that produces what sounds like a very happy monkey in the opening bars.",
      "The bossa-craze may have been short-lived, but Jones's song endured, most memorably in the opening dance sequence of Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery.",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "7) Michael Jackson - Beat It",
      "From the beginning, Jones and Jackson planned to make Thriller a blockbuster pop album.",
      "\"We went through 800 songs to get to nine,\" Jones said. \"That's not casual.\"",
      "The work was exhausting. At one point, they were working in three studios simultaneously... until the speakers caught fire.",
      "Beat It was crucial to the project - because it was designed to get Jackson played on US rock radio, an unheard of prospect in the heavily-segregated music industry of the 1980s.",
      "Jones had told Jackson to write \"a black version\" of The Knack's My Sharona - the 1979 hit song that sold more then 10 million copies. But Jackson was one step ahead. He had a demo that fit the bill, albeit without a hook or lyrics.",
      "While Jackson worked on those elements (you can hear his first, wordless attempt at the melody on his YouTube channel), Jones called on Eddie Van Halen to perform the guitar solo.",
      "\"He came in and he stacked up his Gibson [guitars],\" Jones later recalled.",
      "\"I said, 'I'm not going to sit here and try to tell you what to play... Let's try three or four takes. Some of it will be over-animated, some of it will be long, and we'll sculpt it.",
      "\"And he played his ass off.\"",
      "The song, with its West Side Story-inspired video, landed just as MTV took off, making Jackson a permanent fixture in living rooms across America.",
      "But for all the commercial focus of the Thriller project, Jones always maintained that the music came first.",
      "\"I've never, ever in my life done music for money or fame - because that's when God walks out of the room,\" he said.",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "8) The Brothers Johnson - Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Jones discovered guitarist George Johnson and bassist Louis Johnson when he heard them playing on a demo by Chaka Khan's sister, Taka Boom.",
      "He hired them to play on the soundtrack for the celebrated TV mini-series Roots, placed them in his touring band, and helmed their 1976 debut album Look Out For #1 (including a sublime cover of The Beatles' Come Together).",
      "But the brothers didn't achieve mainstream success until 1977, with the release of Strawberry Letter #23.",
      "Originally recorded by Shuggie Otis, Jones's version toughens up the production, with a strutting bassline and soaring backing vocals - but George Johnson struggled to recreate Shuggie's original guitar solo, which was full of complicated triplet notes.",
      "Frustrated, Jones called up session musician Lee Ritenour for help.",
      "\"Quincy was walking down the hallway tearing his hair out,\" Ritenour later recalled. \"He said, 'I'm going to lunch, Ritenour. Get it done.'",
      "Released in the middle of the punk and disco boom, the song's romantic psychedelia still found an audience - reaching number 13 in the charts. It was later re-popularised by Quentin Tarantino in the film Jackie Brown.",

      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "9) Sarah Vaughan - Misty",
      "Early in his career, Jones was one of the most in-demand arrangers in jazz, working with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee.",
      "In 1958, he recorded an entire album with Sarah Vaughan in Paris, backed by a 55-piece orchestra. Among the highlights is the lovestruck ballad Misty - originally recorded by pianist Erroll Garner, and made famous by Johnny Mathis.",
      "Unlike their syrupy and sentimental versions, Vaughan and Jones (along with producer Jack Tracy) give the lyrics some pathos. She might be \"as helpless as a kitten up a tree\", but you're never entirely convinced she's happy about the situation.",
      "Jones adds beguiling touches - from the cascading strings when Vaughan sings \"a thousand violins begin to play\", to the beautifully muted saxophone line, played by Zoot Sims.",
      "Vaughan died in 1990. In 2019, Jones posted about her influence on his Facebook page, using his pet name for her - Sassy.",
      "\"Dear sweet Sassy was all about sophistication and chord changes and, man, I\u2019m telling you she thought like a horn and SANG like a horn!\" he wrote.",
      "\"We had quite the journey together, & I will never forget each moment we had, because every moment was a special one.\"",

      "Listen to Misty",
      "10) USA For Africa - We Are The World",
      "\"Check your egos at the door,\" said the hand-written sign that Quincy Jones pinned to the door of his recording studio in 1985.",
      "The occasion was the recording of We Are The World - a star-studded charity single that aimed to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia.",
      "Written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, the record featured vocals from Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen, Dionne Warwick and Bob Dylan, all recorded in a single night.",
      "Herding the singers was a massive headache, as the recent Netflix documentary The Greatest Night In Pop revealed.",
      "At one point, Stevie Wonder insisted that some of the lyrics should be rewritten in Swahili - despite the fact that the people of Ethiopia, who would be the main beneficiaries of the famine-relief fundraiser, largely speak other languages.",
      "Jones oversaw the whole session with the patience and wisdom of a producer who'd seen it all.",
      "The results aren't particularly great - the song is sickly and overlong - but the fact that it's coherent at all is a testament to his skill as a producer, arranger, mentor and referee.",
      "In the end, the song raised more than $63m ($227m or \u00a3178m adjusted for inflation); and Jones looked back on it as one of his proudest achievements.",
      "\u201cI have never before or since experienced the joy I felt that night working with this rich, complex human tapestry of love, talent, and grace,\" he wrote in his 2002 autobiography.",

    "summary": "India has approved 227bn rupees ($2.7bn) for new space projects - but the funding is far from lavish.",
    "story": [
      "India recently announced a host of ambitious space projects and approved 227bn rupees ($2.7bn; \u00a32.1bn) for them.",
      "The plans include the next phase of India\u2019s historic mission to the Moon, sending an orbiter to Venus, building of the first phase of the country\u2019s maiden space station and development of a new reusable heavy-lifting rocket to launch satellites.",
      "It's the single largest allocation of funds ever for space projects in India, but considering the scale and complexity of the projects, they are far from lavish and have once again brought into focus the cost-effectiveness of India\u2019s space programme.",
      "Experts around the world have marvelled at how little Indian Space Research Organisation\u2019s (Isro) Moon, Mars and solar missions have cost. India spent $74m on the Mars orbiter Mangalyaan and $75m on last year\u2019s historic Chandrayaan-3 \u2013 less than the $100m spent on the sci-fi thriller Gravity.",
      "Nasa\u2019s Maven orbiter had cost $582m and Russia\u2019s Luna-25, which crashed on to the Moon\u2019s surface two days before Chandrayaan-3\u2019s landing, had cost 12.6bn roubles ($133m).",
      "Despite the low cost, scientists say India is punching much above its weight by aiming to do valuable work.",
      "Chandrayaan-1 was the first to confirm the presence of water in lunar soil and Mangalyaan carried a payload to study methane in the atmosphere of Mars. Images and data sent by Chandrayaan-3 are being looked at with great interest by space enthusiasts around the world.",
      "So how does India keep the costs so low?",
      "Retired civil servant Sisir Kumar Das, who looked after Isro\u2019s finances for more than two decades, says the frugality can be traced back to the 1960s, when scientists first pitched a space programme to the government.",
      "India had gained independence from British colonial rule only in 1947 and the country was struggling to feed its population and build enough schools and hospitals.",
      "\u201cIsro\u2019s founder and scientist Vikram Sarabhai had to convince the government that a space programme was not just a sophisticated luxury that had no place in a poor country like India. He explained that satellites could help India serve its citizens better,\u201d Mr Das told the BBC.",

      "India makes historic landing near Moon's south pole",
      "The year India reached the Moon - and aimed for the Sun",
      "But India\u2019s space programme has always had to work with a tight budget in a country with conflicting needs and demands. Photographs from the 1960s and 70s show scientists carrying rockets and satellites on cycles or even a bullock cart.",
      "Decades later and after several successful interplanetary missions, Isro\u2019s budget remains modest. This year, India\u2019s budgetary allocation for its space programme is 130bn rupees ($1.55bn) - Nasa\u2019s budget for the year is $25bn.",
      "Mr Das says one of the main reasons why Isro\u2019s missions are so cheap is the fact that all its technology is home-grown and machines are manufactured in India.",
      "In 1974, after Delhi conducted its first nuclear test and the West imposed an embargo, banning transfer of technology to India, the restrictions were \u201cturned into a blessing in disguise\u201d for the space programme, he adds.",
      "\u201cOur scientists used it as an incentive to develop their own technology. All the equipment they needed was manufactured indigenously - and the salaries and cost of labour were decidedly less here than in the US or Europe.\u201d",
      "Science writer Pallava Bagla says that unlike Isro, Nasa outsources satellite manufacturing to private companies and also takes out insurance for its missions, which add to their costs.",
      "\u201cAlso, unlike Nasa, India doesn't do engineering models which are used for testing a project before the actual launch. We do only a single model and it's meant to fly. It's risky, there are chances of crash, but that's the risk we take. And we are able to take it because it\u2019s a government programme.\u201d",
      "Mylswamy Annadurai, chief of India\u2019s first and second Moon missions and Mars mission, told the BBC that Isro employs far fewer people and pays lower salaries,  which makes Indian projects competitive.",

      "The tight budget for the projects, he said, sometimes sent them back to the drawing board, allowed them to think out of the box and led to new innovations.",
      "\u201cFor Chandrayaan-1, the allocated budget was $89m and that was okay for the original configuration. But subsequently, it was decided that the spacecraft would carry a Moon impact probe which meant an additional 35kg.\u201d",
      "Scientists had two choices - use a heavier rocket to carry the mission, but that would cost more, or remove some of the hardware to lighten the load.",
      "\u201cWe chose the second option. We reduced the number of thrusters from 16 to eight and pressure tanks and batteries were reduced from two to one.\u201d",
      "Reducing the number of batteries, Mr Annadurai says, meant the launch had to take place before the end of 2008.",
      "\u201cThat would give the spacecraft two years while it went around the Moon without encountering a long solar eclipse, which would impact its ability to recharge. So we had to maintain a strict work schedule to meet the launch deadline.\u201d",
      "Mangalyaan cost so little, Mr Annadurai says, \u201cbecause we used most of the hardware we had already designed for Chandrayaan-2 after the second Moon mission got delayed\u201d.",
      "Mr Bagla says India\u2019s space programme coming at such low cost is \u201can amazing feat\u201d. But as India scales up, the cost could rise.",
      "At the moment, he says, India uses small rocket launchers because they don't have anything stronger. But that means India's spacecraft take much longer to reach their destination.",

      "\u201cWe used Mother Earth's gravity to nudge us to the Moon. It took us weeks and a lot of resourceful planning. Isro has mastered this and done it successfully so many times.\u201d",
      "But, Mr Bagla says, India has announced plans to send a manned mission to the Moon by 2040 and it would need a more powerful rocket to fly the astronauts there quicker.",
      "The government recently said work on this new rocket had already been approved and it would be ready by 2032. This Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV) will be able to carry more weight but also cost more.",
      "Also, Mr Bagla says, India is in the process of opening up the space sector to private players and it\u2019s unlikely that costs will remain so low once that happens.",

      "The Dragon's Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from historic launch pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 9:29 p.m. EST, lighting up the night sky for miles around as it climbed away atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust.",
      "After boosting the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the first stage, making its fifth flight, peeled away, reversed course and headed back to an on-target landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station while the second stage continued the climb to space.",
      "The landing marked SpaceX's 57th successful booster recovery at the Florida Space Force station and its 363rd overall, including California flights and droneship landings.",
      "Just under 10 minutes after liftoff, the vacuum-optimized engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage shut down and one minute later, the Dragon was released to fly on its own. If all goes well, it will catch up with the space station Tuesday morning and move in for docking at the lab's forward port at 10:15 a.m.",
      "One of the first items on the agenda is a test Friday to determine the Cargo Dragon's ability to boost the space station's orbit slightly using its aft-facing thrusters. The ISS is routinely re-boosted by Russian Progress freighters and Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ships, but Friday's test will be a first for SpaceX.",
      "The California rocket builder is under contract to NASA to build a powerful space tug of sorts that can be used to safely drive the ISS back into the atmosphere when the lab complex is retired in the 2030 timeframe. The vehicle is needed to make sure the station breaks up over a stretch of ocean well away from populated areas and shipping lanes.",
      "During the test Friday, the Cargo Dragon's aft thrusters will fire for about 12 minutes.",
      "\"The data that we're going to collect from this reboost and attitude control demonstration will be very helpful, informing SpaceX analyses on how the system performs,\" said Jared Metter, SpaceX director of flight reliability. \"This data is going to lead to future capabilities, namely the US de-orbit vehicle.\"",
      "Reboost aside, the Cargo Dragon is loaded with slightly more than 6,000 pounds of equipment and supplies, including 2,022 pounds of science gear, 2,119 pounds of crew clothing, food and other supplies, 377 pounds of spacewalk equipment, 525 pounds of space station hardware and 44 pounds of computer equipment.",

      "\"While some of you might think that wood in space seems a little counterintuitive, researchers hope that this investigation demonstrates that a wooden satellite can be more sustainable and less polluting for the environment than conventional satellites,\" said Meghan Everett, the ISS deputy project scientist.",
      "\"The main objective here is to determine whether wood can be used in space, and to do this, researchers will measure the temperature and strain of the wooden structure and see how it might change in the vacuum environment of space with atomic oxygen and radiation conditions as well.\"",
      "As with all station-bound Dragon cargo ships, the crew supplies include fresh food and special treats for holiday meals.",
      "Bill Spetch, ISS operations and integration manager, said the \"food kit\" includes \"citrus, apples, sweet onions, blueberries, radishes, etc,\" along with lobster, crab and quail for holiday meals. A variety of cheeses is on board as well as fresh coffee and personal items requested by each crew member.",
      "Mounted in the Dragon's unpressurized trunk section is the Coronal Diagnostic Experiment, or CODEX, an instrument that will be mounted outside the space station to learn more about how charged particles in the solar wind are heated to millions of degrees and accelerated to enormous velocities, affecting Earth's space environment and the rest of the solar system.",
      "Inside the station, the astronauts will have a variety of new experiments and instruments to operate and monitor, including one called ARTEMOSS that will examine how Antarctic moss tolerates the space radiation and microgravity environment to learn more about how plants might be used in future life support systems.",

    "story": [
      "John Fervier, chairman of Georgia's State Election Board, is a mild-mannered corporate executive with a dry wit and an aversion to the spotlight. Yet in recent weeks he found himself at the center of a political storm as three of his MAGA-oriented board members pushed through rules that many believed would have caused chaos and confusion in Georgia during the presidential election.",
      "The pro-Trump faction, which forms a majority of the board, passed one rule that would have required county election officials to hand-count every paper ballot on election night and another rule that required a \"reasonable inquiry\" before an election could be certified.",
      "Both rules were ultimately rejected by Georgia courts, though the rulings have been appealed. Fervier talked to CBS News \u2014his first sit down with a national outlet\u2014 about how he thinks the election has gone so far and what he's expecting in the coming days.",
      "The interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.",
      "Dan Klaidman:\u00a0 How's the election going so far from your vantage point? You've been out there, traveling around, talking to poll workers, election administrators.",
      "John Fervier: As chairman of the state election board, I felt it was necessary for me to have boots on the ground, to go out there and see what's actually happening, specifically for Fulton County, because there were a lot of allegations, mostly unfounded allegations, from the 2020 election.",
      "But I also wanted to see what was going on across the state. So last week, I was in South Georgia, I visited Camden County, visited Glynn County, and I have been to several locations in Gwinnett County. Now I've been to nine different locations in Fulton County.\u00a0 I've visited close to 15 polling locations now, and all I've seen is a very smooth, well-run, well-organized election.",
      "I talked to people operating the poll pads, to voters. I talked to these security officers, and I talk to all the election monitors, whether they're from the Democratic Party, Republican Party, or even the Libertarian Party, I just want to get their feeling of how things are going. I feel confident with the laws and the policies and procedures that are in place that we have a very secure election.",
      "Klaidman:\u00a0 You mentioned Fulton County, which was the object of a lot of the controversy back in 2020 and threats against poll workers \u2014and people, including former President Trump, casting doubt on whether they ran a fair election. This past weekend, the state Republican party filed lawsuits over the county's decision to allow people to drop off absentee ballots after the Friday deadline. A judge rejected their claim.",
      "Fervier: Well, it's a lot of disinformation being put out there. It's people that just don't understand or are actually just trying to create chaos.",
      "There is no prohibition in statute of law that would keep a county from keeping their registrar's office open on the weekend to collect absentee ballots. Some people want to say they're continuing voting or continue doing this or that? No, it's just people that are just dropping off their absentee ballots. They could drop them off at the post office. They can hand them over at the register's office. They can hand them in on Election Day or during early voting period, or on the weekends if that's what the county so desires. And that's not against the statute.",
      "Klaidman:\u00a0 So you think this is an effort to sow distrust in the election, or to suppress the vote?",
      "Fervier:\u00a0 I don't understand why anybody opposed it. Frankly, if you're worried about ballot security, you should be in favor of this because they're actually delivering them to a registrar and not putting a truckload of them in a mailbox someplace. So to me, I don't know why you'd be opposed to this, and I've seen some people online using this to try to create chaos.",
      "Russia election interference in Georgia",
      "Klaidman: The FBI and U.S. intelligence community have said Russia has tried to interfere with the U.S. election.\u00a0 Last week the FBI linked a video purporting to show voter fraud in Georgia to Russian influence actors.",
      "Fervier: To me, the bigger threat is the organic stuff that's coming from within our country. You know, there are groups of people out there, they call themselves the Patriots or the Proud Boys or Antifa or whatever, and those are the ones that scare me more than the Russian bots, because they have organized groups out there that cause issues.",
      "I've seen that on the State Election Board. You'll have these people that will just gin up all this anxiety over issues and they're just trying to create chaos and sow doubt and confusion in the election.",
      "Klaidman: Have you seen any evidence of fraud?",

      "They want to talk about all these dead people voting. I haven't seen that.",

But this mass amount of people, they talk about mass amounts of dead people, or mass amount of illegal immigrants, or massive amount of anything, it's just not happening. It's not reality. But if you listen to some of these people on the internet or on Twitter you would think it's just a big problem. It's just not.",
      "Klaidman: As the chairman of the State Election Board, (you) have been at the center of a controversy in Georgia over this election on the board itself.\u00a0 The MAGA-oriented majority pushed through some rules that could have delayed certification of the election, including a requirement that ballots be handcounted to ensure that (they) matched the number counted by machines, as well as one that allowed for a \"reasonable inquiry\" to look into potential fraud before certification.\u00a0 What do you think those board members' motives were?",
      "Fervier: You'll have to ask them their motive.\u00a0 My positions for opposing these are well known, and I state them in the board meetings themselves. They think that these rules will enhance security of the elections. I don't share that opinion with them.",
      "Some of these rules seem to be fairly innocuous, until you start understanding exactly how they work. I oppose them because I don't think they're grounded in statute or allowed by law.\u00a0 I'm a small-government kind of guy. I don't believe in the power of boards. I believe in the power of the legislature. The legislature is the ones that should be making election law, not state boards.",

      "Klaidman: There's been concern, not just in Georgia but around the country, that some of these local election boards may simply refuse to certify their elections.",
      "Fervier: The statute says that at 5 p.m. on the Monday following the election, the board \"shall certify\" the results of the election. It doesn't say \"maybe.\" It doesn't say \"probably.\" They have no discretion there.",
      "Klaidman: How concerned are you that one or more members of one of these boards refuse to certify as an act of civil disobedience?",
      "Fervier: Well, I think that's likely to happen, having \u2014frankly, I'll be shocked if there wasn't anyone in the state of Georgia that didn't refuse to certify. I would be more concerned if I thought that a (full) board refused to certify. I think that that creates a significant problem. An individual won't stop the certification. I am greatly concerned about if a board refuses to.",
      "Klaidman:\u00a0What recourse is there if that happens?",
      "Fervier: If an individual refuses certifying, I could see somebody bringing a case before the state election board because they refuse to follow the law. It'll be interesting to see if that occurs. We can also refer cases to the attorney general's office or the local D.A. for prosecution.",
      "Why is the election denial movement still strong?",
      "Klaidman: What sort of insights have you gleaned over this past almost year, since you've been on the board about this election denial movement that's been such a stubborn part of our politics?",
      "Fervier: I don't think people give enough credit to the chaos and confusion that was caused by COVID. In the 2020 election, when you had counties that found it very difficult to hire election workers or qualified election workers, you had people that wouldn't go to the polls and vote by absentee ballot in record numbers. I think that there was a lot of human error that occurred in 2020 but I have yet to see any actual fraud, and I've looked at hundreds, if not thousands of pages of evidence that's been put before me. And all that (alleged) fraud has been disproven time and time again, by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, by the FBI, by reporters, by Republicans, by Democrats. I mean, it's been disproven, and yet people can't seem to get past it.",

      "Fervier: I would tell you that for our board, the threats were spiking back in the August-September time frame, when all the rules were being proposed for our board. They've significantly reduced in the last couple weeks.",
      "Klaidman: You received death threats?",
      "Fervier: I've received some.\u00a0 But as I go around to the polls, I haven't heard of a single instance of any threats. There was only two instances I've heard of where the police had to be notified, and it was because voters were wearing campaigning gear that they shouldn't have been wearing. You're not allowed to wear partisan gear within 150 feet of the polls.",
      "Klaidman: Are you worried about physical violence?",
      "Fervier: I think that we need to be prepared for it. There are crazy people out there, crazy people on the right and the left, and emotions and passions are high. Every polling place I've been at has had security officers there, which gives me a lot of confidence, and gives the voters and election workers a lot of confidence.\u00a0 It's something we have to be concerned about but I haven't heard of or seen any threats yet.",
      "Klaidman: We used to take for granted that the people who administer our elections did so in a nonpartisan way. Can we still do that?",
      "Fervier: We've all got opinions. The question is whether you can be nonpartisan in your work. My position is nonpartisan by statute, and I take that extremely seriously. I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican, libertarian, Green Party. It doesn't matter to me \u2014 everybody deserves a voice. Everybody deserves to vote. And it's extremely important to me that all of us in the election system, whether it's the poll workers or the poll superintendents or the boards or anybody, act in a nonpartisan manner.",
      "Klaidman: What's your day look like on Election Day?",
      "Fervier: Busy, busy, busy. I'm going to start out at 7 a.m. in the polls and probably finish up at midnight with the secretary of state's office, watching all the returns come in. I would like to hit 10 to 15 polls during the day at least. And when I go into a poll, I want to shake the hand of every poll worker there, because I am extremely grateful for the hard work and the time and their patience and what they've done over the last three, four weeks in bringing about a safe and secure election for Georgia. These people work hard, and they deserve our appreciation.",

      "Musk lawyer Chris Gober said the final two recipients before Tuesday's presidential election will be in Arizona on Monday and Michigan on Tuesday.",
      "Gober said the \"winners\" of the giveaway are chosen based on their personal stories, and they sign a contract with America PAC to serve as a spokesperson.",
      "\"The $1 million recipients are not chosen by chance,\" Gober said Monday. \"We know exactly who will be announced as the $1 million recipient today and tomorrow.\"",
      "Musk was again a no-show in court on Monday, the day before the 2024 presidential election. Last week, the billionaire did not appear in court despite a judge's order that \"all parties must be present.\"",
      "Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner filed a civil lawsuit against Musk and his super PAC, alleging the $1 million sweepstakes is trying to influence voters in the election.",
      "Krasner had called the sweepstakes a scam violating state election law and asked it to be shut down.",
      "Chris Young, the director of America PAC, testified that the recipients are vetted ahead of time, to \"feel out their personality, (and) make sure they were someone whose values aligned\" with the group.",
      "The disclosures prompted a lawyer for Krasner to call the effort a \"scam\" that is \"designed to actually influence a national election.\"",
      "Musk's lawyers, in closing arguments, called it \"core political speech\" given that participants sign a petition endorsing the U.S. Constitution. They said Krasner's legal bid to shut down the sweepstakes under Pennsylvania law was moot because there would be no more Pennsylvania winners before the program ends Tuesday.",
      "Krasner believes that violates state election law and contradicts what Musk promised when he announced the giveaways during an appearance with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 19: \"We're going to be awarding a million dollars randomly to people who have signed the petition every day from now until the election,\" Musk vowed.",
      "Young also acknowledged that the PAC made the recipients sign nondisclosure agreements.",
      "In an Oct. 20 social media post shown in court, Musk said anyone signing the petition had \"a daily chance of winning $1M!\"",
      "Summers grilled him on Musk's use of both the words \"chance\" and \"randomly,\" prompting Young, who also serves as the PAC's treasurer, to concede the latter was not \"the word I would have selected.\"",

      "\"This was all a political marketing masquerading as a lottery,\" Krasner testified. \"That's what it is. A grift.\"",
      "Lawyers for Musk and the PAC said they do not plan to extend the lottery beyond Tuesday.",
      "Krasner said the first three winners, starting on Oct. 19, came from Pennsylvania in the days leading up to the state's Oct. 21 voter registration deadline.",
      "Other winners came from the battleground states of Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Michigan. It's not clear if anyone has yet received the money.",
      "The PAC pledged they would get it by Nov. 30, according to an exhibit shown in court.",
      "More than 1 million people from the seven states have registered for the sweepstakes by signing a petition saying they support the right to free speech and to bear arms, the first two amendments to the U.S. Constitution.",
      "Krasner questioned how the PAC might use their data, which it will have on hand well past the election.",
      "\"They were scammed for their information,\" Krasner said. \"It has almost unlimited use.\"",
      "Summers said Musk is \"the heartbeat of America PAC,\" and the person announcing the winners and presenting the checks.",
      "\"He was the one who presented the checks, albeit large cardboard checks,\" Summers said. \"We don't really know if there are any real checks.\"",
      "Foglietta presided over the case at Philadelphia City Hall after Musk and the PAC lost an effort to move it to federal court.",

But I would miss his orientation, meeting his teacher, and other festivities surrounding this rite of passage for my first born.",
      "As I stood in a manufacturing facility in York, Pennsylvania, that afternoon, waiting for former President Donald Trump to talk to me, the pangs of mom guilt felt particularly sharp.",
      "I've covered four presidential campaigns, but this one is my first as a mom. This election of a lifetime comes at a precious time in my sons' lives. I've not wanted to miss out on an assignment, and I've not wanted to miss out on my kids, ages three and one. I marvel that I get to witness history for a living. And yet I am absent for important moments at home.",
      "But motherhood has changed the way I think about politics and elections for the better. Our process of selecting a leader also serves as a pulse check of the country, and I see a big part of my job as reporting on what Americans say they need and care about. People clearly have a lot of concerns crowding their daily lives: things are expensive, the world seems on edge, and the future feels uncertain. They want a better, safer life for their children \u2014 that's the essence of the American dream. There are just so many different views about what that looks like.",
      "You don't have to be a mom to understand these things; you just have to be a human. But this time around, I find I have more empathy than I once did. I also worry more than I used to. And some of the biggest issues in this particular election are ones I'm facing myself.",
      "My first question to Trump that day in August was about the child tax credit. I spend half of my take-home salary on child care. As someone who buys gallons of milk a week for my sons, I cringe at the grocery bill. I am concerned about what my child might be exposed to at school, and whether he is physically safe in the building. I went through fertility treatments to have my first son. I know what it's like to desperately want a child. And I'm lucky enough to know the joy of becoming a parent. I also suffered from postpartum depression. I know how difficult it is to navigate a medical and mental health system that tends to leave mothers behind.",

The resources I have are not available to most. That is an injustice. And it's setting women back.",
      "All of this informs my reporting. Many of the voters I've met on the campaign trail just need someone to hear them. And I've been trying to listen. I'm in awe of people willing to pour their hearts out to a reporter \u2014 a complete stranger \u2014 in the hopes of making a difference. I won't forget sitting in a living room in North Carolina as a couple described their difficult IVF journey to me. And I won't forget a woman I met at a Trump rally in Virginia who told me her son had died from an overdose.",
      "To have conversations like those, I've missed some conversations at my own dinner table. I was in a battleground state instead of attending back-to-school night. Lately, I've spent more nights in hotel rooms than in my kids' rooms, tucking them into bed.",
      "But my boys are on my mind at every minute, from the big interviews to the small scenes. I got to FaceTime them from the floor of the Republican National Convention. I ordered their Halloween costumes while on the Trump press plane, flying somewhere over the Midwest. I bring them home books from the states I've visited so they can learn about where I've been. And everytime I see a construction vehicle on the trail, I take photos for my digger-loving three-year-old. (Yes, \"the garbage truck\" was a hit.)",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 14:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A former police officer in Columbus, Ohio, who shot and killed Andre Hill has been found guilty in the shooting.",
    "story": [
      "A former Ohio police officer was convicted of murder Monday in the shooting of Andre Hill, a Black man who was holding a cellphone and keys when he was killed. Officer Adam Coy, who served nearly 20 years with the Columbus police force, shot Hill four times in a garage nearly four years ago. Coy, who is White, was fired after the shooting. He later told jurors that he thought Hill was holding a silver revolver that turned out to be keys.",
      "\"I thought I was going to die,\" he testified. It was only after he rolled over Hill's body and saw the keys that he realized there was no gun, Coy said. \"I knew at that point I made a mistake. I was horrified.\"",
      "Coy, who was partially blocked from view by his grim-faced attorneys, did not visibly react to the verdict but muffled cries could be heard in the courtroom when it was announced. Prosecutors asked that the former officer be sentenced immediately, but Franklin County Judge Stephen McIntosh instead set a sentencing date of Nov. 25.",
      "Coy, who is undergoing cancer treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma, was devastated by the verdict, said defense attorney Mark Collins, who slightly shook his head \"no\" when the verdict was read. He later promised to appeal.",
      "Police body camera footage showed Hill coming out of the garage of a friend's house holding up a cellphone in his left hand, his right hand not visible, seconds before he was fatally shot by Coy. Almost 10 minutes passed before officers at the scene began to aid Hill, who lay bleeding on the garage floor. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.",
      "Weeks after the December 2020 shooting, the mayor forced out the police chief after a series of fatal police shootings of Black men and children. Columbus later reached a $10 million settlement with Hill's family, the largest in city history. The Columbus City Council also passed Andre's Law, which requires police officers to render immediate medical attention to an injured suspect.",
      "Prosecutors said Hill, 47, had followed the officer's commands and was never a threat to Coy, who now faces at least 15 years in prison. The jury also found him guilty of reckless homicide and felonious assault.",
      "\"We're taught do what the cops tell you to do and you can survive that encounter,\" Franklin County assistant prosecutor Anthony Pierson said during closing arguments. \"That's not what happened here.\"",
      "Shawna Barnett, one of Hill's sisters, said she hoped the verdict would send a message that violence from police won't be tolerated.",
      "\"It's been way too long, but I'm glad it's over,\" she said. \"It's time to stop. It's time to make everything fair.\"",
      "Brian Steel, president of the police union in Columbus, said he was shocked by the murder conviction and that it would cause ripple effects for officers in Ohio and beyond.  \"Your split-second decision can now be led to murder,\" he said. \"It is absolutely insane.\"  \"Officers are willing to die for their community, they are willing to die for this job,\" Steel said. \"They do not want to go to prison for this job.\"",
      "The officer's attorneys argued that Hill's lack of a weapon did not matter because Coy thought his life was in danger. \"He wasn't reckless, he was reasonable,\" Collins  said during the trial.",
      "Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who has represented Hill's family, said the verdict showed no one is above the law and sent a message that \"accountability in law enforcement is not optional.\"",
      "\"Andre was an unarmed, innocent man, and his life was taken with disregard for the duty to protect and serve,\" Crump said in a statement.",
      "Coy had gone to the neighborhood to investigate a complaint about someone inside a running vehicle when he first encountered Hill sitting in an SUV. Hill told Coy he was waiting for a friend to come outside.",
      "The officer said he thought Hill seemed dismissive and then suspicious after Hill walked to a house and knocked on the door before entering the garage.",
      "Prosecutors questioned Coy on why he didn't ask Hill his name or call for backup if he was so concerned,\u00a0CBS affiliate WBNS-TV reported. Coy said that Hill only partially obeyed his commands and was hiding his right hand.",
      "\"I thought he was going to draw. I drew my gun and fired four shots,\" Coy said.",
      "According to WBNS-TV, prosecutors asked Coy if Hill was obeying his commands, and Coy responded, \"Partially, by hiding himself. He had his right hand behind his leg.\"",
      "Coy was questioned on whether he asked Hill to show his hands, the station reported.",
      "Coy said, \"It happened too fast, sir.\"",
      "Coy said he lost sight of Hill and suspected he might be trying to break into the house. Coy used a flashlight to spot Hill in the garage and told him to come out, the officer testified.",
      "When Hill walked toward him, Coy said he could not see the man's right hand and then saw what he thought was a revolver. He said he yelled, \"Gun! Gun!\" and then fired at Hill.",
      "Family and friends said Hill \u2014 a father and grandfather \u2014 was devoted to his family and was a skilled tradesman who dreamed of one day owning his own restaurant, after years of work as a chef and restaurant manager.",
      "Coy had a lengthy history of complaints from residents, with more than three dozen filed against him since he joined the department in 2002, according to his personnel file. A dozen of the complaints were for the use of force. All but a few were marked \"unfounded\" or \"not sustained.\"",

      "Because Election Day isn't a U.S. holiday, many American adults are at work on the Tuesday following the first Monday of November, the day designated for federal, state and local general elections. But 28 states and several thousand companies guarantee workers time off to vote.",

      "Why is Election Day on a Tuesday?",
      "Americans continue to vote based largely on the needs of 19th century farmers. As Bloomberg's Claire Suddath noted, Election Day lands on the day deemed most convenient for those legally allowed to vote in 1845: White men.",
      "As the most common occupation 179 years ago was farming, and many attended church on Sunday but also needed a full day to ride into town to vote, Congress went with the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, when most planting and harvesting was done.",
      "These days, many working Americans are at their jobs on Election Day, while their children have the day off from schools that double as polling sites, often leaving parents scrambling for childcare. The difficulties prompted the nonprofit Politisit and partners to offer free Election Day child care options in multiple states, including Georgia, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas.",
      "Which states have voting leave laws?",
      "At a time when 80% of employed Americans work on weekdays, it can be hard for many to take off on a Tuesday to vote, prompting some states to adopt measures such as early voting and mail-in balloting.",
      "Currently, 28 states and the District of Columbia have laws requiring employers to give workers time off to vote, with most stipulating that workers not take a financial hit.

    "summary": "How the U.S. election plays out could have a major impact on the millions of Americans enrolled in Medicare. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "On the campaign trail, both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are eager to portray themselves as guardians of Medicare. Each presidential candidate accuses the other of backing spending cuts and other policies that would damage the health insurance program for older Americans.",
      "But the election's outcome could alter the very nature of the nearly 60-year-old federal program. More than half of Medicare beneficiaries are already enrolled in plans, called Medicare Advantage, run by commercial insurers, and if Trump wins, that proportion is expected to grow \u2014 perhaps dramatically.",
      "Trump and many congressional Republicans have already taken steps to aggressively promote Medicare Advantage. And Project 2025, a political wish list produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation for the next presidency, calls for making insurer-run plans the default enrollment option for Medicare.",
      "Such a change would effectively privatize the program, because people tend to stick with the plans they're initially enrolled in, health analysts say. Trump has repeatedly tried to distance himself from Project 2025, though the document's authors include numerous people who worked in his first administration.",
      "Conservatives say Medicare beneficiaries are better off in the popular Advantage plans, which offer more benefits than the traditional, government-run program. Critics say increasing insurers' control of the program would trap consumers in health plans that are costlier to taxpayers and that can restrict their care, including by imposing onerous prior authorization requirements for some procedures.",
      "\"Traditional Medicare will wither on the vine,\" said Robert Berenson, a former official in the Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton administrations who's now a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning research group.",
      "While the fate of Medicare has gotten scant attention so far in the campaign, the different visions under Trump versus Harris indicate the high stakes.",
      "A candidate's position on protecting Medicare and Social Security is the most important health care issue, or among the most important, in determining 63% of Americans' vote in the presidential election, according to a September poll by Gallup and West Health, a family of nonprofit and nonpartisan organizations focused on health care and aging.",
      "Medicare, which covers about 66 million people, is funded largely by payroll taxes. At age 65, most Americans are automatically enrolled in Medicare coverage for hospitalization and doctor visits, known as Part A and Part B, though others must sign up. Consumers must also sign up for other aspects of Medicare, specifically drug coverage (Part D) and supplemental plans from insurers that pay for costs that aren't covered by traditional Medicare, such as extended stays in skilled nursing facilities and cost sharing.",
      "People on Medicare pay premiums plus as much as 20% of the cost of their care.",
      "Medicare Advantage plans typically combine coverage for hospital and outpatient care and prescriptions, while eliminating the 20% coinsurance requirement and capping customers' annual out-of-pocket costs. Many of the plans don't charge an extra monthly premium, though some carry a deductible \u2014 an amount patients must pay each year before coverage kicks in.",
      "Sometimes the plans throw in extras like coverage for eye exams and glasses or gym memberships.",
      "However, they control costs by limiting patients to networks of approved doctors and hospitals, with whom the plans negotiate payment rates. Some hospitals and doctors refuse to do business with some or all Medicare Advantage plans, making those networks narrow or limited. Traditional Medicare, in comparison, is accepted by nearly every hospital and doctor.",
      "Medicare's popularity is one reason both candidates are pledging to enhance it. Last month, Harris released a plan that would add benefits including care for hearing and vision, and long-term in-home health care. The costs would be covered by savings from expanding Medicare's negotiations with drugmakers, reducing fraud, and increasing discounts drugmakers pay for certain brand-name drugs in the program, according to Harris' campaign.",
      "Trump's campaign said he would prioritize home care benefits and support unpaid family caregivers through tax credits and reduced red tape.",
      "The Trump campaign also noted enhancements to Medicare Advantage plans during his tenure as president, such as increasing access to telehealth and expanding supplemental benefits for seniors with chronic diseases.",
      "But far less attention has been paid to whether to give even more control of Medicare to private insurers. Joe Albanese, a senior policy analyst at Paragon Health Institute, a right-leaning research group, said \"a Trump administration and GOP Congress would be more friendly\" to the idea.",
      "The concept of letting private insurers run Medicare isn't new. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, asserted in 1995 that traditional Medicare would fade away if its beneficiaries could pick between the original program and private plans.",
      "The shift to Medicare Advantage was accelerated by legislation in 2003 that created Medicare's drug benefit and gave private health plans a far greater role in the program.",
      "Lawmakers thought private insurers could better contain costs. Instead, the plans have cost more. In 2023, Medicare Advantage plans cost the government and taxpayers about 6% \u2014 or $27 billion \u2014 more than original Medicare, though some research shows they provide better care.",
      "The Trump administration promoted Medicare Advantage in emails during the program's open enrollment period each year, but support for the privately run plans has become bipartisan as they have grown.",
      "\"It helps inject needed competition into a government-run program and has proven to be more popular with those who switch,\" said Roger Severino, lead architect of Project 2025's section on the Department of Health and Human Services. He served as director of HHS' civil rights office during the Trump administration.",
      "But enrollees who want to switch back to traditional Medicare may not be able to. If they try to buy supplemental coverage for the 20% of costs Medicare doesn't cover, they may find they have to pay an unaffordable premium. Unless they enroll in the plans close to the time they first become eligible for Medicare, usually at age 65, insurers selling those supplemental plans can deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of preexisting conditions.",
      "\"More members of Congress are hearing from constituents who are horrified and realize they are trapped in these plans,\" said Andrea Ducas, vice president of health policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy organization.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 09:41:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The appeal stemmed from a congressional map enacted in January that includes two majority-Black districts.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to take up a long-running redistricting dispute in Louisiana that could determine whether the state maintains a congressional map that includes two majority-Black districts after the 2024 election.",
      "The court's decision to hear the appeal from a group of Black voters and the state marks at least the third time it will step into the legal battle over voting lines for Louisiana's U.S. House districts that were drawn after the 2020 Census. The justices will hear arguments next year, with a decision expected by summer 2025.",
      "The most recent congressional map, enacted in January after federal courts rejected earlier voting bounds, remains in place for the upcoming election, as the Supreme Court in May gave the green light for it to be used this cycle.",
      "A three-judge district court panel had blocked the state from using the newly drawn map in any upcoming election after finding it to be an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. But the high court put that decision on hold.",
      "The winding fight over Louisiana's congressional redistricting plan began in 2022, when Republican state lawmakers adopted a map consisting of five majority-White House districts and one majority-Black district even though roughly one-third of the state's population is Black.",
      "Black voters and civil rights groups successfully challenged the plan's legality, arguing it diluted the voting strength of minority residents in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.",
      "Agreeing with the challengers, U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick blocked Louisiana from using the lines drawn in 2022 in any elections and gave state lawmakers the opportunity to draw a new map that included an additional majority-Black congressional district.",
      "While the litigation was underway, the Supreme Court cleared the way for Louisiana to proceed with redrawing its congressional district lines, as Dick had ordered. A federal appeals court then set a Jan. 15 deadline for state lawmakers to craft a new redistricting plan with a second-majority Black district.",
      "Shortly after the state legislature convened for a special session to draw new lines, it adopted a map that lawmakers said satisfied the district court's ruling and also achieved certain political objectives. The plan protects certain \"pivotal\" Republican incumbents,\u00a0 according to GOP state senators, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, the only woman in Louisiana's congressional delegation.",
      "But the new map changed the district of GOP Rep. Garret Graves, who backed Gov. Jeff Landry's Republican opponent in the 2023 gubernatorial race and didn't publicly support Scalise in his unsuccessful bid for House speaker.",
      "Graves' District 6 was reconfigured to create the second majority-minority district. It now stretches from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge, in the southeast, and connects predominantly Black populations from Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge.",
      "The new plan kicked off the challenge that is now before the Supreme Court, as a group of 12 \"non-African-American\" voters argued it is a racial gerrymander that violates the 14th Amendment. They claimed that the legislature engaged in \"explicit, racial segregation of voters and intentional discrimination\" based on race and created two majority-Black districts without considering traditional redistricting criteria.",
      "A divided three-judge district court panel sided with the voters and concluded that the map is an impermissible racial gerrymander. That decision, though, was halted by the Supreme Court after Louisiana Republicans and Black voters successfully sought to use the new map in the upcoming elections.",
      "State GOP officials have lambasted the legal process that led them back to the high court again, lamenting in a filing to the justices that they are \"stuck in an endless game of ping-pong \u2014 and the state is the ball, not a player.\"",
      "They told the justices the litigation over the redistricting plan forced them into a \"lose-lose situation\" \u2014 the legislature had to consider race to remedy the Section 2 violation the lower courts identified in the first map from 2022, but in doing so, considered race too much, as the three-judge district court panel found when it evaluated the new voting lines.",
      "\"Cases like this illustrate that there is seemingly no end to the torture-by-litigation that States endure after every redistricting cycle,\" the state Republican officials wrote in their filing.",

      "Opposite Jansen's plea were more than 290 public comments, many of which called for an end to vaccine mandates or taxpayer funding of the vaccines, neither of which are happening in the district.

      "He said the board had overstepped the relationship between patients and their doctors \u2014 and possibly opened a door to blocking other vaccines or treatments.",
      "Board members in favor of the decision argued people can get vaccinated elsewhere, and that providing the shots was equivalent to signing off on their safety. (Some people may be reluctant to get vaccinated or boosted because of misinformation about the shots despite evidence that they\u2019re safe and have saved millions of lives.)",
      "The people getting vaccinated at the health department \u2014 including people without housing, people who are homebound and those in long-term care facilities or in the immigration process \u2014 had no other options, Jansen and Aberasturi said.",
      "\"I\u2019ve been homeless in my lifetime, so I understand how difficult it can be when you\u2019re ... trying to get by and get ahead,\" Aberasturi said. \"This is where we should be stepping in and helping.",

      "Aberasturi said he plans to ask at the next board meeting if the health department can at least be allowed to vaccinate older patients and residents of long-term care facilities, adding that the board is supposed to be caring for the \"health and well-being\" of the district's residents. \"But I believe the way we went about this thing is we didn't do that due diligence.\""

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "South Carolina put Richard Moore to death by lethal injection Friday for the 1999 fatal shooting of a convenience store clerk, despite a broad appeal for mercy by parties that included three jurors and the judge from his trial, a former prison director, pastors and the his family.",
      "Moore, 59, was pronounced dead at 6:24 p.m.",
      "TEXAS DEATH ROW INMATE'S LAWYER SAYS 'THERE WAS NO CRIME' AS SHE MAKES LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE HIS LIFE",
      "Moore was convicted of killing the Spartanburg convivence store clerk in September 1999 and sentenced to death two years later. Moore went into the store unarmed, took a gun from the victim when it was pointed at him and fatally shot him in the chest as the victim shot him with a second gun in the arm.",
      "Moore\u2019s lawyers asked Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to reduce his sentence to life in prison without parole because of his spotless prison record and willingness to be a mentor to other inmates. They also said it would be unjust to execute someone for what could be considered self-defense and unfair that Moore, who is Black, was the only inmate on the state\u2019s death row convicted by a jury without any African Americans.",
      "But McMaster refused to grant clemency. No South Carolina governor has reduced a death sentence, and 45 executions have now been carried out since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to restart executions nearly 50 years ago.",
      "This photo provided by Justice 360 shows death row inmate Richard Moore at Kirkland Reception and Evaluation Center in Columbia, S.C., Aug. 17, 2018.\u00a0 (Justice 360 via AP)",
      "Unlike in previous executions, the curtain to the death chamber was open when media witnesses arrived. Moore's last words had already been read by Lindsey Vann, his lawyer of 10 years.",
      "Moore had his eyes closed and his head was pointed toward the ceiling. A prison employee announced the execution could begin at 6:01 p.m. Moore took several deep breaths that sounded like snores over the next minute. Then he took some shallow breaths until about 6:04, when his breathing stopped. Moore showed no obvious signs of discomfort.",
      "Vann cried as the employee announced the execution could start. She clutched a prayer bracelet with a cross. Sitting beside her was a spiritual advisor, his hands on his knees palms up. Vann clutched a prayer bracelet with a cross.",
      "Two members of the victims' family were also present, along with Solicitor Barry Barnette, who was on the prosecution team that convicted Moore. They all watched stoically.",
      "Afterward prison spokeswoman Chrysti Shain read his last words at a news conference.",
      "\"To the family of Mr. James Mahoney, I am deeply sorry for the pain and sorrow I caused you all,\" he said. \"To my children and granddaughters, I love you and am so proud of you. Thank you for the joy you have brought to my life. To all of my family and friends, new and old, thank you for your love and support.\"",
      "His final meal was steak cooked medium, fried catfish and shrimp, scalloped potatoes, green peas, broccoli with cheese, sweet potato pie, German chocolate cake and grape juice.",
      "Three jurors who condemned Moore to death in 2001, including one who wrote Friday, sent letters asking McMaster to change his sentence to life without parole. They were joined by a former state prison director, Moore's trial judge, his son and daughter, a half-dozen childhood friends and several pastors.",
      "They all said Moore, 59, was a changed man who loved God, doted on his new grandchildren the best he could, helped guards keep the peace and mentored other prisoners after his addiction to drugs clouded his judgment and led to the shootout in which James Mahoney was killed, according to the clemency petition.",
      "Moore previously had two execution dates postponed as the state sorted through issues that created a 13-year pause in the death penalty, including companies' refusal to sell the state lethal injection drugs, a hurdle that was solved by passing a secrecy law.",
      "Moore is the second inmate executed in South Carolina since it resumed executions. Four more are out of appeals and the state appears ready to put them to death in five-week intervals through the spring. There are now 30 people on death row.",
      "The governor said before the execution that he would carefully reviewing everything sent by Moore's lawyers and, as is customary, would wait until minutes before the execution starts to announce his decision once he hears by phone that all appeals are finished.",
      "\"Clemency is a matter of grace, a matter of mercy. There is no standard. There is no real law on it,\" McMaster told reporters Thursday.",
      "In an interview for a video that accompanied his clemency petition, Moore expressed remorse for the killing of Mahoney.",
      "\"This is definitely part of my life I wish I could change. I took a life. I took someone\u2019s life. I broke the family of the deceased,\" Moore said. \"I pray for the forgiveness of that particular family.\"",
      "Prosecutors and Mahoney's relatives have not spoken publicly in the weeks leading up to the execution. In the past, family members have said they suffered deeply and want justice to be served.",
      "Moore\u2019s lawyers said his original attorneys did not analyze the crime scene carefully and left unchallenged prosecutors' contention that Moore, who came into the store unarmed, fired at a customer and that his intention from the start was a robbery.",
      "According to their account, the clerk pulled a gun on Moore after the two argued because he was 12 cents short for what he wanted to buy.",
      "Moore said he wrestled the gun from Mahoney's hand and the clerk pulled a second weapon. Moore was shot in the arm and fired back, hitting Mahoney in the chest. Moore then went behind the counter and stole about $1,400.",
      "No one else on South Carolina\u2019s death row started their crime unarmed and with no intention to kill, Moore\u2019s current attorneys say.",
      "Jon Ozmint, a former prosecutor who was director of the South Carolina Department of Corrections from 2003 to 2011 and who added his voice to those seeking clemency, said Moore's case was not the worst-of-the-worst kind of crime that would usually prompt a death penalty case.",
      "There are plenty of people who were not sentenced to death but committed much more heinous crimes, Ozmint said, citing the example of Todd Kohlhepp, who was given a life sentence after pleading guilty to killing seven people including a woman he raped and tortured for days.",
      "Lawyers for Moore, who is Black, also said his trial was not fair. There were no African Americans on the jury even though 20% of Spartanburg County residents were Black.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 The Department of Justice said Monday that federal agents have arrested a Tennessee man with ties to white nationalist groups who they say attempted to use what he believed to be an explosive-laden drone to destroy a Nashville energy facility.",
      "According to court documents, 24-year-old Skyler Philippi is accused of planning to attach several pounds of C-4 explosives to an aerial drone with the intent of destroying an electric substation in Nashville.",
      "The newly unsealed court records reveal that Philippi in July allegedly told a confidential source who was working with the FBI that he wanted to attack several substations to \u201cshock the system.\u201d That confidential source later introduced Philippi to an undercover FBI employee, who began to collect information about Philippi\u2019s plan with other undercover agents.",
      "\u201cPhilippi researched previous attacks on electric substations and concluded that attacking with firearms would not be sufficient,\u201d wrote Angelo DeFeo, an FBI special agent, in the court records released Monday. \u201cPhilippi, therefore, planned to use a drone with explosives attached to it and to fly the drone into the substation.\u201d",
      "Philippi allegedly told undercover law enforcement officials that he was affiliated with several white nationalist and extremist groups, including the National Alliance, which calls for eradicating the Jewish people and other races. Such extremist groups increasingly have viewed attacking the United States\u2019 power grid as a means of disrupting the country.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 19:18:15 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Last Week Tonight\" host, with the help of some \"Uncommitted\" leaders, argued Trump would be miles more dangerous for Muslim and Arab communities.",
    "story": [
      "In the final \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d episode before Election Day, host John Oliver made a last-minute plea for hesitant pro-Palestinian voters to cast their ballot for Vice President Kamala Harris, arguing that she will be easier to hold accountable than former President Donald Trump when it comes to the U.S. role in Israel\u2019s ongoing attacks on Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon.",
      "With just one day left in the presidential campaign, the Democratic nominee continues to struggle to earn the trust of voters who strongly oppose the Biden administration\u2019s nearly unconditional military and diplomatic support for Israel \u2015 specifically in Michigan, a crucial swing state with large Muslim and Arab American populations.",
      "\u201cFirst, let me say I wish Harris had done more to reach out to you, beyond sending Bill Clinton to basically scold you this week,\u201d Oliver said in Sunday\u2019s episode, referring to the former president\u2019s incendiary speech in Michigan, where he defended Israeli military strikes that have killed tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians.",
      "Some pro-Palestinian voters hoped that Harris would do more to reach out to Palestinian Americans after she replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee. But with the vice president publicly claiming that her stance on Gaza policy would essentially be unchanged from Biden\u2019s, many Democratic voters who support a free Palestine are on the fence about whether to continue backing their party\u2019s chosen candidate.",
      "\u201cWhat I have endorsed is that people come out and vote, to not sit on the sideline, regardless of all that has unfolded and happened to you directly or indirectly,\u201d Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud told Democracy Now. \u201cWhat I can assure you is that sitting on the sideline will accomplish nothing.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so, I\u2019ve called on people to vote their moral conscience,\u201d Hammoud said. \u201cTo go out, to at least begin with the local ballot questions, the local elections, and then work their way up to the ballot as they get to that presidential question.\u201d",
      "Oliver pointed to the positions of some Muslim and Arab American leaders with the so-called Uncommitted movement, who organized a protest vote during the primary election which gained so much traction that the movement sent at least 30 delegates to represent the pro-Palestinian vote at the Democratic National Convention, although they were denied a speaking slot.",
      "The movement\u2019s leaders declined to formally endorse Harris after she didn\u2019t meet with them to discuss potential policy changes, nor would she meet with Palestinian families in Michigan whose loved ones have been killed in Gaza. Yet they vehemently warned the movement\u2019s followers against casting their ballot for Trump or a third-party candidate, such as Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee who has won noticeable support from some pro-Palestinian voters after hinging her campaign on calling out Israel\u2019s attacks on Gaza with U.S. weapons.",
      "\u201cThe push for Palestinian human rights will never be easy. But with a second Trump presidency, both civilians in Palestine and our antiwar movement here in our country will suffer,\u201d Uncommitted co-founder Abbas Alawieh said in a Friday ad mobilizing Michigan voters against the Republican candidate.",
      "\ud83d\udea8 Trump's in Dearborn today, spreading lies aimed at Michigan's Arab and Muslim communities. Help raise $50K to make sure Uncommitted Democratic primary voters in Michigan see this anti-Trump ad before Tuesday's election: https://t.co/FL81KcSw1P pic.twitter.com/KG6VbGb3fD",
      "Oliver echoed that sentiment, highlighting Trump\u2019s cozy relationship with right-wing leaders in Israel and his stated plans for the future of Palestinian enclaves, as well as proposals in the right-wing presidential transition blueprint, Project 2025, that threaten aggressive action in the U.S. against pro-Palestinian protests. On top of that, the late-night host stressed that a Trump reelection will reverberate far beyond four years in the White House if he is again given the opportunity to appoint U.S. Supreme Court justices.",
      "Some of the Uncommitted leaders have stressed that they are voting for Harris because she can be more easily pressured to change policy positions. Georgia state Rep. Ruwa Romman recorded a TikTok post last month saying that she voted for the Democrat in her crucial swing state as a \u201cpromise that I and those who stand with me will not stop demanding the end of mass slaughter and violence everywhere.\u201d",
      "Harris told reporters on Sunday in Detroit that she is \u201chonored\u201d to have the support of some Arab American leaders but that she knows the community is \u201cnot a monolith.\u201d",

      "The Biden administration is still approving weapon sales to Israel, despite about two-thirds of Harris voters believing the U.S. should not provide unrestricted assistance to the military if the Israel Defense Forces continue to indiscriminately harm civilians in Gaza and Lebanon, according to a poll released Monday by the Arab American Institute.",
      "\u201cHere is how I look at it: The struggle for justice isn\u2019t just about what happens on Election Day,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fight waged constantly day in, day out \u2015 in protests, on the street, meetings with legislators and in the thousand small actions that cumulatively move the government forward, an inch at a time.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 18:49:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The Milwaukee Election Commission rejected the suggestion by Republicans that poll watchers were being unfairly restricted.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican National Committee on Monday sued the city of Milwaukee, alleging that its election commission unfairly limited poll watchers at three early voting locations in Wisconsin.",
      "The RNC lawsuit claims the commission intends to limit poll watchers on Election Day, but the commission denied that anyone was \u201carbitrarily\u201d limited from observing polls.",
      "\u201cThe Milwaukee Election Commission refutes the claims made by the RNC. Despite the [commission] maintaining open communications with the RNC, including meeting as recently as last night, it seems that filing a lawsuit was their goal all along,\u201d Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Paulina Gutierrez said Monday in a statement.",
      "Observers \u201cmay be subject to reasonable limitations,\u201d Gutierrez said, but \u201cat no point was the Republican Party denied the presence of observing during the in-person absentee voting period, nor will they be denied that presence on Election Day.\u201d",
      "Poll workers are different from watchers \u2014 workers administer elections, while watchers merely observe and can raise challenges \u2014 but an abundance of unruly watchers swarming already inundated workers is a recipe for delay and disruption. In Wisconsin, observers must follow rules set by the commission.",
      "In-person absentee ballot voting began in the state on Oct. 22 and ended on Nov. 3.",
      "The RNC alleges that watchers of in-person absentee and early voting were restricted at three early voting sites \u2014 American Serb Hall, Good Hope Branch Library and the Capitol Drive Voting Center \u2014 in Wisconsin.",
      "At some of these centers, the RNC claims that the commission allowed there to be only one watcher per political party despite there being space for \u201cfar more observers.\u201d Such a limitation instills distrust and causes a \u201clack of voter confidence in our electoral process,\u201d according to the RNC lawsuit.",
      "Wisconsin\u2019s chief inspector decides the conditions for observers and makes that decision based on a number of factors, including space available.",
      "The RNC lawsuit emphasizes that the inspector and commission are obligated to create numerous \u201careas\u201d for observers at polling centers, not just one area.",

      "Not surprisingly, Carlson\u2019s theory that abortions cause hurricanes produced some stormy reactions on social media.",
      "Some posts pointed out that his theory goes against data suggesting that hurricanes have increased even as abortion rates have dropped over the last four decades.",
      "what's funny about this is that the U.S. abortion rate has actually been declining since the 1980s, so by his logic, hurricanes are getting worse in tandem with fewer abortions https://t.co/URh9Gl2jxs",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 17:07:07 -0500",
    "summary": "A Pennsylvania judge found the tech billionaire\u2019s sweepstakes can continue just a day before it was scheduled to end.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk\u2019s pro-Donald Trump America PAC can continue to dole out $1 million daily for its voter giveaway program, a judge in Pennsylvania ruled on Monday.",
      "Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas Judge Angelo Foglietta issued the ruling.",
      "Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner argued the program, which has doled out $16 million so far, was an illegal lottery scheme and requested an injunction.",
      "Musk formally unveiled the $1 million giveaway to registered voters on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, and on America PAC\u2019s website, on Oct. 19. To be entered into the sweepstakes, people must be registered voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin or North Carolina \u2014 all swing states \u2014 and sign a pledge stating that they agree to be a \u201cspokesperson for America PAC\u201d and endorse its statement that the \u201cFirst and Second Amendments guarantee freedom of speech and the right to bear arms.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department sent a letter to America PAC about the program on Oct. 23, informing Musk it may run afoul of federal voting and election laws.",
      "Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner then sued Musk and America PAC on Oct. 28, at which time at least $4 million had already been doled out. Krasner argued that the sweepstakes illegally incentivized voters and only the state of Pennsylvania can operate lottery programs within its borders.",
      "Pennsylvania code states that all lottery proceeds must be used \u201cfor the benefit of those 65 years of age and older,\u201d the district attorney\u2019s office said. The manner in which prizes are claimed, how funds from lotteries are used and even how those funds are disclosed are all controlled by state law and state operators.",
      "Before Monday\u2019s ruling by Foglietta to let the giveaway continue, Musk successfully managed to ensnare the case with brief delays. He attempted to move the case into federal court, kicking off a delay of at least a day as his attorneys argued that Krasner was engaged in a publicity stunt. Musk\u2019s lawyers said the request for a transfer of jurisdictions was proper because the lawsuit involved constitutional and First Amendment issues that were specific to a \u201cfederal election.\u201d A federal judge disagreed and ordered the case back to state court.",
      "But with so few days to go until Election Day, the impact of Krasner\u2019s lawsuit was effectively moot.",
      "When Musk first announced the program, he said that the $1 million would be awarded randomly. In the suit, Krasner pointed out that recipients of the giveaways on Oct. 19 and Oct. 20 did not appear to be \u201cchosen at random because both happened to live near the location of Musk\u2019s pro-Trump rallies and both were in attendance at those rallies.\u201d",
      "According to Reuters, Musk\u2019s lawyer Chris Gober told the judge on Monday that the $1 million wasn\u2019t a \u201cprize to be won\u201d but rather an agreement to fulfill \u201ccontractual obligations to serve as a spokesperson for the PAC.\u201d The money, he argued, was a salary people earned.",
      "Gober suggested there was a difference between declaring recipients \u201crandomly\u201d and \u201cby chance\u201d and that doing the latter would make it a lottery.",
      "\u201cYou just heard this guy say, \u2018My boss, my client, called this random. We promised people that they were going to participate in a random process, but it\u2019s a process where we pre-select people,\u2019\u201d John Summers, lead counsel for the commonwealth, said Monday at the hearing.",
      "As of Sunday, $16 million has been allocated to voters who signed the petition, according to America PAC.",
      "So far, four winners have been declared in Pennsylvania; three winners each were declared in North Carolina, Michigan and Wisconsin; and one person each received the $1 million in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada.",

      "Brendan Carr, a Republican on the Federal Communications Commission, issued a public complaint on X this weekend after reports first emerged that Harris would drop in on the iconic show with just days to go until the presidential election. The skit saw the vice president give a pep talk to comedian Maya Rudolph \u2014 who has been playing her for weeks \u2014 and make some jokes about Trump\u2019s recent campaign stop inside a garbage truck.",
      "\u201cThis is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC\u2019s Equal Time rule,\u201d Carr wrote on X. \u201cThe purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct \u2014 a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.\u201d",
      "NBC later filed an Equal Time Notice with the FCC on Sunday noting Harris appeared on SNL \u201cwithout charge\u201d for a total of a minute and 30 seconds. Doing so allows other campaigns to request equal access to its airwaves.",
      "Trump\u2019s minute-long video message was aired as NBC broadcast a NASCAR event on Sunday and was played again during the network\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d coverage for a total of two minutes of airtime.",
      "Update: NBC stations ARE providing Trump with equal time, per the FCC's regulations, in the wake of the Harris cameo on \"SNL\" last night. A direct-to-camera appeal from Trump to \"go and vote\" aired during this evening's NASCAR post-race show. pic.twitter.com/w3bVv9vP6u",
      "\u201cHello to our great sports fans,\u201d the former president said in the clip. \u201cWe\u2019re two days away from the most important election in the history of our country we\u2019ve got to save our country and it needs saving, it\u2019s in very bad shape. \u2026 We\u2019re going to end up in a depression based on what\u2019s been happening. We\u2019ve never seen anything like it at least in the last 40 years.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe party I knew and loved would have never chosen as its nominee the adulterous, childish, habitually lying and criminally convicted Donald Trump,\u201d wrote the pastor, who backed Hillary Clinton over the former president in 2016.",

      "\u201cTonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones\u2019 passing,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cAnd although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.\u201d",
      "Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary musical catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song. For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who did not own at least one record with his name on it, or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who did not have some connection to him.",
      "Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for \u201cRoots\u201d and \u201cIn the Heat of the Night,\u201d organized President Bill Clinton\u2019s first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of \u201cWe Are the World,\u201d the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa.",
      "Lionel Richie, who co-wrote \u201cWe Are the World\u201d and was among the featured singers, would call Jones \u201cthe master orchestrator.\u201d",
      "In a career which began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 rpm, top honors likely go to his productions with Jackson: \u201cOff the Wall,\u201d \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cBad\u201d were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones\u2019 versatility and imagination helped set off the explosive talents of Jackson as he transformed from child star to the \u201cKing of Pop.\u201d On such classic tracks as \u201cBillie Jean\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Stop \u2019Til You Get Enough,\u201d Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For \u201cThriller,\u201d some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing \u201cBeat It\u201d and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.",
      "\u201cThriller\u201d sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles\u2019 \u201cGreatest Hits 1971-1975\u201d among others as the best-selling album of all time.",
      "\u201cIf an album doesn\u2019t do well, everyone says \u2018it was the producers fault\u2019; so if it does well, it should be your \u2018fault,\u2019 too,\u201d Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. \u201cThe tracks don\u2019t just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.\u201d",
      "Quincy Jones leaves behind a vast music (\u201cThriller\u201d) & film (THE COLOR PURPLE) legacy. He was a terrific movie producer, composer, arranger & the most successful music producer of all time. He was also a compelling storyteller, recounting his projects\u2019 histories. #RIPQuincyJones pic.twitter.com/9Geqa1H1nG",
      "RIP Quincy Jones, who defined the highest level of musical genius for 5 generations. Perhaps the greatest producer & soundtrack composer of all-time. The most quotable, the coolest, who made everything from Thriller to Vibe to the Fresh Prince. Who did it all, better than anyone. pic.twitter.com/gU8PD1gsCN",
      "So sad to wake up to the news that music god & genius Quincy Jones has died\ud83d\ude22His work on Off the Wall with Michael Jackson was the first album to blow my mind, then Thriller.

      "The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography \u201cQ\u201d, including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for \u201cRoots.\u201d He also received France\u2019s Legion d\u2019Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, \u201cListen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones\u201d and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author.",
      "Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, once telling Oprah Winfrey that \u201cThere are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don\u2019t. Nothing\u2019s in between.\u201d Jones\u2019 mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem \u201csenseless\u201d for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting.",
      "\u201cThey nailed my hand to a fence with a switchblade, man,\u201d he told the AP in 2018, showing a scar from his childhood.",
      "Music saved him. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano.",
      "\u201cI went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \u201cThat\u2019s where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.\u201d",
      "Within a few years he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band.",
      "\u201cWe had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,\u201d Jones later told Musician magazine. \u201cThat\u2019s when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.\u201d",
      "As a music executive, he overcame racial barriers by becoming a vice president at Mercury Records in the early \u201960s. In 1971, he became the first Black musical director for the Academy Awards ceremony. The first movie he produced, \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d received 11 Oscar nominations in 1986. (But, to his great disappointment, no wins). In a partnership with Time Warner, he created Quincy Jones Entertainment, which included the pop-culture magazine Vibe and Qwest Broadcasting. The company was sold for $270 million in 1999.",
      "\u201cMy philosophy as a businessman has always come from the same roots as my personal credo: take talented people on their own terms and treat them fairly and with respect, no matter who they are or where they come from,\u201d Jones wrote in his autobiography.",
      "He was at ease with virtually every form of American music, whether setting Sinatra\u2019s \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d to a punchy, swinging rhythm and wistful flute or opening his production of Charles\u2019 soulful \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d with a lusty tenor sax solo. He worked with jazz giants (Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, Duke Ellington), rappers (Snoop Dogg, LL Cool J), crooners (Sinatra, Tony Bennett), pop singers (Lesley Gore) and rhythm and blues stars (Chaka Khan, rapper and singer Queen Latifah).",
      "On \u201cWe are the World\u201d alone, performers included Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen. He co-wrote hits for Jackson \u2013 \u201cP.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing\u201d \u2013 and Donna Summer \u2013 \u201cLove Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger) \u2013 and had songs sampled by Tupac Shakur, Kanye West and other rappers. He even composed the theme song for the sitcom \u201cSanford and Son.\u201d",
      "Jones was a facilitator and maker of the stars. He gave Will Smith a key break in the hit TV show \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\u201d which Jones produced, and through \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d he introduced Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg to filmgoers. Starting in the 1960s, he composed more than 35 film scores, including for \u201cThe Pawnbroker,\u201d \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d and \u201cIn Cold Blood.\u201d",
      "He called scoring \u201ca multifaceted process, an abstract combination of science and soul.\u201d",
      "Jones\u2019 work on the soundtrack for \u201cThe Wiz\u201d led to his partnership with Jackson, who starred in the 1978 movie. In an essay published in Time magazine after Jackson\u2019s death, in 2009, Jones remembered that the singer kept slips of paper on him that contained thoughts by famous thinkers. When Jones asked about the origins of one passage, Jackson answered \u201cSocrates,\u201d but pronounced it \u201cSO-crayts.\u201d Jones corrected him, \u201cMichael, it\u2019s SOCK-ra-tees.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd the look he gave me then, it just prompted me to say, because I\u2019d been impressed by all the things I saw in him during the rehearsal process, \u2018I would love to take a shot at producing your album,\u2019\u201d Jones recalled. \u201cAnd he went back and told the people at Epic Records, and they said, `No way \u2014 Quincy\u2019s too jazzy.\u2019 Michael was persistent, and he and his managers went back and said, `Quincy\u2019s producing the album.\u2019 And we proceeded to make \u2018Off the Wall.\u2019 Ironically, that was one of the biggest Black-selling albums at the time, and that album saved all the jobs of the people saying I was the wrong guy. That\u2019s the way it works.\u201d",
      "Tensions emerged after Jackson\u2019s death. In 2013, Jones sued Jackson\u2019s estate, claiming he was owed millions in royalties and production fees on some of the superstar\u2019s greatest hits. In a 2018 interview with New York magazine, he called Jackson \u201cas Machiavellian as they come\u201d and alleged that he lifted material from others.",
      "Jones was hooked on work and play, and at times suffered for it. He nearly died from a brain aneurysm in 1974 and became deeply depressed in the 1980s after \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d was snubbed by Academy Awards voters; he never received a competitive Oscar. A father of seven children by five mothers, Jones described himself as a \u201cdog\u201d who had countless lovers around the world. He was married three times, his wives including the actor Peggy Lipton.",
      "\u201cTo me, loving a woman is one of the most natural, blissful, life-enhancing \u2014 and dare I say, religious \u2014 acts in the world,\u201d he wrote.",
      "He was not an activist in his early years, but changed after attending the 1968 funeral of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and later befriending the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jones was dedicated to philanthropy, saying \u201cthe best and only useful aspect of fame and celebrity is having a platform to help others.\u201d",
      "His causes included fighting HIV and AIDS, educating children and providing for the poor around the world. He founded the Quincy Jones Listen Up! Foundation to connect young people with music, culture and technology, and said he was driven throughout his life \u201cby a spirit of adventure and a criminal level of optimism.\u201d",
      "\u201cLife is like a dream, the Spanish poet and philosopher Federico Garcia Lorca said,\u201d Jones wrote in his memoir. \u201cMine\u2019s been in Technicolor, with full Dolby sound through THX amplification before they knew what these systems were.\u201d",
      "Along with Rashida, Jones is survived by daughters Jolie Jones Levine, Rachel Jones, Martina Jones, Kidada Jones and Kenya Kinski-Jones; son Quincy Jones III; brother Richard Jones and sisters Theresa Frank and Margie Jay.",

      "Embiid took issue with Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes, who mentioned the All-Star center\u2019s late brother and his son \u2014 both named Arthur \u2014 in columns questioning Embiid\u2019s professionalism and effort not being in shape after playing in the Paris Olympics. Embiid has yet to play for the 76ers this season.",
      "As reporters entered the locker room to talk to players, Embiid stood and confronted Hayes.",
      "\u201cThe next time you bring up my dead brother and my son again, you are going to see what I\u2019m going to do to you and I\u2019m going to have to ... live with the consequences,\u201d Embiid said to Hayes.",
      "Embiid continued, with several instances of profanity in the next few sentences. Hayes offered an apology, which Embiid did not want. \u201cThat\u2019s not the f\u2014\u2014\u2014 first time.\u201d Embiid said.",
      "Embiid later said that he doesn\u2019t care what reporters say. \u201cBut you do,\u201d Hayes answered.",
      "Embiid appeared to get louder at that point, and not long afterward pushed Hayes on the shoulder while the team\u2019s public relations chief got between them. Another PR person moved Tyrese Maxey\u2019s interview to the hallway outside the locker room, trying to clear reporters.",
      "At the same time, a team security person asked the media not to report on what had happened. Embiid yelled over the security guard.",
      "\u201cThey can do whatever they want,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cI don\u2019t give a s\u2014-.\u201d",
      "Embiid had called Hayes out in a press conference following practice on Friday at the team\u2019s training facility, referring to him as \u201cMarcus, whatever his name is\u201d and questioning critics of his prolonged absence.",
      "Hayes recently wrote a story saying that Embiid disrespects the 76ers and the game, and that the team should consider giving fans refunds when Embiid doesn\u2019t play.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve done way too much for this \u2026 city to be treated like this, done way too ... much,\u201d Embiid said Friday. \u201cI wish I was as lucky as other ones, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not trying and I\u2019m not doing whatever it takes to be out there, which I\u2019m gonna be here pretty soon.\u201d",

    "summary": "The \"Real Time\" host argued that the gun-filled fantasy the former president shared Thursday wasn't a threat, but an antiwar rallying cry that liberals used to share.",
    "story": [
      "Bill Maher has been a critic of Donald Trump since the earliest days of his 2016 run for president.",
      "But on Friday, the liberal pundit defended the GOP presidential nominee for imagining how former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) would react to having guns trained at her, and argued on his show, HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time,\u201d that Trump\u2019s remark expressed the same antiwar notion that liberals used to share.",
      "At a campaign event with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in Glendale, Arizona, on Thursday, the former president called Cheney a \u201cwar hawk.\u201d Both Cheney and her father, former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney, have endorsed his opponent, Kamala Harris.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s put her with a rifle, standing there, with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let\u2019s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face,\u201d Trump said.",
      "He went on: \u201cYou know, they\u2019re all war hawks when they\u2019re sitting in Washington in a nice building, saying, \u2018Aw, gee, well, let\u2019s send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy.\u2019\u201d",
      "Maher argued the former president\u2019s fantasy about Cheney getting shot at was just a poorly worded argument for non-interventionist foreign policy.",
      "\u201cI woke up today to the headline that Trump had called for a firing squad for Liz Cheney,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cAnd this is what I really don\u2019t like about the media \u2014 no, he didn\u2019t. You don\u2019t have to move me to not like Donald Trump more than I already do.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust to be clear, this is exactly what hippies always said,\u201d the host added. \u201cThis is exactly what peaceniks always said. This is \u2018Fortunate Son,\u2019 the song. It\u2019s like, you know what? It\u2019s very easy to sit in your building and send young men to die.\u201d",
      "Maher received some pushback from one guest on his show, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who acerbically countered that Trump must know \u201cwhat it\u2019s really like from Vietnam\u201d \u2014 in reference to the fact that Trump\u2019s \u201cbone spur\u201d diagnosis helped him avoid being drafted into the military.",
      "Maher conceded that Trump \u201cexpresses himself horribly,\u201d and Raskin argued that there has \u201cbeen a lot of violence\u201d following Trump\u2019s political rise \u2014 which shouldn\u2019t be ignored.",

      "The MAGA leader has reportedly made more than 100 threats to his perceived enemies, and has begun repeating that there is \u201can enemy within\u201d the U.S. government that he hopes to eradicate. He has even pondered using the military to quell potential civil unrest from the \u201cradical left.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s Cheney comment sparked outrage among high-ranking Democrats, including Harris, who argued such remarks are \u201cdisqualifying,\u201d as well as Cheney herself, who said this is \u201chow dictators destroy free nations.\u201d",
      "Maher, who has long warned about the dangers of a second Trump term and predicted that he wouldn\u2019t promptly concede the 2020 presidential election, ultimately found himself in a predicament Friday \u2014 by defending the same billionaire who once sued him.",
      "\u201cJust don\u2019t lie to me,\u201d Maher said Friday about the media. \u201cI don\u2019t like Donald Trump. Don\u2019t lie to me and tell me he wants her in front of a firing squad. He was saying something that \u2026 sounds like what hippies used to say \u2014 about not sending people to die.\u201d",

    "title": "Federal Union Blasts Montana GOP Senate Hopeful For 'Disdain' Of Wildland Firefighters",
    "published": "Sat, 02 Nov 2024 13:07:36 -0400",
    "summary": "The blistering remarks come after HuffPost first revealed that Tim Sheehy accused wildland firefighters of laziness and \u201cmilking\u201d fires for overtime pay.",
    "story": [
      "A union representing thousands of federal wildland firefighters excoriated Montana GOP Senate hopeful Tim Sheehy after he accused firefighters of dragging their feet to put out infernos and \u201cmilking\u201d disasters for overtime pay.",
      "\u201cSheehy\u2019s comments are not only unfounded and disrespectful of wildland firefighters across the country, but they also show a severe lack of understanding of the essential and dangerous work these brave men and women do to defend our country from devastating fires \u2013 especially communities in Montana,\u201d said Randy Erwin, the national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, in a press release dated Thursday.",
      "\u201cSheehy\u2019s disdain for firefighters is out of step with true Montanans and the rest of America,\u201d he added.",
      "Erwin\u2019s blistering takedown comes about two weeks after HuffPost first reported that Sheehy, who made millions running an aerial firefighting company that relies heavily on lucrative federal contracts, has repeatedly claimed, with little evidence, that a significant number of boots-on-the-ground firefighters are standing around while wildfires rage.",
      "In the 2023 book \u201cMudslingers: A True Story of Aerial Firefighting,\u201d Sheehy described an encounter with firefighters battling blazes in Idaho in 2015. He wrote that one firefighting pilot told him of the blaze: \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to go too fast. ... There\u2019s a lot of overtime pay to be earned out there! We put it out, it\u2019s back on salary!\u2019\u201d",
      "That conversation \u201csmacked less of concern or common sense than it did laziness \u2014 or, worse, greed,\u201d Sheehy wrote. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it malevolence; anyone who climbs into a plane or picks up a shovel to fight wildfires clearly has a capacity for goodness and a desire to help. That said, even in positions that are demonstrably service-oriented, there is the potential for self-interest, if not outright corruption, leading to a response that is not necessarily in the public\u2019s best interest.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf there is no fire, there is no money,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the faster that a fire is extinguished, the sooner the money dries up or goes elsewhere. It might seem ridiculous to worry about a shortage of work to keep the wildfire industry busy given the extraordinary expansion of the season in recent years, not to mention the gnawing sense that firefighters will forever be overmatched against nature. But old beliefs and protocols die hard, and clearly there were some in the industry who saw nothing wrong with milking every fire for what it was worth despite the risks and the blurring of ethical boundaries.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not the only time Sheehy has hurled such accusations at public servants who work in the same field as him. Sheehy is the founder of Belgrade, Montana-based Bridger Aerospace, a company that has a fleet of firefighting aircraft, and he has consistently highlighted his company\u2019s work in campaign ads and speeches. At a book signing in Huntsville, Alabama, in April, months after launching his campaign against three-term incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, Sheehy told attendees, \u201cThere\u2019s a very real dynamic in wildfire that a lot of those people don\u2019t want to put the fire out.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want to put the fire out because that\u2019s where they get their overtime, that\u2019s where they get their hazard pay,\u201d he added.",
      "Wildland firefighters are notoriously underpaid for a job that is becoming increasingly dangerous amid worsening climate change.",
      "In an October post on X, formerly Twitter, Tester called Sheehy\u2019s comments \u201cinsulting.\u201d",
      "On its website, the National Federation of Federal Employees notes that its advocacy for wildland firefighters includes \u201cfighting for a permanent, competitive pay fix, enhanced mental health and physical wellbeing resources, adequate housing, and more.\u201d In Thursday\u2019s press release, Erwin said that NFFE represents many federal wildland firefighters across the country, including in Montana. And he highlighted the myriad challenges these workers are facing.",
      "\u201cWildland firefighters have been doing more with less for decades, and the current shortage of firefighters places them and other first responders at greater risk while they work longer deployments fighting hotter and bigger fires each year,\u201d Erwin said. \u201cSheehy and his arial company have profited heavily from taxpayer-funded contracts to fight wildfires while many wildland firefighters struggle to pay the rent because of low pay.\u201d",
      "He slammed Sheehy\u2019s remarks as \u201celitist and self-serving.\u201d",
      "\u201cFederal wildland firefighters and other first responders deserve better, as do all the residents of Montana,\u201d Erwin said.",

    "story": [
      "VEGA BAJA, Puerto Rico \u2014 Eliezer Concepci\u00f3n worked for years at his roadside mechanic shop to save enough money to buy a piece of his hometown before it was too late.",
      "In 2020, he finally purchased a dilapidated house in this beachside enclave roughly 45 minutes west of the sprawling capital of San Juan. It took him two years to renovate a dwelling destroyed in 2017\u2019s Hurricane Mar\u00eda into a functioning Airbnb. But he saw it as a way to earn extra money by tapping into the Caribbean island\u2019s $10 billion tourism industry \u2014 and to keep the cash circulating locally.",
      "For years, Puerto Rico\u2019s controversial tax haven laws have drawn wealthy Americans looking to avoid income taxes and sparked a property gold rush that pits lower-paid, Spanish-speaking natives against cash-rich Anglophone newcomers. But Concepci\u00f3n, 43, was determined to keep at least his piece of the town in the hands of a real Vegabaje\u00f1o.",
      "\u201cMy neighbors are all selling,\u201d Concepci\u00f3n, 43, said on a July afternoon, leaning back in the leather chair of the tiny office of his auto body shop. \u201cBut I wanted a good chance for someone from here to buy and rebuild.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s getting harder to reject the routine cash offers from real estate speculators. Since the privately held LUMA Energy took over operations of Puerto Rico\u2019s electrical grid from the bankrupt state-owned utility PREPA in 2021, the power goes out weekly, if not daily, and bills keep going up. A lack of consistent air conditioning or refrigeration deters guests, leaving Concepci\u00f3n\u2019s vacation rental business struggling. He wonders how long he can hold out \u2014 and how Puerto Rico\u2019s historic election next week could forever change the dynamics in what is considered the world\u2019s oldest colony.",
      "While they are full U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans living on the island can\u2019t vote for the president, and the lone delegate they send to Congress has no real legislative powers. That makes the gubernatorial race the territory\u2019s most important election \u2014 and this year\u2019s is unlike any other in the 76 years since the U.S. began allowing Puerto Ricans to vote for their own governor.",
      "That\u2019s because, when Concepci\u00f3n goes to the polls next week, he\u2019ll be among the first American citizens since the Civil War with a real shot at electing a governor from a party pushing for independence from the United States.",
      "Juan Dalmau, the gubernatorial nominee from the once-marginalized Puerto Rican Independence Party, is now in second place, and polls show the race tightening amid the island\u2019s fury over remarks a speaker made last Sunday at former President Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Manhattan calling Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "The front-runner, Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, is a Republican and Trump ally representing the New Progressive Party, the pro-statehood party that has ruled Puerto Rico continuously since 2016.",
      "Jes\u00fas Manuel Ortiz Gonz\u00e1lez, the nominee from the traditional opposition Popular Democratic Party, which advocates retaining Puerto Rico\u2019s territorial status, struggled to break through but is now competing with Dalmau for second place in the most recent poll.",
      "The Fraught History That Led To This Point",
      "The central faultline in Puerto Rican politics has long been the territory\u2019s relationship with the mainland U.S. After seizing the island as a colony in the spoils of Washington\u2019s victory in the Spanish-American War of 1898, the U.S. violently suppressed Puerto Rico\u2019s independence movement for decades.",
      "As Europe began dismantling its empires after World War II, the U.S. granted the Philippines its independence but cut a separate deal with Puerto Rico, giving the island limited autonomy as a \u201ccommonwealth\u201d and U.S. territory.",
      "Puerto Rican rebels, under the command of the Harvard-trained lawyer and independence leader Pedro Albizu Campos, attempted an armed uprising in 1950. But the U.S. military, in a singular act of deploying the Air Force against its own citizens, bombed a rebel stronghold in the mountains, leveling almost the entire town. Even waving a pro-independence flag became an offense punished with years of jail time.",
      "From that point on, local control of Puerto Rico passed between the two main political parties duking it out each election cycle. On one side was the Popular Democratic Party, known by its Spanish acronym PPD, which supported the commonwealth status quo. On the other was the New Progressive Party, or PNP, which called for U.S. statehood. The pro-independence PIP remained a minor third party akin to the Green Party, earning at most a tiny single-digit percentage of the vote each election.",
      "That arrangement worked for much of the rest of the 20th century, when federal support helped industrialize Puerto Rico and raise living standards. In 1996, however, Clinton-era reforms saw the federal government phase out the tax credit that had drawn manufacturers to the island. As factories closed, Puerto Rico\u2019s government tried to make up for the jobs by hiring more teachers and police officers. But as the industrial tax base evaporated, Puerto Rico borrowed more and more money by issuing bonds that Wall Street expected would be backed up by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury.",
      "By 2016, Puerto Rico\u2019s debt and unfunded pension obligations reached a combined $126 billion. The island went bankrupt.",
      "Not an independent country, Puerto Rico could not get help refinancing from international lenders. Not a fully incorporated part of the U.S., either, the territory could not access the bankruptcy protections from which states and municipalities like Detroit benefit.",
      "Instead, Congress \u2014 which legally considers Puerto Rico and the four other permanently populated U.S. territories \u201cpossessions\u201d \u2014 passed a law called the PROMESA Act, after the Spanish word for \u201cpromise,\u201d which gave a White House-appointed board of financial overseers veto power over all the spending of the island\u2019s elected government.",
      "The fiscal control board \u2014 known pejoratively among locals as \u201cla junta,\u201d the term for a ruling council in military dictatorships \u2014 instituted harsh austerity measures, closing hundreds of schools and slashing pensions in a place with worse poverty than the poorest U.S. state.",
      "Then came Hurricane Mar\u00eda, a catastrophe from which Puerto Rico\u2019s infrastructure has yet to recover. While the precise death toll is debated, most scholars agree the aftermath of the storm killed thousands who might have otherwise survived if they had had access to refrigerated medicine or clean water after the blackout disabled groundwater pumps.",
      "In the summer of 2019, text messages between then-Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 and his inner circle showed the pro-statehood leader making jokes about the bloated bodies of Puerto Ricans killed during the storm two years earlier. As many as 1 million Puerto Ricans flooded the streets in protest, demanding his resignation.",
      "The chaos didn\u2019t stop when Rossell\u00f3 stepped down in disgrace. He tried appointing Pedro Pierluisi, a former coal lobbyist, as governor. But state courts intervened and instead selected Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced to lead the island from 2019 to 2021 (Pierluisi then won the 2020 election to succeed her, and is the island\u2019s current governor). In 2022, just as protests over the LUMA contract were growing, federal authorities arrested V\u00e1zquez in a corruption scandal.",
      "To Dalmau, the events showed Puerto Rico was primed for radical change. Sure enough, when he ran for governor in 2020, he won 14% of the vote \u2014 seven times the largest share of ballots the Independence Party had ever won and the first time it had earned a double-digit share of the vote.",
      "How A \u2018Radical\u2019 Candidate Went Mainstream",
      "Like Albizu Campos, Juan Manuel Dalmau Ram\u00edrez is a Harvard-trained lawyer. Dalmau, 51, served in Puerto Rico\u2019s Senate before becoming the standard-bearer for the Puerto Rican Independence Party, or PIP, in the 2020 election.",
      "His surprisingly strong performance wasn\u2019t the only sign the two-party duopoly on Puerto Rico\u2019s politics was crumbling. That same year saw upstart parties that eschewed the status question field competitive nominees.",
      "On the right, the Christian-democratic Dignity Project party sought to unite the largely Catholic island around conservative social reforms, like tighter abortion restrictions and a ban on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. On the left, the Citizens Victory Movement endorsed more liberal social policies but advocated primarily for ending Puerto Rico\u2019s colonial arrangement with the U.S. In a bid to cleave voters from both traditional parties, neither new party openly backed statehood or independence.",
      "In 2020, the Citizens Victory Movement came close to winning the race for San Juan mayor, arguably the island\u2019s second-most influential position after governor. This year, the Independence Party and the Citizens Victory Movement formed a coalition called Alianza, or \u201cAlliance.\u201d",
      "The Citizens Victory Movement\u2019s energetic organizing, combined with the Independence Party\u2019s experience running in elections for decades, has launched Dalmau into second place in recent polls.",
      "Dalmau\u2019s pitch for breaking off from the U.S. is really something closer to a conscious uncoupling. He envisions weaning Puerto Rico off federal funding over a 25-year period and striking a deal to give members of the Puerto Rican diaspora \u2014 twice as many Puerto Ricans live in states like New York and Florida as on the island \u2014 the option for dual passports.",
      "The recently privatized power grid will need to come back under government management, but Dalmau wants to attract big companies with tax breaks like the ones the U.S. government once used to develop a manufacturing industry in Puerto Rico.",
      "\u201cOur platform is going to support a democratic decolonization process,\u201d Dalmau told HuffPost in July after a press conference at a landmark building in the upscale San Juan neighborhood of Miramar. \u201cPuerto Ricans are a nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople lost their fear that you can vote for an independentista, and the next day Puerto Rico will become independent.\u201d",
      "During the world wars, the U.S. military\u2019s outposts in Puerto Rico helped Washington maintain control over the Caribbean and routes to the Panama Canal. During the Cold War, Puerto Rico served as a vital defense hub and a model for the benefits of American capitalism over communism once Fidel Castro took power in neighboring Cuba.",
      "But now, Dalmau said, Puerto Rico no longer hosts major military operations, and its debt crisis is an ongoing embarrassment to the U.S.",
      "\u201cPuerto Rico has become a burden,\u201d he said.",
      "Puerto Ricans are split over the island\u2019s future relationship with the U.S. A survey released last month by El Nuevo D\u00eda, the territory\u2019s newspaper of record, showed 44% of voters back statehood and a combined 44% favor sovereignty. Of the latter set, 25% support a compact of free association with the U.S. \u2014 a deal akin to what Palau and Micronesia have, allowing the former U.S. Pacific territories to represent themselves at the United Nations but still benefit from federal funding \u2014 and 19% back independence.",
      "Either way, Dalmau has sought to play down the independence issue, particularly as voters prepare to cast ballots simultaneously in a nonbinding referendum over whether Puerto Rico should become a state, independent or something else. For the first time in the long history of failed plebiscites over Puerto Rico\u2019s status, where one side or the other often boycotted the vote to make the results meaningless, this referendum does not include the option for the status quo.",
      "Rather than peg his candidacy to independence, Dalmau has pitched himself as a crusader against what he called the \u201ctwo-headed monster\u201d of the traditional two parties.",
      "\u201cPeople lost their fear that you can vote for an independentista, and the next day Puerto Rico will become independent,\u201d Dalmau said. \u201cPeople tell me, \u2018I was PNP, I was PPD, we have to get these people out of office.\u2019\u201d",
      "The MAGA Front-Runner",
      "Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, who leads the gubernatorial race, has sought to revive old fears of independence by linking Dalmau to socialist authoritarians in Latin America. Ads running on TV show him alongside Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro, Cuban leader Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel and Nicaraguan dictator Daniel Ortega.",
      "Ironically, it\u2019s her party, the pro-statehood PNP, that has the closest connections to Venezuela\u2019s embattled regime.",
      "As part of a massive corruption investigation, federal authorities arrested the former PNP governor, V\u00e1zquez, in 2022 on bribery charges. Among those charged with her was Julio Martin Herrera Velutini, a banker who financed her failed election campaign in 2020. The Department of Justice accused Herrera Velutini of bribing V\u00e1zquez as part of a deal to take control of Puerto Rico\u2019s financial regulator to hide a multimillion-dollar portfolio of dirty money linked to the Venezuelan regime.",
      "Like Dalmau, Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n \u2014 who currently serves as Puerto Rico\u2019s resident commissioner, a nonvoting delegate to the U.S. Congress \u2014 ran on changing the contract between the island and LUMA Energy after it took over the territory\u2019s electrical grid three years ago under a privatization effort the fiscal control board promoted.",
      "Her tough-talking ads on radio and television helped her defeat incumbent governor Pierluisi in the PNP\u2019s primary earlier this year.",
      "A spokesperson for Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n declined HuffPost\u2019s request to meet in Puerto Rico over the summer and initially offered to set up an interview remotely a week later. But multiple subsequent emails and phone calls went unanswered.",
      "On the campaign trail, Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n has claimed credit for the increase in federal funding the Biden administration has provided to Puerto Rico, and promised to hold LUMA accountable for ongoing blackouts. But Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, a Republican in her stateside politics and a close ally of former President Donald Trump, was among the strongest supporters of privatizing Puerto Rico\u2019s electrical system. While the Biden administration has promoted solar energy, Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n joined her fellow Republicans in advocating for Puerto Rico\u2019s controversial natural gas buildout.",
      "\u201cI see her as arrogant. She talks tough,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Rosario Borres, 53, a retired school janitor from the southern coastal town of Santa Isabel. \u201cShe kept lying and lying. It\u2019s written in black and white history. When you lie to Puerto Ricans, you disrespect us and underestimate our intelligence.\u201d",
      "Rosario Borres, who depends on an electric wheelchair due to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, said he needed cheaper, more reliable power. On a July afternoon, he came to an evangelical church in Santa Isabel to see U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm unveil a new program to provide solar panels to low-income households.",
      "He said he voted for Pierluisi in the primary. Now, he said, he may not vote at all. If he does, he said, his vote may go to Dalmau.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather vote for Juan than the PPD,\u201d he said, referring to the status-quo commonwealth party that served as the statehood party\u2019s traditional opposition.",
      "In Cata\u00f1o, a densely populated city neighborhood across the bay from scenic Old San Juan, Lissette Avil\u00e9s R\u00edos, a nun and environmentalist, criticized Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n\u2019s support for fossil fuel projects, including a controversial natural gas import terminal operating with federal permits.",
      "\u201cShe was pushing for more natural gas as the resident commissioner all while she was planning a run for governor,\u201d Avil\u00e9s R\u00edos said.",
      "Back in Vega Baja, Angel Manuel Ciordia, 75, said he would vote for Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n because he believes statehood is the best path forward for Puerto Rico. But he said it\u2019s unlikely to make any difference if Trump wins back the White House.",
      "\u201cIt all depends on who the president is,\u201d said Ciordia, a retired radio executive, during an interview outside his home. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t want us.\u201d",
      "Historically, Republicans championed statehood for Puerto Rico. In recent years, however, liberals have seized on the issue, conflating the movement with the push to admit the District of Columbia as its own state. The GOP has dismissed the effort as a bid to inflate Democratic power in the Senate, since D.C. is a liberal stronghold, though there\u2019s little evidence to suggest that socially conservative Puerto Rico would yield similar partisan outcomes.",
      "Recent GOP rhetoric suggesting Puerto Rican statehood would yield two liberal senators appears to have taken hold among voters. A YouGov poll released Thursday showed 79% of Democrats and just 41% of Republicans supporting statehood. Asked whether they would back Puerto Rico\u2019s independence, Democratic support plunged to 56%, while Republican backing rose slightly to 46%.",
      "Overall, however, 59% of Americans said they would support admitting Puerto Rico as a state if that\u2019s what voters on the island wanted. Just 16% opposed statehood, and 25% said they did not know enough to answer.",
      "Some voters themselves seemed to shrug off the sovereignty stakes of the election.",
      "\u201cI just want the government to help fishermen,\u201d Miguel Santiago said outside a bar on Vega Baja\u2019s main beach.",
      "He didn\u2019t have strong opinions about either top gubernatorial candidate but said the effects of climate change are shrinking the fish populations, and those whose livelihoods depend on large catches need the government to provide more subsidies and curbs on imported seafood.",
      "William Gibson, 60, a retired teacher sunbathing on the beach, said he had decamped permanently for Colombia. But he rolled his eyes when asked about Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n and said he would not cast a ballot for her.",
      "In July, Concepci\u00f3n worried that Dalmau could not possibly compete with the well-funded campaigns from the traditional two parties.",
      "\u201cDalmau has a good message, but that isn\u2019t what people see,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThey hear radio ads. They see TV ads. They get what the people with money to pay for them want us to see. And that\u2019s not the Independence Party.\u201d",
      "He hadn\u2019t yet decided how he would vote. But he said Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n was \u201csmart and more in touch with the people\u201d than the incumbent from her party, Pierluisi, and he was leaning toward voting for her.",
      "\u201cLook, I\u2019ve seen her with friends of mine, regular people,\u201d he said. He grew quiet for a moment, then exhaled. \u201cShe at least looks like someone who can listen to people.\u201d",
      "Since then, however, Dalmau has racked up endorsements from some of Puerto Rico\u2019s biggest celebrities, including the music superstars Bad Bunny and Residente, and scored major interviews with influential local reporters.",
      "Meanwhile, comedian Tony Hinchcliffe\u2019s \u201cgarbage\u201d remark at Trump\u2019s rally went viral, stirring voters\u2019 resentments of Trump for his mishandling of the 2017 hurricane and redrawing the connection between Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n and the presidential candidate she supports. At the high school that one of Concepci\u00f3n\u2019s four children attends, Dalmau won students\u2019 mock election.",

      "Hewitt, who said that he voted for Trump last month, interrupted Marcus as she predicted the former president would \u201crev up his supporters to contest elections\u201d and also go to court to make \u201cwhatever arguments he can, no matter how far-fetched.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are news people, even though we have opinions, and we have to report the whole story if we bring up part of the story,\u201d Hewitt said.",
      "\u201cYes, he\u2019s upset about [Pennsylvania\u2019s] Bucks County, but he was right and he won in court,\u201d Hewitt said of Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s the story.\u201d",

      "Capehart said he didn\u2019t \u201cappreciate being lectured about reporting\u201d when Hewitt has shared \u201clots of things that aren\u2019t basic fact\u201d on the Post show.",

      "Harris slammed Trump\u2019s remarks about Cheney as \u201cdisqualifying,\u201d adding that anyone \u201cwho uses that kind of violent rhetoric is clearly disqualified and unqualified to be president.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "FLINT, Mich. \u2014 Sen. JD Vance, who says his partnership with Donald Trump has cost him friends, is wrapping up his campaign for vice president by asking voters not to let their political differences come between them.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t like Kamala Harris and her policies, but most of the people who are voting for Kamala Harris are fundamentally decent people,\u201d Vance, R-Ohio, said in an interview aboard his campaign plane Monday. \u201cI just believe that.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a belief Vance has articulated at his rallies ahead of Election Day.",
      "At an event here Monday afternoon, Vance reminded hundreds of supporters cramped inside a theater that those who \u201cvote the wrong way\u201d are \u201cour fellow citizens.\u201d On Sunday in Pennsylvania, Vance made a similar pitch for civility while vowing that, if they are elected Tuesday, he and Trump are \u201cstill going to love\u201d Harris voters, \u201cand we\u2019re still going to serve them.\u201d",
      "Vance himself speaks of Harris, the vice president and Democratic presidential nominee, in coarse terms on occasion, like the time he said she can \u201cgo to hell.\u201d\u00a0And last week, at a point of high tension between the campaigns, Vance said anyone who believes U.S. troops in World War II \u201cwere fighting for what Kamala Harris is fighting for today,\u201d singling out border security and transition-related medical care, is a \u201cdips---.\u201d",
      "But on his plane Monday, he said his closing message of respect is important given the increasingly hostile tone of the race.",
      "At a Trump rally last week at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden, comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d in a set that included other racist jokes. Harris\u2019 running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, compared the rally to a Nazi gathering. President Joe Biden, meanwhile, appeared to call Trump supporters \u201cgarbage,\u201d though he and the White House tried to clarify that he was speaking only about Hinchcliffe.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never heard Trump in private or in public just sort of say, \u2018We\u2019re going to call everybody who votes for the other side bad people,\u2019\u201d Vance said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not how he thinks.",
      "\u201cIt goes back to the \u2018basket of deplorables,\u2019\u201d Vance added, referring to the disparaging remarks Hillary Clinton made about Trump supporters in 2016 and acknowledging his own past as a Trump critic. \u201cEven when I was not a Trump guy back then \u2026 that really pissed me off.\u201d",
      "For Vance, the sentiments are personal. He said he and his wife, Usha, have lost friends since he established himself as a staunch Trump ally in his 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio.",
      "\u201cGoing back to the Senate race, certainly, but more accelerated, I would say, over the VP race is just people ... that my kids have hung out with, that I would have trusted to like, you know, babysit my children, who over politics are just like, \u2018No, we\u2019re washing our hands of you. This is unacceptable,\u2019\u201d Vance said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very tragic when you have family members and friends discarding lifelong relationships over political disagreements.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never once thought to myself, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not going to be your friend because you voted for Bernie [Sanders] or you voted for Biden,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just not the way that I think. And you know, I have many flaws, but I think that\u2019s one of my virtues.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s final day of campaigning Monday was set to be his busiest yet, packed with battleground state visits to Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania. He was noticeably tired \u2014 tousled hair and dressed casually in a hoodie, a T-shirt and jeans \u2014 as he arrived with his wife to catch the campaign plane Monday morning at a private airport near his Cincinnati home.\u00a0To wake everyone up, Vance aides played Europe\u2019s \u201cThe Final Countdown\u201d at high volume as the plane took off for La Crosse, Wisconsin.",
      "A few hours later, between his stops in La Crosse and Flint, Vance was in good spirits, joking and pointing out the artwork from his three young children that was decorating the passenger cabin. Much of his staff joined him for the final swing, including Andy Surabian, Jai Chabria and Luke Thompson, three of his longest-serving political advisers. In LaCrosse, they stopped to pick up some Old Style beer \u2014 a Midwest classic \u2014 and shoot a brief video in front of a stack of brewery tanks known as the World\u2019s Largest Six Pack.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re having fun,\u201d Vance said. \u201cIt\u2019s the last day. Feels kind of weird, but here we are.\u201d",
      "Reflecting at the end of his campaign, Vance said he most enjoyed the opportunity to travel with his children and with Usha, who sat beside him paying household bills.",
      "\u201cSeeing the country from the perspective of a 7-year-old, a 4-year-old and 2-year-old, with all the crazy s--- that they say, the observations that they have,\u201d Vance added. \u201cThe way that my 4-year-old points to some of your colleagues who have cameras and says, \u2018Daddy, is that the fake news?\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018No, we\u2019re not allowed to say that, son.\u2019\u201d",
      "Though Vance laughed at that memory, news reporters were top of mind when he was asked about his biggest frustration as a national candidate. He argued that mainstream media did not adequately vet Harris \u2014 who has been vice president for nearly four years and ran for president in 2020 \u2014 after Biden ended his campaign and urged Democrats to coalesce around her.",
      "\u201cMeanwhile, [the media] talks about, you know, the \u2018cat ladies\u2019 controversy or some random joke that Trump made at a rally,\u201d Vance said, referring to remarks he made in 2021 that disparaged Harris and other Democratic leaders who do not have biological children.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve really been disappointed at just the nature of the conversation,\u201d Vance added. \u201cAs somebody who\u2019s very patriotic \u2026 do I think that we\u2019ve actually had a serious debate in this country over serious issues over the last couple of months? Sometimes yes, but sometimes no.\u201d",
      "Vance was particularly critical of The Washington Post, which in September reported on criticism of Trump he shared in private social media messages with an acquaintance in 2020. A recent Fox News report focused on the newspaper\u2019s negative coverage of Vance.",
      "\u201cThe Washington Post has conducted itself like a left-wing tabloid,\u201d Vance said. \u201cEvery time I talk to a Washington Post reporter, it\u2019s not even like, \u2018Oh, your questions are so biased.\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018I can\u2019t believe how dumb your questions are.\u2019\u201d",
      "A Post spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "Vance\u2019s final campaign sprint has included speculation about his future. Win or lose Tuesday, Vance, 40, is positioned to be a leading figure in the party for years to come.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting four more years of Trump, and then eight years of JD Vance!\u201d Donald Trump Jr., the former president\u2019s eldest son and a close Vance ally, said last week as he campaigned for Republican Senate candidate Bernie Moreno in Vance\u2019s home state, Ohio.",
      "Vance called such considerations \u201cabstract\u201d in an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan last week. But the possibility of Vance 2028 was much more perceptible at a rally Sunday night in New Hampshire, a state once thought to be safe for Harris but where campaign officials believe the race has tightened. It also happens to be the state that holds the first GOP presidential primary.",
      "\u201cYou could tell they were excited,\u201d Vance said of his audience. \u201cNew Hampshire obviously doesn\u2019t get a lot of love during the general election. I think we have an outside chance there. And so it was worth making a stop.\u201d",
      "Was it an investment in his future?",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even like to think about that stuff,\u201d Vance said. \u201cA Republican consultant will come up and say, \u2018Hey, you know \u2026 blah, blah, blah, blah, you\u2019ve acquitted yourself well.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to overstate things, because I think, yes, life will go on and America will still be the best country in the world. But I really, really, really don\u2019t want us to lose, and it\u2019s hard to even think about anything post that. So hopefully we win, we do a lot of good. And you know, 2028 \u2014 we can worry about it later.\u201d"

      "Beneath the surface of a tight presidential race and NBC News' tied final national poll, the handful of voters who have wavered in recent weeks illustrated the lesser-of-two-evils thinking that could decide the 2024 election.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris is an \"empty vessel,\" one voter says. Others worry world leaders won't respect Harris because she's a woman. Another voter's concern: It's not clear what she stands for besides opposing former President Donald Trump.",
      "But then there are voters who say Trump lacks the character or demeanor a president should have. He's \"very rude\" and \"lies too much.\" And some specifically panned the racist and demeaning rhetoric from Trump allies at last week's rally at Madison Square Garden, criticizing them for alienating Americans instead of bringing them together.",
      "That's according to answers from 24 respondents in the newest national NBC News poll, conducted over the last few days, from voters who say they seriously considered voting for Harris or Trump in the last two or three weeks before picking the other option.",
      "It's an extremely small share of the poll: Only 2% of those who said they would vote for Harris said they seriously considered Trump (and vice versa) in the last few weeks.",
      "But the responses from these voters \u2014 who were given the time for extended answers in their own words \u2014 shed some light on what's going into the final analysis of voters torn about who to support in an election that could be decided by thin margins in key battleground states.",
      "For those who considered Harris but ended up backing Trump, much of their reasoning centered on either the economy or frustration with the direction of the Biden administration. There were also concerns about Harris' gender or that she'd be \"weak,\" either in actuality or perception.",
      "\"I get worried, I think that other countries won't take her seriously and they would take Trump more seriously,\" a New York woman in her mid-to-late 40s said.",
      "A Hispanic man in Missouri who is in his mid-to-late 20s put forward a similar contrast.",
      "\"Donald Trump appears to me as a bully, but it is good to have a bully in your corner, especially when\u00a0they have proven that whatever they are doing is going to lower inflation,\" he said.",
      "\"Besides this, Kamala Harris\u00a0seems to be a principled person, though through her interviews, a bit dimwitted,\" the poll respondent continued. \"She has been in power\u00a0with Biden and things haven\u2019t been well in the world.\"",
      "Other voters derisively mentioned Harris' laughter, called Trump more \"transparent in what he's looking to do,\" and cited their support for Trump economic policies like tariffs and not taxing overtime pay.",
      "For the Harris supporters who briefly, seriously, considered Trump, the former president's tone and demeanor looms large.",
      "\"He's very rude and I just don't trust him. He lies too much for one thing,\" a white Wisconsin woman over 65 years old said.",
      "Two voters mentioned Trump's recent rally at Madison Square Garden, where a comedian who spoke before Trump called Puerto Rico \"garbage\" and others made sexist and other inflammatory comments, as something that turned them off.",
      "Mistakenly attributing the comment about Puerto Ricans to Trump, one Black Hispanic man in Pennsylvania panned Trump.",
      "\"The rally in New York City where he called Puerto Ricans trash, I really didn't like that. I can't vote for that,\" said the man, who is an independent between the ages of 25 and 29, according to his poll response. \"Her policies are good for seniors.\"",
      "With such a small group of voters undecided after a long campaign, a constellation of issues, sentiments or late-breaking news could hold some sway with these people as they decide how to cast their ballot.",
      "NBC News' poll also asked about 400 respondents if they had seen, read or heard something over the last few weeks about either candidate that gave them a more or less favorable impression of them.",
      "On Harris, 40% said they'd seen something that made them view her more favorably, while 43% said something made them view her less favorably and 17% said either nothing made a difference or they hadn't seen anything to change their mind.",
      "Meanwhile, 33% said they saw something that made them view Trump more favorably, while 46% said they saw something that made them view him less favorably and 19% said nothing moved the needle for them.",
      "Again, a handful of voters brought up the rally comments about Puerto Ricans when voters were describing something that made them view Trump more negatively. It was specifically mentioned by six of the 34 people who responded to the open-ended part of the question.",
      "\"This whole political rally thing with the comedian was just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\" said one Texas woman, age 60-64, who is leaning toward supporting Harris. \"I\u2019ve never had any respect for him and it\u2019s hard to forget that he incited a riot that caused American people to attack the Capitol. That, to me, is just the beginning of the end.\"",
      "Asked what has made them less favorable to Harris in recent weeks, several voters pointed to her current role in the White House and her ties to President Joe Biden, while others indicated they did not know enough about her plans.",
      "\"She\u2019s not distanced herself from Joe Biden. She\u2019s just following the path Joe Biden has been on the past four years,\" said one middle-aged Florida man who is leaning toward Trump.",
      "\"I wish she was concerned with more on what the country needs,\" said a middle-aged Idaho woman who said she is likely supporting a third-party candidate. \"I think she is focusing on women\u2019s needs. I think she attacks Trump. I feel that she does not get deep into the problem, like immigration. I feel like she says a bunch of smart words, but I do not get an answer, like with the economy. Her vocabulary is really good, but I do not get an answer.\"",
      "And one voter, a woman in Louisiana between the ages of 30 and 34 who remains undecided, shed light on why she remains stuck.",
      "\"As far as Kamala, not really sure what she\u2019s done thus far for the country. And as far as Donald Trump,\u00a0he\u2019s done good for money,\" she said.",
      "But, she added, \"he\u2019s encouraged violence and racism in the country.\""

But this time, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are so diametrically opposed \u2014 in style, substance, policy and beyond \u2014 that the victor could shape global events for years, if not decades, to come.",
      "\u201cThis is an extremely important election for the world,\u201d said Thomas Shannon Jr., former U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs, the third-highest-ranking role in the State Department. Particularly, \u201cbecause it comes at a time of debate within the American public about the purpose of American power in the world.\u201d",
      "A Harris administration \u201cwould be more predictable, and one in which both our adversaries and allies feel they have an understanding of what we might be doing,\u201d said Shannon, a veteran career diplomat who has served senior, nonpolitical roles under presidents Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s approach would be more unpredictable \u2014 which would be unsettling\u201d for both adversaries and allies, he added.",

      "The election \u201cwill have significant implications virtually for everyone in the world \u2014 for good or evil,\u201d said Dong Wang, an international studies professor at Peking University.",
      "Trump and Harris have \u201ccompletely different competing visions of the global order,\u201d said Wang, executive director at the university\u2019s Institute for Global Cooperation and Understanding. Harris would bring \u201cmore continuity and predictability,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we cannot assume she will be Biden 2.0. Whereas Trump would mean \u201cmore unpredictability for many countries in the world \u2014 for friends, allies and foes alike.\u201d",
      "Many in Beijing see peril in both candidates at a time when China hawkishness is about the only issue of bipartisan consensus in Washington.",
      "Despite the sluggishness of China\u2019s economy and America\u2019s strong performance by comparison, the Asian giant is still forecast to overtake the U.S. economically at some point in the next two decades. And so influential Chinese observers see Trump as one who brings unwelcome chaos and unpredictability \u2014 as well as his beloved tariffs.",
      "During his first term, he started a trade war with Beijing, imposing $360 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods. He promises to go further this time, vowing a flat tariff of at least 60% on anything coming in from China \u2014 threatening to hike these levies to 150% or 200% if China invades Taiwan, the self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own."

    "story": [
      "The close and uncertain battle for the White House has taken center stage this year. But Congress will play a major role in implementing (or blocking) the next president\u2019s agenda \u2014 and the fight for the legislative branch is coming down to the wire.",
      "Both parties only need to net a handful of seats to flip each chamber, with Republicans currently controlling the House and Democrats controlling the Senate with slim majorities.",
      "Senate Republicans need a net gain of two seats to win the majority outright or just one seat if former President Donald Trump also wins the White House, since the vice president casts tie-breaking votes in the Senate.",
      "In the House, Democrats need to net just four seats to take control of the chamber, and it is possible they could win the House even if Vice President Kamala Harris loses the White House. Control of the House could also be unclear for days, with several battleground seats in slow-counting California.",
      "As the battle for Congress comes to a close, here are five things to watch:",
      "1. Will there be ticket-splitters?",
      "Both parties will be relying on the dwindling group of voters who split their tickets between the presidential race and down-ballot contests.",
      "In the Senate, two Democrats are running for re-election in states Trump is expected to carry: Montana\u2019s Jon Tester and Ohio\u2019s Sherrod Brown. Both have relied on ticket-splitters in the past, leveraging their own personal brands and appeals to working-class voters.",
      "But Republicans are betting that both states have shifted too far to the right for Tester and Brown to defeat their respective Republican opponents, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy and businessman Bernie Moreno.",
      "(West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice is expected to pick up a Senate seat for Republicans easily in his state, where Democratic-turned-independent Sen. Joe Manchin decided not to run for re-election.)",
      "Ticket-splitters could also play an outsize role in the battle for the House, where a slew of competitive districts are in states that are not presidential battlegrounds, like New York and California. There are 16 Republicans running for re-election in districts President Joe Biden won in 2020. While there are some signs Trump may be outperforming his 2020 margins in these districts, particularly in blue states like New York, Republicans will likely have to hang on to some Harris districts to hold the House majority. Five Democratic incumbents are also running in districts Trump carried in 2020, making them top GOP targets this year.",
      "2. What impact could the presidential race have down-ballot?",
      "The race for the White House is expected to have a significant impact on down-ballot races, especially in perennial battlegrounds.",
      "Democrats are defending five Senate seats in presidential battlegrounds, including two open-seat races in Arizona and Michigan. Pennsylvania\u2019s Bob Casey, Wisconsin\u2019s Tammy Baldwin and Nevada\u2019s Jacky Rosen are also running for re-election.",
      "Their fates could be closely tied to the presidential race. In 2020, just one senator, Maine Republican Susan Collins, won re-election as her state voted for the opposite party for president. In 2016, every state supported the same party for president and for Senate.\u00a0And this year, Harris and Biden have been key themes in congressional Republicans\u2019 closing-argument ads. (More on that below.)",
      "Some candidates, like Casey and Republican Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania, have been trying to strike a balance with the top of their respective tickets by appearing with their parties\u2019 presidential nominees on the campaign trail while also highlighting areas of disagreement.",
      "Several of these Senate candidates, like Rosen in Nevada, have been able to run ahead of Harris, as their GOP opponents have struggled to gain traction. But Senate contests in these battlegrounds have largely tightened in recent days, as the presidential races in these states are coin flips.",
      "These battlegrounds are also hosting competitive House races, such as Pennsylvania\u2019s 7th District anchored in Allentown, which is also a presidential bellwether, and the 10th District in Harrisburg, where a former Freedom Caucus leader is on defense.",
      "3. Which issues will win out?",
      "Like the race for president, congressional races have centered on issues that voters often list as crucial to their votes: the economy, immigration, abortion and democracy. But in the waning days of the election, both parties have focused their closing arguments on two distinct issues.",
      "Democratic candidates in the most competitive House and Senate races focused many of their closing ads on abortion, looking to leverage an issue that has boosted the party since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade more than two years ago. Democrats also believe ballot initiatives enshrining abortion rights in some crucial battlegrounds could boost their candidates, even as polling has shown a wide gap between those measures and Democratic candidates.",
      "The second-most mentioned topic in Democrats\u2019 closing ads last week was immigration, as Democrats look to rebut GOP attacks on the issue, followed by health care, bipartisanship and taxation.",
      "Republicans\u2019 most mentioned topic on the airwaves last week was immigration, often mentioned alongside other topics like transgender women playing women\u2019s sports, as they try to paint Democrats as extreme. Other frequently mentioned topics include Harris, taxation, Biden and character, underscoring how Republicans have tried to nationalize these congressional races.",
      "4. Can Republicans overcome Democrats\u2019 massive financial advantage?",
      "Republicans have long been concerned about Democrats\u2019 massive fundraising advantage in House and Senate races. Democrats saw a fundraising boon when Harris took over the ticket, which flooded down-ballot campaigns with cash as she also broke fundraising records.",
      "That\u2019s allowed Democratic candidates to dominate the airwaves, pushing out their positive messages and launching early attacks against their GOP opponents. While Republicans have gotten a boost from outside groups, those groups are charged higher rates for ads, so their money does not go as far.",
      "Nearly $1.6 billion has been spent on ads in Senate races since Labor Day, with Democrats spending $803 million and Republicans spending $758 million, according to AdImpact.",
      "In each of the competitive Senate contests, the Democratic candidate has outspent their opponent in campaign ads. But Republicans have harnessed big-spending outside groups to take the lead in spending in some key races, like in Ohio\u2019s tight race, where Republicans have spent a combined $185 million to Democrats\u2019 $143 million.",
      "More than $1 billion has also been spent on ads in House races since Labor Day, with Democrats spending $615 million to Republicans\u2019 $448 million, according to AdImpact. And Democratic candidates and outside groups have outspent Republicans in 17 of the 20 House races that have seen the most ad spending this fall.",
      "5. Will there be any surprises?",
      "House and Senate contests could also see some surprise results on election night.",
      "One of the most surprising developments on the Senate map has been a competitive race in Nebraska, where independent Dan Osborn is taking on GOP Sen. Deb Fischer.",
      "The race has led to some late spending in the Cornhusker State, with Republicans looking to prop up Fischer as she tries to close the gap with Trump, who is expected to easily win the state.",
      "Since Labor Day, Osborn has spent $9.8 million on ads and Fischer has spent $3.5 million. And outside groups have ramped up their spending since Labor Day, with independent PAC Retire Career Politicians spending more than $13 million.",
      "Democrats have continued to invest in Texas, where Democratic Rep. Colin Allred is facing GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, and they\u2019re also eyeing a possible pickup in Florida, where former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is challenging GOP Sen. Rick Scott.",
      "Allred has led the race in ad spending since Labor Day, shelling out more than $50 million to Cruz\u2019s $27 million. Senate Majority PAC, the main Democratic outside group involved in Senate races, has contributed $12.2 million in the race so far through its affiliated group WinSenate in an effort to bolster Allred\u2019s campaign by focusing ads on abortion.",
      "In the Maryland Senate race, Republicans have tried to pull off an upset by recruiting former GOP Gov. Larry Hogan to run for the open seat. Hogan has made the race unusually competitive\u00a0for the typically blue state, but Democratic candidate Angela Alsobrooks has trounced Hogan in ad spending, pouring more than $10 million onto the airwaves, with Hogan spending roughly $3.2 million.",
      "Republicans have ramped up their ad spending in Maryland since Labor Day, thanks largely to the pro-Hogan super PAC Maryland\u2019s Future, which has spent more than $25 million boosting Hogan on the airwaves."

      "Once the last voter casts their ballot in a state and the polls close, the process of revealing the winner begins. That\u2019s when Election Day turns into election night, and each state starts reporting its vote totals.",
      "Some states \u2014 like Florida, Georgia and North Carolina \u2014 report their vote quickly, while others like Arizona, Nevada and California typically take longer, upward of a week or two to tabulate most of their ballots. Within many states, the patterns of how votes are reported can make it difficult to tell in the middle of election night who the winner is going to be in the end.",
      "For example, vote returns can skew toward one party early in a night because only a certain type of vote is reported first \u2014 like when mail ballots are counted before any in-person Election Day votes. These patterns can create what are sometimes referred to as \u201cvote mirages.\u201d",

      "A vote mirage is when the current vote count shows a candidate getting a higher percentage of the vote than they will ultimately end up with in the final count. Mirages can be \u201cred\u201d or \u201cblue\u201d depending on which party appears to be benefiting \u2014 but \u201cappears\u201d is the really important thing here, because like any other mirage, a vote mirage is fleeting and doesn\u2019t reflect the final reality.",
      "The factors that produce a vote mirage",
      "Generally speaking, there are three factors that produce vote mirages: geography, vote mode and order of tabulation.",
      "Mirages can emerge because of geographic differences in the counties that report more quickly or more slowly. It\u2019s common for small, rural counties or precincts to report their tallies more quickly than large, urban ones, because the logistics of counting votes are simpler when there are fewer ballots to handle. As a result, since voters in rural areas are more likely to be Republican than voters in urban areas, a red mirage can happen when a state\u2019s vote count overrepresents rural areas at a certain point on election night.",
      "Virginia is an example of a state that usually has a geography-driven red mirage early on election night. This is because Fairfax County, a high-population suburb of Washington, D.C., where Joe Biden received 70% of the vote in 2020, tends to be one of the last counties in the state to report most of its results. Until Fairfax County has reported most or all of its votes, Donald Trump will likely have a statewide vote percentage that is higher than his final statewide total.",
      "On election night 2020, Fairfax County reported the results from a majority of its ballots (nearly 375,000 votes) at 11:43 p.m. ET. This single report caused Trump\u2019s statewide vote percentage to shrink in that moment from 50.2% to 45.8%. (That\u2019s close to Trump\u2019s final vote share in Virginia, 44%.)",
      "Another factor that can cause vote mirages is partisan differences by vote mode \u2014 mail ballots, early in-person votes, Election Day in-person votes, and so on.",
      "Many states and counties tend to report the results of each mode one at a time. This can cause vote mirages if one party is more likely than the other to cast its votes using a particular mode. This was the case in 2020, when Democrats voted more by mail than Republicans, and Republicans were much more likely to show up on Election Day.",
      "This difference caused a large blue mirage in North Carolina in 2020. In the first hour after polls closed, most North Carolina counties had reported their mail and early in-person votes. Those votes were heavily Democratic, and at 8:18 p.m. ET, Biden was at 57.6% in the statewide vote count. But over the next three hours, the state reported its heavily Republican Election Day votes, causing Biden\u2019s vote percentage to shrink to his final number there, 48.6%.",
      "The third factor that can produce vote mirages is more complicated: differences in the order that specific modes of ballots are counted. This tends to be the most consequential in states and counties that report the results of their mail ballots in small batches.",
      "Many election offices tend to count their mail ballots in the order that they were received, meaning that ballots returned by voters in mid-October will appear in the vote tallies earlier than those received on Election Day. This will produce a vote mirage if there are partisan differences between the earliest-returned mail ballots and the later-returned ones.",
      "This is what occurred in Arizona in 2020. The mail ballots reported by Maricopa County (which accounts for 60% of the state\u2019s voters) on election night included those returned by voters by the weekend before Election Day. This ended up producing a blue mirage, because those earlier mail votes were more Democratic than the later ones.",
      "The results of the later-returned mail ballots were reported in the days following Election Day. Because those late-arriving mail ballots were heavily pro-Republican, Donald Trump\u2019s vote count grew from 46.8% at 3 a.m. ET on election night to his ultimate vote share of 48.9% \u2014 just shy of Biden\u2019s 49.2%.",
      "Interestingly, Arizona\u2019s pattern in the 2018 midterm election was the opposite. Late-arriving mail ballots were much more heavily pro-Democratic, and, once they were added, the Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema, went from trailing by 0.8 percentage points on Election Night to winning the election by 2 points.",
      "What to watch for in terms of mirages in each state",
      "The NBC News Decision Desk accounts for these mirages when deciding whether to project the winner in a race. For example, we are less likely to project a Republican winner in a state if all the remaining uncounted ballots are expected to come from heavily Democratic counties. Conversely, we are less likely to make a projection if the Democrat is ahead but most of the uncounted ballots are expected to be strongly Republican, in-person Election Day votes.",
      "We are also cautious about assuming that historical patterns will hold in 2024, especially given that the 2020 election was held during a pandemic, with voters more likely to vote by mail and social distancing affecting how election officials tabulated the results. This year, the Trump campaign has also encouraged his supporters to vote early, which may affect partisan differences between vote modes.",
      "Here are specific details about the mirages we have seen in key swing states in the past \u2014 and what could happen on election night this year.",
      "North Carolina: Most of the mail ballots will likely be reported first, causing a blue mirage. In a change for this year\u2019s election, in-person early ballots cannot be tabulated until after polls close on Election Day. We expect the in-person early votes to start coming in around 8 p.m. ET, a half-hour after polls close in the state. But the vote percentages will shift toward Republicans as in-person Election Day votes get reported over the course of the evening.",
      "Georgia: Most counties will report their early in-person and mail ballots first, likely causing a blue mirage before the statewide results move toward Trump as Election Day votes are reported. After that, there may be a small shift back toward the Democrats, as the late-arriving mail ballots are reported from large metro Atlanta counties. Unlike 2020, Georgia counties are not allowed to pause their vote-counting process until they have counted all ballots.",
      "Pennsylvania: We expect the earliest-reported votes to be dominated by mail ballots, including from heavily Democratic Philadelphia and Allegheny counties, causing an early blue mirage. Then, as in-person Election Day votes are reported, the blue mirage will turn into a red one, with the results tipping more Republican than we expect to see in the final margin. Finally those large counties (particularly Philadelphia) will continue to count and report their remaining mail ballots. This will likely shift the race back in Democrats\u2019 direction.",
      "In 2020, the Pennsylvania results at 3 a.m. ET on election night were about 7 percentage points more Republican than the final result. In the 2022 Senate election, the 3 a.m. red mirage was just over 1 percentage point from the final margin.",
      "Michigan: We expect a slight red mirage in Michigan as smaller, more pro-Republican localities report their votes. The total vote count will likely trickle upward as small places report, and the size of the mirage will shrink when large, Democratic cities like Detroit, Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor report. This year, Michigan voters can vote early in person for the first time in a general election, and clerks are now permitted to preprocess their mail ballots, enabling faster counting. Both of these changes may cause differences in vote reporting patterns compared to what we have seen in previous elections.",
      "Wisconsin: In most Wisconsin municipalities, all modes of vote are reported together. This produces a slight red mirage, because smaller, rural municipalities tend to report more quickly.",
      "A handful of large municipalities, including the city of Milwaukee, tabulate their mail ballots centrally and report them separately from their Election Day votes. The state will experience a red mirage until the heavily Democratic mail ballots from most heavily Democratic cities in the state are reported. At 4:42 a.m. ET on election night 2020, Milwaukee reported that Biden had received 85% of its 168,000 mail ballots. This caused Biden\u2019s statewide total to increase from 47.3% to 49.3%.",
      "Arizona: In 2020, about 70% of the state\u2019s votes \u2014 mostly early in-person and early-arriving mail ballots \u2014 were reported in the first hour after polls closed. This generated a statewide Biden lead of over 14 percentage points in a state he ultimately won by 0.3 points.",
      "As Election Day votes were reported in the next few hours of election night, the size of the blue mirage shrunk to about 3.5 points. It continued to shrink after Election Day as the pro-Trump, late-arriving mail ballots were reported. In the 2022 Senate race, the Democrat was ahead in the first hour by 19 points and won by 5. But in the 2018 Senate race, the pattern worked in the opposite direction, with the Republican ahead by 3 points early before ultimately losing by 2 points.",
      "Nevada: Nevada will experience a red mirage until Clark County (Las Vegas) reports. In 2020, Clark\u2019s first report came 90 minutes after the first county in the state had reported its votes. In 2022, this gap was only 10 minutes. Then, the first report in Clark may cause a blue mirage, which will shrink as in-person Election Day votes are tabulated statewide.",
      "Late-arriving mail ballots will be reported in the days after Election Day. In 2020, these ballots moved Biden\u2019s lead from 0.6 percentage points to a final result of 2.4 points."

      "Races that are nearly tied, like the presidential race in Georgia and Arizona in 2020 (Joe Biden\u2019s winning margins in these states were 11,779 and 10,457 votes, respectively), require essentially all the vote to be counted before NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk can project a winner.

In 2020, Pennsylvania was the pivotal Electoral College state to call the presidency, and there is a decent chance it plays that role again. But in 2020, it took four days after Election Day for the NBC News Decision Desk to be able to declare a winner.",
      "It may well happen much earlier this year. This is because 98% to 99% of the vote in Pennsylvania will likely be counted by Wednesday morning.",
      "How Pennsylvania counts its vote remains largely unchanged since 2020, but the process should be more efficient this year. Key counties like Allegheny (home of Pittsburgh) and Philadelphia have invested heavily in new voting machines and have added more personnel to help process ballots. Also, remember that this election is not being administered amid a global pandemic that required strict social distancing between election officials, slowing the count.",
      "We expect several Pennsylvania counties to release large counts of early votes shortly after polls close, followed by the in-person Election Day vote. That would leave the early votes received on Election Day, along with provisional ballots, still to count on Wednesday.",
      "If 99% of the total vote is counted quickly, a Wednesday projection is very possible in Pennsylvania, unless the race is razor tight. In 2022, we had about 90% of the vote counted in Pennsylvania when the NBC News Decision Desk projected Democrat John Fetterman as the winner of the state\u2019s Senate race at 12:51 a.m. ET.",
      "In Wisconsin and Michigan, the bulk of the vote could also be counted by Wednesday if past reporting patterns hold.",
      "Based on those patterns, in Wisconsin, the amount counted by Wednesday morning should be over 99%. In Michigan, it should be more than 95%. An important note in Michigan: For the first time, municipalities with more than 5,000 residents can begin pre-processing absentee ballots \u2014 opening envelopes, verifying voter signatures and so on \u2014 several days before the election, which could lead to more efficient counting on election night.",
      "On the other hand, the introduction of early in-person voting in Michigan could add some difficulty in quickly counting the vote. Regardless of these changes, both Michigan and Wisconsin count almost all of their votes quickly. So, unless the races are extremely close, there is a decent chance the NBC News Decision Desk would be able to make a projection sometime on Wednesday.",
      "If the races are that close, however, it could take days or perhaps even a week, depending on the margins.",
      "How the Sun Belt battlegrounds count their votes",
      "Outside of the blue wall, the critical swing states of Georgia and North Carolina are among the best in the nation when it comes to efficiently processing and counting their votes.",
      "These two states are also extremely good at making their data available to the public electronically. In Georgia, over 99% of the vote will be counted on election night. In fact, almost all the vote has been counted in recent past elections by 1 a.m. ET. However, Georgia was so close in 2020 that it took days to call the race.",
      "North Carolina has a similar pattern in how it reports out the vote, with 99% of the vote counted by midnight in past elections. Still, any chance of an election night projection in either of these closely divided states depends on a wide enough spread between the two candidates.",
      "The one electoral vote awarded to the winner in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd Congressional District could also be pivotal in the path to 270. With no significant changes in how votes are counted in Nebraska, around 90% of the vote can be expected to be counted by Wednesday morning, which again could lead to a projection if there is enough spread between the candidates.",
      "The last two battleground states, Arizona and Nevada, almost certainly won\u2019t be called quickly. If the presidency comes down to one of these states, forget any thoughts of a Wednesday resolution.",
      "In 2020, NBC News did not project a winner in Arizona until Nov. 12, nine days after Election Day. And unlike some other close states, it wasn\u2019t just because the margin was so thin.",
      "Typically, Arizona has as much as 20% of its vote still to count after election night \u2014mainly late-arriving mail ballots. And there are very substantial differences between Republicans and Democrats in terms of who votes when (early versus on Election Day). This makes it nearly impossible to project a winner in Arizona on election night.",
      "Nevada is a state that has a large amount of early voting, both absentee and in person, that is not counted on election night. In the past, nearly a quarter of the vote is still not counted by the Wednesday morning after Election Day.",
      "Given that the state has been historically close in presidential elections, the probability of calling a close race with a large amount of uncounted vote is very low.",

    "summary": "After Donald Trump claimed victory in the early morning hours after election night in 2020, his campaign and supporters turned to the courts to make that claim a reality.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 After Donald Trump claimed victory in the early-morning hours after election night in 2020, his campaign and supporters turned to the courts to make that claim a reality. The Trump campaign and surrogates began filing lawsuits the very same day, challenging the results on a variety of grounds well before the final votes were counted.",
      "The legal process and tactics may provide insight into how Trump or his allies could launch similar efforts should he lose again this time.",
      "Over the remainder of November and into December, Trump and his Republican allies filed dozens of lawsuits in key swing states that, if successful, would have given Trump the Electoral College votes needed to remain in the White House. Their efforts stretched from local county courts all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and were supported by solo practitioners and state attorneys general alike.",
      "Of the more than 60 lawsuits filed in the post-election period, Trump obtained a favorable ruling in only one case \u2014 the remainder were eventually either dismissed, settled or voluntarily withdrawn.",
      "Approximately 12 hours after Trump declared victory in a 2 a.m. speech from the White House, the campaign filed lawsuits seeking to stop the counts in Michigan and Georgia. Later that day, a third lawsuit was filed in Pennsylvania seeking to prevent voters from \u201ccuring\u201d mail-in ballots that lacked proof of identification.",
      "More lawsuits from the campaign and Republican allies swiftly followed in those states and other heated battlegrounds. In Arizona, voters and the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit alleging thousands of people in Maricopa County had their ballots disqualified because of ink-bleed caused by Sharpies. In Nevada, Trump electors sued alleging that faulty signature matching machines cast doubt on over 100,000 Clark County mail-in votes. In Wisconsin, Trump filed a lawsuit alleging widespread voter fraud and demanding a recount, which ultimately reaffirmed Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the state.",
      "Over the following days and weeks, all these lawsuits ended in losses for Trump, with the exception of his initial lawsuit in Pennsylvania. That resulted in an order finding that the Pennsylvania secretary of state overstepped by extending the deadline for voters to provide missing proof of identification for mail-in ballots received after Election Day and enjoining counties from counting any ballots \u201ccured\u201d during that time. Even with that ruling, Biden still won Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes.",
      "On Nov. 19, 2020, nearly two weeks after all major media outlets had called the election for Biden, Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis held a press conference in Washington, D.C., to present evidence they claimed showed widespread fraud and election interference by foreign countries.",
      "\u201cThe number of voter fraud cases in Philadelphia could fill a library,\u201d Giuliani said.",
      "\u201cWhat we are really dealing with here, and uncovering more by the day, is the massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba and likely China in the interference with our elections here in the United States,\u201d Powell said.",
      "Powell\u2019s claims at that press conference went too far even for Trump, who behind the scenes dismissed her as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cunhinged,\u201d according to filings in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s criminal election interference case against Trump.",
      "The rate of new lawsuits slowed significantly in December, but Trump and his allies hadn\u2019t given up. One week into the month, Texas sought leave at the U.S. Supreme Court to file a lawsuit against Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin arguing that officials in those states had made illegal changes to election laws and again raising allegations of fraud. Seventeen Republican attorneys general would go on to add their support to Texas\u2019 case. The justices ultimately declined to hear the case, stating that Texas had not shown a \u201cjudicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court, with the exception of justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, never showed any real appetite for taking up other election cases that rose to their level. The justices disposed of a handful of post-election challenges from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin with no further explanation in an order a month after Biden was inaugurated.",
      "\u201cThese cases provide us with an ideal opportunity to address just what authority nonlegislative officials have to set election rules, and to do so well before the next election cycle,\u201d Thomas wrote in a dissent. \u201cThe refusal to do so is inexplicable.\u201d",
      "The legal efforts to keep Trump in power had failed, but the ramifications of these challenges would continue to unfold for their participants over the following years. The federal indictment against Trump mentions these baseless lawsuits as proof of his corrupt intent to remain in power despite knowing he lost the election. Giuliani has been disbarred in New York and D.C., indicted in Georgia and Arizona and has been ordered to turn over his Manhattan apartment and other property to two Georgia election workers he defamed.",
      "Powell and Ellis were indicted in Georgia and have both pleaded guilty. Ellis was also indicted in Arizona and has since agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for her charges being dropped. And dozens of ethics complaints against local attorneys who filed election challenges are still pending nationwide."

      "The rules about when recounts happen and the procedures they include vary from state to state, since elections are administered locally. Those rules were in the spotlight in 2020, after Joe Biden won a handful of key battleground states by a razor-thin margin.",
      "Former President Donald Trump requested, and was granted, recounts in a few of these states, but none of them changed the outcome of the election there. Typically, recounts only slightly change the final margin of a race, but when the vote is close enough, they can have a real effect.",
      "Ahead of Election Day, here's a refresher of the recount rules in the states expected to be the closest in the presidential race.",
      "Arizona",
      "Candidates don't request recounts in Arizona, but the state requires an automatic recount if a race is decided by a margin within (or equal to) less than 0.5% of votes cast in a race. The threshold was lower in 2020 (0.1%), but since then, the state enacted a law raising the automatic recount threshold to 0.5%.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers approved new measures in 2024 that would shorten the time needed for a potential recount. That means Arizona would be able to handle a recount and not miss the deadline for the December meeting where members of the Electoral College cast their votes.",
      "Georgia",
      "In Georgia, a candidate can request a recount if the margin of a race is within 0.5 percentage points, as long as the request is made within two business days of certification.",
      "Georgia's 2020 presidential vote got significant scrutiny in the days after Election Day, given both the tight margin and Trump's baseless claims of widespread fraud.",
      "Election officials hand-counted nearly 5 million ballots again after the election, as part of a statewide risk-limiting audit authorized by a new state law.",
      "Then, after the state certified Biden's victory, the Trump campaign requested a machine recount, as was its right under state law. (That recount also didn't change the outcome.)",
      "State law also allows election officials to ask for a recount if there is \"a suspected error or discrepancy in the returns,\" and the secretary of state can ask for one if a candidate believes a \"suspected error or discrepancy\" occurred.",
      "Michigan",
      "Michigan law provides for an automatic recount if the margin of victory in a race is 2,000 votes or fewer. A candidate is also allowed to request a recount if they have a \"good-faith belief that but for fraud or mistake, the candidate would have had a reasonable chance of winning,\" according to state law.",
      "The state recently enacted changes to Michigan's recount law, but none will go into effect before Election Day.",
      "Nevada",
      "There's no provision for automatic recounts here, but a candidate can request one, as long as they cover the cost of the recount and make the request within three days of the certification.",
      "North Carolina",
      "A candidate can request a recount in a race if the margin of victory is within 0.5% of votes cast, or 10,000 votes, whichever is less.",
      "Pennsylvania",
      "The state automatically triggers a recount if the margin between two candidates is within 0.5%. But three voters can also request a recount in a specific precinct if they allege there was fraud or an error in that precinct.",
      "Wisconsin",
      "The state allows candidates to request a recount, as Trump did in 2020. But the candidate who requests the recount has to cover the expenses if the margin of victory is larger than 0.25 percentage points, as Trump did when he paid $3 million for a partial recount that resulted in no substantive change to the 2020 vote count."

      "Donald Trump has more than just the presidency on the line Nov. 5 \u2014 the outcome of his various legal troubles hinges on the election, as well.",
      "A win in the election he\u2019s dubbed \u201cthe most important\u201c in the history of the country would likely result in the federal criminal cases against him being dismissed, with state criminal cases possibly being frozen until he leaves office and additional delays in the various pending civil cases against him.",
      "A loss to Vice President Kamala Harris, however, could see Trump facing a potential jail sentence later in the month for his criminal conviction in New York and the possibility of additional criminal trials in 2025. It could also leave him open to additional civil trials in the near future, while he\u2019s already appealing $500 million in civil judgments against him.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot more arrows in the quiver when you\u2019re the president,\u201d said NBC News legal analyst Chuck Rosenberg.",
      "Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung predicted Trump would prevail at the ballot box and said all of the cases should be tossed. The \u201cwitch hunts against President Trump have imploded\u201d and \u201cshould all be dismissed in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s historic decision on immunity and other vital jurisprudence,\u201d Cheung said in a statement.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at where the legal cases against the Republican presidential nominee currently stand, and how they may \u2014 or may not \u2014 be affected by a Trump win or loss.",
      "Hush money case",
      "Win or lose, Trump\u2019s biggest immediate challenge after the election is his potential sentencing on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in New York. He is tentatively scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 26 \u2014 three weeks after Election Day.",
      "New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan twice postponed the proceeding to give Trump and his attorneys more time to argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s July ruling on the scope of presidential immunity should result in the conviction being thrown out. They also want the charges against Trump either dropped or for him to get a new trial that omits evidence they argue shouldn\u2019t have been allowed in light of the high court\u2019s ruling.",
      "Merchan is supposed to decide on that request by Nov. 12. Trump\u2019s attorneys are expected to immediately appeal if he rules against their client.",
      "If the sentencing proceeds, Merchan could potentially sentence Trump to prison, which would also be immediately appealed. Rosenberg told NBC News in May, after Trump\u2019s conviction, that jail time was unlikely but possible considering the former president spent much of the trial insulting the judge and defying his gag order.",
      "An election victory would give Trump additional fodder for an appeal to stave off jail time; his attorneys have argued in another case that the Constitution bars the president from being restricted from carrying out his official duties.",
      "Federal election interference case",
      "If Trump loses, special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election interference case is also on the horizon.",
      "The case, which charges Trump with conspiracy to defraud the United States for illegally trying to overturn the 2020 election results, was initially slated to go to trial earlier this year but was paused for several months while the Supreme Court weighed Trump\u2019s arguments that he was mostly protected from allegations of wrongdoing because of presidential immunity.",
      "Prosecutors are expected to continue moving forward with the case even if Trump is elected in November, but it\u2019s likely that whoever Trump names to head the Justice Department will fire Smith and scuttle the case.",
      "In an interview last week with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump suggested he might not wait for his new AG. \u201cI would fire him within two seconds,\u201d Trump said, referring to Smith.",
      "Even with Smith out of the picture, the Justice Department would still have to move to have the judge dismiss the case \u2014 a request judges don\u2019t always necessarily grant.",
      "Georgia election interference case",
      "The sprawling case charging Trump and more than a dozen others with illegally conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results is on hold until December when an appeals court will weigh whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and her office should be allowed to remain on the case.",
      "If she is, that could allow the long-stalled case to proceed. Trump\u2019s loss could pave the way for Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee to set a trial date for the case. However, if Trump loses, he is still likely to appeal the case further, which Willis brought against him in 2023, which could pose more delays.",
      "If Willis and her office are booted from the case, that would cause additional delays as well. The process of finding another prosecutor can be lengthy; it took almost two years to name one in another case involving Willis.",
      "If Trump wins the election, those delays could be even longer. At a court hearing in December of last year, McAfee asked Trump attorney Steve Sadow when his client could stand trial if he\u2019s elected.",
      "\u201cThe answer to that is I believe that under the supremacy clause and his duties as president of the United States, this trial would not take place at all until after he left his term in office,\u201d Sadow replied.",
      "Barbara McQuade, an NBC News legal analyst and a former federal prosecutor, said she believes it\u2019s possible both state criminal cases could be stayed during Trump\u2019s time in office and \u201cwould resume upon the expiration of his term.\u201d",
      "Classified documents case",
      "In July, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the criminal case charging Trump with lying and scheming to\u00a0mislead federal investigators\u00a0to retain sensitive classified materials after he left the White House, finding Smith\u2019s appointment as special counsel was illegal.",
      "Smith is appealing the decision, arguing that there\u2019s plentiful precedent for his appointment and that the case should be allowed to proceed.",
      "As with the federal election case, Smith\u2019s office is expected to proceed with business as usual in the appeal even if Trump is elected, although the special counsel\u2019s office would likely be quickly shut down and the appeal dropped.",
      "E. Jean Carroll appeals",
      "Cases that likely won\u2019t be affected by a Trump win or loss are his pending appeals of civil judgments against him totaling more than  $500 million.",
      "The former president is appealing the largest award \u2014 more than $478 million and growing by more than $111,000 a day \u2014 in a civil fraud case in New York state court. During arguments before the state Appellate Division, three members of the five-judge panel indicated they thought the award was too large.",
      "A lawyer for the state attorney general\u2019s office argued that the award is appropriate because the amount of fraud Trump and his company were found responsible for was sizable and went on for an extended period of time.",
      "It\u2019s unclear when the panel will rule.",
      "Trump is also appealing a pair of jury awards totaling about $88 million that he has to pay writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "Carroll filed two suits against Trump, one for allegedly sexually assaulting her in the 1990s and defamation and another for defaming her while he was president.",
      "The appeals court is expected to rule in the sexual assault case first, and that ruling could come at any time.",
      "Jan. 6 suits",
      "Trump is facing eight pending\u00a0civil suits\u00a0related to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including by injured police officers. Similar to the criminal cases, Trump has argued that his actions were protected by presidential immunity.",
      "A federal appeals court allowed the cases to proceed last year after the plaintiffs contended that Trump\u2019s actions weren\u2019t official presidential acts because he was acting as a candidate for the office.",
      "Trump, they noted, would have the opportunity to push back on that stance as the case proceeds.",
      "No trial date has been set in the cases, and with the likelihood of appeals the immunity issues could take months or longer to be determined.",
      "The process could become even more drawn out if Trump wins, because he could attempt to get the Justice Department involved in his defense. He could also try to delay trials in those cases by arguing that they should come after his criminal trial in Georgia, since they cover similar ground and could affect his right against self-incrimination.",
      "\u201cCivil cases are often stayed for that reason,\u201d McQuade said.",
      "\u2018Exonerated 5\u2019 suit",
      "Trump is facing another defamation suit brought against him this month by members of the so-called Central Park Five, who now call themselves the Exonerated Five.",
      "During last month\u2019s presidential debate, Trump incorrectly said that the men, who are Black and Latino, pleaded guilty in a criminal case in which they\u2019d been charged with assaulting and raping a white woman jogging in New York\u2019s Central Park in 1989. He also said they \u201ckilled a person ultimately\u201d although the woman is still alive.",
      "The five, who were teenagers when they were convicted, said they were coerced into confessions by police, and pleaded not guilty to the charges. They were convicted at trial and served lengthy prison sentences while maintaining their innocence.",
      "They were exonerated in 2002 after a review by prosecutors that included DNA evidence that found the jogger had been attacked by a serial rapist who confessed to the crime after the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "That suit is not expected to be affected by Trump\u2019s election given a Supreme Court ruling during the Clinton years that presidents aren\u2019t immune from civil suits that aren\u2019t related to their time in office.",
      "McQuade said she believes the case \u201ccould proceed, just as the Paula Jones case did against Bill Clinton.\u201d"

    "summary": "A network of reporters and voting experts gather results from thousands of jurisdictions, checking all of it for anomalies before viewers and readers see the data.",
    "story": [
      "The task of counting and announcing vote results from over 100,000 precincts across the country \u2014 mostly within a few hours \u2014 requires a massive operation that involves hundreds of thousands of poll workers, election officials and observers.",
      "We may think of a presidential election as a single nationwide contest, but how elections are administered varies across the 50 states and Washington, D.C. Even within states, different jurisdictions \u2014 counties, cities and so on \u2014 could have different\u00a0administrative practices or logistics in the election process.",
      "In most of the country, counties run elections. In a handful of states, particularly in New England, cities or towns administer them.",
      "Nearly all of those jurisdictions provide multiple vote reports (updates to the vote count) on election night and in the following days. In the November 2020 election, NBC News received over 88,000 updates to its vote totals across 542 different races. More than 45,000 of those vote updates came before 2 a.m. ET on election night.",
      "From 9:15 to 9:30 p.m. ET that night, NBC News received just over four updates per second, on average.",
      "In all, NBC News will report vote results from 4,635 jurisdictions across the U.S. Here\u2019s how it works, from how local governments count to how NBC News monitors, checks and displays the vote totals.",
      "How do states and counties tabulate their vote results?",
      "The vote results reported by NBC News are the product of hundreds of thousands of people working to accurately and efficiently count and report the results. The process begins at your local polling place or precinct. On Election Day 2020, there were over 107,000 physical polling places nationwide, staffed by nearly 700,000 poll workers, many of them volunteers.",

      "Inside NBC News' Decision Desk: When will we know who won the presidential race?",
      "How exit polls work and how NBC News uses them on election night",
      "After polls close in your state and the last voters have cast their ballots, poll workers begin to close the precincts and tabulate the votes. Each state has different requirements for the process, but the steps generally include turning off and securing voting machines and ensuring that the number of voters who checked in corresponds with the number of ballots cast.",
      "Then, each precinct tabulates its vote results and reports those numbers to a central office in its county or town.",
      "In some states, local precincts also count mail ballots from voters who live inside the boundaries of those precincts. Poll workers must scan them through tabulation machines either on Election Day, perhaps while the precincts are not busy, or after polls have closed.",
      "In other places, mail ballots are counted centrally in a jurisdiction\u2019s single facility instead of precinct by precinct. Some of those counties, such as Clark County, Nevada (home of Las Vegas), and Maricopa County, Arizona (home of Phoenix), provide partial reports at regular intervals. Others do not report any mail results until they have tabulated all the mail ballots.",
      "For example, Milwaukee County in Wisconsin released its full tabulation of about 170,000 mail ballots at 4:40 a.m. ET on election night 2020, after it had worked its way through the whole batch.",
      "How does NBC News receive and display counties\u2019 vote tabulations?",
      "In November, NBC News is covering 610 statewide and congressional races. To manage the task of collecting all those results in a relatively short amount of time, NBC News coordinates with ABC News, CBS News and CNN through the National Election Pool, or NEP. Since 2018, the NEP has received vote count data from Edison Research, a firm that specializes in collecting election data.",
      "No centralized, federal government agency collects and reports vote results, so each state determines how it makes\u00a0those results available. Many states have websites where anybody can access the real-time vote counts. Others have websites with results \u2014 but the numbers on election night are not as up to date as what is available from individual counties.",
      "And some states do not have vote results pages that update on election night at all.",
      "Edison Research collects the vote results state by state and county by county. When possible, it uses software to automatically detect updates and collect the vote counts from state or county websites. In other jurisdictions, Edison manually transcribes vote result data from PDFs into its tabulation system.",
      "And because many jurisdictions do not post their results online on election night but the results themselves are public information, Edison also hires thousands of \u201cvote reporters\u201d to physically be at county or town election offices where they can get the totals after votes are tabulated.",
      "After Edison processes the data, it is transmitted to NBC News and the rest of the NEP. That is when you will see vote numbers change on a television graphic or on NBCNews.com. That is also when NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk sees the updated vote count and uses it in its process of determining when it can accurately project the winner of a race.",
      "How does NBC News ensure the vote counts are correct?",
      "Given the high volume of data being reported in a fairly short amount of time, it is not hard to imagine that mistakes can be made. Any process that involves hundreds of thousands of people transmitting millions of numbers has the potential for human-generated error from poor handwriting, typos, miscommunications and so forth.",
      "What makes election results in this country trustworthy, however, are the countless fail-safes that detect and correct such mistakes.",
      "The biggest of those fail-safes is vote certification. The results you see on election night are only unofficial counts, and they can change \u2014 typically by tiny amounts, like when overseas and military ballots are added to vote counts or when a state conducts a recount in a close race and re-examines disputed ballots. Only when a state certifies the results, which happens days or even weeks after Election Day, do they become final. And before certification, states require several postelection audit procedures, which double- and triple-check the accuracy of the counts.",
      "On election night, there are other error-detection fail-safes at every stage of the vote counting process. They begin at the local precincts, where poll workers make sure that the \u201cbooks balance\u201d by verifying, for example, that the number of ballots cast in the precincts correspond with the number of voter check-ins.",
      "Then, when a precinct reports its vote results to its state or county, it performs additional quality assurance checks. Does the number of votes in the precinct make sense when compared with its number of registered voters? Is the turnout rate comparable to the rates in nearby precincts? If any of those questions raise flags about a precinct\u2019s count, the state or the county will resolve the concerns by consulting with the person in charge of the precinct or by re-checking the data before those votes are added to the county\u2019s overall count.",
      "Edison Research performs another set of data quality checks when it receives vote results. It looks for errors, like extra digits added to a candidate\u2019s count or vote counts for two candidates getting flipped accidentally. If Edison\u2019s error detection system suspects a report may include a mistake, the data gets held\u00a0until a trained analyst can verify it with the state or the county.",
      "Finally, NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk also has its own set of data quality assurance tools, which compare the vote results to various administrative and historical data sources. If those tools detect anomalies, they are flagged to Edison and the NEP for further investigation. NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk will not call a race until it is certain that the vote results are error-free."

    "story": [
      "On Election Day, as votes are being tallied and news organizations await results and race projections that can be reported, exit polls are a critical tool providing an early look at who is voting and what\u2019s motivating their choices.",
      "An exit poll is a survey of voters taken as they leave (or exit) their voting location. It\u2019s the only national survey of known voters in the country. It allows news organizations, researchers and voters to understand what\u2019s happening in an election as the results flow in.",
      "Here\u2019s how exit polling works, where they are conducted and how NBC News will be using the exit poll results on election night and the days after.",
      "Who conducts the exit poll?",
      "Since 2003, Edison Research, a firm that specializes in collecting election data, has conducted exit polls on behalf of the National Election Pool. The NEP is a consortium of media networks \u2014 ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC News \u2014 that pools together resources for one collective vote count and exit poll operation. NBC News independently analyzes and reports on the exit poll results.",

      "Inside NBC News' Decision Desk: When will we know who won the presidential race?",
      "What questions are asked?",
      "The exit poll asks voters which candidates they supported for president and in other races. But a number of other attitudinal and issue-based questions are usually included, such as: \u201cWhat is the most important issue to your vote?\u201d The other key component of an exit poll is asking about a voter\u2019s demographics such as age, gender, race, education. These types of questions help illustrate how different groups voted and what mattered to them, and they are also used to weight the exit poll \u2014 that is, to make sure that the exit poll properly reflects the demographic composition of the electorate as well as the election results.",
      "Members of each news organization in the NEP jointly determine in which states the exit polls will be conducted (in addition to the national exit poll survey), and they work together to decide what questions are included on the national and state questionnaires. The exit poll questionnaires include about 25 questions and take around 5 minutes to complete.",
      "How are exit polls conducted?",
      "The exit poll is then conducted in a random sample of selected polling places across the country and in states with their own exit polls (more on that later). At least one interviewer is assigned to each polling place on Election Day. This year, interviewers will be stationed at 600 polling locations throughout the country, with each of them following local rules about where they can stand in relation to the polling location. The interview is self-administered, meaning the respondent fills out the survey on their own. Then, the interviewers call in their results throughout the day, and the results are reported to news organizations.",
      "What about state exit polls?",
      "In addition to a national exit poll, which captures voters across the country, there are exit polls specifically for states that are pivotal to winning the presidency or include important down-ballot races, such as Senate or governor. This year, NBC News will have coverage of state exit polls in Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. The exit poll will be conducted in 40 balloting locations in each state.",
      "How does the exit poll capture the growing percentage of people voting early or by mail?",
      "The exit poll supplements in-person Election Day interviews by contacting early voters through a telephone poll of people on voter lists in all 50 states, as well as by collecting interviews during early in-person voting periods.",
      "This year, the exit poll is conducting interviews at early in-person voting locations in Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada and Ohio. All voters in a given state, regardless of whether they vote early or on Election Day, are asked the same questions.",
      "Are exit polls anonymous?",
      "Yes. In person, voters are handed a piece of paper and pencil to fill out a paper questionnaire and they answer anonymously. When they are done, they put their folded questionnaire into a box, much like casting a ballot. Interviews conducted by telephone do not retain any personal information about the voter who was interviewed.",
      "How many people are interviewed?",
      "The national exit poll will include approximately 20,000 interviews in total, including in-person on Election Day, in-person during early voting and via telephone to capture other early voters, including those who cast their ballots by mail. For each state exit poll in Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin, there will be sample sizes of 1,500 to 2,500 respondents per state.",
      "How do we use exit polls?",
      "The NBC News Decision Desk uses some exit poll data to help project election results. However, the exit poll is primarily used as a reporting tool on election night.",
      "The data gives viewers and readers a look into what issues are motivating voters, how they feel about the country and who they are. It\u2019s the nation\u2019s first look into what the electorate looks like and how voters are feeling about the election, the candidates and their choices.",
      "What data do news organizations report and when?",
      "Participants in the NEP do not report any exit poll results before 5 p.m. ET on Election Day, and no exit poll results that can be indicative of the outcome of a race get reported until after all the polls are scheduled to close in a state. As election night goes on and interviewers on the ground call in more exit poll results, the data is updated and re-weighed in real time."

      "Getting on the voter roll",
      "Georgia asks for quite a bit of information to register as a voter: name, address, date of birth and either the number on your driver\u2019s license or state ID if you have one, or the last four digits of your Social Security number if you don\u2019t. Sign the form swearing \u2014 under penalty of perjury \u2014 that you\u2019re a citizen and eligible to vote, and you\u2019re good to go.",
      "Election officials will then check your information against government databases, which typically verify your identity and citizenship. If officials can\u2019t find corroborating information, you\u2019ll be asked to prove your citizenship with a passport, birth certificate, naturalization certificate or similar document before you are fully registered to vote.",
      "Staying on the roll",
      "Georgia checks its voter rolls against lists of people who have died or been convicted of a felony, while also routinely checking in with voters who change their address with the U.S. Postal Service or cancel their Georgia driver\u2019s license.",
      "They also use the interstate Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) to find voters who die elsewhere, or move and register out of state.",
      "Casting a ballot",
      "You must show a photo ID to vote. If you choose to vote by mail, you\u2019ll have to request a ballot with your driver\u2019s license number or a photocopy of your photo ID.",
      "All ballots are fed into tabulators to be tallied, totals are reconciled (ensuring that there are an equal number of both ballots cast and voters who voted) and the results are driven to the county election office.",
      "Checking the count",
      "After the results are tallied, the state conducts a risk-limiting audit by physically counting randomly selected batches of ballots and hand-counting them. The state also runs all the ballot images through a computer program that tallies the results."

      "Four years after 2020 gave us an \u201celection week,\u201d voters are heading to the polls and wondering: How long will it take for states to count their ballots this year?",
      "Several dynamics have changed since the last presidential contest: Many voters have returned to in-person voting after the Covid pandemic, and many states have rewritten their laws to allow election officials to start processing mail ballots ahead of Election Day. Those two changes are expected to speed up tabulation, but it could still take days to get a full picture of the election results.",

      "Voters across the country are set to decide on nearly 150 ballot measures next week that will shape the future of a wide variety of policy issues in their states.",
      "Constitutional amendments related to abortion rights have drawn the most national attention in an election year that has otherwise been dominated by the presidential race.",
      "But ballot measures in dozens of other states will also put decisions about how to handle marijuana regulations, voting procedures, economic issues and immigration laws directly in the hands of voters.",
      "\u201cThe major trends that we\u2019re seeing in 2024 are reproductive freedom, democracy and economic justice,\u201d said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, the executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, which works with progressive organizations to help advance citizen-led ballot measures.",
      "Follow live updates on the 2024 election",
      "According to her group, there are 147 ballot measures on ballots next Tuesday in 41 states. Of those, 77 were referred to the ballot by state lawmakers, while 57 were initiated by citizens. The others are considered bond proposals, advisory questions and constitutional convention questions. (In addition, Louisiana will let voters decide on four constitutional amendments on its Dec. 7 ballot.)",
      "Here's a rundown of the various issues the proposed amendments seek to address.",
      "Abortion",
      "Constitutional amendments to expand or protect abortion access will be on the ballot in 10 states, including the presidential battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada and the Senate battlegrounds of Montana and Florida.",
      "\u201cEveryone knows this is a big issue this year \u2014 it\u2019s the most we\u2019ve ever seen for reproductive freedom ballot measures in history,\u201d Fields Figueredo said.",
      "In Arizona, Florida, Missouri and South Dakota, proposed amendments would effectively protect abortion rights until fetal viability, with some exceptions that differ in each state after that point, and undo existing abortion laws on the books.",
      "In Maryland, Montana, Nevada and New York, abortion is already legal through fetal viability, and in Colorado, there are no laws restricting abortion and no gestational limits for women seeking abortions. As a result, the proposals in those states are intended to formally enshrine those existing rights, which organizers have said is designed to prevent lawmakers from undoing them in the future.",
      "Nebraska is the only state where two dueling constitutional amendments will appear on the November ballot.",
      "One measure would amend the state constitution to protect abortion rights until fetal viability, with exceptions for the life and health of the woman after that.",
      "The other would protect abortion rights in the first trimester, but it would bar the procedure in the second and third trimesters, except in medical emergencies or when pregnancies are the result of sexual assaults or incest. Passage would effectively codify the state's existing law banning abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy, with some exceptions, in the state constitution.",
      "Voting and elections",
      "There are 39 ballot measures on the November ballot related to democracy, elections and voting procedures, according to the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center.",
      "Some seek to create or further tighten voting restrictions, while others seek to broaden access.",
      "For example, eight states \u2014 Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin \u2014 will have constitutional amendments, referred to the November ballot by Republican lawmakers, designed to make it clear that only American citizens can vote in elections in those states. It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in elections in each of those states and at the federal level, and it rarely happens. Election experts have warned that the measures amount to an effort by Republicans to drive the unsubstantiated narrative that noncitizens are voting in large numbers.",
      "In Nevada, a constitutional amendment on the ballot would require people to show identification when they vote in person. Under state rules, voters would need to pass it in two consecutive elections for it to take effect.",
      "Meanwhile, at least three states will have measures on their ballots that would make it more difficult for citizen-led initiatives to qualify for the ballot. A proposal in Arizona would raise signature requirements for citizen-led constitutional amendments to include 15% of registered voters in each of the state\u2019s 30 legislative districts, while another would allow any person to contest an initiative or proposed amendment in court after it has been filed.",
      "A proposal in North Dakota would require any ballot initiative to be solely about one subject and constitutional amendments to be passed in both the primary and general elections to take effect.",
      "In addition, ballot measures in a handful of other states will let voters decide about implementing open primaries, as well as ranked-choice voting, in some elections.",
      "Marijuana",
      "Nearly half the states have already legalized use of recreational or medical marijuana. Voters in four more states \u2014 Florida, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota \u2014 will decide next week whether to join them.",
      "A ballot measure in Florida will let voters decide whether to make recreational weed \u2014 sold at designated dispensaries \u2014 legal for everyone over 21. Medical marijuana is already legal in Florida.",
      "In Nebraska, where the use of all marijuana remains illegal, a pair of measures would legalize and regulate the use and sale of medical marijuana.",
      "And in North Dakota and South Dakota, where marijuana is legal for medical purposes, voters will decide on whether to legalize its use recreationally.",
      "Immigration",
      "Arizona is the only state with an immigration-related measure on the ballot this year \u2014 and the stakes are big.",
      "Arizona\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature referred a controversial immigration policy to the ballot that would increase the use of a federal database to check employment eligibility and give state and local law enforcement agencies the authority to detain and deport undocumented border crossers, despite court rulings that have established that that power belongs to the federal government.",
      "Democrats and progressive groups have described the measure as effectively resurrecting controversial 2010 anti-illegal immigration legislation. And voting rights groups have argued it is designed to galvanize conservative turnout and counter enthusiasm for the state\u2019s abortion rights proposal.",
      "Economy and crime",
      "Several states will also allow voters to decide on an array of proposals related to economic issues and crime.",
      "California voters will be asked whether they approve of gradually raising the state\u2019s minimum wage to $18 per hour, while voters in Alaska and Missouri will be asked whether they approve of gradually raising it to $15 per hour.",
      "In Arizona, voters will decide on a constitutional amendment that would effectively revise the rules for a minimum wage for tipped workers.",
      "In Colorado, voters will decide on a list of amendments that would cap property tax revenues for local districts, while voters in Washington state will decide whether state employees may opt out of coverage of various insurance programs.",
      "And in California, voters will determine the fate of a ballot measure that would raise criminal penalties for many drug-related crimes."

      "A lawyer for Elon Musk said in a Philadelphia courtroom Monday that the winners of Musk\u2019s $1 million daily prize giveaway in election swing states are not chosen at random, contradicting what Musk said when he announced the contest last month.",
      "Legal experts told NBC News that the disclosure could have legal fallout for Musk across multiple jurisdictions under laws designed to protect consumers from deceptive practices.",
      "\u201cThis is absolutely, unambiguously illegal,\u201d Christopher Peterson, a University of Utah law professor who specializes in consumer protection, said in an email.",
      "\u201cYou cannot lawfully lie to the public about conducting a random sweepstakes, lottery, or contest and then rig the results to hand-select the winners,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really is not complicated. This is just fraud; a simple, ugly fraud on the public.\u201d",
      "He said Musk and his super PAC\u2019s behavior could be \u201cboth a civil wrong and a crime.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s America PAC declined to comment on that analysis or the views of other legal experts. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Chris Gober, a lawyer for America PAC, made the disclosure at a hearing about the giveaways. He said that the winners are not chosen by random, as in a lottery drawing, but that the super PAC instead selects the winners based on who it believes would be effective political spokespeople.",
      "The disclosure flew in the face of what Musk said onstage at a Pennsylvania rally on Oct. 19, when he revealed the contest to draw attention to a petition supporting free speech and gun rights.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be awarding $1 million randomly to people who have signed the petition every day from now until the election,\u201d Musk said, followed by wild applause from the audience.",
      "The disclosure that Musk\u2019s statement was not true was met with backlash on Musk\u2019s social media app, X, where some users said Monday that he had deceived petition-signers or even defrauded them. To sign the petition, people are required to give their names, email addresses, cellphone numbers and mailing addresses, and they must be registered to vote in one of seven swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin.",
      "America PAC\u2019s daily $1 million giveaway has been a key feature of Musk\u2019s efforts on behalf of former President Donald Trump. Musk has spent more than $118 million to try to re-elect Trump, and he has appeared in Pennsylvania numerous times to campaign in person.\u00a0Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner sued Musk and America PAC over the offer, calling it an unlawful lottery under Pennsylvania law and leading to Monday\u2019s court hearing.",
      "John Summers, a lawyer for Krasner, called Gober\u2019s disclosure \u201ca flat-out admission of liability\u201d at the hearing.",
      "While Gober said he believed the non-random nature of the offer means it is not a lottery, legal experts said the statement could open up Musk and the super PAC to additional claims of liability under federal consumer protection law or in the seven battleground states where people have been winning prizes.",
      "Rebecca Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School who specializes in the First Amendment and false advertising, said she considered Gober\u2019s disclosure to be an admission of liability.",
      "\u201cThey falsely advertised that people who never had a chance to win should participate, and participation meant providing the PAC with valuable information about voters to target,\u201d she said in an email.",
      "\u201cDeceptive trade practices laws may be triggered by claiming \u2018random\u2019 selection and then not delivering, but states may differ about exactly what conduct is covered \u2014 many limit prohibitions to conduct that relates to selling goods or services,\u201d she said.",
      "Whether such laws apply in the circumstances around America PAC would be determined in court only if someone decides to sue. Tushnet said that she expects plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers could explore class action lawsuits over consumer protection and that state attorneys general may be interested in pursuing enforcement actions, too.",
      "George Conway, a prominent lawyer and former Republican who is a vocal critic of Trump, agreed that state attorneys general could see the disclosure as a consumer protection issue.",
      "Typically under state law, \u201cthis is actually bread and butter stuff for them,\u201d he said in a direct message. \u201cThere are church raffle exemptions and such but if you are giving out a million dollars you\u2019ve got to comply with some specific requirements.\u201d",
      "A representative for the Pennsylvania attorney general declined to comment. Representatives for attorneys general in several other states did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "A spokesperson for the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees consumer protection on the federal level, declined to comment.",
      "Not all legal experts agree that action would be warranted on behalf of petition-signers.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t imagine any AG or the FTC getting into the middle of this very minor dust up,\u201d said David Vladeck, a Georgetown University law professor, in an email. He said that even if Musk\u2019s offer of a random chance at $1 million was deceptive, \u201cit was isolated (only a few days) and unlikely to be repeated.\u201d",
      "But Vladeck added that there is the separate question of whether the offer violated federal election law, which bars paying people to vote or register to vote.",
      "\u201cSome of the criminal authorities might be concerned that there was a quid pro quo in that Musk was providing cash for people to vote for his candidate, albeit dressed up with some kind of lottery,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is going to be an enforcement action against Musk, it will be by the criminal authorities, not the FTC or State AGs.\u201d",
      "Lorrin Freeman, the district attorney of Wake County, North Carolina\u2019s largest county, said in an email: \u201cOur office has not received any information that would give rise at this time to an investigation of Mr. Musk for conduct within the state of North Carolina that violates state law.\u201d",
      "Jeff Sovern, a professor of consumer protection law at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, said Musk\u2019s offer \u201csounds like a fairly clear violation\u201d of the 1914 federal law that bans deceptive trade practices. He said that, under that law, conduct is deceptive if it misleads consumers who are acting reasonably under the circumstances and if there\u2019s a false statement that\u2019s material, or that matters to consumers.",
      "He said a non-random contest marketed as random appears to fit both requirements.",
      "\u201cThe claim that this is random is likely to cause consumers acting reasonably to believe it is random,\u201d he said in an email. He added, \u201cIt seems likely that a chance to win a million dollars would matter to many consumers.\u201d",

He said that Congress hasn\u2019t given the FTC the budget to bring every case it could and that if it did bring a case, the result might simply be an order for America PAC to stop the offer \u2014 which is scheduled to end Tuesday, anyway.",
      "\u201cSometimes the FTC can get a financial penalty \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether that would be the case here \u2014 but I suspect that wouldn\u2019t matter much to the world\u2019s richest man,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cOn the other hand, the FTC has become the federal government\u2019s foremost protector of privacy and the privacy implications of this might increase their interest in the matter,\u201d he added.",
      "The Justice Department, which had warned Musk\u2019s super PAC that its offer may run afoul of federal election law, did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

      "Some Americans are voting for their wallets. Others are voting for democracy. And there are those who just aren\u2019t sure.",
      "That\u2019s what several people profiled in NBC News\u2019 \u201cCheckbook Chronicles\u201d over the last four months shared days ahead of an election that offers two profoundly different economic visions.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris calls for expanded support for caregivers, homebuyers and entrepreneurs, paired with curbs on grocery and drug prices. Former President Donald Trump wants more tariffs and tax cuts, an unprecedented immigration crackdown and slashed government spending that he says would spur growth and lower costs.",
      "While many economists favor Harris\u2019 agenda, she has struggled to sustain a decisive lead among voters on economic matters. Meanwhile, the economy itself remains solid, even though major cost pressures linger. Inflation is virtually back to normal, the job market is cooling but stable and consumer optimism is bounding higher.",
      "There\u2019s more to it under the surface, though. Here\u2019s how a few ordinary Americans see things from where they\u2019re sitting.",
      "On the upswing",
      "Stefanie Longenecker, 43, has been breathing a little easier as inflation slows.",
      "After leaving the workforce during the pandemic because she couldn\u2019t find affordable child care, Longenecker said her family has been economizing. But her husband recently got a new job that pays more per hour and with lower health care costs.",
      "The role offers less overtime, causing a slight decline in their monthly income, but she doesn\u2019t mind the trade-off: He can spend more time with the family, and she\u2019s started doing some freelance writing to pull in more money.",
      "While household finances have been tight, \u201cI\u2019m really happy with the government doing what it seems like they can do, and unfortunately they\u2019re not getting recognized,\u201d she said of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s economic policies. \u201cThings are absolutely trending in a good direction.\u201d",
      "Things are absolutely trending in a good direction.",
      "Stefanie Longenecker, 43, Palmyra, Pa.",
      "Education, reproductive rights and health care access are bigger priorities than economic issues for Longenecker, who lives in Palmyra, Pennsylvania, and is backing Harris. Still, she worries her finances could worsen under Trump, especially if he puts tariffs of up to 20% on all foreign goods and 60% on imports from China.",
      "\u201cThe idea of tariffs, to me, is horrifying and could tank our economy,\u201d Longenecker said. \u201cIf people think that things are expensive now, wait until the prices go up 20%, 30%, 40%.\u201d",
      "Things are also looking up for Stefany Serna, 33, a server at a steakhouse in Coral Gables, Florida. Her husband\u2019s side gig has been \u201cflourishing,\u201d giving them steady monthly income and a glimpse of a future beyond waiting tables. He\u2019s a fellow server but has a background in music production and has been uploading \u201cdeep relaxation\u201d tracks to Spotify and YouTube.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for many years, but this one avenue that he did finally \u2014 it gave birth to something,\u201d Serna said. She declined to say how much the music project is earning but said it\u2019s letting her husband pick up fewer shifts.",
      "Serna herself has begun working on a mobile bartending business. And while pursuing their solo ventures has required some tight budgeting, she said they see it as a long-term play.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be on my feet every day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to build a family. I would prefer to be at home.\u201d",
      "A self-described Republican since high school, Serna isn\u2019t too keen on either candidate but prefers Trump. \u201cHis first term was good, even though we had Covid,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like the economy was a little better.\u201d",
      "Times still tough",
      "Lucy Haverfield is planning to sell her home in Alva, Florida, and leave the state for good.",
      "The 71-year-old widow was already struggling to get by on $2,400 a month in Social Security payments. But now her homeowners insurance rates and property taxes are set to go up at least $2,000 combined next year, which a roughly $50 bump in monthly Social Security checks won\u2019t cover.",
      "\u201cWith the income that I have right now, I can only absorb so much,\u201d Haverfield said. She weathered only minor damage from Hurricane Milton but said she isn\u2019t sure how many more intensifying hurricane seasons she can sustain.",
      "\u201cFlorida is going to be left to people who have the financial wherewithal to withstand repeated beatings and absorb all the insurance costs,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery year it\u2019s up and up and up.\u201d",
      "Do I want a democracy or not? \u2026 I\u2019m not voting on somebody who is going to make my electric bill better.",
      "Lucy Haverfield, 71, Alva, Fla.",
      "Insurers had already been hiking rates and fleeing the state before the back-to-back punches from hurricanes Helene and Milton, but industry experts now warn that Floridians\u2019 costs could surge higher still.",
      "Where Haverfield moves next could hinge on the election. She said she\u2019s considering Canada if Trump wins, but not necessarily for economic reasons.",
      "\u201cIf Trump were handing out gold coins, it wouldn\u2019t matter because it\u2019s about: Do I want a democracy or not? That\u2019s what I\u2019m voting on,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not voting on somebody who is going to make my electric bill better. I wish they would, but at least you have a chance if you have a democracy.\u201d",
      "Georgia resident Nancy Breland, 72, hasn\u2019t seen any financial relief either. Her monthly retirement income of around $7,600 is comfortable, but homeowners insurance, utilities and long-term care costs are weighing on her.",
      "As her husband\u2019s cognitive health declines, she fears having to dip into savings to cover his care. Her homeowners insurer recently canceled her policy, sending her scrambling to find another provider as Helene and then Milton headed her way. She spent $8,000 on repairs after the storms, and her monthly electric bill went from around $220 earlier this year to $360 now, even as her usage has gone down. Grocery bills also remain high.",
      "Breland voted reluctantly for Trump, whom she called a narcissist. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I had much choice,\u201d she said, adding of Harris, \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s got the backbone for the job.\u201d",
      "Breland isn\u2019t optimistic that her financial picture will change under the next administration. \u201cI\u2019ve got bigger things going on that are way more stressful,\u201d she said. \u201cWhoever wins, I just hope they do the best job that they can and we\u2019re surprised by the outcome.\u201d",
      "A mixed picture",
      "Otis Keys II, a Dallas-area UPS truck driver, is looking for stability. The 41-year-old said he resumed full-time shifts in mid-October after a series of schedule changes that he expected would lower his full-year income by at least $20,000.",
      "He\u2019s now grossing $2,500 each week, less than the $3,100 he was able to hit before the carrier\u2019s overtime crackdown, and feeling a bit more upbeat about replenishing his nearly depleted savings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my second week back,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a work in progress right now, trying to get back to the game plan.\u201d",
      "Keys, who has shouldered steep grocery costs for three teenagers, hasn\u2019t decided how to vote this year. \u201cI know this sounds crazy, but I got a couple of days to get that figured out,\u201d he said.",
      "Keys said Harris has put forth clearer economic policies, like her plan to offer first-time homebuyers $25,000 in downpayment assistance. His rent for his four-bedroom home is rising to $1,850 in January, and he wants to own his next place.",
      "Are you better off than four years ago? That\u2019s all that really matters.",
      "Becky Melvin, 61, Jacksonville, Fla.",
      "While Keys said Trump\u2019s \u201cpro-America\u201d stance appeals to him, he has been leaning toward Harris since watching her debate performance and was put off by the former president\u2019s anti-union comments in a conversation this summer with multibillionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whom Trump praised for sacking striking workers.",
      "Many Americans will breathe a sigh of relief after casting their ballots, but Keys said he won\u2019t rest easy until after Nov. 16, when his local Teamsters chapter will vote on its next president \u2014 a decision that \u201cis impacting me more than anything,\u201d said Keys, who\u2019s voting to unseat an incumbent official.",
      "\u201cUPS is a giant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be three times as strong and stern when it comes to holding the company to the contract.\u201d",
      "Becky Melvin, 61, said the daily anxiety about her future has started to lift for the first time in years. The Jacksonville, Florida, resident had been picking up orders for groceries and other items on delivery apps after getting laid off from a six-figure public relations job shortly before the pandemic.",
      "It was tough going, but in September she began taking classes to become a 911 operator and dispatcher, a role she said was completely outside her comfort zone.",
      "\u201cI had to go find an opportunity at an agency that would hire someone over age 60, who still thinks I have something to offer,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s helping my community and my police officers.\u201d",
      "The job entails a slight pay cut from the roughly $50,000 she was netting on the delivery apps after taxes, but Melvin finally has health insurance again, as well as a pension. For the first time in years, she was recently able to pay for a new glasses prescription.",
      "But Melvin feels she\u2019s still climbing back toward the financial stability she enjoyed before her layoff, which is factoring into her vote for Trump.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe [Harris] has any idea how to help the economy,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people are saying, \u2018Are you better off than four years ago?\u2019 That\u2019s all that really matters.\u201d"

      "The mud\u2019s story dates to the 1930s, and MLB still relies on one small supplier.",
      "A new study explains the science behind why it works: The mud has perfect proportions of clay and sand.",
      "For more than 80 years, baseball has relied on a stash of special mud to take the shine off balls\u2019 slick leather and give fielders a better grip. The substance is rubbed on every baseball before every major league game.",
      "Called Lena Blackburne Baseball Rubbing Mud, it comes from a single source: a secret spot along the banks of a tributary of the Delaware River. Jim Bintliff, a retired New Jersey printing press operator, collects the mud about once a month from his grandfather\u2019s old fishing hole. He likens its consistency, after processing, to a \u201ccold cream or maybe a stiff pudding.\u201d",
      "Despite the mud\u2019s ubiquity, no one had been able to explain the science behind why it makes balls easier to grip \u2014 or even provide empirical proof that it worked at all. Until now.",
      "Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania designed a series of tests to study the mud and even constructed a synthetic rubber \u201cfinger\u201d to measure its characteristics. Their results, published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, offer the first published scientific evidence that the mud\u2019s power is more than myth.",
      "\u201cIt spreads like face cream, but it grips like sandpaper. It has this magical ability,\u201d said Doug Jerolmack, a geophysicist at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of the study.",
      "Jerolmack\u2019s team found that the mud has the perfect proportions of sticky clay and particles of sand. The latter studs the surface of a ball like barnacles to enhance friction, yet the material still spreads thin and even, like toothpaste.",
      "\u201cThe more you push on it, the more it flows,\u201d Jerolmack said.",
      "The authors concluded that any attempt to create a synthetic substance to replace the mud \u2014 something Major League Baseball has explored \u2014 would be foolish.",
      "\u201cIt is a very special combination of ingredients that nature makes that make it work,\u201d Jerolmack said.",
      "The mud\u2019s origin story is rooted in tragedy.",
      "In a game in August 1920, New York Yankees pitcher Carl Mays fired a ball toward Cleveland shortstop Ray Chapman and hit him in the head. The ball struck Chapman\u2019s skull, killing him.",
      "The death raised concerns about wild pitches and the risk of fresh, shiny baseballs slipping from pitchers\u2019 hands. So in 1929, the president of the National League required umpires to start soiling balls for better grip, according to the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "But finding the right substance proved tough.",
      "\u201cThey tried to use infield dirt. That scratched the leather too much. They tried using shoe polish and tobacco spit; those things darkened the ball too much,\u201d Bintliff said.",
      "Finally, in 1938, Lena Blackburne, a third-base coach for the Philadelphia Athletics, remembered a fine filtered mud from his childhood in New Jersey. He went back to the source, collected it and began applying it.",
      "The mud was so popular that Blackburne created a business of processing and selling it. Eventually, he passed the company to a childhood friend with whom he used to fish and swim, whose grandson, Bintliff, now runs the company with his wife.",
      "Since 2022, MLB has mandated that at least 156 balls get prepared for every game, each getting at least a 30-second rub with the mud within a three-hour period.",
      "Bintliff said MLB purchases tubs of mud for every team at $100 each \u2014 two for the regular season and more for spring training. Some clubs, like the World Series-winning Dodgers, purchase additional containers for their farm systems, he added.",
      "\u201cThis mud works as a superfine abrasive and takes the gloss coating off without doing any type of damage to the leather or laces,\u201d Bintliff said.",
      "He collects the mud in 5-gallon buckets \u2014\u00a0usually around 10 to 20 buckets per visit to the riverbank \u2014 then processes it in his garage by draining the river water, removing twigs and stone and adding tap water. The process yields a rough average of 150 pounds of product.",
      "Are any special ingredients added?",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the proprietary part,\u201d he said.",
      "The scientists who studied the mud aren\u2019t baseball die-hards, but they got interested after doing an informal analysis of the substance five years ago. After that, two students at Jerolmack\u2019s lab set off to prove whether or not the mud worked. They developed three key tests.",
      "First, they analyzed the mud\u2019s adherence, or stickiness, by using an atomic force microscope, which measures the mud\u2019s resisting force as an instrument pulls away from it. Then, to understand how well the mud flowed, the researchers placed some on a machine called a rheometer that spun the sample and measured its viscosity.",
      "The third test estimated the friction between human skin and a baseball; it involved constructing a \u201cfinger\u201d out of synthetic rubber, with a drop of whale oil substituting for the oils secreted by human skin. The \u201cfinger\u201d was pressed to strips of leather baseballs then spun on the rheometer.",
      "The properties those tests revealed are rare and sought after in cosmetics and other fields, according to Emanuela Del Gado, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Institute for Soft Matter Synthesis and Metrology.",
      "\u201cIn industry, people spend quite some time to adjust the formulation to obtain that type of property,\u201d said Del Gado, who was not involved in the research.",
      "\u201cSimple materials to us, can be extremely complex, and they can teach us a lot,\u201d she added, noting that the mud was shaped by currents, rainfall and long cycles of seasonal environmental changes.",
      "These days, Bintliff counts among his clients college coaches, Little League umpires and National Football League teams. He plans to pass the business to one of his children.",
      "So far, the mud has survived new technology vying to replace it.",
      "In 2016, MLB tested balls coated with a proprietary chemical, and last year, Commissioner Rob Manfred said the league was working with Dow Chemical to develop a \u201ctacky ball\u201d that would stay \u201cpure white.\u201d But that project has not closed in on a solution that could replace the mud, an MLB source said.",
      "The study authors recommended against abandoning the mud, given their new evidence supporting what ballplayers intuited more than 80 years ago: \u201cThis stuff works,\u201d Jerolmack said."

      "The ban on the \u201cjunk fees,\u201d which will go into effect in the 2027-28 academic year, applies to students eligible for free and reduced-price school meals \u2014 those whose annual household incomes are 185% or less of the federal poverty level, which equals $57,720 maximum for a family of four.",
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government agency that aims to ensure fairness in the marketplace, estimated in a report in July that school meal payment processors collect more than $100 million in transaction fees a year.",
      "The report said the fees disproportionately burden lower-income households, which tend to make smaller, more frequent electronic deposits into their children\u2019s accounts.",
      "That means that although students who qualify for reduced-price school meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch, many families end up paying additional costs because of the fees they incur every time they deposit money into their meal accounts.",
      "The average processing charge is $2.37 for payment processors that charge a flat rate and 4.4% of the total transaction for those that charge a percentage, according to the report.",
      "\u201cThe policy announced today will ensure fairness for all students receiving meals at a reduced price, even when paying online,\u201d the Agriculture Department said in a statement Friday.",
