      "Last season's scoring champ and finals MVP will be featured on the game\u2019s standard edition. He averaged 32.7 points, 6.4 assists and five rebounds per game, leading the Thunder to a 68-14 record.",
      "The Thunder outscored teams by 12.9 points per game, the biggest margin in league history. They beat the Indiana Pacers in seven games to win the NBA title. Gilgeous-Alexander was awarded last week for his stellar season with a record-setting 4-year, $285 million extension.",

      "Chanel has marked 110 years of its haute couture by recreating its atelier inside the freshly restored Grand Palais for Paris Couture Week",
      "PARIS -- Only Chanel would call its legendary Rue Cambon salon \u201ctoo small\u201d \u2014 then rebuild it, supersized, in a palace.",
      "On Tuesday, as the house marked 110 years of its haute couture \u2014 a century and more of Coco Chanel\u2019s revolution in how women dress \u2014 it blew up its atelier as a giant set inside the freshly restored Grand Palais, turning intimacy into spectacle for a nature-drenched show at Paris Couture Week.",
      "Chanel, whose founder banished corsets and reimagined luxury as liberation, showed just how far that legacy stretches: from the tiny salons of 1915 to its modern colossus.",
      "It was a flex only a handful of luxury giants could pull off \u2014 and perhaps, as one front-row guest suggested, a dazzling distraction as the fashion world counts down to the debut of Chanel's new designer Matthieu Blazy.",
      "Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Naomi Campbell and the house\u2019s tightest VIP circle scaled gilded steps, sweating past marble and gold, to enter the reconstructed atelier. The set by Willo Perron was classic Chanel: intimate yet monumental, old world yet futuristic.",
      "\u201cIt just felt special,\u201d Campbell said, \u201clike stepping into a memory and something completely new. There\u2019s warmth, intimacy, nostalgia. Chanel can recreate anything, and it works.\"",
      "More drama unfolded on the runway. This was couture as nature fantasy, filtered through the Chanel prism. Menswear tailoring added swing to sculpted jackets and coatdresses, while mohair suits in deep greens and plums channeled autumn\u2019s hush. Boucl\u00e9 tweeds mimicked sheepskin; feathers and tweed created illusionary faux fur.",
      "Gold-sprayed wheat ears \u2014 the house symbol of abundance \u2014 were everywhere: stitched into flounces, embroidered on necklines, set on every guest\u2019s seat. The theme may have been country, but make no mistake: This was as close as Chanel gets to \u201croughing it.\u201d",
      "Technique dazzled at every turn: jewel-buttons, embroidered florals and a finale of lam\u00e9 so luminous it mimicked sunlight on harvest fields. The studio team, holding the fort after Virginie Viard\u2019s abrupt and unceremonious exit last year, anchored the show in classic codes but played with wit and lightness.",
      "That obsessive handwork matters \u2014 not just for tradition, but for business. Chanel is fashion\u2019s juggernaut: Privately held, the brand reported $18.7\u202fbillion in revenue for 2024, cementing its status as one of the world\u2019s most powerful luxury houses. Couture may be the crown, but its influence drives global sales in fragrance, bags and jewelry, making it the envy of rivals.",
      "Change is always looming at Chanel. For more than 30 years, Karl Lagerfeld transformed the brand from Parisian legend to pop phenomenon, staging ever-grander spectacles at the Grand Palais. After his death in 2019, Viard, his longtime deputy, guided Chanel into a softer, more discreet era.",
      "Now the industry is holding its breath for Blazy, a Belgian talent with stints at Margiela, Celine and most recently Bottega Veneta, where he won fans for his blend of innovation and reverence for craft.",
      "Campbell said of Blazy, whom she knows personally: \u201cHe\u2019s focused, open-minded \u2014 he\u2019ll bring something special.\u201d",
      "Tuesday\u2019s show unfolded inside the Grand Palais' newly restored Salon d\u2019Honneur, its gold and stone revealed after a 600-million-euro, multi-year restoration co-funded by Chanel. It\u2019s more than a venue; it\u2019s an advertisement of the house\u2019s power and commitment to Parisian heritage.",

      "GENEVA -- A Swiss village has cashed in on a pay-for-entry turnstile used by avid tourists who flock each day to a lakeside dock featured in the hit South Korean Netflix series \u201cCrash Landing On You,\u201d often to snap souvenir photos.",
      "Local leaders in Iseltwald and tourism officials insist the village's 406 inhabitants aren\u2019t getting rich off the influx of visitors, who pay 5 Swiss francs ($6.30) to access the dock. In 2024, entries brought in nearly 245,000 francs ($307,000), while a one-franc public pay toilet collected about 58,000 francs more, said village clerk Gabriela Blatter.",
      "Proceeds have gone mostly to garbage disposal, restroom cleaning, additional work hours and custodial staff hires, she said.",
      "Titia Weiland, manager of the B\u00f6nigen-Iseltwald Tourism agency, said the funds go right back to village upkeep: \u201cIt\u2019s not correct to read it as \u2018the community gets rich\u2019,\u201d alluding to some comments along those lines in the media and online.",
      "The village, situated along a small peninsula that juts out into Lake Brienz, features majestic views of Alpine peaks over the water.",
      "An episode in early 2020 of the cross-border Korean love story spotlighted the dock as a romantic getaway. That sparked online hype among fans of the series across Asia and beyond, which hasn\u2019t let up, fueling the rush of tourism to Iseltwald.",
      "The continued influx has exposed growing pains for the Swiss village, like those faced by other tourist hotspots that get too much of a good thing.",
      "Part of the problem is infrastructure: Iseltwald has three hotels and four restaurants, not enough for about 1,000 visitors who arrive by tour bus, public bus and car each day on average, according to Blatter. The village is revamping a parking lot to help cope with the strain, and the only village store now operates 7 days a week. Previously, it was open Monday to Friday.",
      "\u201cThere were always tourists in Iseltwald. We are happy with them. The problem is that the tourists don\u2019t understand what\u2019s private and what\u2019s public,\" Blatter said, adding that some traipse through private yards and gardens. \u201cThey go everywhere.\u201d",
      "For months, fans of the series could visit the dock for free until the turnstile was put up in 2023 to help offset costs incurred by the local government.",
      "Not long ago, Weiland said, \u201cwe were wishing for more tourists in Iseltwald: In some ways, we are thankful ... but it can be extreme.\u201d Villagers who hosted the crews for on-site filming at the dock had no idea the series would become such a runaway success, she said.",
      "The village has a website devoted to the \u201cfilming location\" of the series that lists transportation options and entreats visitors to respect the dock, refrain from littering, and consider the \u201cquiet atmosphere of this authentic Swiss village\u201d by keeping noise down and avoiding private property.",
      "\u201cEnjoy your stay in beautiful Iseltwald and take with you memories to your home country!\u201d the site says.",

The show's narrator, Iain Stirling, announced Ortega had departed \u201cdue to a personal situation\u201d early in Sunday's episode.",
      "Ortega becomes the second contestant this season to depart the show amid controversy due to past social media posts. Yulissa Escobar abruptly exited last month in the second episode after clips of her using racist language resurfaced online. Her departure was also not explained in the show.",
      "A spokesperson for the show declined to comment Monday.",

      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d is an American spin-off of the original U.K. series and is airing its seventh season. The show airs daily except Wednesdays and brings young singles together in a remote villa in Fiji to explore connections with the ultimate goal of finding love.",
      "Couples undergo challenges and are encouraged test their romantic connections as new contestants are introduced. Islanders are routinely \u201cdumped\u201d from the villa throughout the series as stronger couples form. The winning couple receives $100,000.",
      "The show, which strips contestants of their phones or access to the outside world, has previously asked fans to avoid cyberbullying contestants. Host Ariana Madix called for fans to stop doxxing and harassing the show\u2019s stars in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Ortega entered the villa at the end of the first episode as a bombshell, one of the first in a steady stream of new contestants who come in after the show began, often expected to disrupt existing couples and create new relationship dynamics.",
      "Ortega quickly coupled up with Nic Vansteenberghe, whom she remained with up until her departure. Her exit broke up one of the few consistent couples of the season. The couple had just announced a few episodes prior they were \u201cclosed off,\u201d a popular \u201cLove Island\u201d phrase to indicate neither contestant was interested in exploring a connection with any other islander.",
      "\u201cBefore Cierra had left, my mind was clear. I knew what the future would look like, and now, I'm lost,\u201d Vansteenberghe said during Sunday's episode.",
      "Vansteenberghe stayed on the show as a single islander after Ortega left, and he ultimately re-coupled with fellow contestant Olandria Carthen before the end of the episode.",
      "Belle-A Walker, a contestant who was dumped earlier this season, took to Instagram to express heartbreak over Ortega's resurfaced posts. Walker, who is Asian American, said she is \u201cdeeply appreciative\u201d of the show's producers \u201cfor taking a stand and making it clear that racism of any kind is not tolerated.\u201d",

      "Wrapped in a custom Schiaparelli gown of graphic fringe, the U.S. rapper stood beneath the gilded columns of the Petit Palais, holding a live crow on her arm.",
      "Her avian plus one squawked, glared, and nearly lunged \u2014 setting the tone for a show that soared straight into the surreal.",
      "It was a fitting image for Schiaparelli. Elsa Schiaparelli, the house\u2019s founder, built her legend in the 1930s by weaving the unexpected \u2014 lobster dresses, shoe hats, and, yes, animals \u2014 into the heart of high fashion.",
      "That legacy pulsed through Daniel Roseberry\u2019s Fall 2025 collection, a spectacle in pure black and white, staged as if the city itself had been drained of color, leaving only stark contrast and raw emotion.",
      "Inside, the mood was cinematic \u2014 gowns and jackets defined by intensity and ease, with the waist and hips shaped through unexpected techniques. Hints of disco sheen flickered like film across the runway.",
      "But if the house has been criticized in the past for relying on extreme corsetry and body manipulation, this season marked a shift. Roseberry, perhaps heeding the critics, abandoned his signature corset silhouette. In its place: a freer, more elastic exploration of the body, echoing Schiaparelli\u2019s own restless spirit.",
      "Roseberry said the collection was inspired by the moment in 1940, when Elsa Schiaparelli fled Nazi-occupied Paris for New York \u2014 a period \u201cwhen life and art was on the precipice: to the sunset of elegance, and to the end of the world as we knew it.\u201d",
      "Here, that tension was alive in every look: archival codes reimagined, but with a restless push toward the future. Dresses undulated like car bodies, hips arced in impossibly engineered shapes, ribbons from antique Lyon couture fluttered as kinetic sculptures.",
      "Yet the show was more than spectacle. This was couture at its most essential \u2014 an ideas factory for the entire fashion industry, unfettered by trends.",
      "\u201cChanel was interested in how clothes could be of practical use to women; Elsa was interested in what fashion could be,\u201d Roseberry added.",
      "It is this what-if energy, the transformation of memory, myth, and sheer technique into something never seen before, that keeps couture vital, even as the world rushes toward AI and disposable fast fashion.",
      "The setting only heightened the effect. The Petit Palais is currently home to an exhibit on Charles Worth, the 19th-century Englishman who invented haute couture by bringing artistry and handcraft to Paris. The symmetry was irresistible: in these halls, Schiaparelli\u2019s past collided with fashion\u2019s future, reminding all why couture matters: not as museum piece, but as living laboratory for risk, reinvention, and radical beauty.",
      "A decade after its relaunch, Schiaparelli has found commercial traction and become a fixture on the world\u2019s red carpets, a rare feat in today\u2019s luxury market. But above all, the brand\u2019s power lies in its ability to surprise. On opening day, as Cardi B\u2019s crow threatened to take flight, Schiaparelli proved that in Paris, fashion\u2019s most potent magic is still the unexpected.",

      "Dinosaur fatigue may be a theme in \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d but moviegoing audiences don\u2019t seem to have that reservation. The newest installment in the \u201cJurassic World\u201d franchise ruled the Fourth of July holiday box office with a global, five-day launch of $318.3 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "The Universal Pictures release, directed by Gareth Edwards, opened on Wednesday and earned $147.3 million in its first five days in 4,308 North American theaters. An estimated $91.5 million of that comes from the traditional \u201cthree day\u201d weekend, which includes the Friday holiday, Saturday and projected Sunday ticket sales.",
      "Internationally, it opened in 82 markets including China, adding $171 million to the opening total. According to the studio, $41.5 million of that came from China alone, where it played on 65,000 screens, 760 of which were IMAX. It's the country's biggest MPA (Motion Picture Association) opening of the year.",
      "\u201cRebirth,\u201d starring Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali and Jonathan Bailey, is the fourth movie in the \u201cJurassic World\u201d series and the seventh since Steven Spielberg\u2019s original Michael Crichton adaptation stormed theaters in the summer of 1993. The new film received mixed reviews from critics, carrying a 51% on Rotten Tomatoes, and B CinemaScore from opening weekend audiences.",
      "Factors like the holiday weekend, inflation and post-COVID moviegoing realities make it difficult to fairly compare the \u201cRebirth\u201d launch to the other films in the \u201cJurassic World\u201d franchise, the first of which opened to $208 million domestically in 2015. The other two, \u201cFallen Kingdom\u201d and \u201cDominion\u201d opened to $148 million and $145 million respectively.",
      "\u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d introduced a new main cast to the series and brought back a familiar voice in \u201cJurassic Park\u201d screenwriter David Koepp to guide the story about a dangerous hunt for dinosaur DNA (not for making dinosaurs this time, but for curing heart disease). It cost a reported $180 million net to produce, not including marketing and promotion costs.",
      "The campaign was far reaching, including a global press tour, with stops everywhere from London to Seoul, integrated marketing across NBC Universal platforms and brand tie-ins with everything from Jeep and 7-11 to Johansson\u2019s skincare line.",
      "No major new films dared go up against the dinosaurs, who left last week\u2019s champion, the Brad Pitt racing movie \u201cF1,\u201d in the dust. \u201cF1\u201d fell a modest 54% in its second weekend with $26.1 million, helping bring its domestic total to $109.5 million. It continues to play on IMAX screens with accounted for $7.6 million of the North American weekend ticket sales. Globally, it's nearing $300 million with a running total of $293.6 million.",
      "Third place went to Universal's live-action \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon,\u201d which earned $11 million in its fourth weekend, bringing its domestic total to $224 million. Disney and Pixar's \u201cElio\u201d landed in fourth place with $5.7 million. Globally, \u201cElio\u201d has just crossed $96 million in three weekends.",

      "LONDON -- Hard-rock royalty and some 40,000 fans gathered for an ear-splitting tribute to Ozzy Osbourne at what the heavy metal icon says was his last-ever live performance.",
      "The original lineup of Osbourne\u2019s band Black Sabbath performed at Villa Park soccer stadium in their home city of Birmingham, central England, on Saturday.",
      "The 76-year-old singer, who has been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease, sang from a black throne that rose up from under the stage.",

      "Osbourne performed several songs solo before being joined onstage, for the first time in 20 years, by Black Sabbath bandmates Tony Iommi, Terence \u201cGeezer\u201d Butler and Bill Ward. The band ended a short set with \u201cParanoid,\" one of its most famous songs.",
      "It capped a day-long metal festival that included performances from the likes of Anthrax, Metallica and Guns N\u2019Roses. Artists who sent plaudits and well-wishes included Jack Black, Dolly Parton and Elton John.",
      "\u201cYou are one of the most remarkable singers of our time,\u201d John said. \u201cYou are the king, you are the legend.\u201d",
      "Osbourne formed Black Sabbath in 1968 in Birmingham, a city then known for its heavy industry that became the crucible of the British metal scene. Black Sabbath\u2019s devil imagery and thunderous sound made them one of the era's most influential \u2014 and parent-scaring \u2014 metal acts. Both the band and Osbourne as a solo artist have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.",
      "Osbourne\u2019s fame expanded into the mainstream in the early 2000s, when he joined his wife Sharon Osbourne, and two of their children in the MTV reality TV show \u201cThe Osbournes.\u201d",
      "He has struggled with health issues since 2003 following a near-fatal quad bike crash. He revealed his Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis in 2020 and paused touring in 2023 after spinal surgery.",

      "And was there brotherly love between the famously feuding Gallagher siblings? Definitely maybe.",
      "Fans traveled to the Welsh capital from around the world for a show that many thought would never happen. Noel and Liam Gallagher, the heart of Oasis, had not performed together since the band's acrimonious split in 2009.",
      "One fan banner summed it up: \u201cThe great wait is over.\u201d",

      "The U.S. State Department's revelation that it has revoked visas for British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan is the latest indication that the Trump administration appears to have eased privacy restrictions to make public points",
      "WASHINGTON -- When the United States revokes someone's visa, it is typically confidential, with few exceptions. But with British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan and others, the Trump administration appears to have eased privacy restrictions to make a public point when it deems a case particularly egregious.",
      "The State Department\u2019s number two diplomat made headlines when he posted a social media message this week saying visas for the band for an upcoming U.S. tour had been revoked. British police are investigating whether a crime was committed when the duo's frontman led the audience in chants of \u201cDeath to the IDF\u201d \u2014 the Israel Defense Forces \u2014 at a music festival in the U.K.",
      "Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau posted that their visas had been revoked \u201cin light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants.\u201d",
      "The band rejected claims of antisemitism and said in a statement that it was being \u201ctargeted for speaking up\u201d about the war in Gaza.",
      "Under the Immigration and Nationality Act and certain statutes related to the privacy of government documents, the State Department has for years resisted or refused to discuss specific cases in which visas may have been denied or revoked. Certain exemptions apply, such as when foreign officials and their immediate family members are found to ineligible for entry into the United States for violating anti-corruption or human rights regulations.",
      "However, as the Trump administration pursues a nationwide crackdown targeted at visa holders it believes have engaged in antisemitic or pro-militant behavior, the standard for releasing once-privileged information seems to have been relaxed.",
      "\u201cForeigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said when asked about the public announcement.",
      "She said one reason for announcing the revocations was to make clear that the administration is serious about the standards it will apply to visa holders and applicants.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been public about that standard, and this was a very public event that violated that very basic standard about the nature of who we want to let into the country,\u201d Bruce said.",
      "Other recent cases have been less clear-cut, although some have ended up in public court cases.",
      "Earlier this year, as part of an initiative to expel foreign students who are accused by the Trump administration of engaging in pro-Hamas, anti-Israel or antisemitic activity, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had rescinded at least 300 visas and expected that number to rise.",
      "Many of those cases were not publicized individually.",
      "One that was: Rumeysa Ozturk, who was detained by immigration authorities in Massachusetts for authoring an opinion piece criticizing Tufts University for not taking a tougher line on alleged Israeli atrocities in Gaza.",
      "U.S. officials said at the time that her visa had been revoked because of adverse foreign policy consequences if she remained in the United States.",
      "Other high-profile and public cases of visa revocations for political reasons date back decades, including actor Charlie Chaplin in 1952 during the Truman administration and an ultimately unsuccessful deportation attempt against Beatles singer John Lennon in the 1970s.",
      "\u201cThe practice of ideological exclusion has a long history in the United States, having been used for decades as a political tool to keep U.S. audiences from being exposed to dissident viewpoints,\u201d the human rights group Amnesty International said in a 2020 report.",
      "\u201cDuring the Cold War, in particular, the U.S. government denied visas to some of the world\u2019s leading intellectuals, writers and artists who, the government thought, might promote Communism or other 'subversive' views,\u201d it said.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- While Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs awaits a jury\u2019s verdict in his federal sex trafficking trial, the once-celebrated music mogul has seen his business empire rapidly unravel.",
      "Combs, 55, who is one of the most influential figures in hip-hop history, now faces charges, including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking involving two former partners and transporting people across state lines for prostitution. Prosecutors have painted a dark portrait of the mogul, whose alleged pattern of violence included drug-fueled sex parties he reportedly called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "If convicted, the three-time Grammy winner could face life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how Combs\u2019 business portfolio and public image have crumbled under the weight of the allegations.",
      "Before Combs was arrested and charged, his major business ventures had collapsed: He stepped down and later fully divested from Revolt TV, which was founded in 2013. The network offered a mix of programming focused on hip-hop culture, R&B music, social justice and documentaries.",
      "He also reportedly lost a Hulu reality series deal and saw his once-iconic fashion brand Sean John vanish from Macy\u2019s shelves.",
      "After surveillance footage surfaced last year showing Combs physically assaulting singer Cassie, his then-girlfriend, in 2016, consequences mounted: New York City revoked his ceremonial key, Peloton pulled his music, Howard University rescinded his honorary degree and his charter school in Harlem cut ties.",
      "Last year, Combs settled a legal dispute with Diageo, relinquishing control of his lucrative spirits brands, Ciroc and DeLe\u00f3n. While many of his ventures have unraveled, his music catalog \u2014 for now \u2014 remains intact.",
      "Bad Boy Records may be synonymous with 1990s icons like The Notorious B.I.G., Faith Evans, Ma$e, and 112, but Combs kept the label relevant before his arrest with high-profile releases.",
      "In 2023, Combs dropped \u201c The Love Album: Off the Grid,\u201d which was his first solo studio album in nearly two decades, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e released her critically acclaimed project \u201d The Age of Pleasure \" through Bad Boy. Both albums earned Grammy nominations, with Mon\u00e1e\u2019s effort recognized in the prestigious record of the year category.",
      "Ahead of the \u201cThe Love Album\u201d release, Combs made headlines by returning Bad Boy publishing rights to several former artists and songwriters, years after he was criticized for how he handled their contracts.",
      "Bad Boy Records remains operational, but the label has been significantly shaken by Combs' legal firestorm and it hasn't announced any major upcoming releases.",
      "Last week, a surprise EP called \u201cNever Stop\u201d released by his son, King Combs, and Ye (formerly Kanye West), showed support for the embattled mogul. The project was released through Goodfellas Entertainment.",
      "Bad Boy Records remained active through 2022, backing Machine Gun Kelly\u2019s \u201cMainstream Sellout\u201d under the Bad Boy umbrella. He was a producer on MTV\u2019s reality television series \u201cMaking the Band,\u201d and \u201cMaking His Band,\u201d launching the careers of artists like the girl group Danity Kane and male R&B group Day 26.",
      "Combs has been sued by multiple people who claim to have been victims of physical or sexual abuse. He has already paid $20 million to settle with one accuser, his former girlfriend Cassie. Most of those lawsuits, though, are still pending. It isn\u2019t clear how many, if any, will be successful, or how much it will cost Combs to defend himself in court. Combs and his lawyers have denied all the misconduct allegations and dismissed his accusers as out for a big payday.",
      "Federal prosecutors have also informed the court that if Combs is convicted, they would seek to have him forfeit any assets, including property, \u201cused to commit or facilitate\u201d his crimes. They won\u2019t detail exactly what property that might involve until after the trial is over.",
      "Despite the legal turmoil surrounding Combs, his music catalog remains widely available on major streaming platforms including Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. None of the streamers have publicly addressed whether they plan to adjust how his music is featured if Combs is convicted.",
      "Interestingly, Combs\u2019 music saw a roughly 20% boost in U.S. streaming between April and May 2025, his biggest monthly spike this year, according to Luminate. The numbers jump coincided with key moments in the trial, including testimonies from Cassie and Kid Cudi.",
      "However, there was a slight drop-off with a 5 to 10% decrease in June compared to the previous month\u2019s streams.",
      "Streaming makes up a fraction of an artist's revenue and is calculated through a complicated process called \u201cstreamshare.\" Most artists see very little pay from digital services.",
      "Sean John, founded in 1998, has gone largely dormant, with its presence disappearing from major retailers like Macy's. There are no clear signs of a relaunch on the horizon.",
      "In 2023, Combs launched Empower Global, an online marketplace designed to uplift Black-owned businesses and strengthen the Black dollar. He positioned the platform as a modern-day \u201cBlack Wall Street,\u201d backing it with a reported $20 million of his own investment.",
      "The platform debuted with 70 brands and planned to expand by onboarding new Black-owned businesses each month, aiming to feature more than 200 by year\u2019s end.",
      "However, as 2023 came to a close, several brands cut ties with Empower Global. It was reported that some cited disappointing performance and growing concerns over the misconduct allegations surrounding Combs.",

      "BERLIN -- German investigators said Tuesday they were examining the case of a doctor who has been suspected of killing several patients.",
      "The public prosecutor's office and criminal police in the northern German town of Itzehoe said in a statement they were \"currently investigating a doctor from the Pinneberg district on initial suspicion of killing several patients, most of them elderly.\u201d",
      "They said they were looking into \u201cpast deaths\u201d and that a special commission had already carried out \u201cseveral autopsies and exhumations\u201d as part of the investigation.",
      "In line with German privacy rules, the statement did not further identify the doctor from Pinneberg, which is located between Itzehoe and Hamburg, nor did it give any details on the number or identity of the possible victims.",
      "\u201cNo details of the number of deaths investigated are currently being provided for reasons of investigative tactics,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The investigators said the forensic medical examination and evaluation of the findings were expected to take several weeks.",
      "In a different case, a Berlin doctor was charged in April with the killings of 15 patients under palliative care. The doctor was part of a nursing service\u2019s end-of-life care team and investigators say they\u2019ve found evidence linking him to the deaths of 15 people between September 22, 2021, and July 24 last year.",

      "Roseline Phay is a farmer in the West African nation of Liberia",
      "SARWORLOR, Liberia -- Five months ago, Roseline Phay, a 32-year-old farmer from the West African nation of Liberia, set off on a quest to find contraceptives.",
      "Phay and her partner have two daughters, and they barely make ends meet. Determined not to have more children, she went to a health worker in her village, but contraception pills, implants and condoms had run out. Phay trekked for hours on red clay roads to the nearest clinic, but they had no contraceptives either.",
      "She did not know it, but her mission was doomed from the beginning. Just weeks before, U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly suspended most foreign aid through the U.S. Agency for International Development, which paid for medications in Liberia's public clinics.",
      "Tenacious and outspoken, Phay repeated the trip four times. Then she got pregnant.",
      "\u201cI'm suffering,\u201d she said, with daughter Pauline crying in her arms. \u201cI have this little child on my back, and the other child in my stomach is suffering.\" She must continue farming throughout her pregnancy, she said, or \"I will not eat.\u201d",
      "After she got pregnant she had to wean Pauline off breastfeeding, she said, and the girl became so badly malnourished that she almost died. The U.S. cuts left no therapeutic food to give her, and she is still ill.",
      "Phay is among millions across Africa who have seen their lives upended after the U.S. aid cuts. In Liberia, the American support made up almost 2.6% of the gross national income, the highest percentage anywhere in the world, according to the Center for Global Development.",
      "\u201cThe impact of USAID in Liberia cannot be overstated,\u201d said Richlue O. Burphy, who worked for USAID projects for over a decade and manages the National Lottery, a government body. \u201cEverywhere you go, you see the USAID (signs). And almost all the government institutions ... had some kind of USAID partnership.\u201d",
      "The sense of betrayal runs deep in Liberia, established in the early 1800s with the aim of relocating freed slaves and free-born Black people from the United States. The political system is modeled on that of the U.S., along with its flag. Liberians often refer to the U.S. as their \u201cbig brother.\u201d",
      "Liberia was one of the first countries to receive USAID support, starting in 1961. Its officials thought they would be spared from Trump\u2019s cuts because of the countries' close relationship.",
      "Following civil wars and an Ebola epidemic, Liberia's survival has depended largely on foreign aid, mainly from the U.S. and the World Bank. Despite abundant natural wealth, six out of 10 Liberians live in poverty, according to the World Bank, and Liberia is among the world's 10 poorest nations.",
      "The aid cuts pose \u201ca serious challenge,\u201d especially for the healthcare system, Deputy Finance Minister Dehpue Y. Zuo, responsible for drafting the development budget, told The Associated Press. To make sure the system stays afloat, he said, \"we have to take a dramatic switch to see where we will be cutting funding for other areas.\u201d",
      "Liberia received an average of $527.6 million in aid annually between 2014 and 2023, according to the finance ministry. This year, Liberia was supposed to receive $443 million, but the total estimated impact of the cuts is $290 million \u2014 essentially what hadn't been disbursed yet.",
      "USAID funding built schools and health clinics, provided training for teachers and doctors and gave scholarships for study in the U.S. It supported small-scale farmers and paid for school meals.",
      "But most of the U.S. funding went to Liberia's health system, making up 48% of its budget. It funded malaria control, maternal health programs, HIV/AIDS treatment and community health programs. It financed hundreds of health projects run by aid groups.",
      "Now in Bong county, where Phay lives, medicine shelves in health clinics are almost empty. The USAID-funded ambulance cannot function because there is no money for fuel. Hospitals are running out of hand sanitizer and gloves. Training for medical staff has stopped, and community health workers have not been paid in months.",
      "Moses K. Banyan, head of the nearby CB Dunbar Hospital, described the U.S. cuts as \u201cbeyond a shock.\u201d He worried about the future, especially now that Bong county has begun to see a handful of mpox cases spread from neighboring Sierra Leone.",
      "Warning of the cuts could have helped in finding options, he said. \u201cBut it's like you were sleeping, you woke up and you were told: \u2018Hey, leave this house.\u2019\u201d",
      "The withdrawal of U.S. support is an opportunity for others, especially China, experts and officials said. Chinese companies have been operating Liberia\u2019s gold mines, building roads and training aid workers. Chinese beer is sold alongside local brands. Many Liberians who would have sent children to universities in the U.S. are now choosing China.",
      "Last month, China opened a cardiology wing in the capital\u2019s main hospital, which is named after John F. Kennedy but was commonly referred to as \u201cJust For Killing\u201d because of its scarce resources, even before the U.S. cuts.",
      "\u201cThere are gaps to be filled, and that cannot be covered by the government of Liberia,\u201d said Zuo, the deputy finance minister. \u201cWe are open door to the rest of the world, including the United States.\u201d",
      "In Phay's village of Sarworlor, community health worker Alice Togbah still wears her USAID vest though she hasn't been paid in months. She has no more malaria medication for children. She is running out of cough medicine and diarrhea treatment.",
      "A 4-year-old resident, Promise, got malaria a few days ago. Her mother, Grace Morris, obtained only a limited number of malaria tablets at the nearest clinic because of the U.S. cuts. Now they are finished, and the child still feels ill.",
      "\u201cChildren die from malaria here,\u201d she said. Last year, her neighbor's son died because he did not get medication on time.",
      "Morris and other women also seek contraceptives. Liberia in recent years made strides in bringing down teenage pregnancy rates and maternal mortality rates.",
      "For women in traditional, conservative communities, access to contraceptives meant reclaiming some control over their lives.",
      "\u201cIf ... my man touches me, I cannot say no because I need to satisfy him,\u201d Phay said. \u201cBut if I have no medicine, I will get pregnant.\u201d",
      "Her 9-year-old daughter, also named Promise, is living in the capital, Monrovia, with her aunt. Phay wants her to finish school and have a different life from hers.",
      "\u201cI am begging, if you people have the medicine, you people need to help us,\" she said. \u201cI don't want her to suffer like me.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- The government\u2019s top vaccine official working under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently restricted the approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, disregarding recommendations from government scientists, according to federal documents released Wednesday.",
      "The new memos from the Food and Drug Administration show how the agency\u2019s vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, personally intervened to place restrictions on COVID shots from vaccine makers Novavax and Moderna.",
      "Both vaccines were approved by the FDA in May after months of analysis by rank-and-file FDA reviewers.",
      "But internal correspondence show Prasad disagreed with staffers who planned to approve the shots for everyone 12 and older, similar to previous COVID vaccines. The scientists had concluded the benefit from the vaccines and the risk of COVID-19 outweighed the risk of possible side effects, which are rare.",
      "Instead Prasad decided the shots should be limited to those who face special risks from the virus\u2014 seniors or children and adults with underlying medical issues.",
      "Prasad explained that the COVID vaccine benefits must be reconsidered in light of falling rates of death and hospitalization and the possibility for vaccine side effects. It\u2019s the latest in a series of vaccine restrictions imposed by officials working under Kennedy, who has long questioned the benefits of vaccines.",
      "\u201cEven rare vaccination related harms both known and unknown now have higher chance of outweighing potential benefits\u201d Prasad wrote in a five-page memo explaining his decision.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months.",
      "Top FDA leaders are typically not involved in the review of individual products. Officials like Prasad can overrule staffers, but such cases are rare and often controversial.",
      "News of the FDA documents was first reported by the New York Times.",
      "Prasad was hired to lead the FDA\u2019s vaccine center in May, after the previous director, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign over disagreements with Kennedy. An academic researcher specializing in cancer therapies, Prasad came to prominence during the pandemic for criticizing public health measures, including the FDA\u2019s approval of COVID boosters for healthy adults and children.",

      "\u201cThe medications should be available, the question is at what price and can people sustain that,\u201d said Matt Maciejewski, a Duke University professor who studies obesity treatment coverage.",
      "Doctors say the situation forces them to get creative in treating patients, but there\u2019s hope that prices may fall more in the future.",
      "Wegovy and Zepbound are part of a wave of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity.",

      "But most state and federally funded Medicaid programs don\u2019t cover the drugs for obesity and neither does Medicare, the federal program mainly for people age 65 and older.",
      "Even the plans that cover the drugs often pay only a portion of the bill, exposing patients to hundreds of dollars in monthly costs, said Dr. Beverly Tchang.",
      "Drugmakers offer help with these out-of-pocket costs, but that assistance can be limited.",
      "\u201cCoverage is not the same as access,\u201d said Tchang, a New York-based doctor who serves as a paid advisor to both Novo and Lilly.",
      "Bill-payers like employers are nervous about drugs that might be used by a lot of people indefinitely.",

      "That should have ended the compounded versions, but there is an exception: Some compounding is permitted when a drug is personalized for the patient.",
      "The health care company Hims & Hers Health offers compounded doses of semaglutide, the drug behind Wegovy, that adjust dose levels to help patients manage side effects. Hims says these plans start at $165 a month for 12 months, with customers paying in full upfront.",
      "It\u2019s a contentious issue. Eli Lilly has sued pharmacies and telehealth companies trying to stop them from selling compounded versions of its products.",
      "Novo recently ended a short-lived partnership with Hims to sell Wegovy because the telehealth company continued compounding. Novo says the compounded versions of its drug put patient safety at risk because ingredients are made by foreign suppliers not monitored by US regulators.",
      "Hims says it checks all ingredients to make sure they meet U.S. quality and safety standards. It also uses a third-party lab to verify that a drug's strength is accurately labeled.",
      "Both drugmakers are selling most of their doses for around $500 a month to people without insurance, a few hundred dollars less than some initial prices.",
      "Even so, that expense would eat up about 14% of the average annual per person income in the U.S., which is around $43,000.",
      "There are some factors that may suppress prices over time. Both companies are developing pill versions of their treatments. Those could hit the market in the next year or so, which might drive down prices for the older, injectable doses.",

      "Authorities in eastern Libya have refused entry to three European ministers and the EU commissioner for migration on alleged entry violations",
      "CAIRO -- CAIRO (AP) \u2014 Authorities in eastern Libya refused entry to three European ministers and the EU commissioner for migration on alleged entry violations, apparently after they stopped first in the rival Libyan capital of Tripoli in the west.",
      "A statement from the prime minister of the eastern part of Libya, Osama Hammad, said the interior ministers of Italy, Greece, Malta and the EU migration commissioner, Magnus Brunner, were \u201cpersona non-grata\u201d after they were denied entry shortly after their arrival in Benghazi. It said the ministers had entered illegally and had not followed Libyan diplomatic conventions.",
      "The ministers were in \u201cflagrant contravention of established diplomatic norms and international conventions, and through actions that demonstrably disregard Libyan national sovereignty, as well as in violation of Libyan domestic laws,\u201d the statement said. The delegations \u201care urged to engage with the Libyan Government in accordance with the principle of reciprocity, as enshrined in international agreements, treaties, and diplomatic custom,\u201d it added.",
      "In addition to Brunner, the delegation included Greek Migration and Asylum Minister Thanos Plevris, Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi and Maltese Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri.",
      "The delegation was visiting Libya seeking tougher migration measures against boats carrying migrants from Libya. The EU has spent years and millions of euros trying to stem the people smuggling operations that have thrived in Libya's lawlessness and brought hundreds of thousands of desperate people to European shores.",
      "Libya plunged into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. In the chaos that followed, the country split, with rival administrations in the east and west backed by rogue militias and foreign governments. Currently, Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah heads the internationally recognized government in the capital of Tripoli in the west while Hammad heads the administration in the east, where the powerful military commander Khalifa Hifter continues to also hold sway.",
      "The EU delegation had met first with Dbeibah, and the deportation incident was apparently caused because the European delegation stopped first in Tripoli, said Greek Deputy Prime Minister Kostis Hadzidakis. Usually foreigners including diplomats coordinate with both administrations if they want to visit western and eastern Libya.",
      "Speaking to state-run ERT television in Greece, Hadzidakis said the Tripoli meeting went ahead as planned.",
      "\u201cHowever, in Benghazi \u2014perhaps because the visit to Tripoli came first \u2014 the Benghazi government decided it would not receive the European Commissioner and the three ministers. I don\u2019t think that was a constructive move, especially given that the European Union is genuinely trying to find a solution to this very unusual situation \u2014 just as it has tried with our other southern and eastern neighbors \u2014 on a complex issue like migration.\"",
      "For southern and eastern Libya, which are under the control of Hifter\u2019s forces, visitors have to coordinate and get permits from the east-based government, which is allied with Hifter. It's not clear if such permits were sought or granted.",
      "In Italy, opposition lawmakers who have criticized the hard-line stance against migration of the government of Premier Giorgia Meloni were quick to point out the irony that her migration minister was deported from a country on alleged immigration violations.",
      "\u201cPiantedosi was turned back from Libya because he was accused of illegal entry,\u201d Democratic Party lawmaker Matteo Orfini wrote on Facebook. \u201cI was thinking of an ironic comment but I\u2019d say that\u2019s good as is.\u201d",

He said he had given police investigators the names of two people who he suspected.",
      "The new animal protection law, known as the Brambilla law, went into effect on July 1 and calls for up to four years in prison and a 60,000-euro (around a $70,000) fine, with the stiffest penalties applied if the mistreatment is committed in front of children or is filmed and disseminated online.",

It said that a criminal probe was launched into his death and investigators saw suicide as the most likely cause.",
      "The agency said Starovoit's body was found in his car, but Russian media that carried images from the scene later reported that he was found dead in a small park next to a parking lot where he left his Tesla and a pistol presented to him as an official gift was at his side.",

      "Russian media reported that Starovoit\u2019s dismissal and his death could have been linked to an investigation into the embezzlement of state funds allocated for building fortifications in the Kursk region, where he was governor for five years before becoming transportation minister.",
      "Starovoit\u2019s successor as governor, Alexei Smirnov, stepped down in December and was arrested on embezzlement charges in April.

The incursion humiliated the Kremlin \u2014 the first time the country\u2019s territory was occupied by an invader since World War II.",

      "In a speech to the European Parliament marking the launch of Denmark\u2019s six-month term as holder of the EU presidency, Frederiksen lamented that \u201ccutting our defense spending in the past 30 years was a huge mistake.\u201d",
      "European officials have warned that President Vladimir Putin could soon try to test NATO\u2019s Article 5 security guarantee \u2014 the pledge that an attack on any one ally would be met with a collective response from all 32. Most of the allies are EU countries.",
      "Russia has been accused of acts of sabotage, cyberattacks and fake news campaigns \u2013 largely to weaken European support for Ukraine \u2013 and while Europe is not at war, it is not at peace either, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has said.",
      "\u201cRussia\u2019s military rearming means that they could, within two to five years, pose a credible military threat to Europe and NATO,\u201d Frederiksen told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France.",
      "\u201cStrengthening Europe\u2019s defense industry is an absolute top priority, and we have to be able to defend ourselves by 2030 at the latest,\u201d she said. \u201cNever, ever should we allow Europe to be put in a position again where we cannot defend ourselves.\u201d",
      "Many European leaders insist they have heard the Trump administration\u2019s warning that American security priorities now lie elsewhere \u2013 in the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific \u2013 but Europe\u2019s effort to arm is moving only slowly.",
      "At a key summit last month, NATO leaders endorsed a statement saying: \u201cAllies commit to invest 5% of GDP annually on core defense requirements as well as defense- and security-related spending by 2035 to ensure our individual and collective obligations.\u201d",
      "That historic pledge will require them to spend tens of billions of euros (dollars) more over the coming decade, not five years. Spain \u2013 NATO\u2019s lowest spender with 1.28% of GDP last year \u2013 quickly branded the target \u201cunreasonable.\u201d",
      "The goal has sparked debate in Slovenia \u2013 which spent 1.37% of GDP last year \u2013 about whether to hold referendums on defense spending and even on NATO membership itself.",

      "Money spent on military support to Ukraine can now be included in NATO\u2019s defense calculations, but even that accounting boost will not hike the GDP military spend by much.",
      "With the threat of Russian aggression at the forefront of its concerns, the EU\u2019s executive branch has come up with a security plan. It hinges on a 150-billion-euro ($176 billion) loan program that member countries, Ukraine and outsiders like Britain could dip into.",
      "It aims to fill gaps that the U.S. might leave. Spending priorities for joint purchase include air and missile defense systems, artillery, ammunition, drones, equipment for use in cyber and electronic warfare, and \u201cstrategic enablers\u201d like air-to-air refueling and transport.",
      "Countries are urged to buy much of their military equipment in Europe, working mostly with European suppliers \u2014 in some cases with EU help to cut prices and speed up orders. This is partly to create jobs in the European defense sector and partly to reduce reliance on American systems.",
      "On Tuesday, 15 EU countries were permitted to take advantage of another measure \u2014 a \u201cnational escape clause\u201d \u2014 to allow them to spend more on defense without breaking the bloc\u2019s debt rules.",
      "To help Ukraine fend off the Russian invasion, the plan aims to provide at least two million artillery rounds each year; supply more air defense systems, missiles and drones; and train tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops annually.",
      "Beefing up Ukraine\u2019s defense industry is also a pillar. The country produces arms and ammunition faster and more cheaply than its EU partners. Kyiv estimates that 40% more of its industrial capacity could be exploited if Europe were to invest.",
      "Still, ambition is one thing, and the reality another.",
      "\u201cThings are not moving fast enough to be able to defend ourselves in 5 years,\u201d Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen told reporters last week. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge, huge challenge to reach that goal.\u201d",
      "A big part of the problem is that governments and the defense industry are stuck in old ways of thinking and neither wants to take a risk, even with Europe\u2019s biggest land war in many decades still raging in its fourth year.",

      "Demand for 155mm artillery shells is a typical example, Finkielman said. \u201cWhen you see the kinds of orders that have been placed around Europe, it is two to three years out in time,\u201d he said, while industry needs five to 10 years\u2019 worth of orders to take a chance.",
      "Finkielman said that if governments and industries in Britain, France, Germany and Italy start to move, \u201cthe rest will follow.\u201d",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The high-profile case of the so-called Death Cap Mushroom Cook is likely to remain a topic of conversation across Australia for years to come.",
      "For more than two months, the triple-murder trial has gripped the public's attention with details of how Erin Patterson murdered three of her estranged husband\u2019s relatives by deliberately serving them a lunch of poisonous mushrooms,",
      "It is no surprise that on Tuesday \u2014 the day after the guilty verdict was delivered by the court in Victoria \u2014 media websites, social media and podcasts were scrambling to offer analysis on what motivated her.",
      "Newspaper headlines described Patterson, 50, as a coercive killer with narcissistic characteristics. \u201cCold, mean and vicious,\u201d read one.",
      "Strict Australian court reporting laws prohibit anything that might sway jurors in a trial. Some news outlets had saved up thousands of words awaiting the verdicts: scrutiny of Patterson\u2019s past work history, behavior and psyche.",
      "The coverage tried to explain why the mother of two meticulously planned the fatal lunch and lured three people she said she loved to their deaths. Any certain answer, for now, remains a mystery.",
      "She faces life in jail, with sentencing to come at a later date.",
      "After a nine-week Supreme Court trial in the state of Victoria, it took the jury six days to convict Patterson. She was guilty of murdering her parents-in-law, Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail\u2019s sister, Heather Wilkinson, by serving them a lunch of beef Wellington pastries laced with poisonous mushrooms.",
      "She was also convicted of attempting to murder Heather\u2019s husband, Ian Wilkinson, who survived the meal at Patterson\u2019s home in the rural town of Leongatha in 2023.",
      "Patterson denied the charges and gave a defense that she had no reason to murder her beloved, elderly in-laws. But the jury disagreed and rejected her claim that the inclusion of toxic mushrooms in the meal was a terrible accident.",
      "Prosecutors failed to offer a motive for Patterson\u2019s crimes and weren't required to.",
      "\u201cPeople do different things for different reasons. Sometimes the reason is obvious enough to others,\u201d prosecutor Nanette Rogers told the jury. \u201cAt other times, the internal motivations are only known by the person themselves.\u201d",
      "But Rogers gave hints. At one point, the prosecutor had Patterson read aloud scathing messages she'd sent which highlighted past friction with her in-laws and tension with her estranged husband, who had been invited to the lunch but didn\u2019t go.",
      "\u201cYou had two faces,\u201d Rogers said. Patterson denied it.",
      "With guilty verdicts but no proven reason why, Australian news outlets published avid speculation Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWhat on earth was Erin Patterson\u2019s motive?\u201d The Australian newspaper\u2019s editorial director Claire Harvey asked in a column. Harvey pointed at rifts in the killer's relationship with her estranged husband.",
      "Chris Webster was the first medical doctor to speak to Patterson after her four lunch guests had been hospitalized and testified in the trial. He told reporters Tuesday that he became convinced she deliberately poisoned her victims when she lied about buying the foraged mushrooms she had served from a major supermarket chain.",
      "\u201cShe had a dilemma and the solution that she chose is sociopathic,\u201d Webster told Nine Network television.",
      "The outpouring of scorn for Patterson reflects a national obsession with the case and a widespread view that she wasn't a sympathetic figure.",
      "It was an opinion Australians were legally required not to express in the media or online before the trial ended to ensure a fair hearing. But newspapers now don't have to hold back.",
      "Under the headline \u201cDeath Cap Stare,\u201d The Age reported how the \u201ckiller cook\u201d didn\u2019t flinch as she learned her fate, but stared at the jury as they delivered their verdict.",
      "Melbourne\u2019s Herald Sun newspaper\u2019s front page screamed: \u201cCOOKED,\u201d labelling Patterson \u201cEvil Erin\u201d and a \u201cCold-Blooded Killer.\u201d",
      "During the trial, Patterson chose to testify in her own defense, a tactic considered risky in the Australian justice system and one which most observers said didn't serve her well. She joked awkwardly at times and became combative with the prosecutor.",
      "Journalist John Ferguson, who won a Melbourne Press Club award for breaking the story of the fatal lunch, said Patterson often cried or came close to tears during her trial. But when she was convicted, she displayed no emotion, he noted.",
      "\u201cWhat the court got on Monday was the full Erin. Cold, mean and vicious,\u201d Ferguson wrote in The Australian Tuesday.",
      "The verdicts also prompted an online frenzy among Australians, many of whom turned citizen detectives during the trial.",
      "By late Monday, posts about the verdicts on local Reddit pages had drawn thousands of comments laced with black humor, including memes, in-jokes and photographs taken at local supermarkets where pre-packaged beef Wellington meals were discounted.",
      "Fascination about the case will linger. A drama series, documentary and books are planned, all of them likely to attempt an answer to the question of what motivated Patterson.",

      "Tebbit\u2019s son William said he died peacefully at home late Monday. No cause was given.",
      "Tebbit was known for his role tackling the power of Britain\u2019s trade unions during the 1980s, and for his socially conservative and free-market views.",
      "He was famed for suggesting the unemployed should get on their bikes to look for work, and for what became known as Tebbit\u2019s \u201ccricket test\u201d \u2013 his 1990 assertion that immigrants could not truly be British until they cheered for England at cricket, rather than India, Pakistan or the West Indies.",
      "Current Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said Tebbit was \u201can icon in British politics.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was one of the leading exponents of the philosophy we now know as Thatcherism and his unstinting service in the pursuit of improving our country should be held up as an inspiration to all Conservatives,\u201d she said. \u201cHe never buckled under pressure and he never compromised.\u201d",
      "A political bruiser known for no-holds-barred attacks on the opposition, Tebbit was nicknamed the \u201cChingford skinhead\u201d by opponents. Michael Foot, who led the Labour Party in the 1980s, called him a \u201csemi-house-trained polecat.\u201d",
      "However, even Tebbit\u2019s critics praised his stoic response to the Irish Republican Army bombing of Brighton\u2019s Grand Hotel during the Conservative Party conference in 1984. Five people were killed in the bombing, an attempt to kill Thatcher. Tebbit was seriously wounded and his wife Margaret was paralyzed from the neck down.",
      "Elected to the House of Commons in 1970, Tebbit served as employment secretary and trade secretary under Thatcher. In 1985 he was appointed chairman of the Conservative Party, helping Thatcher win a third straight election victory in 1987.",
      "The same year, he stepped down from the government so he could spend more time with his wife. In 1992 he was appointed to the House of Lords, Parliament\u2019s unelected upper chamber.",
      "He continued to speak out, especially on Britain\u2019s increasingly close relationship with Europe, about which he was skeptical. He was a prominent advocate of Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, an issue that divided his party and the country.",
      "After a 1998 peace accord ended three decades of violence in Northern Ireland, many former militants entered politics, But Tebbit did not forgive. When the former IRA commander Martin McGuinness \u2014 who had become deputy first minister of Northern Ireland \u2014 died in 2017, Tebbit expressed hope he was \u201cparked in a particularly hot and unpleasant corner of hell for the rest of eternity.\u201d",
      "Margaret Tebbit died in 2020. Tebbit is survived by two sons and a daughter.",

      "Thailand\u2019s Cabinet has withdrawn a controversial bill to legalize casinos",
      "BANGKOK -- Thailand\u2019s Cabinet on Tuesday withdrew a controversial bill that aims to legalize casinos after the Prime Minister was suspended last week over an ethics investigation.",
      "Deputy Minister of Finance Julapun Amornvivat said the government only wants to delay the bill and will reintroduce it at an appropriate time. He cited the current political situation and the Cabinet reshuffle as a factor in the decision.",
      "The bill, also known as the \u201centertainment complexes bill,\u201d was first approved by the Cabinet in January and was awaiting review by lawmakers. If passed, it would allow casinos to operate within complexes that also house other businesses such as hotels, convention halls, malls or theme parks.",

      "Paetongtarn is under an ethics investigation over accusations that she made comments that damaged Thailand\u2019s national interests to Cambodia's Senate President Hun Sen when the two discussed a recent border dispute last month.",
      "The ruling Pheu Thai Party has said the bill would help attract more investments, boost tourism and solve issues of illegal gambling. But it has faced strong opposition from the public and Pheu Thai\u2019s former coalition partner, Bhumjaithai Party, which quit the government last month over the leaked call.",
      "Julapun said the government needed more time to explain the benefits of the bill to the public, adding that the delay was regrettable.",

      "CAIRO -- Egyptian officials said Tuesday a fire that engulfed a main telecom company building in downtown Cairo the day before left four people dead and over two dozen injured.",
      "The blaze, which broke out at the landmark 10-story Telecom Egypt building and lasted for hours, began in one of the halls on the floor housing telecom operators and spread to other floors due to its intensity, authorities said.",
      "The four dead were company employees who had been inside the burning building, according to their workers\u2019 union.",
      "Hossam Abdel Ghaffar, the health ministry spokesperson, told The Associated Press over the phone the number of the injured increased from 14 to 26, including those who suffered from smoke suffocation. All were hospitalized and some have been discharged, he said.",
      "By Tuesday morning, the upper part of the building was charred, and firefighters were still spraying water as smoke billowed from the top floors, though the massive flames had been contained, according to an AP photographer on site.",
      "The blaze prompted a temporary outage of internet and mobile phone services. NetBlocks, a global internet monitor, wrote Monday on X that network data show national connectivity was at 62% of ordinary levels.",
      "The outage also disrupted air traffic, but the civil aviation ministry said early Tuesday all halted flights have taken off.",
      "The Egyptian Stock Exchange halted trading on Tuesday due to widespread disruption impacting the efficiency of the trading system.",
      "The minister of communications, Amr Talaat, said in a statement that all communications services will gradually be fully restored within 24 hours and that they were transferred to more than one switchboard to operate as an alternative network",

      "Cintula was immediately arrested and was ordered by a court to remain behind bars. If convicted, he faces life imprisonment.",
      "Fico was shot in the abdomen and was transported to a hospital in nearby Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica. He underwent a five-hour surgery, followed by another two-hour surgery two days later. He has since recovered.",
      "The defendant refused to testify at the court but confirmed that what he told investigators about his motive was true.",
      "In testimony read by a prosecutor at the trial, Cintula said he disagreed with the government's policies, including the cancellation of a special prosecution office dealing with corruption, the end of military help for Ukraine and the government\u2019s approach to culture \u201cI decided to harm the health of the prime minister but I had no intention to kill anyone.\u201d",
      "Cintula originally was charged with attempted murder. Prosecutors later dropped that charge and said they were instead pursuing the more serious charge of engaging in a terror attack, based on evidence the investigators obtained, but they gave no further details.",
      "Government officials initially said that they believed it was a politically motivated attack committed by a \u201clone wolf,\u201d but announced later that a third party might have been involved in \u201cacting for the benefit of the perpetrator.\u201d",

      "Fico has long been a divisive figure in Slovakia and beyond. He returned to power for the fourth time after his leftist Smer, or Direction, party won the 2023 parliamentary election after campaigning on a pro-Russia and anti-American message.",
      "His critics have charged that Slovakia under Fico has abandoned its pro-Western course and is following the direction of Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.",
      "Thousands have repeatedly rallied in the capital and across Slovakia to protest Fico\u2019s pro-Russian stance and other policies.",

    "story": [
      "Roseline Phay is a farmer in the West African nation of Liberia",
      "SARWORLOR, Liberia -- Five months ago, Roseline Phay, a 32-year-old farmer from the West African nation of Liberia, set off on a quest to find contraceptives.",
      "Phay and her partner have two daughters, and they barely make ends meet. Determined not to have more children, she went to a health worker in her village, but contraception pills, implants and condoms had run out. Phay trekked for hours on red clay roads to the nearest clinic, but they had no contraceptives either.",
      "She did not know it, but her mission was doomed from the beginning. Just weeks before, U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly suspended most foreign aid through the U.S. Agency for International Development, which paid for medications in Liberia's public clinics.",
      "Tenacious and outspoken, Phay repeated the trip four times. Then she got pregnant.",
      "\u201cI'm suffering,\u201d she said, with daughter Pauline crying in her arms. \u201cI have this little child on my back, and the other child in my stomach is suffering.\" She must continue farming throughout her pregnancy, she said, or \"I will not eat.\u201d",
      "After she got pregnant she had to wean Pauline off breastfeeding, she said, and the girl became so badly malnourished that she almost died. The U.S. cuts left no therapeutic food to give her, and she is still ill.",
      "Phay is among millions across Africa who have seen their lives upended after the U.S. aid cuts. In Liberia, the American support made up almost 2.6% of the gross national income, the highest percentage anywhere in the world, according to the Center for Global Development.",
      "\u201cThe impact of USAID in Liberia cannot be overstated,\u201d said Richlue O. Burphy, who worked for USAID projects for over a decade and manages the National Lottery, a government body. \u201cEverywhere you go, you see the USAID (signs). And almost all the government institutions ... had some kind of USAID partnership.\u201d",
      "The sense of betrayal runs deep in Liberia, established in the early 1800s with the aim of relocating freed slaves and free-born Black people from the United States. The political system is modeled on that of the U.S., along with its flag. Liberians often refer to the U.S. as their \u201cbig brother.\u201d",
      "Liberia was one of the first countries to receive USAID support, starting in 1961. Its officials thought they would be spared from Trump\u2019s cuts because of the countries' close relationship.",
      "Following civil wars and an Ebola epidemic, Liberia's survival has depended largely on foreign aid, mainly from the U.S. and the World Bank. Despite abundant natural wealth, six out of 10 Liberians live in poverty, according to the World Bank, and Liberia is among the world's 10 poorest nations.",
      "The aid cuts pose \u201ca serious challenge,\u201d especially for the healthcare system, Deputy Finance Minister Dehpue Y. Zuo, responsible for drafting the development budget, told The Associated Press. To make sure the system stays afloat, he said, \"we have to take a dramatic switch to see where we will be cutting funding for other areas.\u201d",
      "Liberia received an average of $527.6 million in aid annually between 2014 and 2023, according to the finance ministry. This year, Liberia was supposed to receive $443 million, but the total estimated impact of the cuts is $290 million \u2014 essentially what hadn't been disbursed yet.",
      "USAID funding built schools and health clinics, provided training for teachers and doctors and gave scholarships for study in the U.S. It supported small-scale farmers and paid for school meals.",
      "But most of the U.S. funding went to Liberia's health system, making up 48% of its budget. It funded malaria control, maternal health programs, HIV/AIDS treatment and community health programs. It financed hundreds of health projects run by aid groups.",
      "Now in Bong county, where Phay lives, medicine shelves in health clinics are almost empty. The USAID-funded ambulance cannot function because there is no money for fuel. Hospitals are running out of hand sanitizer and gloves. Training for medical staff has stopped, and community health workers have not been paid in months.",
      "Moses K. Banyan, head of the nearby CB Dunbar Hospital, described the U.S. cuts as \u201cbeyond a shock.\u201d He worried about the future, especially now that Bong county has begun to see a handful of mpox cases spread from neighboring Sierra Leone.",
      "Warning of the cuts could have helped in finding options, he said. \u201cBut it's like you were sleeping, you woke up and you were told: \u2018Hey, leave this house.\u2019\u201d",
      "The withdrawal of U.S. support is an opportunity for others, especially China, experts and officials said. Chinese companies have been operating Liberia\u2019s gold mines, building roads and training aid workers. Chinese beer is sold alongside local brands. Many Liberians who would have sent children to universities in the U.S. are now choosing China.",
      "Last month, China opened a cardiology wing in the capital\u2019s main hospital, which is named after John F. Kennedy but was commonly referred to as \u201cJust For Killing\u201d because of its scarce resources, even before the U.S. cuts.",
      "\u201cThere are gaps to be filled, and that cannot be covered by the government of Liberia,\u201d said Zuo, the deputy finance minister. \u201cWe are open door to the rest of the world, including the United States.\u201d",
      "In Phay's village of Sarworlor, community health worker Alice Togbah still wears her USAID vest though she hasn't been paid in months. She has no more malaria medication for children. She is running out of cough medicine and diarrhea treatment.",
      "A 4-year-old resident, Promise, got malaria a few days ago. Her mother, Grace Morris, obtained only a limited number of malaria tablets at the nearest clinic because of the U.S. cuts. Now they are finished, and the child still feels ill.",
      "\u201cChildren die from malaria here,\u201d she said. Last year, her neighbor's son died because he did not get medication on time.",
      "Morris and other women also seek contraceptives. Liberia in recent years made strides in bringing down teenage pregnancy rates and maternal mortality rates.",
      "For women in traditional, conservative communities, access to contraceptives meant reclaiming some control over their lives.",
      "\u201cIf ... my man touches me, I cannot say no because I need to satisfy him,\u201d Phay said. \u201cBut if I have no medicine, I will get pregnant.\u201d",
      "Her 9-year-old daughter, also named Promise, is living in the capital, Monrovia, with her aunt. Phay wants her to finish school and have a different life from hers.",
      "\u201cI am begging, if you people have the medicine, you people need to help us,\" she said. \u201cI don't want her to suffer like me.\"",

The fund would hold 5% in the cryptocurrency developed by the company Ripple and 2% in the crypto created by the exchange Crypto.com, which will act as the ETF\u2019s digital custodian.",

      "St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital\u2019s fundraising organization, ALSAC, promoted Ike Anand Tuesday to become its new president and chief executive officer.",
      "The leadership change comes as ALSAC -- which raised more than $2.5 billion for the Memphis-based hospital in 2024, according to tax filings \u2013 navigates a global expansion and an increasingly complicated funding landscape in the United States.",
      "\u201cMy role is to make sure that ALSAC is able to deliver on its promises to St. Jude so that St. Jude can continue to dream big,\u201d said Anand, who had been ALSAC\u2019s chief operating officer since 2020. \u201cAnd ALSAC has a lot of initiatives in the pipeline to make sure that that happens.\u201d",
      "Dr. Frederick M.

However, Anand says that St. Jude and ALSAC see it as their mission to care for all 400,000 children around the world diagnosed with cancer, so the changes do not really change their focus.",

      "GENEVA -- Switzerland's medical products authority has granted the first approval for a malaria medicine designed for small infants, touted as an advance against a disease that takes hundreds of thousands of lives \u2014 nearly all in Africa \u2014 each year.",
      "Swissmedic gave a green light Tuesday for the medicine from Basel-based pharmaceutical company Novartis for treatment of babies with body weights between 2 and 5 kilograms (nearly 4\u00bd to 11 pounds), which could pave the way for hard-hit African nations to follow suit in coming months.",
      "The agency said that the decision is significant in part because it's only the third time it has approved a treatment under a fast-track authorization process, in coordination with the World Health Organization, to help developing countries access needed treatment.",
      "The newly approved medication, Coartem Baby, is a combination of two antivirals. It is a lower dose version of a tablet previously approved for other age groups, including older children.",
      "Dr. Quique Bassat, a malaria expert not affiliated with the Swiss review, said the burden of malaria in very young children is \u201crelatively low\u201d compared to older kids.",
      "But access to such medicines is important to all, he said.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that any child of whichever age \u2014 and particularly very, very young ones or very light-weighted ones \u2014 require a treatment,\u201d said Bassat, the director- general of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, known as ISGlobal.",
      "Up to now, antimalarial drugs designed for older children have been administered to small infants in careful ways to avoid overdose or toxicity, in what Bassat called a \u201csuboptimal solution\u201d that the newly designed medicine could help rectify.",
      "\u201cThis is a drug which we know is safe, we know works well, and therefore it will just be available as a new version for a specific age group,\u201d he said.",
      "Ruairidh Villar, a Novartis spokesperson, said that eight African countries took part in the assessment and are expected to approve the medicine within 90 days. The company said that it's planning on a rollout on a \u201clargely not-for-profit basis\u201d in countries where malaria is endemic.",
      "Dr. Bhargavi Rao, co-director of the Malaria Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, noted that malaria cases continue to rise \u2014 especially in crisis-hit countries \u2014 despite new vaccines and programs targeting the mosquitoes that spread the parasite.",
      "She said access strategies for the new medicine must include a look at where needs are greatest, and urged clarity on pricing.",
      "\u201cWe need transparency around what Novartis\u2019 \u2018largely not for profit\u2019 statement means including publicly available pricing, which countries will benefit and how long for,\u201d she wrote in an email.",
      "Still, she said it was \u201csignificant to finally have a suitable and safe treatment for very young children \u2014 more than 20 years since WHO first pre-qualified Coartem for older age groups.",
      "She noted the announcement comes as resistance to antimalarials has been growing and many traditional donor countries have been sharply cutting outlays for global health \u2014 including for malaria programming and research.",
      "The mosquito-borne illness is the deadliest disease in Africa, whose 1.5 billion people accounted for 95% of an estimated 597,000 malaria deaths worldwide in 2023, according to WHO. More than three-quarters of those deaths were among children.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Foreign tourists are trickling back to China after the country loosened its visa policy to unprecedented levels. Citizens from 74 countries can now enter China for up to 30 days without a visa, a big jump from previous regulations.",
      "The government has been steadily expanding visa-free entry in a bid to boost tourism, the economy and its soft power. More than 20 million foreign visitors entered without a visa in 2024 \u2014 almost one-third of the total and more than double from the previous year, according to the National Immigration Administration.",
      "\u201cThis really helps people to travel because it is such a hassle to apply for a visa and go through the process,\u201d Georgi Shavadze, a Georgian living in Austria, said on a recent visit to the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.",

      "In December 2023, China announced visa-free entry for citizens of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia. Almost all of Europe has been added since then. Travelers from five Latin American countries and Uzbekistan became eligible last month, followed by four in the Middle East. The total will grow to 75 on July 16 with the addition of Azerbaijan.",
      "About two-thirds of the countries have been granted visa-free entry on a one-year trial basis.",
      "For Norwegian traveler \u00d8ystein Sporsheim, this means his family would no longer need to make two round-trip visits to the Chinese embassy in Oslo to apply for a tourist visa, a time-consuming and costly process with two children in tow. \u201cThey don\u2019t very often open, so it was much harder\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe new visa policies are 100% beneficial to us,\u201d said Jenny Zhao, a managing director of WildChina, which specializes in boutique and luxury routes for international travelers. She said business is up 50% compared with before the pandemic.",

      "Trip.com Group, a Shanghai-based online travel agency, said the visa-free policy has significantly boosted tourism. Air, hotel and other bookings on their website for travel to China doubled in the first three months of this year compared with the same period last year, with 75% of the visitors from visa-free regions.",
      "No major African country is eligible for visa-free entry, despite the continent\u2019s relatively close ties with China.",
      "Those from 10 countries not in the visa-free scheme have another option: entering China for up to 10 days if they depart for a different country than the one they came from. The policy is limited to 60 ports of entry, according to the country's National Immigration Administration.",
      "The transit policy applies to 55 countries, but most are also on the 30-day visa-free entry list. It does offer a more restrictive option for citizens of the 10 countries that aren't: the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Sweden, Russia, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Indonesia, Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.",
      "Aside from the U.K., Sweden is the only other high-income European country that didn\u2019t make the 30-day list. Ties with China have frayed since the ruling Chinese Communist Party sentenced a Swedish book seller, Gui Minhai, to prison for 10 years in 2020. Gui disappeared in 2015 from his seaside home in Thailand but turned up months later in police custody in mainland China.",

In 2019, the consortium discovered the Glaucus-1 well inside the same Block 10 where the Pegasus-1 well is located. Cypriot authorities say Glaucus-1 is estimated to contain 3.7 trillion cubic feet of gas.",
      "Overall, Pegasus-1 is the sixth natural gas deposit to be discovered inside Cyprus\u2019 economic zone in the last 14 years. Other deposits include the Zeus, Cronos and Calypso wells, which lie inside Block 6 that is operated by a consortium made up of Italy\u2019s Eni and Total of France. Cronos is estimated to hold 3.1 trillion cubic feet of gas and Zeus 2.5 trillion cubic feet. Calypso is still being evaluated.",
      "The Eni-Total consortium holds exploration licenses for four blocks.",
      "The earliest field to be discovered, Aphrodite, is estimated to hold 5.6 trillion cubic feet of gas. The field is inside Block 12, which is operated by a consortium made up of Chevron, NewMed Energy and Shell.",
      "Agreements with Egypt foresee gas from the Cronos and Aphrodite fields to be sent to Egypt via a pipeline for either domestic use or to be processed at Egyptian facilities for export to Europe and other markets.",
      "Cyprus\u2019 Energy Minister George Panastasiou also said that ExxonMobil, Eni and Total could partner up to jointly develop their gas deposits found in close proximity to each other.",

      "They\u2019ve remained sluggish so far this year, as many prospective homebuyers have been discouraged by elevated mortgage rates and home prices that have kept climbing, though more slowly.",
      "As home sales have slowed, properties are taking longer to sell. That's led to a sharply higher inventory of homes on the market, benefitting investors and other home shoppers who can afford to bypass current mortgage rates by paying in cash or tapping home equity gains.",
      "\u201cAs traditional buyers struggle with affordability, investors with cash and financing advantages are stepping in to maintain transaction volume,\u201d according to the report.",
      "BatchData analyzes U.S. home sales records to determine which properties were purchased by investors. These could include vacation homes or rentals, but not a homebuyer\u2019s primary residence.",
      "Investors bought 1.2 million homes in 2024, up from an average of 1.1 million homes a year going back to 2020, according to BatchData.",
      "Even so, investor-owned homes account for roughly 20% of the nation's 86 million single-family homes, the firm said.",
      "Of those, mom-and-pop investors, or those who own between 1 and 5 homes, account for 85% of all investor-owned residential properties, while those with between 6 and 10 properties account for another 5%.",
      "Institutional investors that own 1,000 or more homes account for only about 2.2% of all investor-owned homes, the firm said.",
      "And that number could get smaller, amid signs that large institutional investors are scaling back home purchases.",
      "Out of a group of eight of the biggest companies that own and lease single-family houses, including Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent, six sold more homes in the second quarter than they bought, according to data from Parcl Labs.",

      "Haiti\u2019s once illustrious Grand H\u00f4tel Oloffson has been burned down by gangs this past weekend",
      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- Haiti\u2019s once illustrious Grand H\u00f4tel Oloffson, a beloved Gothic gingerbread home that inspired books, hosted parties until dawn and attracted visitors from Mick Jagger to Haitian presidents, was burned down by gangs this past weekend.",
      "Hundreds of Haitians and foreigners mourned the news as it spread across social media, with the hotel manager on Monday confirming the fire on X in a brief comment. Even though gang violence had forced the hotel in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, to close in recent years, many had hoped it would reopen.",
      "\u201cIt birthed so much culture and expression,\u201d said Riva Pr\u00e9cil, a Haitian-American singer who grew up in the hotel from age 5 to 15.",
      "In a tearful phone interview, Pr\u00e9cil recalled how she learned to swim, dance and sing at the Oloffson.",
      "The attack on the community where the hotel was located began late Saturday, according to James Jean-Louis, who lives above the Oloffson. He told The Associated Press in a phone interview Sunday that he observed the flames as he and other residents were chased out while police and gangs exchanged heavy gunfire.",
      "Among those lamenting the fire was Michael Deibert, author of \u201cNotes From the Last Testament: The Struggle for Haiti,\u201d and \u201cHaiti Will Not Perish: A Recent History.\u201d",
      "He landed in Miami on Sunday only to open his phone and see a flurry of messages from friends in Haiti.",
      "\u201cWhen you went to the Oloffson, you really felt you were being connected with Haiti\u2019s political and cultural history,\u201d he said. \u201cYou went to Haiti and were never the same. And the Oloffson really captured that.\u201d",
      "The hotel attracted artists, intellectuals and politicians from Haiti and beyond, including Jacqueline Onassis and Tennessee Williams. It also survived coups, dictatorships and the devastating 2010 earthquake.",
      "Isabelle Morse, daughter of Richard Morse, who became the hotel's manager several decades ago, said he loved having writers, photographers and other artists at the Oloffson.",
      "\u201cHis sense of community was very important to him,\u201d she said in a phone interview Monday, describing the hotel as \u201chis whole life.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor him, it represented freedom, where people from all walks of life could come in and share that space,\" she said.",
      "Richard Morse did not return a message seeking comment. The renowned band he founded, RAM, posted on X early Monday that the hotel had \u201cburned to the ground.\u201d",
      "His daughter said her parents had hoped to reopen the Oloffson.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not only a business, it\u2019s our home. We were raised there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was more about moving back home rather than reopening the business.\u201d",
      "The Oloffson served as a presidential summer palace in the early 1900s and then became a U.S. Marine Corps Hospital before a Swedish sea captain converted it into a hotel in the 1930s.",
      "It also served as inspiration for the fictional Hotel Trianon in Graham Greene\u2019s 1966 novel \u201cThe Comedians,\u201d set in Haiti under the brutal dictatorship of Francois Duvalier, best known as \u201cPapa Doc.\u201d",
      "In real life, tourism dwindled under the Duvaliers, and the hotel became a respite for aid workers and foreign correspondents.",
      "In the late 1980s, Richard Morse became the hotel\u2019s manager. His band, RAM, played Haitian roots music on Thursday nights that became legendary, as were the Day of the Dead celebrations known as F\u00e8t Gede that drew in Vodou practitioners.",
      "\u201cIt was a vessel for so many people to gather and freely express themselves,\u201d Pr\u00e9cil recalled. \u201cRAM really created that culture and that environment, made it a space that welcomed people from all types of denominations and sexual preferences.\u201d",
      "The Oloffson was nestled in the upscale community of Pacot in the southeast corner of the Port-au-Prince capital. It was surrounded by lush gardens and often described as a mythical place, renowned for its intricate latticework, turrets and spires and creaking parquet floors that characterize Haiti's endangered gingerbread homes.",
      "A 1940s advertisement by Haiti\u2019s tourism department said that the hotel was situated \u201cin the coolest section of the town\u201d and noted that English, French, German and Spanish were spoken there.",
      "The hotel closed in recent years as gangs began raiding and seizing control of once peaceful communities.",
      "\u201cA lot of Haiti\u2019s architectural heritage is going up in flames right now with so-called leaders stand by with their hands in their pockets,\u201d Deibert said. \u201dThe destruction of the Oloffson is symbolic of the destruction of Haiti\u2019s history and culture that we\u2019ve been watching over the last several years.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Monday set a 25% tax on goods imported from Japan and South Korea, as well as new tariff rates on a dozen other countries",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Monday set a 25% tax on goods imported from Japan and South Korea, as well as new tariff rates on a dozen other nations that would go into effect on Aug. 1.",
      "Trump provided notice by posting letters on Truth Social that were addressed to the leaders of the various countries. The letters warned them to not retaliate by increasing their own import taxes, or else the Trump administration would further increase tariffs.",
      "\u201cIf for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 25% that we charge,\u201d Trump wrote in the letters to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung.",
      "The letters were not the final word from Trump on tariffs, so much as another episode in a global economic drama in which he has placed himself at the center. His moves have raised fears that economic growth would slow to a trickle, if not make the U.S. and other nations more vulnerable to a recession. But Trump is confident that tariffs are necessary to bring back domestic manufacturing and fund the tax cuts he signed into law last Friday.",
      "He mixed his sense of aggression with a willingness to still negotiate, signaling the likelihood that the drama and uncertainty would continue and that few things are ever final with Trump.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all done,\" Trump told reporters Monday. \u201cI told you we\u2019ll make some deals, but for the most part we\u2019re going to send a letter.\u201d",
      "South Korea\u2019s Trade Ministry said early Tuesday that it will accelerate negotiations with the United States to achieve a mutually beneficial deal before the 25% tax on its exports goes into effect.",
      "Imports from Myanmar and Laos would be taxed at 40%, Cambodia and Thailand at 36%, Serbia and Bangladesh at 35%, Indonesia at 32%, South Africa and Bosnia and Herzegovina at 30% and Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Tunisia at 25%.",
      "Trump placed the word \u201conly\u201d before revealing the rate in his letters to the foreign leaders, implying that he was being generous with his tariffs. But the letters generally followed a standard format, so much so that the one to Bosnia and Herzegovina initially addressed its woman leader, \u017deljka Cvijanovi\u0107, as \u201cMr. President.\u201d Trump later posted a corrected letter.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump, by setting the rates himself, was creating \u201ctailor-made trade plans for each and every country on this planet and that\u2019s what this administration continues to be focused on.\u201d",
      "Following a now well-worn pattern, Trump plans to continue sharing the letters sent to his counterparts on social media and then mailing them the documents, a stark departure from the more formal practices of all his predecessors when negotiating trade agreements.",
      "The letters are not agreed-to settlements but Trump's own choice on rates, a sign that the closed-door talks with foreign delegations failed to produce satisfactory results for either side.",
      "Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute who formerly worked in the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, said the tariff hikes on Japan and South Korea were \u201cunfortunate.\u201d",
      "\u201cBoth have been close partners on economic security matters and have a lot to offer the United States on priority matters like shipbuilding, semiconductors, critical minerals and energy cooperation,\u201d Cutler said.",
      "Trump still has outstanding differences on trade with the European Union and India, among other trading partners. Tougher talks with China are on a longer time horizon in which imports from that nation are being taxed at 55%.",
      "The office of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement that the tariff rates announced by Trump mischaracterized the trade relationship with the U.S., but it would \u201ccontinue with its diplomatic efforts towards a more balanced and mutually beneficial trade relationship with the United States\" after having proposed a trade framework on May 20.",
      "The S&P 500 stock index was down 0.8% in Monday trading, while the interest charged on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes increased to nearly 4.39%, a figure that could translate into elevated rates for mortgages and auto loans.",
      "Trump has declared an economic emergency to unilaterally impose the taxes, suggesting they are remedies for past trade deficits even though many U.S. consumers have come to value autos, electronics and other goods from Japan and South Korea. The constitution grants Congress the power to levy tariffs under normal circumstances, though tariffs can also result from executive branch investigations regarding national security risks.",
      "Trump's ability to impose tariffs through an economic emergency is under legal challenge, with the administration appealing a May ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade that said the president exceeded his authority.",
      "It's unclear what he gains strategically against China \u2014 another stated reason for the tariffs \u2014 by challenging two crucial partners in Asia, Japan and South Korea, that could counter China's economic heft.",
      "\u201cThese tariffs may be modified, upward or downward, depending on our relationship with your Country,\u201d Trump wrote in both letters.",
      "Because the new tariff rates go into effect in roughly three weeks, Trump is setting up a period of possibly tempestuous talks among the U.S. and its trade partners to reach new frameworks.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see a huge escalation or a walk back \u2014 it\u2019s just more of the same,\" said Scott Lincicome, a vice president at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank",
      "Trump initially roiled the financial markets by announcing tariff rates on dozens of countries, including 24% on Japan and 25% on South Korea. In order to calm the markets, Trump unveiled a 90-day negotiating period during which goods from most countries were taxed at a baseline 10%. So far, the rates in the letters sent by Trump either match his April 2 tariffs or are generally close to them.",
      "The 90-day negotiating period technically ends Wednesday, even as multiple administration officials suggested the three-week period before implementation is akin to overtime for additional talks that could change the rates. Trump signed an executive order Monday to delay the official tariff increases until Aug. 1.",
      "Congressionally approved trade agreements historically have sometimes taken years to negotiate because of the complexity.",
      "Administration officials have said Trump is relying on tariff revenues to help offset the tax cuts he signed into law on July 4, a move that could shift a greater share of the federal tax burden onto the middle class and poor as importers would likely pass along much of the cost of the tariffs. Trump has warned major retailers such as Walmart to simply \u201ceat\u201d the higher costs, instead of increasing prices in ways that could intensify inflation.",
      "Josh Lipsky, chair of international economics at The Atlantic Council, said a three-week delay in imposing the tariffs was unlikely sufficient for meaningful talks to take place.",
      "\u201cI take it as a signal that he is serious about most of these tariffs and it\u2019s not all a negotiating posture,\" Lipsky said.",
      "Trump's team promised 90 deals in 90 days, but his negotiations so far have produced only two trade frameworks.",
      "His outline of a deal with Vietnam was clearly designed to box out China from routing its America-bound goods through that country, by doubling the 20% tariff charged on Vietnamese imports on anything traded transnationally.",
      "The quotas in the signed United Kingdom framework would spare that nation from the higher tariff rates being charged on steel, aluminum and autos, though British goods would generally face a 10% tariff.",
      "The United States ran a $69.4 billion trade imbalance in goods with Japan in 2024 and a $66 billion imbalance with South Korea, according to the Census Bureau. The trade deficits are the differences between what the U.S. exports to a country relative to what it imports.",
      "According to Trump's letters, autos would be tariffed separately at the standard 25% worldwide, while steel and aluminum imports would be taxed on 50%.",
      "This is not the first time Trump has tangled with Japan and South Korea on trade \u2014 and the new tariffs suggest his past deals made during his first term failed to deliver on his administration's own hype.",
      "In 2018, during Trump's first term, his administration celebrated a revamped trade agreement with South Korea as a major win. And in 2019, Trump signed a limited agreement with Japan on agricultural products and digital trade that at the time he called a \u201chuge victory for America\u2019s farmers, ranchers and growers.\u201d",
      "Trump has also said on social media that countries aligned with the policy goals of BRICS, an organization composed of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, would face additional tariffs of 10%.",

      "The year-long post places Hayden back at the center of the very debates over American culture that surrounded her dismissal. The White House ousted Hayden, the first woman and the first African American to hold the title, after she was accused of promoting \u201cradical\u201d literary material by a conservative advocacy group seeking to squash Trump opposition within the federal government.",
      "Hayden acknowledged existing threats to \u201cthe free exchange of ideas\u201d in a statement to the AP.",
      "\u201cFor generations, libraries, archives, and cultural institutions have been the guardians of knowledge and the catalysts for human progress,\u201d she said. \u201cTogether, we will work to strengthen the public knowledge ecosystem and ensure that the transformative power of information remains accessible to all.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Mellon Foundation has been working to fill fiscal holes for arts communities reeling from federal cuts. Its $15 million \u201cemergency\u201d fund aims to offset the $65 million that were supposed to go to the state humanities councils that organize book fairs, heritage festivals, theater productions and other programs fostering cultural engagement.",
      "The foundation has previously supported the American Library Association's efforts to counter book bans, increase scholarships for librarians of color and boost adult literacy.",
      "Mellon President Elizabeth Alexander said the foundation is thrilled to welcome Hayden, \u201ca leader with an unshakable regard for the public good of the American people,\u201d during such a \u201ccrucial time.\u201d Public knowledge institutions are navigating \u201chistoric challenges and transformative advances,\" according to Mellon, including artificial intelligence, digital technologies, federal funding withdrawals and censorship efforts.",
      "Hayden's tenure at the Library of Congress included modernizing its collection of the nation's books and history. Recent campaigns sought to improve accessibility for everyday visitors. She oversaw new initiatives reaching out to rural and online audiences. And it was Hayden who arranged for Lizzo's 2022 performance where the artist played a crystal flute owned by President James Madison \u2014 among the Library's troves of artifacts.",

      "The arrest of eight Vermont dairy farmers in April sent shock waves throughout New England's agriculture industry, and fears haven't eased since then",
      "MONTPELIER, Vt. -- After six 12-hour shifts milking cows, Jos\u00e9 Molina-Aguilar's lone day off was hardly relaxing.",
      "On April 21, he and seven co-workers were arrested on a Vermont dairy farm in what advocates say was one of the state\u2019s largest-ever immigration raids.",
      "\u201cI saw through the window of the house that immigration were already there, inside the farm, and that\u2019s when they detained us,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cI was in the process of asylum, and even with that, they didn\u2019t respect the document that I was still holding in my hands.\u201d",
      "Four of the workers were swiftly deported to Mexico. Molina-Aguilar, released after a month in a Texas detention center with his asylum case still pending, is now working at a different farm and speaking out.",
      "\u201cWe must fight as a community so that we can all have, and keep fighting for, the rights that we have in this country,\u201d he said.",
      "Ryan Brissette, spokesman for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said agents initially responded to a report from a concerned citizen who saw two people carrying backpacks entering private farm property near the Canadian border. Agents apprehended one person at the scene and more during the ensuing search of the area, he said.",
      "The owner of the farm declined to comment. But Brett Stokes, a lawyer representing the detained workers, said the raid sent shock waves through the entire Northeast agriculture industry.",
      "\u201cThese strong-arm tactics that we\u2019re seeing and these increases in enforcement, whether legal or not, all play a role in stoking fear in the community,\u201d said Stokes, director of the Center for Justice Reform Clinic at Vermont Law and Graduate School.",
      "That fear remains given the mixed messages coming from the White House. President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the U.S. illegally, last month paused arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels. But less than a week later, Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said worksite enforcement would continue.",
      "Asked for updated comment Monday, the department repeated McLaughlin's earlier statement.",
      "\u201cWorksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability,\u201d she said.",
      "Such uncertainty is causing problems in big states like California, where farms produce more than three-quarters of the country\u2019s fruit and more than a third of its vegetables. But it\u2019s also affecting small states like Vermont, where dairy is as much a part of the state\u2019s identity as its famous maple syrup.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of all milk production in New England comes from Vermont, where more than half the state\u2019s farmland is dedicated to dairy and dairy crops. There are roughly 113,000 cows and 7,500 goats spread across 480 farms, according to the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, which pegs the industry\u2019s annual economic impact at $5.4 billion.",
      "That impact has more than doubled in the last decade, with widespread help from immigrant labor. More than 90% of the farms surveyed for the agency\u2019s recent report employed migrant workers.",
      "Among them is Wuendy Bernardo, who has lived on a Vermont dairy farm for more than a decade and has an active application to stop her deportation on humanitarian grounds: Bernardo is the primary caregiver for her five children and her two orphaned younger sisters, according to a 2023 letter signed by dozens of state lawmakers.",
      "Hundreds of Bernardo's supporters showed up for her most recent check-in with immigration officials.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Asian shares mostly fell Monday as the Trump administration stepped up pressure on trading partners to quickly make new deals before a Wednesday tariff deadline, with plans for the United States to start sending letters warning countries that higher tariffs could kick in Aug. 1.",
      "Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 shed 0.6% to 39,577.66 while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index edged down 0.2% to 23,874.18.",

      "Oil prices also fell after OPEC+ agreed on Saturday to raise production in August by 548,000 barrels per day, accelerating output increases since oil prices jumped, then retreated, in the aftermath of Israel and U.S. attacks on Iran.",
      "U.S. benchmark crude was down 73 cents to $66.27 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, shed 78 cents to $68.02 per barrel.",

      "It said the near-term outlook will likely hinge on several key factors like the extent to which trading partners are included in Trump letters, the rate of tariffs, and the effective date of such tariffs. A more distant implementation date might leave scope for some last-minute trade negotiations and maintain market optimism for potential resolutions or extensions, it added.",
      "\u201cWith the July 9 tariff deadline fast approaching, all eyes are trained on Washington, scanning for signs of escalation or retreat. The path forward isn\u2019t clear, but the terrain is littered with risk,\" Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.",

      "In other dealings Monday, the U.S. dollar rose to 145.01 Japanese yen from 144.44 yen. The euro edged lower to $1.1771 from $1.1779.",

      "South Africa\u2019s first Black female beer brewery owner is aiming to shake up the industry",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- After pouring brown, gritty liquid from a huge silver tank into a flute-like container known as a refractometer, South African beer brewing master Apiwe Nxusani-Mawela gives an expert nod of approval and passes it around to her students, who yell their observations with glee.",
      "\u201cWhen you are brewing you must constantly check your mixture,\u201d Nxusani-Mawela instructs them. \u201cWe are looking for a balance between the sugar and the grains.\u201d",
      "The 41-year-old Nxusani-Mawela is an international beer judge and taster, and is believed to be the first Black woman in South Africa to own a craft brewery, a breakthrough in a world largely dominated by men and big corporations. Her desire is to open South Africa's multibillion-dollar beer-brewing industry to more Black people and more women.",
      "At her microbrewery in Johannesburg, she's teaching 13 young Black graduates \u2014 most of them women \u2014 the art of beer making.",
      "The students at the Brewsters Academy have chemical engineering, biotechnology or analytical chemistry degrees and diplomas, but are eager to get themselves an extra qualification for a possible career in brewing.",
      "Wearing hairnets and armed with barley grains and water, the scientists spend the next six hours on the day's lesson, learning how to malt, mill, mash, lauter, boil, ferment and filter to make the perfect pale ale.",
      "\u201cMy favorite part is the mashing,\" said Lerato Banda, a 30-year-old chemical engineering student at the University of South Africa who has dreams of owning her own beer or beverage line. She's referring to the process of mixing crushed grains with hot water to release sugars, which will later ferment. \"It\u2019s where the beer and everything starts.\u201d",
      "Nxusani-Mawela's classes began in early June. Students will spend six months exploring beer varieties, both international and African, before another six months on work placement.",
      "Nxusani-Mawela's Tolokazi brewery is in the Johannesburg suburb of Wynberg, wedged between the poor Black township of Alexandra on one side and the glitzy financial district of Sandton \u2014 known as Africa's richest square mile \u2014 on the other.",
      "She hails from the rural town of Butterworth, some 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) away, and first came across the idea of a career in beer at a university open day in Johannesburg. She started brewing as an amateur in 2007. She has a microbiology degree and sees beer making as a good option for those with a science background.",
      "\u201cI sort of fell in love with the combination of the business side with the science, with the craftsmanship and the artistic element of brewing,\u201d she said.",
      "For the mother of two boys, beer brewing is also ripe for a shakeup.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make sure that being the first Black female to own a brewery in South Africa, that I\u2019m not the first and the last,\u201d she said. \u201cBrewsters Academy for me is about transforming the industry ... What I want to see is that in five, 10 years from now that it should be a norm to have Black people in the industry, it should be a norm to have females in the industry.\"",
      "South Africa's beer industry supports more than 200,000 jobs and contributes $5.2 billion to South Africa\u2019s gross domestic product, according to the most current Oxford Economics research in \u201cBeer\u2019s Global Economic Footprint.\u201d While South Africa's brewing sector remains male-dominated, like most places, efforts are underway to include more women.",
      "One young woman at the classes, 24-year-old Lehlohonolo Makhethe, noted women were historically responsible for brewing beer in some African cultures, and she sees learning the skill as reclaiming a traditional role.",
      "\"How it got male dominated, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Makhethe said. \u201cI\u2019d rather say we are going back to our roots as women to doing what we started.\u201d",
      "While Nxusani-Mawela teaches all kinds of styles, she also is on a mission to keep alive traditional African beer for the next generation. Her Wild African Soul beer, a collaboration with craft beer company Soul Barrel Brewing, was the 2025 African Beer Cup champion. It's a blend of African Umqombothi beer \u2014 a creamy brew incorporating maize and sorghum malt \u2014 with a fruity, fizzy Belgian Saison beer.",
      "\u201cUmqombothi is our African way, and everybody should know how to make it, but we don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe that the beer styles that we make need to reflect having an element of our past being brought into the future.\u201d",
      "She's used all sorts of uniquely African flavors in her Tolokazi line, including the marula fruit and the rooibos bush that's native to South Africa and better-known for being used in a popular caffeine-free tea.",
      "\u201cWho could have thought of rooibos beer?\u201d said Lethabo Seipei Kekae after trying the beer for the first time at a beer festival. \u201cIt\u2019s so smooth. Even if you are not a beer drinker, you can drink it.\u201d",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Crew members abroad a ship set ablaze by a series of attacks in the Red Sea abandoned the vessel Sunday night as it took on water, marking the first serious assault in the vital corridor for trade after a monthslong campaign by Yemen's Houthi rebels there.",
      "Suspicion for the attack immediately fell on the Houthis, particularly as a security firm said it appeared bomb-carrying drone boats hit the ship after it was targeted by small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. The rebels' media reported on the attack but did not claim it. It can take them hours or even days before they acknowledge an assault.",
      "A renewed Houthi campaign against shipping could again draw in U.S. and Western forces to the area, particularly after President Donald Trump targeted the rebels in a major airstrike campaign.",
      "And it comes at a sensitive moment in the Middle East, as a possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war hangs in the balance and as Iran weighs whether to restart negotiations over its nuclear program following American airstrikes targeting its most-sensitive atomic sites amid an Israeli war against the Islamic Republic.",
      "\u201cIt likely serves as a message that the Houthis continue to possess the capability and willingness to strike at strategic maritime targets regardless of diplomatic developments,\u201d wrote Mohammad al-Basha, a Yemen analyst at the Basha Report risk advisory firm.",
      "The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center first said that an armed security team on the unidentified vessel had returned fire against an initial attack and that the \u201csituation is ongoing.\u201d It described the attack as happening some 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Hodeida, Yemen, which is held by the country's Houthi rebels.",
      "\u201cAuthorities are investigating,\u201d it said. It later said the ship was on fire after being \u201cstruck by unknown projectiles.\"",
      "Ambrey, a private maritime security firm, issued an alert saying that a merchant ship had been \u201cattacked by eight skiffs while transiting northbound in the Red Sea.\u201d",
      "Ambrey later said the ship also had been attacked by bomb-carrying drone boats, which could mark a major escalation. It said two drone boats struck the ship, while another two had been destroyed by the armed guards on board.",
      "The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said the ship was taking on water and its crew had abandoned the vessel.",
      "The U.S. Navy's Mideast-based 5th Fleet referred questions to the military's Central Command, which said it was aware of the incident without elaborating.",
      "Authorities did not identify the vessel for hours. However, the description of the vessel targeted matched against the Liberian-flagged bulk tanker Magic Seas, which had been broadcasting it had an armed security team on board in the vicinity the attack took place and had been heading north. EOS Risk Group, another maritime security firm, identified the targeted vessel as being a Liberian-flagged ship as well.",
      "The Magic Seas' owners did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Houthi rebels have been launching missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group\u2019s leadership has described as an effort to end Israel\u2019s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The group's al-Masirah satellite news channel acknowledged the attack occurred, but offered no other comment on it as it aired a speech by its secretive leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi. However, Ambrey said the vessel targeted met \u201cthe established Houthi target profile,\" without elaborating.",
      "Between November 2023 and January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.",
      "The Houthis paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. That ended weeks later and the Houthis haven't attacked a vessel, though they have continued occasional missile attacks targeting Israel. On Sunday, the group claimed launching a missile at Israel which the Israeli military said it intercepted. Shipping through the Red Sea, while still lower than normal, has increased in recent weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, a wider, decadelong war in Yemen between the Houthis and the country\u2019s exiled government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, remains in a stalemate. The Yemeni Coast Guard, which is loyal to the exiled government, has engaged in a firefight with at least one vessel in the Red Sea in the past as well.",
      "Pirates from Somalia also have operated in the region, though typically they've sought to capture vessels either to rob or ransom their crews. But neither the Yemeni Coast Guard nor the pirates have been known to use drone boats in their attacks.",

      "America\u2019s largest trade partner is awaiting word on whether U.S. President Donald Trump will impose punishing tariffs on its goods",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) \u2014 America\u2019s largest trade partner, the European Union, is among the entities awaiting word Monday on whether U.S. President Donald Trump will impose punishing tariffs on their goods, a move economists have warned would have repercussions for companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "Trump imposed a 20% import tax on all EU-made products in early April as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the United States has a trade imbalance. Hours after the nation-specific duties took effect, he put them on hold until July 9 at a standard rate of 10% to quiet financial markets and allow time for negotiations.",
      "Expressing displeasure the EU's stance in trade talks, however, the president said he would jack up the tariff rate for European exports to 50%. A rate that high could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals much more expensive in the U.S.",
      "The EU, whose 27 member nations operate as a single economic bloc, said its leaders hoped to strike a deal with the Trump administration. Without one, the EU said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes.",
      "Here are important things to know about trade between the United States and the European Union.",
      "A lot of money is at stake in the trade talks.",
      "The EU's executive commission describes the trade between the U.S. and the EU as \"the most important commercial relationship in the world.\u201d The value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.",
      "The biggest U.S. export to Europe is crude oil, followed by pharmaceuticals, aircraft, automobiles, and medical and diagnostic equipment. Europe's biggest exports to the U.S. are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits.",
      "Trump has complained about the EU's 198 billion-euro ($233 billion) trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more stuff from European businesses than the other way around. However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services.",
      "The U.S. services surplus took the nation's trade deficit with the EU down to 50 billion euros ($59 billion), which represents less than 3% of overall U.S.-EU trade.",
      "Before Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained a generally cooperative trade relationship and low tariff levels on both sides. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU's averaged 1.35% for American products.",
      "But the White House has taken a much less friendly posture toward the longstanding U.S. ally since February. Along with the fluctuating tariff rate on European goods Trump has floated, the EU has been subject to his administration's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 25% tax on imported automobiles and parts.",
      "Trump administration officials have raised a slew of issues they want to see addressed, including agricultural barriers such as EU health regulations that include bans on chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef.",
      "Trump has also criticized Europe's value-added taxes, which EU countries levy at the point of sale this year at rates of 17% to 27%. But many economists see VAT as trade-neutral since they apply to domestic goods and services as well as imported ones. Because national governments set the taxes through legislation, the EU has said they aren't on the table during trade negotiations.",
      "\u201cOn the thorny issues of regulations, consumer standards and taxes, the EU and its member states cannot give much ground,\u201d Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Germany's Berenberg bank, said. \u201cThey cannot change the way they run the EU\u2019s vast internal market according to U.S. demands, which are often rooted in a faulty understanding of how the EU works.\u201d",
      "Economists and companies say higher tariffs will mean higher prices for U.S. consumers on imported goods. Importers must decide how much of the extra tax costs to absorb through lower profits and how much to pass on to customers.",
      "Mercedes-Benz dealers in the US. have said they are holding the line on 2025 model year prices \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d The German automaker has a partial tariff shield because it makes 35% of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the U.S. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but the company said it expects prices to undergo \u201csignificant increases\u201d in coming years.",
      "Simon Hunt, CEO of Italian wine and spirits producer Campari Group, told investment analysts that prices could increase for some products or stay the same depending what rival companies do. If competitors raise prices, the company might decide to hold its prices on Skyy vodka or Aperol aperitif to gain market share, Hunt said.",
      "Trump has argued that making it more difficult for foreign companies to sell in the U.S. is a way to stimulate a revival of American manufacturing. Many companies have dismissed the idea or said it would take years to yield positive economic benefits. However, some corporations have proved willing to shift some production stateside.",
      "France-based luxury group LVMH, whose brands include Tiffany & Co., Luis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon, could move some production to the United States, billionaire CEO Bernaud Arnault said at the company\u2019s annual meeting in April.",
      "Arnault, who attended Trump's inauguration, has urged Europe to reach a deal based on reciprocal concessions.",
      "\u201cIf we end up with high tariffs, ... we will be forced to increase our U.S.-based production to avoid tariffs,\u201d Arnault said. \u201cAnd if Europe fails to negotiate intelligently, that will be the consequence for many companies. ... It will be the fault of Brussels, if it comes to that.\u201d",
      "Some forecasts indicate the U.S. economy would be more at risk if the negotiations fail. Without a deal, the EU would lose 0.3% of its gross domestic product and U.S. GDP would fall 0.7%, if Trump slaps imported goods from Europe with tariffs of 10% to 25%, according to a research review by Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels.",
      "Given the complexity of some of the issues, the two sides may arrive only at a framework deal before Wednesday\u2019s deadline. That would likely leave a 10% base tariff, as well as the auto, steel and aluminum tariffs in place until details of a formal trade agreement are ironed out.",
      "The most likely outcome of the trade talks is that \u201cthe U.S. will agree to deals in which it takes back its worst threats of \u2018retaliatory\u2019 tariffs well beyond 10%,\u201d Schmieding said. \u201cHowever, the road to get there could be rocky.\u201d",
      "The U.S. offering exemptions for some goods might smooth the path to a deal. The EU could offer to ease some regulations that the White House views as trade barriers.",
      "\u201cWhile Trump might be able to sell such an outcome as a \u2018win\u2019 for him, the ultimate victims of his protectionism would, of course, be mostly the U.S. consumers,\u201d Schmieding said.",

      "BEIJING -- China on Friday imposed anti-dumping duties on European brandy, most notably cognac produced in France, as trade tensions between Beijing and United States allies continue to rise.",
      "The tariffs, effective on Saturday, will range from 27.7% to 34.9%, China's Commerce Ministry said. They are to be in place for five years and will not be applied retroactively.",
      "The announcement came during a European visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi aimed at ironing out trade differences. Wang was set to visit Paris after stops in Brussels and Berlin.",
      "The anti-dumping duties are the result of a probe China launched last year into European cognac, after the European Union undertook a probe into Chinese electric vehicles subsidies.",
      "\u201cThe investigative authority finally ruled that the dumping of related imported brandy from the EU has existed,\u201d read a statement by China\u2019s Commerce Ministry. \u201cThe domestic brandy industry faces a material threat of damage, and there is a causal relationship between the dumping and the substantial damage threat.\u201d",
      "Besides cognac, China has also launched investigations into European pork and dairy products. The brandy probe was the first and targeted mainly French makers of cognac and similar spirits such as Armagnac.",
      "China initially announced provisional tariffs of 30.6% to 39% on French cognac producer Remy Martin and other European brandies after a majority of E.U. countries approved duties on electric vehicles made in China.",
      "Wang was set to meet his French counterpart, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, later Friday in Paris.",
      "His European tour comes ahead of a China-EU summit to be focused on trade later this month in Beijing.",

      "Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark is doubling down on his preference for staying with only five automatic qualifiers if the College Football Playoff does expand to 16 teams as many expect after this season",
      "FRISCO, Texas -- Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark is doubling down on his preference to stay with only five automatic qualifiers if the College Football Playoff does expand from 12 to 16 teams as many expect after this season, instead of each of the four power conferences being guaranteed multiple bids.",
      "\u201cWe have the responsibility to do what\u2019s right for college football ... not what's right for one or two or more conferences,\u201d Yormark said Tuesday at Big 12 football media days. \u201cI think 5-11 is fair. Earn it on the field, assuming we want to expand. I love the current format, but if we\u2019re going to expand, let\u2019s do it in a way that\u2019s fair and equitable and gives everyone a chance.\u201d",
      "While the Southeastern Conference and Big Ten will have more of a say on the playoff format starting in 2026, when ESPN's $7.8 billion contract kicks in, Yormark believes the 5-11 format would be good for now and in the future. He said ACC Commissioner Jim Phillips feels the same way, and is expected to express that during his league's media days in two weeks.",
      "\u201cWe do not need a professional model because we are not the NFL,\u201d Yormark said. \"We are college football and we must act like it.\"",
      "In the 12-team format still in place for this season, the five highest-ranked conference champions are guaranteed spots in the playoff. The difference this year is that the top four highest-ranked champions are no longer guaranteed the top four seeds that come with first-round byes.",
      "Among potential 16-team formats would be four automatic qualifiers from both the SEC and Big Ten, and two each for the Big 12 and ACC. The Big 12 last season had only conference champion Arizona State make the playoff last season.",
      "\u201cWe want to earn it on the field,\" Yormark said. \u201cIt might not be the best solution today for the Big 12, given your comments about (automatic qualifiers), but long term, knowing the progress we\u2019re making, the investments we\u2019re making, it\u2019s the right format for us.\u201d",
      "Yormark, who is going into his fourth year as Big 12 commissioner, believes that the landmark NCAA House settlement will have a positive impact for all conferences, especially if the College Sports Commission works the way it is intended in enforcing the rules in the remade system.",
      "\u201cIt will. I have a lot of faith in Bryan Seely,\u201d Yormark said of the former Major League Baseball executive named CEO of the new CSC. \u201cIt should create a level playing field, and I'm not giving that up.\u201d",
      "The Big 12 was already in transition and still at 10 teams when Yormark arrived in 2022. BYU, Cincinnati, Houston and UCF joined the league the following year.",
      "Texas and Oklahoma, who won football national championships while in the Big 12, completed their long-planned move to the SEC last year. That is when Pac-12 schools Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah came into what is now a 16-team Big 12.",
      "\"I think parity matters, and I think ultimately over time, and that\u2019s hopefully sooner than later, there\u2019ll be a couple of our schools that will emerge, you know, as elite schools that are always part of the conversations at the highest levels. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working towards,\u201d Yormark said. \u201cBut it starts with parity and being competitive top to bottom. And I think we\u2019re there.\u201d",

      "But her ability to change the depth, speed, angles and spins of her shots over and over can frustrate any opponent and dull the type of power that Sabalenka brings to the court. And, make no mistake: Sabalenka was frustrated, especially in the final set.",
      "\u201cIt's not like it's an annoying game. It\u2019s a smart game. She\u2019s really making everyone work against her,\u201d Sabalenka said. \u201cYou know you have to work for every point. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a big server, if you're a big hitter. You have to work. You have to run. And you have to earn the win.\u201d",
      "As her mistakes mounted, she would look up at her box with a quizzical expression and raise her hands. After missing one forehand off a short ball, she knelt on the grass near the net.",
      "After getting broken for the sixth time of the afternoon to fall behind 4-3 in the last set, Sabalenka broke right back to open her match-ending run. In the next game, she finally delivered her lone two aces of the match, one at 103 mph, the other at 116 mph.",
      "When Sabalenka produced a volley winner to break again and end things after nearly three hours, she shut her eyes, spread her arms wide and let out a big scream.",
      "Taylor Fritz recovered from a mid-match lull and reached the semifinals at the All England Club for the first time with a 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4) victory over Karen Khachanov. The No. 5-seeded Fritz, an American who was the runner-up at last year's U.S. Open, came in with a 1-4 record in major quarterfinals, 0-2 at Wimbledon. He'll now meet either two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz of Spain or unseeded Cam Norrie of Britain, who were scheduled to play each other later Tuesday.",
      "The last two women's quarterfinals are No. 7 Mirra Andreeva vs. Belinda Bencic, and No. 8 Iga Swiatek vs. No. 19 Liudmila Samsonova. The men's matchups are No. 1 Jannik Sinner vs. No. 10 Ben Shelton, and 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic vs. No. 22 Flavio Cobolli.",

      "There's intrigue whether Clark will draft Fever teammate Aliyah Boston with the No. 1 pick that the guard earned by getting the most fan votes. Or will she take three-time league MVP A'ja Wilson of the Las Vegas Aces. Clark also may try to draft All-Star reserve Kelsey Mitchell, who is another Indiana teammate.",
      "\u201cI think there's a high chance that Kels and AB will be on my team,\u201d Clark said Monday at an open practice for season ticket holders. \u201cI'm going to do everything I can to get those two. I might trade the rest of my team for those two. I'm excited, it will be a lot of fun. That's what the All-Star Game is for, giving the fans something to cheer about.\u201d",
      "Wilson said at practice Monday that she was fine wherever she was drafted. The Aces star has experience having been captain of the game a few times. She went against Breanna Stewart, who is also a starter again this year.",
      "\u201cStewie and I always had fun, that's just us,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe took it seriously, but we also didn't. We just made sure we were happy with our choices. Stewie and I had our unwritten written rules. We had a good time we had an understanding of everything.\"",

      "Byron Buxton has had an All-Star season for the Minnesota Twins highlighted by his consistent presence in the lineup",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- For all the evidence that Byron Buxton has had an All-Star season, the supporting statistics start and end with this simple number: 73.",
      "That's the total of games in which the Minnesota Twins have had their dynamic center fielder in the starting lineup, putting him on pace for the second-most of his 11-year career. Availability has long been the elusive piece to make Buxton one of the most complete players in the major leagues, and his age-31 season has brought a fresh wave of all-around production fueled by good health.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a monumental return,\u201d manager Rocco Baldelli said. \u201cHe\u2019s been one of the top players in baseball. To be able to get prime Buxton, basically every day, that\u2019s a whole different deal. When you actually see it and you actually get it, and it\u2019s in front of you every day, it\u2019s a beautiful thing.\u201d",
      "His second All-Star Game selection will go down as one of his greatest satisfactions in the sport, considering the path he's taken to get here and the fact that the festivities next week will be in his native Georgia.",
      "\u201cGoing back home to do something like this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I know I\u2019m not going to play 30 more years to get back to Atlanta,\u201d said Buxton, who was previously an All-Star in 2022 when the game was in Los Angeles.",
      "Family was front of mind when Buxton was informed he'd made the team. His youngest of three sons, Baire, wasn't born when he went the last time. The host site this year at Truist Park, the home of the Braves, is about a three-hour drive from his tiny hometown, Baxley. Then there's his participation in the Home Run Derby, which will fulfill the wish of his oldest son, 11-year-old Brix, to deliver a towel and a drink during his breaks.",
      "\u201cOut of everybody there, all the people he\u2019s going to see, that\u2019s what he wants and cares about. So it\u2019s the small things that add up to the big ones,\u201d Buxton said.",
      "With five of his 20 home runs leading off the game for the Twins, Buxton has 14 career leadoff homers to tie Chuck Knoblauch for the fourth-most in Twins history. He\u2019s also one of only six players in the major leagues this season with at least 15 homers and 15 steals.",
      "Buxton ranks among the top 10 batters in the American League in slugging percentage, OPS, triples, homers, runs, RBIs and steals, plus a number of other advanced statistics while providing his usual Gold Glove-caliber defense in center. He is 16 for 16 on stolen-base attempts, too, as sure of a sign his hips and knees are as healthy as ever. With 109 steals in 121 career attempts, Buxton is the only player in Major League Baseball history with more than 100 attempts and a 90% or better success rate.",
      "His home run on June 11 was measured at 479 feet, the second-longest in MLB this season and the longest of his career. The only setback was a concussion that cost him 11 games in May, stemming from an outfield collision with teammate Carlos Correa. After topping the 100-game mark in 2024 for only the second time in his career, Buxton has not only built on that injury-prevention progress but experienced the full benefits of being consistently healthy enough to play. Only twice has Baldelli slotted Buxton as the designated hitter this year.",
      "\u201cOnce you get those at-bats and get back into the groove of things, you tend to start taking off,\u201d Buxton said.",
      "The Twins, who took a 43-47 record into their three-game series starting Tuesday against the Chicago Cubs, would be in big trouble without him.",
      "\u201cHe does it at the highest level, everything he does,\u201d Correa said. \"He\u2019s fun. He\u2019s electric, full of energy, and our team needs that.\u201d",

      "Having expanded his player pool during a CONCACAF Gold Cup that ended with a 2-1 loss to Mexico in Sunday\u2019s final, U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino has eight friendlies left from September through March to evaluate players to pick for the World Cup",
      "Now comes the U.S. national team's version of \u201cSurvivor.\u201d",
      "Having expanded his player pool during a CONCACAF Gold Cup that ended with a 2-1 loss to Mexico in Sunday's final, coach Mauricio Pochettino has eight friendlies left from September through March to evaluate players to pick for the World Cup.",
      "\u201cAll the American players have the possibility,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWe need analyze every single player, see the circumstances, the situations, performance, fitness level.\u201d",
      "Following a CONCACAF Nations League flop with his A team in March, Pochettino had largely a B squad for the Gold Cup. Star Christian Pulisic wanted vacation time; Yunus Musah opted out for an undisclosed personal reason; Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Gio Reyna were forced to be with their teams at the Club World Cup; Antonee Robinson and Folarin Balogun were hurt; and Sergi\u00f1o Dest was regaining fitness.",
      "Defender Tim Ream and Tyler Adams were the only holdovers in the lineup against Mexico from the starters in the 2022 World Cup second-round loss to the Netherlands.",
      "Players who boosted themselves during the Gold Cup included goalkeeper Matt Freese, right back Alex Freeman, midfielders Malik Tillman and Sebastian Berhalter, and forward Patrick Agyemang.",
      "\u201cGuys have stepped up who were maybe taking a back seat previously, not that they\u2019re quiet mice and they just sit there and listen to everything,\u201d said Ream, the 37-year-old who captained the U.S. against Mexico.",
      "Pochettino has 10 wins and six losses since replacing Gregg Berhalter last fall. A segment of the team's fan base was discouraged by last year's first-round elimination at the Copa America, this year's Nations League and a four-game losing streak entering the Gold Cup, the team's longest skid since 2007.",
      "Crowds that rooted overwhelming for Guatemala in the semifinals and Mexico in the final caused Pochettino to implore the American fan base to support its national team.",
      "\u201cI think it would have been different if we would have played in two stadiums, the other way around, both against Guatemala in St. Louis \u2014 90 (%) to 10 for USA, and today, instead of 70,000 \u2014 I\u2019m not saying 70, but 60 or 50,000 of our people supporting us,\u201d he said Sunday. \"But, well, this is what we have to deal with.\u201d",
      "Even following Freese's emergence, the American goalkeeper pool is its weakest since the 1980s. Matt Turner has failed to establish himself with a top-tier European team, just like Zack Steffen. And given a chance to regain the starting spot after returning to Major League Soccer, Steffen got hurt ahead of the Gold Cup.",
      "Richards and Ream are the strongest of the central defenders, and Dest and Robinson the top choice at outside back with no clear No. 2s. Midfield has the most depth and no one has seized the striker position.",
      "Ex-players, including Landon Donovan, Clint Dempsey and Tim Howard, have criticized the current player pool's dedication. Speaking late Sunday, Adams noted \u201cso much noise outside of what we were doing on the field\u201d heading into the tournament.",
      "\u201cI told every single player after the game how proud I was just of the growth of every single individual,\u201d Adams said.",
      "He said the positive culture Pochettino established over five weeks together has to be maintained for friendlies against South Korea on Sept. 6 and Japan three days later.",
      "\u201cI think it has to translate right away or I think Mauricio just probably won\u2019t call people in,\" Adams said. \"The culture that we have, it doesn\u2019t matter who you are. If it\u2019s guys here that played well, if it\u2019s guys coming back into the group, if you\u2019re coming back from injury, just whatever it is, the culture and the emotion is the first thing that he wants to see.\u201d",
      "There also will be a pair of friendlies in each of October, November and March, a possible January training camp mostly for MLS-based players and then two pre-World Cup send-off games in early June.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing is to have our heads up,\" Pochettino said. \"I have no doubt that we are going to be really, really competitive and going to be very difficult for the opponent.'",

      "CHICAGO -- NASCAR\u2019s first in-season tournament hasn\u2019t made much of an impression on its drivers so far. Ty Gibbs said Sunday he didn't know who his second-round opponent was until after the Cup Series race.",
      "That might be about to change.",
      "Gibbs is one of eight drivers still in the mix for the $1 million prize that goes to the winner of the five-race, bracket-style competition. While Shane van Gisbergen was closing out his Cup victory in Chicago this weekend, some of the most compelling action on the downtown street course was at least connected to the inaugural In-Season Challenge.",
      "Alex Bowman and Bubba Wallace raced each other hard in the final laps after they tangled in Chicago last year. Bowman got the better of the head-to-head matchup, finishing eighth and eliminating Wallace from the tournament.",
      "John Hunter Nemechek was 15th, one spot better than his opponent, Chase Elliott. Gibbs had a strong day and finished second, good enough to beat AJ Allmendinger in sixth. Ty Dillon, Tyler Reddick, Ryan Preece, Zane Smith and Erik Jones also moved on.",
      "The 14th-seeded Smith upset No. 3 seed Chris Buescher by finishing 14th. He is matched up with Gibbs for Sunday's road race at Sonoma.",
      "\u201cI hate we had to knock another Ford out, but it\u2019s super cool to advance,\u201d Smith said.",
      "With the in-season tournament \u2014 part of a new media rights deal that includes TNT \u2014 NASCAR is following in the footsteps of the NBA and soccer leagues around the world. After Sonoma this weekend, it concludes with races at Dover and Indianapolis Motor Speedway.",
      "Bowman said the tournament wasn't on his mind as he battled with Wallace at the end in Chicago. Whatever the reason for the contact, their head-to-head matchup certainly added a bit of intrigue to the racing behind van Gisbergen's victory.",
      "With the money involved and the field trimmed to eight drivers, there could be more moments like the duel between Bowman and Wallace in the final weeks of the challenge.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that to happen or to get raced like that, but we did,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cWe just have to move on from it and keep digging.\u201d",
      "It sure sounds as if Dillon is enjoying the competition. Dillon, the No. 32 seed, eliminated Brad Keselowski on Sunday after he upset top-seeded Denny Hamlin at Atlanta on June 28.",
      "There was absolutely no drama in Dillon's win after Keselowski was collected in an early crash that began with Carson Hocevar hitting the wall and spinning out between Turns 10 and 11. Hocevar was eliminated by Reddick.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just so proud of Kaulig Racing and our No. 10 team,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cI knew in a basketball city, going up against Brad in a game of knockout, I was going to have a good chance.\u201d",
      "Dillon takes on Bowman and Preece faces Reddick in the next round. But the most interesting contest just might be Nemechek versus Jones in a matchup of Legacy Motor Club teammates.",
      "\u201cI felt like if we could have gotten through the first round, these next two rounds are really good for us,\" Preece said. \"Our road course program is pretty strong, and we keep making it better. So going into Sonoma, I think we\u2019re up against Tyler Reddick, so he\u2019s really good at road courses as well, but I like being the underdog.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Novak Djokovic overcame an uncharacteristically unsteady start to avoid what would have been his earliest exit at Wimbledon since 2016, coming through for a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory over 11th-seeded Alex de Minaur in the fourth round Monday.",
      "With Roger Federer, an eight-time Wimbledon winner, sitting in the front row of the Royal Box, so little went right at the outset for the 38-year-old Djokovic on the grass below during a breezy afternoon with the temperature in the 60s Fahrenheit (teens Celsius), a week after matches were contested in record-breaking heat.",
      "But Djokovic turned things around enough to grab the middle two sets and then really took control after trailing 4-1 in the fourth. He won the last five games and 14 of the final 15 points.",
      "His bid for an eighth Wimbledon title and 25th Grand Slam singles trophy overall will continue against No. 22 Flavio Cobolli of Italy. Cobolli reached his first major quarterfinal with a 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3) victory over 2014 U.S. Open champion and two-time major runner-up Marin Cilic.",
      "Djokovic will be appearing in his 63rd Slam quarterfinal.",
      "Against de Minaur, he made mistake after mistake, double-faulting four times in the first set alone. By match\u2019s end, he had faced a hard-to-believe 19 break points.",
      "After entering with 41 holds in 42 service games in the tournament, Djokovic was broken in five of his first seven against de Minaur, a 26-year-old Australian who was supposed face the Serb in last year\u2019s quarterfinals at Wimbledon but withdrew with an injured hip.",
      "Despite producing merely four clean winners of his own in the opening set, de Minaur accumulated nearly twice as many points as Djokovic, 27-14. That\u2019s because Djokovic contributed a whopping 16 unforced errors.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t remember when I\u2019ve seen him play a worse set than this,\u201d John McEnroe, who won Wimbledon three times in the 1980s, said on the BBC telecast. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s literally been years.\u201d",
      "All in all, Djokovic was discombobulated, chalking it up afterward to nerves. He rushed between points. He reacted to flubbed shots by rolling his eyes or shouting and glaring in the direction of his guest box or putting his arms wide as if seeking explanations from someone, anyone.",
      "At changeovers, he placed an ice-filled towel \u2014 usually wrapped around necks by players in steamy conditions \u2014 on his stomach, which he complained about during his first-round victory last week. But afterward, Djokovic dismissed the significance of that.",
      "This could have been Djokovic\u2019s soonest setback at Wimbledon since he was eliminated in the third round by Sam Querrey nine years ago. That one was even more shocking, because it ended Djokovic\u2019s 30-match Grand Slam winning streak, which included championships at the preceding four major tournaments in a row, making him the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold each of those trophies simultaneously.",
      "Djokovic won his men\u2019s-record 24th major title at the 2023 U.S. Open.",
      "He\u2019s come close to raising his total, finishing as the runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz at Wimbledon last year \u2014 the second consecutive time they met in the final, with the results the same \u2014 and departing each of the first two Slams of 2025 in the semifinals: he stopped with a hurt hamstring at the Australian Open in January and lost to No. 1 Jannik Sinner at the French Open last month.",
      "No man as old as Djokovic is now has won a major championship.",
      "He keeps showing why it's not preposterous to think he could, though, such as his diving volley winner earlier in the tournament or the way Djokovic broke to lead 2-1 in the second set on a 35-stroke exchange Monday. He put his right index finger to his ear and waved his arms to ask for noise from the spectators.",
      "The comeback officially was on, and soon enough, he was closing the third set with a winner to cap a 27-shot point.",
      "By the very end, it's almost as though de Minaur was resigned to defeat, knowing he's only the latest \u2014 and perhaps not the last \u2014 opponent to succumb to a surging Djokovic.",

    "story": [
      "Filmmaker Peter Jackson's fascination with a large extinct New Zealand bird has led to an unusual partnership with a biotech company known for its grand and controversial plans to bring back lost species",
      "WASHINGTON -- Filmmaker Peter Jackson owns one of the largest private collections of bones of an extinct New Zealand bird called the moa. His fascination with the flightless ostrich-like bird has led to an unusual partnership with a biotech company known for its grand and controversial plans to bring back lost species.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal Biosciences announced an effort to genetically engineer living birds to resemble the extinct South Island giant moa \u2013 which once stood 12 feet (3.6 meters) tall \u2013 with $15 million in funding from Jackson and his partner Fran Walsh. The collaboration also includes the New Zealand-based Ng\u0101i Tahu Research Centre.",
      "\u201cThe movies are my day job, and the moa are my fun thing I do,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cEvery New Zealand schoolchild has a fascination with the moa.\u201d",
      "Outside scientists say the idea of bringing back extinct species onto the modern landscape is likely impossible, although it may be feasible to tweak the genes of living animals to have similar physical traits. Scientists have mixed feelings on whether that will be helpful, and some worry that focusing on lost creatures could distract from protecting species that still exist.",
      "The moa had roamed New Zealand for 4,000 years until they became extinct around 600 years ago, mainly because of overhunting. A large skeleton brought to England in the 19th century, now on display at the Yorkshire Museum, prompted international interest in the long-necked bird.",
      "Unlike Colossal's work with dire wolves, the moa project is in very early stages. It started with a phone call about two years ago after Jackson heard about the company's efforts to \u201cde-extinct\u201d \u2013 or create genetically similar animals to \u2013 species like the woolly mammoth and the dire wolf.",
      "Then Jackson put Colossal in touch with experts he\u2019d met through his own moa bone-collecting. At that point, he\u2019d amassed between 300 and 400 bones, he said.",
      "In New Zealand, it\u2019s legal to buy and sell moa bones found on private lands, but not on public conservation areas \u2013 nor to export them.",
      "The first stage of the moa project will be to identify well-preserved bones from which it may be possible to extract DNA, said Colossal\u2019s chief scientist Beth Shapiro.",
      "Those DNA sequences will be compared to genomes of living bird species, including the ground-dwelling tinamou and emu, \u201cto figure out what it is that made the moa unique compared to other birds,\u201d she said.",
      "Colossal used a similar process of comparing ancient DNA of extinct dire wolves to determine the genetic differences with gray wolves. Then scientists took blood cells from a living gray wolf and used CRISPR to genetically modify them in 20 different sites. Pups with long white hair and muscular jaws were born late last year.",
      "Working with birds presents different challenges, said Shapiro.",
      "Unlike mammals, bird embryos develop inside eggs, so the process of transferring an embryo to a surrogate will not look like mammalian IVF.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s lots of different scientific hurdles that need to be overcome with any species that we pick as a candidate for de-extinction,\u201d said Shapiro. \u201cWe are in the very early stages.\u201d",
      "If the Colossal team succeeds in creating a tall bird with huge feet and thick pointed claws resembling the moa, there\u2019s also the pressing question of where to put it, said Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who is not involved in the project.",
      "\u201cCan you put a species back into the wild once you\u2019ve exterminated it there?\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s exceedingly unlikely that they could do this in any meaningful way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis will be an extremely dangerous animal,\u201d Pimm added.",
      "The direction of the project will be shaped by M\u0101ori scholars at the University of Canterbury\u2019s Ng\u0101i Tahu Research Centre. Ng\u0101i Tahu archaeologist Kyle Davis, an expert in moa bones, said the work has \u201creally reinvigorated the interest in examining our own traditions and mythology.\u201d",
      "At one of the archaeological sites that Jackson and Davis visited to study moa remains, called Pyramid Valley, there are also antique rock art done by M\u0101ori people \u2013 some depicting moa before their extinction.",
      "Paul Scofield, a project adviser and senior curator of natural history at the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch, New Zealand, said he first met the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d director when he went to his house to help him identity which of the nine known species of moa the various bones represented.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t just collect some moa bones \u2013 he has a comprehensive collection,\u201d said Scofield.",

      "Less than a month after extending a deadline to ban TikTok for the third time, President Donald Trump told reporters late Friday night that, \u201cWe pretty much have a deal,\u201d on TikTok",
      "Less than a month after extending a deadline to ban TikTok for the third time, President Donald Trump told reporters late Friday night that, \u201cWe pretty much have a deal,\u201d on TikTok \u2014 but he did not offer details.",
      "The details and timing of a potential deal are not clear. TikTok did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Monday.",
      "Emarketer analyst Jeremy Goldman said while TikTok is \u201creportedly planning\u201d a U.S. version of its app to comply with legal restrictions, the platform \u2014 if it launches without the original TikTok algorithm \u2014 \u201crisks losing the very personalization that drives user engagement.\u201d",
      "In other words, TikTok just isn't TikTok without its algorithm.",
      "\u201cAnd getting millions to download a new app is no small feat, to say the least,\u201d Goldman added.",
      "Here's what to know about where TikTok stands in the U.S. following Trump's comments.",
      "Though he has no clear legal basis to do so, Trump has continued to extend the deadline for TikTok to avoid a ban in the U.S. This gives his administration more time to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership.",
      "It is not clear how many times Trump can \u2014 or will \u2014 keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance. While there is no clear legal basis for the extensions, so far there have been no legal challenges against the administration. Trump has amassed more than 15 million followers on TikTok since he joined last year, and he has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters. He said in January that he has a \u201cwarm spot for TikTok.\u201d",
      "For now, TikTok continues to function for its 170 million users in the U.S. Tech giants Apple, Google and Oracle were persuaded to continue to offer and support the app, on the promise that Trump\u2019s Justice Department would not use the law to seek potentially steep fines against them.",
      "Americans are even more closely divided on what to do about TikTok than they were two years ago.",
      "A recent Pew Research Center survey found that about one-third of Americans said they supported a TikTok ban, down from 50% in March 2023. Roughly one-third said they would oppose a ban, and a similar percentage said they weren\u2019t sure.",
      "Among those who said they supported banning the social media platform, about 8 in 10 cited concerns over users\u2019 data security being at risk as a major factor in their decision, according to the report.",
      "Trump said Friday that on Monday or Tuesday, the U.S. would take the proposal to Chinese leader Xi Jinping or one of his representatives. The president said he thinks they \u201cprobably\u201d need China to approve the deal but he wasn\u2019t sure they needed to.",
      "When asked whether he was confident China would approve the deal, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m not confident but I think so.\u201d",
      "He said that for the U.S., \u201cwe make a lot of money if the deal goes through.\"",
      "The Chinese embassy in Washington said in a statement that it has no new information to share and \u201cChina has reiterated its principled position on multiple occasions and will handle relevant issues in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations.\"",
      "Although it\u2019s unclear if ByteDance plans to sell TikTok, several potential bidders have come forward in the past few months.",
      "Aides for Vice President JD Vance, who was tapped to oversee a potential deal, have reached out to some parties, such as the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI, to get additional details about their bids, according to a person familiar with the matter. In January, Perplexity AI presented ByteDance with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation.",
      "Perplexity had no comment on Monday.",
      "Other potential bidders include a consortium organized by billionaire business executive Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic adviser. Investors in the consortium say they\u2019ve offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. And if successful, they plan to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they say will provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "\u201cEvery day that passes without a qualified divestiture of TikTok puts Americans at greater risk of manipulation and surveillance. We believe the administration will ultimately obey the courts and follow the requirements for a lawful divestiture,\u201d McCourt\u2019s internet advocacy organization, Project Liberty, said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with members of the administration, policymakers, and our many outstanding partners in The People\u2019s Bid to achieve this goal.\u201d",
      "Among other possible investors are the software company Oracle and the investment firm Blackstone. Neither company immediately responded to messages seeking comment on Monday.",

      "A stark disagreement over regulating AI in Republicans\u2019 tax cut and spending bill is the latest tension among conservatives about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference",
      "NEW YORK -- A controversial bid to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade seemed on its way to passing as the Republican tax cut and spending bill championed by President Donald Trump worked its way through the U.S. Senate.",
      "But as the bill neared a final vote, a relentless campaign against it by a constellation of conservatives \u2014 including Republican governors, lawmakers, think tanks and social groups \u2014 had been eroding support. One, conservative activist Mike Davis, appeared on the show of right-wing podcaster Steve Bannon, urging viewers to call their senators to reject this \u201cAI amnesty\u201d for \u201ctrillion-dollar Big Tech monopolists.\u201d",
      "He said he also texted with Trump directly, advising the president to stay neutral on the issue despite what Davis characterized as significant pressure from White House AI czar David Sacks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and others.",
      "Conservatives passionate about getting rid of the provision had spent weeks fighting others in the party who favored the legislative moratorium because they saw it as essential for the country to compete against China in the race for AI dominance. The schism marked the latest and perhaps most noticeable split within the GOP about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference.",
      "In the end, the advocates for guardrails won, revealing the enormous influence of a segment of the Republican Party that has come to distrust Big Tech. They believe states must remain free to protect their citizens against potential harms of the industry, whether from AI, social media or emerging technologies.",
      "\u201cTension in the conservative movement is palpable,\u201d said Adam Thierer of the R Street Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. Thierer first proposed the idea of the AI moratorium last year. He noted \u201cthe animus surrounding Big Tech\u201d among many Republicans.",
      "\"That was the differentiating factor.\u201d",
      "The Heritage Foundation, children\u2019s safety groups and Republican state lawmakers, governors and attorneys general all weighed in against the AI moratorium. Democrats, tech watchdogs and some tech companies opposed it, too.",
      "Sensing the moment was right on Monday night, Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who opposed the AI provision and had attempted to water it down, teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington to suggest striking the entire proposal. By morning, the provision was removed in a 99-1 vote.",
      "The whirlwind demise of a provision that initially had the backing of House and Senate leadership and the White House disappointed other conservatives who felt it gave China, a main AI competitor, an advantage.",
      "Ryan Fournier, chairman of Students for Trump and chief marketing officer of the startup Uncensored AI, had supported the moratorium, writing on X that it \u201cstops blue states like California and New York from handing our future to Communist China.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans are that way ... I get it,\u201d he said in an interview, but added there needs to be \u201cone set of rules, not 50\u201d for AI innovation to be successful.",
      "Tech companies, tech trade groups, venture capitalists and multiple Trump administration figures had voiced their support for the provision that would have blocked states from passing their own AI regulations for years. They argued that in the absence of federal standards, letting the states take the lead would leave tech innovators mired in a confusing patchwork of rules.",
      "Lutnick, the commerce secretary, posted that the provision \u201cmakes sure American companies can develop cutting-edge tech for our military, infrastructure, and critical industries \u2014 without interference from anti-innovation politicians.\u201d AI czar Sacks had also publicly supported the measure.",
      "After the Senate passed the bill without the AI provision, the White House responded to an inquiry for Sacks with the president's position, saying Trump \"is fully supportive of the Senate-passed version of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Acknowledging defeat of his provision on the Senate floor, Cruz noted how pleased China, liberal politicians and \u201cradical left-wing groups\u201d would be to hear the news.",
      "But Blackburn pointed out that the federal government has failed to pass laws that address major concerns about AI, such as keeping children safe and securing copyright protections.",
      "\u201cBut you know who has passed it?\u201d she said. \u201cThe states.\u201d",
      "Conservatives distrusting Big Tech for what they see as social media companies stifling speech during the COVID-19 pandemic and surrounding elections said that tech companies shouldn\u2019t get a free pass, especially on something that carries as much risk as AI.",
      "Many who opposed the moratorium also brought up preserving states' rights, though proponents countered that AI issues transcend state borders and Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce.",
      "Eric Lucero, a Republican state lawmaker in Minnesota, noted that many other industries already navigate different regulations established by both state and local jurisdictions.",
      "\u201cI think everyone in the conservative movement agrees we need to beat China,\" said Daniel Cochrane from the Heritage Foundation. \u201cI just think we have different prescriptions for doing so.\u201d",
      "Many argued that in the absence of federal legislation, states were best positioned to protect citizens from the potential harms of AI technology.",
      "\u201cWe have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next 10 years and giving it free rein and tying states hands is potentially dangerous,\u201d Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on X.",
      "Another Republican, Texas state Sen. Angela Paxton, wrote to Cruz and his counterpart, Sen. John Cornyn, urging them to remove the moratorium.",
      "She and other conservatives said some sort of federal standard could help clarify the landscape around AI and resolve some of the party's disagreements.",
      "But with the moratorium dead and Republicans holding only narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress, it\u2019s unclear whether they will be able to agree on a set of standards to guide the development of the burgeoning technology.",
      "In an email to The Associated Press, Paxton said she wants to see limited federal AI legislation \u201cthat sets some clear guardrails\u201d around national security and interstate commerce, while leaving states free to address issues that affect their residents.",
      "\"When it comes to technology as powerful and potentially dangerous as AI, we should be cautious about silencing state-level efforts to protect consumers and children,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "A startup called Gigablue claims to have reached a milestone by selling 200,000 carbon credits for its ocean-based carbon capture technology",
      "The startup Gigablue announced with fanfare this year that it reached a historic milestone: selling 200,000 carbon credits to fund what it describes as a groundbreaking technology in the fight against climate change.",
      "Formed three years ago by a group of entrepreneurs in Israel, the company says it has designed particles that when released in the ocean will trap carbon at the bottom of the sea. By \u201charnessing the power of nature,\u201d Gigablue says, its work will do nothing less than save the planet.",
      "But outside scientists frustrated by the lack of information released by the company say serious questions remain about whether Gigablue\u2019s technology works as the company describes. Their questions showcase tensions in an industry built on little regulation and big promises \u2014 and a tantalizing chance to profit.",
      "Jimmy Pallas, an event organizer based in Italy, struck a deal with Gigablue last year. He said he trusts the company does what it has promised him \u2014 ensuring the transportation, meals, and electricity of a recent 1,000-person event will be offset by particles in the ocean.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s service is like \u201can extra trash can\u201d where Pallas can discard his unwanted emissions, he said.",
      "\u201cSame way I use my trash can \u2014 I don\u2019t follow where the truck that comes and picks up my trash brings it to,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take their word for it.\u201d",
      "Gigablue has a grand vision for the future of carbon removal. It was originally named \u201cGigaton\u201d after the one billion metric tons of carbon dioxide most scientists say will be necessary to remove from the atmosphere each year to slow global warming.",
      "The company began trials in the South Pacific Ocean last year, and says it will work with country authorities to create a \u201csequestration field\u201d \u2014 a dedicated part of the ocean where \u201cpulses\u201d of particles will be released on a seasonal basis.",
      "Gigablue says its solution is affordable, too \u2014 priced to attract investors.",
      "\u201cEvery time we go to the ocean, we generate hundreds of thousands of carbon credits, and this is what we\u2019re going to do continuously over the upcoming years and towards the future, in greater and greater quantities,\u201d co-founder Ori Shaashua said.",
      "Carbon credits, which have grown in popularity over the last decade, are tokens that symbolize the removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. On paper, companies that buy credits achieve a smaller carbon footprint without needing to reduce their own emissions \u2014 for instance, by paying another vendor to plant trees or capture carbon dioxide from the air.",
      "Only a few countries have required local industries to purchase carbon credits. Most companies that buy them, including Microsoft and Google, do so voluntarily.",
      "The credits have helped fund a band of startups like Gigablue that are eager to tackle the climate crisis, but they are also unevenly regulated, scientifically complex, and have in some cases been linked to fraud.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s 200,000 credits are pledged to SkiesFifty, a newly formed company investing in greener practices for the aviation industry. It\u2019s the largest sale to date for a climate startup operating in the ocean, according to the tracking site CDR.fyi, making up more than half of all ocean-based carbon credits sold last year.",
      "And it could beckon a rapid acceleration of the company\u2019s work. Gigablue hopes to reach a goal this year of capturing 10 metric tons of carbon dioxide for each ton of particles it deploys, Shaashua said. At that rate, Gigablue would disperse at least 20,000 tons of particles in the ocean.",
      "Gigablue wouldn\u2019t reveal what it earned in the sale, and SkiesFifty\u2019s team declined to be interviewed for this story. Most credits are sold for a few hundred dollars each \u2014 but a chart on Gigablue\u2019s website suggests its prices are lower than almost any other form of carbon capture on the market.",
      "The startup is the brainchild of four entrepreneurs hailing from the tech industry. According to their LinkedIn profiles, Gigablue\u2019s CEO previously worked for an online grocery startup, while its COO was vice president of SeeTree, a company that raised $60 million to provide farmers with information on their trees.",
      "Shaashua, who often serves as the face of Gigablue, said he specializes in using artificial intelligence to pursue positive outcomes in the world. He co-founded a data mining company that tracked exposure risks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and led an auto startup that brokered data on car mileage and traffic patterns.",
      "\u201cThree years ago, I decided to take the same formula, so to say, to climate,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Under his guidance, he said, Gigablue created an AI-driven \u201cdigital twin\u201d of the ocean based on dozens of metrics to determine where to release the particles.",
      "Chief technology officer Sapir Markus-Alford earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in earth and environmental sciences from Israel\u2019s Ben-Gurion University in 2021, shortly before founding Gigablue.",
      "Markus-Alford said she began her studies and eventual path to Gigablue after seeing bleached coral reefs and other impacts of warming waters on a series of diving trips around the world.",
      "\u201cI understood that the best thing we could do for the ocean is to be able to remove CO2,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "A spokesperson for Gigablue did not answer whether the other co-founders have graduate degrees in oceanography or environmental science, but said the company\u2019s broader team holds a total of 46 Ph.D.s with expertise in biology, chemistry, oceanography, and environmental science. Markus-Alford said that figure includes outside experts and academics and \u201ceveryone that supports us.\u201d",
      "The company\u2019s staffing has expanded from Israel to hubs in New York and New Zealand, Shaashua said.",
      "In social media posts advertising open jobs, Gigablue employees encouraged applicants to \u201cJoin Our Mission to Save the World!\u201d",
      "The particles Gigablue has patented are meant to capture carbon in the ocean by floating for a number of days and growing algae, before sinking rapidly to the ocean floor.",
      "\u201cWe are an elevator for carbon,\u201d Shaashua said. \u201cWe are exporting the carbon from the top to the bottom.\u201d",
      "Algae \u2014 sometimes referred to as phytoplankton \u2014 has long been attractive to climate scientists because it absorbs carbon dioxide from the surrounding water as it grows. If the algae sinks to the deep sea or ocean floor, Gigablue expects the carbon to be trapped there for hundreds to thousands of years.",
      "The ultimate goal is to lower carbon dioxide levels so drastically that the ocean rebalances with the atmosphere by soaking up more CO2 from the air. It\u2019s a feat that would help slow climate change, but one that is still under active study by climate scientists.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s founders have said the company\u2019s work is inspired by nature and \u201cvery, very environmentally safe.\u201d The company\u2019s particles and sinking methods simply recreate what nature has been doing \u201csince forever,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Gigablue ran its first trial sinking particles in the Mediterranean in March last year.",
      "Later, on two voyages to the South Pacific, the company released 60 cubic meters \u2014 about two shipping containers \u2014 of particles off the coast of New Zealand.",
      "While Gigablue has made several commercial deals, it has not yet revealed what its particles are made of. Partly this is because the company says it will build different particles tailored to different seasons and areas of the ocean.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s proprietary,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "Documents provide a window into the possible ingredients. According to information on the permit, Gigablue\u2019s first New Zealand trial last year involved releasing particles of pure vermiculite, a porous clay often used in potting soil.",
      "In the second New Zealand trial, the company released particles made of vermiculite, ground rock, a plant-based wax, as well as manganese and iron.",
      "A patent published last year hints the particles could also be made of scores of other materials, including cotton, rice husks or jute, as well as synthetic ingredients like polyester fibers or lint. The particles contain a range of possible binding agents, and up to 18 different chemicals and metals, from iron to nickel to vanadium.",
      "Without specifying future designs, Markus-Alford said Gigablue\u2019s particles meet certain requirements: \u201cAll the materials we use are materials that are natural, nontoxic, nonhazardous, and can be found in the ocean,\u201d she said. She wouldn\u2019t comment on the possible use of cotton or rice, but said the particles won\u2019t include any kind of plastic.",
      "When asked about vermiculite, which is typically mined on land and heated to expand, Markus-Alford said rivers and erosion transport most materials including vermiculite to the ocean. \u201cAlmost everything, basically, that exists on land can be found in the ocean,\u201d she said.",
      "The company said it had commissioned an environmental institute to verify that the particles are safe for thousands of organisms, including mussels and oysters. Any materials in future particles, Gigablue said, will be approved by local authorities.",
      "Shaashua has said the particles are so benign that they have zero impact on the ocean.",
      "\u201cWe are not changing the water chemistry or the water biology,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Ken Buesseler, a senior scientist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who has spent decades studying the biological carbon cycle of the ocean, says that while he\u2019s intrigued by Gigablue\u2019s proposal, the idea that the particles don\u2019t alter the ocean is \u201calmost inconceivable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere has to be a relationship between what they\u2019re putting in the ocean and the carbon dioxide that\u2019s dissolved in seawater for this to, quote, work,\u201d Buesseler said.",
      "Buesseler co-leads a nonprofit group of scientists hoping to tap the power of algae in the ocean to capture carbon. The group organizes regular forums on the subject, and Gigablue presented in April.",
      "\u201cI left with more questions than answers,\u201d Buesseler said.",
      "Several scientists not affiliated with Gigablue interviewed by The Associated Press said they were interested in how a company with so little public information about its technology could secure a deal for 200,000 carbon credits.",
      "The success of the company\u2019s method, they said, will depend on how much algae grows on the particles, and the amount that sinks to the deep ocean. So far, Gigablue has not released any studies demonstrating those rates.",
      "Thomas Ki\u00f8rboe, a professor of ocean ecology at the Technical University of Denmark, and Philip Boyd, an oceanographer at the University of Tasmania who studies the role of algae in the Earth\u2019s carbon cycle, said they were doubtful algae would get enough sunlight to grow inside the particles.",
      "It\u2019s more likely the particles would attract hungry bacteria, Ki\u00f8rboe said.",
      "\u201cTypical phytoplankton do not grow on surfaces, and they do not colonize particles,\u201d Ki\u00f8rboe said. \u201cTo most phytoplankton ecologists, this would just be, I think, absurd.\u201d",
      "The rates at which Gigablue says its particles sink \u2014 up to a hundred meters (yards) per hour \u2014 might shear off algae from the particles in the quick descent, Boyd said.",
      "It\u2019s likely that some particles would also be eaten by fish \u2014 limiting the carbon capture, and raising the question of how the particles could impact marine life.",
      "Boyd is eager to see field results showing algae growth, and wants to see proof that Gigablue\u2019s particles cause the ocean to absorb more CO2 from the air.",
      "\u201cThese are incredibly challenging issues that I don\u2019t think, certainly for the biological part, I don\u2019t think anyone on the planet has got solutions for them,\u201d he said.",
      "James Kerry, a senior marine and climate scientist for the conservation group OceanCare and senior research fellow at Australia's James Cook University, has closely followed Gigablue\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got is a situation of a company, a startup, upfront selling large quantities of credits for a technology that is unproven,\u201d he said.",
      "In a statement, Gigablue said that bacteria does consume the particles but the effect is minimal, and its measurements will account for any loss of algae or particles as they sink.",
      "The company noted that a major science institute in New Zealand has given Gigablue its stamp of approval. Gigablue hired the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, a government-owned company, to review several drafts of its methodology.",
      "In a recent letter posted to Gigablue\u2019s website, the institute\u2019s chief ocean scientist said his staff had confidence the company\u2019s work is \u201cscientifically sound\u201d and the proposed measurements for carbon sequestration were robust.",
      "Whether Gigablue\u2019s methods are deemed successful, for now, will be determined not by regulators \u2014 but by another private company.",
      "Puro.earth is one of several companies known as registries that serve the carbon credit market.",
      "Amid the lack of regulation and the potential for climate startups to overstate their impact, registries aim to verify how much carbon was really removed.",
      "The Finnish Puro.earth has verified more than a million carbon credits since its founding seven years ago. But most of those credits originated in land-based climate projects. Only recently has it aimed to set standards for the ocean.",
      "In part, that\u2019s because marine carbon credits are some of the newest to be traded. Dozens of ocean startups have entered the industry, with credit sales catapulting from 2,000 in 2021 to more than 340,000, including Gigablue\u2019s deal, last year.",
      "But the ocean remains a hostile and expensive place in which to operate a business or monitor research. Some ocean startups have sold credits only to fold before they could complete their work. Running Tide, a Maine-based startup aimed at removing carbon from the atmosphere by sinking wood chips and seaweed, abruptly shuttered last year despite the backing of $50 million from investors, leaving sales of about 7,000 carbon credits unfulfilled.",
      "In June, Puro.earth published a draft methodology that will be used to verify Gigablue\u2019s work, which it designed in consultation with Gigablue. Once finalized, Gigablue will pay the registry for each metric ton of carbon dioxide that it claims to remove.",
      "Marianne Tikkanen, head of standards at Puro.earth, said that although this methodology was designed with Gigablue, her team expects other startups to adopt the same approach.",
      "\u201cWe hope that there will be many who can do it and that it stimulates the market,\u201d she said.",
      "It remains to be seen whether New Zealand officials will grant permission for the expanded \u201csequestration field\u201d that Gigablue has proposed creating, or if the company will look to other countries.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s environmental authority has so far treated Gigablue\u2019s work as research \u2014 a designation that requires no formal review process or consultations with the public. The agency said in a statement that it could not comment on how it would handle a future commercial application from Gigablue.",
      "But like many climate startups, Gigablue was involved in selling carbon credits during its research expeditions \u2014 not only inking a major deal, but smaller agreements, too.",
      "Pallas, the Italian businessman, said he ordered 22 carbon credits from Gigablue last year to offset the emissions associated with his event in November. He said Gigablue gave them to him for free \u2014 but says he will pay for more in the future.",
      "Pallas sought out carbon credits because he sees the signs of climate change all around him, he says, and expects more requirements in Italy for businesses to decarbonize in coming years. He chose Gigablue because they are one of the largest suppliers: \u201cThey\u2019ve got quantity,\u201d he said.",
      "How authorities view Gigablue\u2019s growing commercial activity could matter in the context of an international treaty that has banned certain climate operations in the ocean.",
      "More than a decade ago, dozens of countries including New Zealand agreed they should not allow any commercial climate endeavor that involves releasing iron in the ocean, a technique known as \u201ciron fertilization.\u201d Only research, they said, with no prospect of economic gain should be allowed.",
      "Iron is considered a key ingredient for spurring algae growth and was embedded in the particles that Gigablue dispersed in October in the Pacific Ocean. Several scientific papers have raised concerns that spurring iron-fueled algae blooms on a large scale would deplete important nutrients in the ocean and harm fisheries.",
      "The startup denies any link to iron dumping on the basis that its particles don\u2019t release iron directly into the water and don\u2019t create an uncontrolled algae bloom.",
      "\u201cWe are not fertilizing the ocean,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "\u201cIn fact, we looked at iron fertilization as an inspiration of something to avoid,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "But the draft methodology that Puro.earth will use to verify Gigablue\u2019s work notes many of the same concerns that have been raised about iron fertilization, including disruptions to the marine food web.",
      "Other scientists who spoke with AP see a clear link between Gigablue\u2019s work and the controversial practice. \u201cIf they\u2019re using iron to stimulate phytoplankton growth,\u201d said Kerry, the OceanCare scientist, \u201cthen it is iron fertilization.\u201d",
      "For now, scientific concerns don\u2019t seem to have troubled Gigablue\u2019s buyers. The company has already planned its next research expedition in New Zealand and hopes to release more particles this fall.",
      "\u201cThey mean well, and so do I,\u201d said Pallas, of his support for Gigablue. \u201cSooner or later, I\u2019ll catch a plane, go to New Zealand, and grab a boat to see what they\u2019ve done.\u201d",

      "The harmless object is currently near Jupiter hundreds of millions of miles (kilometers) away and moving toward Mars, but it should get no closer to the sun than that, according to scientists.",
      "It's too soon to know whether the object, designated for now as A11pl3Z, is a rocky asteroid or a icy comet, or how big and what shape it is. More observations are needed to confirm its origins. NASA said it is monitoring the situation.",

It specializes in treating children with orthopedic problems, burns, urology disorders and craniofacial conditions including cleft lips and palates. While the organization accepts insurance payments, it says that it treats patients regardless of their ability to pay.",
      "\u201cThis is a decision of the health care system to expand the role we play in pediatric research,\u201d said Mel Bower, a spokesperson for Shriners Children's. He said the institute will be financed using the Shriners Children's resources and should be operating within a year to 18 months.",
      "The institute projects it will have 470 employees, many of them new hires, and Georgia Tech said it will be the largest tenant at Science Square. That is a mixed-use development that Georgia Tech is developing along with the Trammell Crow Co.",
      "Georgia Tech owns the land adjoining its campus near downtown Atlanta, while the company built labs that opened last year. The development aims to emulate Georgia Tech's success in joint developments with technology companies in Atlanta's Midtown neighborhood. That tech sector has been a major driver of growth in Atlanta in recent years, and officials are now trying to bolster growth from biomedical research.",
      "Leanne West, the chief engineer of pediatric technology at Georgia Tech, said the university has already conducted 25 projects with Shriners Children's. She said both Georgia Tech and Emory University will lend research expertise to the institute, and she hopes institute employees can work alongside Georgia Tech researchers.",
      "\u201cThe goal is to really help embed some of their researchers here with Georgia Tech, to walk across campus, to work in the same labs, to have that physical presence together,\u201d West said. \u201cI think we can accomplish great things by doing that.\u201d",
      "The state and local governments are providing incentives to Shriners Children\u2019s, although it is not exactly clear how that would work because nonprofits are generally exempt from income and property taxes. In Georgia, nonprofit organizations do have to pay sales taxes, which means the state could waive such taxes on equipment purchases. Jessica Atwell, a spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Economic Development, said the state won\u2019t release documents until they are finalized.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Ancient DNA has revealed a genetic link between the cultures of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, according to research published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "Researchers sequenced whole genomes from the teeth of a remarkably well-preserved skeleton found in a sealed funeral pot in an Egyptian tomb site dating to between 4,495 and 4,880 years ago.",
      "Four-fifths of the genome showed links to North Africa and the region around Egypt. But a fifth of the genome showed links to the area in the Middle East between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, known as the Fertile Crescent, where Mesopotamian civilization flourished.",
      "\u201cThe finding is highly significant\" because it \u201cis the first direct evidence of what has been hinted at\u201d in prior work,\u201d said Daniel Antoine, curator of Egypt and Sudan at the British Museum.",
      "Earlier archeological evidence has shown trade links between Egypt and Mesopotamia, as well as similarities in pottery-making techniques and pictorial writing systems. While resemblances in dental structures suggested possible ancestral links, the new study clarifies the genetic ties.",
      "The Nile River is \u201clikely to have acted as an ancient superhighway, facilitating the movement of not only cultures and ideas, but people,\u201d said Antoine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The skeleton was found in an Egyptian tomb complex at the archaeological site of Nuwayrat, inside a chamber carved out from a rocky hillside. An analysis of wear and tear on the skeleton \u2014 and the presence of arthritis in specific joints \u2014 indicates the man was likely in his 60s and may have worked as a potter, said co-author and bioarchaeologist Joel Irish of Liverpool John Moores University.",
      "The man lived just before or near the start of ancient Egypt\u2019s Old Kingdom, when Upper and Lower Egypt were unified as one state, leading to a period of relative political stability and cultural innovation \u2014 including the construction of the Giza pyramids.",

      "NEW YORK -- Sales of Tesla electric cars fell sharply in the last three months as boycotts over Elon Musk's political views continue to keep buyers away.",
      "The 13% plunge in global sales over a year earlier suggests the damage to Tesla's brand from Musk's embrace of U.S. President Donald Trump and far-right European politicians is much deeper, widespread and lasting than some investors had expected. The figures reported by Tesla on Wednesday also signal that its quarterly earnings report due later this month could disappoint as rival electric-vehicle makers pounce on its weakness and steal market share. v",
      "Sales fell to 384,122 in April through June, down from 443,956 in the same three months last year.",
      "During the latest period, Musk formally left the Trump administration as a cost-cutting czar, and hopes rose that sales would recover. The Tesla CEO himself recently said the company was in the midst of a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in sales, a statement contradicted by the latest figures.",
      "Still, some parts of the report were encouraging. Sales of the Models 3 and Y totaled 373,728, above the estimate of 356,000 from Wall Street analysts. Tesla shares rose 5% on the news.",
      "\u201cThe numbers weren\u2019t as bad as thought with all the analyst forecast cuts we saw over the past week,\u201d said Morningstar's Seth Goldstein, though he added the report overall showed the company faces big challenges. \u201cThe current product lineup is at market saturation and Tesla will need the new affordable vehicle to grow deliveries.\u201d",
      "Musk has promised a cheaper EV model would be coming this year that would boost sales.",
      "It's not clear yet if Musk's latest feud with Trump will help lure back buyers who have been angry at the billionaire's political positions. After Musk once again took to social media to criticize Trump's budget bill, the president threatened Tuesday to use the power of his office to hurt his companies, including Tesla, pushing its stock down more than 5%.",
      "A June AP-NORC poll showed about half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans.",
      "The new figures come as Tesla is focusing less on new models and more on robots, self-driving technology and robotaxis ferrying passengers around without anyone behind the wheel.",
      "Tesla is in the midst of a test run of robotaxis in Austin, Texas, that seems to have gone smoothly for the most part. But it also has drawn the scrutiny of federal car safety regulators because of a few mishaps, including one case in which a Tesla cab was shown on a video heading down an opposing lane.",
      "The competition from rival EV makers is especially fierce in Europe where China's BYD has taken a bite out of its market share. Tesla sales fell 28% in May in 30 European countries even as the overall market for electric vehicles expanded sharply, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association.",
      "Musk has acknowledged that his work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency and his embrace of European far-right candidates have hurt the company. But he said earlier this year that much of the sales plunge is due to customers holding off while they waited for an ugrade to Tesla's best selling Model Y. That new version has been out for months now.",

      "U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly on Tuesday rejected Huawei\u2019s request to dismiss the allegations in a 16-count federal indictment against the company, saying in a 52-page ruling that its arguments were premature.",
      "The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The U.S. accuses Huawei and some of its subsidiaries of plotting to steal U.S. trade secrets, installing surveillance equipment that enabled Iran to spy on protesters during 2009 anti-government demonstrations in Iran, and of doing business in North Korea despite U.S. sanctions there.",
      "During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term in office, his administration raised national security concerns and began lobbying Western allies against including Huawei in their wireless, high-speed networks.",
      "In its January 2019 indictment, the Justice Department accused Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company called Skycom to sell equipment to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions and charged its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with fraud by misleading the HSBC bank about the company\u2019s business dealings in Iran.",
      "Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Canada in late 2018 on a U.S. extradition request but released in September 2021 in a high-stakes prisoner swap that freed two Canadians held by China and allowed her to return home.",
      "Chinese officials have accused the U.S. government of \u201ceconomic bullying\u201d and of improperly using national security as a pretext for \u201coppressing Chinese companies.\u201d In their motion to dismiss the broad criminal case, among other arguments Huawei's lawyers contended that the U.S. allegations were too vague and some were \u201dimpermissibly extraterritorial,\" and do not involve domestic wire and bank fraud.",
      "The biggest maker of network gear, Huawei struggled to hold onto its market share under sanctions that have blocked its access to most U.S. processor chips and other technology. The limits led it to ramp up its own development of computer chips and other advanced technologies.",
      "The company also shifted its focus to the Chinese market and to network technology for hospitals, factories and other industrial customers and other products that would not be affected by U.S. sanctions.",

      "The Chicago boy became a star engineer who ran Motorola\u2019s research and development arm when the hometown telecommunications titan was locked in a 1970s corporate battle to invent the portable phone. Cooper rejected AT&T\u2019s wager on the car phone, betting that America wanted to feel like Dick Tracy, armed with \u201ca device that was an extension of you, that made you reachable everywhere.\u201d",
      "Fifty-two years ago, Cooper declared victory in a call from a Manhattan sidewalk to the head of AT&T\u2019s rival program. His four-pound DynaTAC 8000X has evolved into a global population of billions of smartphones weighing mere ounces apiece. Some 4.6 billion people \u2014 nearly 60% of the world \u2014 have mobile internet, according to a global association of mobile network operators.",
      "The tiny computers that we carry by the billions are becoming massive, interlinked networks of processors that perform trillions of calculations per second \u2013 the computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The simple landlines once used to call friends or family have evolved into omnipresent glossy screens that never leave our sight and flood our brain with hours of data daily, deluging us with endless messages, emails, videos and a soundtrack that many play constantly to block the outside world.",
      "From his home in Del Mar, California, the inventor of the mobile phone, now 96, watches all of this. Of one thing Cooper is certain: The revolution has really just begun.",
      "Now, the winner of the 2024 National Medal of Technology and Innovation \u2014 the United States\u2019 highest honor for technological achievement \u2013 is focused on the cellphone\u2019s imminent transition to a thinking mobile computer fueled by human calories to avoid dependence on batteries. Our new parts will run constant tests on our bodies and feed our doctors real-time results, Cooper predicts.",
      "\u201cThat will let people anticipate diseases before they happen,\u201d Cooper envisions. \u201cPeople are going to die from old age and accidents but they\u2019re not going to die from disease. That\u2019s a revolution in medicine.\u201c",
      "Human behavior is already adapting to smartphones, some observers say, using them as tools that allow overwhelmed minds to focus on quality communication.",

      "For almost everyone, the straight-up phone call has become an intrusion. Now everything needs to be preceded by a message. \u201cThere seems to be a sense that the phone call is for heart-to-heart and not just for information exchange,\u201d Fischer says.",
      "And this from a 20-year-old corroborates that: \u201cThe only person I call on a day-to-day basis is my cousin,\u201d says Ayesha Iqbal, a psychology student at Suffolk County Community College. \u201cI primarily text everyone else.\u201d",
      "Child education student Katheryn Ruiz, 19, concurs, saying \u201ctexting is used for just like nothing substantial, like nothing personal.\u201d",
      "Sometimes the roles are reversed, though. Sixty-eight-year-old Diana Cunningham of Overbrook, Kansas, pop. 1005, uses a group text to stay in touch with her kids and grandkids. Her 18-year-old granddaughter Bryndal Hoover, a senior at nearby Lawrence High School, says she prefers voice calls over texting because then I can understand, \u2018Oh, how should I go about a conversation?\u2019\u201d",
      "When she was a girl, Karen Wilson\u2019s family shared a party line with other phone customers outside Buffalo, New York. Wilson, 79, shocked her granddaughter by telling her about the party line when the girl got a cellphone as a teenager.",
      "\u201cWhat did you do if you didn\u2019t wait?\u2019\u201d the girl asked. Responded her grandmother: \u201c`You went down to their house and you yelled, \u2018Hey, Mary, can you come out?\u2019\u201d",
      "Many worry about the changes exerted by our newly interconnected, highly stimulated world.",
      "We increasingly buy online and get products delivered without the possibility of serendipity. There are fewer opportunities to greet a neighbor or store employee and find out something unexpected, to make a friend, to fall in love. People are working more efficiently as they drown.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no barrier to the number of people who can be reaching out to you at the same time and it\u2019s just overwhelming,\u201d says Kristen Burks, an associate circuit judge in Macon, Missouri.",
      "Most importantly, sociologists, psychologists and teachers say, near-constant phone-driven screen time is cutting into kids\u2019 ability to learn and socialize. A growing movement is pushing back against cellphones\u2019 intrusion into children\u2019s daily lives.",

      "\u201cBy creating a firehose of addictive content that entered through kids\u2019 eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human development on an almost unimaginable scale,\u201d he writes.",
      "Seven states have signed \u2014 and twenty states have introduced \u2014 statewide bell-to-bell phone bans in schools. Additional states have moved to prohibit them during teaching time.",
      "That doesn\u2019t sit well with the smartphone\u2019s inventor, who says there are better solutions than regulation. \u201cAccommodating disruptive technologies requires disruptive solutions,\u201d Cooper wrote from Del Mar. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better for teachers to integrate the cellphone that provides access to all the information in the world?\u201d",
      "That advantage is coming to rich countries faster than poor ones.",
      "The first time that Nnaemeka Agbo had to leave his family in Nigeria for a prolonged period, life shuttled him to Russia for studies, like many other young Nigerians increasingly desperate to relocate to seek better opportunities.",

      "In a country that has one of the world\u2019s highest poverty and hunger levels despite being Africa\u2019s top oil producer, Agbo\u2019s experience mirrors many young people in Nigeria increasingly forced to choose between remaining at home with family or aiming at a better life elsewhere. At least 37% of African adults expressed their desire to live somewhere else in 2023, the highest rate in the world, according to a Gallup survey published in October last year.",

      "In Africa, where only 37% of the population had internet access in 2023, according to the International Telecommunication Union, regular mobile calls are the only option many have. In northern Nigeria\u2019s Zamfara state, Abdulmalik Saidu says the mobile connectivity rate is so low that \u201csometimes we stay for weeks without network.\u201d",
      "When 19-year-old Shamsu Deen-Cole flew from Sierra Leone to the United States to study international relations in 1971, making a call to his parents in Sierra Leone would take days, starting with telling his parents when to expect the call. Calls would cost around $150 for under 10 minutes. \u201cThere was no time for extra talks or complimentary because it would all add up in cost,\u201d recalls Deen-Cole, 73.",

      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exceptionally good technology,\u201d said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\u201d",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of the New World Screwworm fly. The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them \u2014 so they can mate ineffectively with females and over time cause the population to die out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",

      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly\u2019s cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",
      "Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University\u2019s Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.",
      "Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico\u2019s border with Guatemala, killing three people.",
      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \u201cWhiz Packer.\u201d",
      "The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.",
      "Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA\u2019s \u201ccrowning achievements.\u201d",
      "Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn\u2019t be shuttered after another successful fight.",
      "\u201cSomething we think we have complete control over \u2014 and we have declared a triumph and victory over \u2014 can always rear its ugly head again,\u201d Burgess said.",

    "story": [
      "\"There should have been sirens here,\" said Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick.",
      "As state and local officials in Texas have come under scrutiny over the lack of sirens to warn people of impending flash flooding on the Guadalupe River that killed more than 100 people, records reviewed by ABC News show authorities of one of the hardest hit counties have had discussions about implementing such an alert system for nearly a decade.",
      "The destructive flooding hit in the early morning hours of the Fourth of July, causing the Guadalupe River in Kerr County to rise by 26 feet in less than an hour, spilling its banks and flooding multiple summer camps and RV parks along the winding river.",
      "On Monday, the death toll from the flooding climbed to more than 100, according to officials. At least 84 of the deaths occurred in Kerr County, including 27 children at Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian summer camp near the banks of the Guadalupe, authorities said.",
      "Ten girls and a counselor from Camp Mystic remained unaccounted for on Monday as search-and-rescue efforts stretched into their fourth day.",
      "Since the catastrophe, local officials have faced questions about how warnings were sent out to the community, why evacuations weren't ordered in low-lying areas and why there were no audible warning systems to alert campers along the Guadalupe.",
      "\"There should have been sirens here,\" Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told Fox News on Monday, adding that the subject will likely come up in a special session of the state legislature to analyze what occurred during the flooding.",
      "Patrick added, \"Had we had sirens around this area, up and down -- the same type of sirens they have in Israel when there's an attack coming, that would have blown very loudly -- it's possible that would have saved some of these lives.\"",
      "'I've spent hours in those helicopters pulling kids out of trees'",
      "Records reviewed by ABC News show that many of the same questions have been under discussion, specifically in Kerr County, for nearly a decade.",
      "The minutes from a March 28, 2016, meeting of the Kerr County Commissioners' Court, show that former Kerr County Sheriff Rusty Hierholzer pushed the commission to upgrade the county's flood-warning system. At the time, Hierholzer told the commission that he was in favor of placing high-decibel outdoor sirens along the river that could go off and be heard from a distance of 3 miles when water gauges indicated flooding, according to the online minutes of the meeting.",
      "According to the meeting minutes, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, then-Commissioner Tom Moser said there are state-of-the-art warning systems, including those with sirens, in other parts of the state, \"even though this [Kerr County] is probably one of the highest flood-prone regions in the entire state.\"",
      "Hierholzer told the commission that the sirens, in addition to the county's CodeRED emergency notification system, would work to quickly spread the word of imminent danger, according to the meeting minutes.",
      "In that meeting, according to the minutes, Hierholzer raised what he called the \"most important\" issue -- that of warning the summer camps along the Guadalupe, recalling a 1987 flash flood in which 10 children from the Pot O' Gold Ranch Christian camp in Comfort, Texas, were killed attempting to evacuate the camp in a bus.",
      "\"I've spent hours in those helicopters pulling kids out of trees,\" Hierholzer told the commission, according to the meeting minutes.",
      "At the time, Hierholzer added that a lot of people in the county were not signed up for CodeRED alerts and that it was difficult to get people to sign up for the phone alerts.",
      "\"So yes, you need both. You need the sirens, and you need CodeRED to try to make sure we'll notify everybody we can when it's coming up,\" Hierholzer said, according to the meeting minutes.",
      "Moser, according to the meeting minutes, told his fellow commissioners that upgrading the warning system to include sirens was \"not hugely expensive,\" adding that the units would cost around $40,000 each.",
      "The Kerr County Commissioners' Court applied for a nearly $1 million FEMA grant, according to the meeting minutes. The county's application was not selected, but it was not immediately clear why.",
      "Moser could not be reached for comment by ABC News on Monday. He told The Wall Street Journal on Sunday that the county considered paying for the upgrade of its flood warning system, but eventually decided not to include it in its annual budget.",
      "\"It was probably just, I hate to say the word, priorities. Trying not to raise taxes,\" Moser told the newspaper.",
      "Reached by ABC News by phone on Monday, Hierholzer declined to comment on the statements he made to the commissioners more than nine years ago.",
      "\"This is probably one of the worst disasters Kerr County has ever seen. So right now, I don\u2019t want to get into all this kind of political stuff -- what we could've, would've, should've done,\" Hierholzer told ABC News.",
      "Officials concede they were caught off guard",
      "Kerr County officials said during a news conference on Saturday that they were caught off guard by the torrential rains that caused the Guadalupe River to rise to near-historic levels in a matter of minutes.",
      "\"We didn't know this flood was coming,\" Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said. \"We have floods all the time. This is the most dangerous river valley in the United States, and we deal with floods on a regular basis. When it rains, we get water. We had no reason to believe that this was going to be anything like what's happened here, none whatsoever.\"",
      "But during a news conference on Sunday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said the state began preparing for the storm last Wednesday by pre-positioning assets and resources in flood-prone areas of the state, including Kerr County.",
      "Chief W. Nim Kidd of the Texas Division of Emergency Management said alerts were also sent out.",
      "\"From a technical perspective, there were multiple warning systems that are out there, and all of us can choose to sign up for warning systems in certain areas depending on the local government that they're in and the way their system works,\" Kidd said during the governor's press conference. But he added that some places have spotty cell phone reception.",
      "Kidd added, \"There can be all kinds of alert systems that are sent, and we know that some general messaging was sent early, some urgent warnings were sent at various times. But just sending the message is not the same as receiving the message, having a plan to do something when you receive the message and then the ability to implement that plan.\"",
      "During a news conference on Monday, Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said staff at some of the summer camps on the Guadalupe were monitoring the rising river at 3:30 a.m. on the day of the flood and managed to move campers to higher ground.",
      "Asked by reporters why mandatory evacuations were not issued by the city or county, Rice said, \"Evacuations are a delicate balance because if you evacuate too late, you then risk putting buses, or cars, or vehicles, or campers on roads ... trying to get them out, which can make it more challenging because these flash floods happen very quickly.\"",
      "When pressed on why evacuations were not announced far in advance of the storm, Rice added, \"It's like disasters in Texas everywhere -- it's very tough to make those calls because what we also don't want to do is cry wolf.\"",

      "The government has been steadily expanding visa-free entry in a bid to boost tourism, the economy and its soft power. More than 20 million foreign visitors entered without a visa in 2024 \u2014 almost one-third of the total and more than double from the previous year, according to the National Immigration Administration.",

      "Philadelphia faces mounting trash and tension as a strike by many of the city's blue-collar workers enters its eighth day",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- As trash and tempers heat up across Philadelphia on Day 8 of a strike by blue-collar city workers Tuesday, some residents and small business owners are hiring pop-up hauling services to clear their blocks of garbage, even as they broadly support the union\u2019s quest for higher pay.",
      "Mayor Cherelle Parker, a Democrat, is standing firm in her offer of raises of about 3% per year over a three-year contract, which comes on top of a 5% raise she gave as an olive branch to all four major city unions after taking office last year.",
      "\u201cI do believe that the mayor has made a gross mistake,\u201d said Jody Sweitzer, who has watched her East Passyunk neighborhood in South Philadelphia gentrify in her 26 years there, leading to higher rents and less diversity. Sweitzer owns a popular downtown bar called Dirty Frank's.",
      "\u201cForty thousand dollars cannot cut it in Philadelphia, you know,\" she said, referring to striking workers' pay. \"You can barely rent an apartment with that kind of money. So I feel as a resident of Philadelphia that she\u2019s doing injustice to those (workers) who actually live here.\u201d",
      "The strike by District Council 33 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees involves nearly 10,000 workers, although judges have sided with the city in ordering some critical employees back to work at the city's 911 centers, water department and airport. Judges have also decreed a temporary halt on evictions.",
      "The two sides have met only intermittently since the strike began, but there was hope they would return to the bargaining table on Tuesday. In the summer of 1986, a citywide trash strike went on for three weeks, leaving 45,000 tons of rotting garbage in the streets.",
      "Terrill Haigler, 35, a former sanitation worker who now does private hauling under the handle \u201cYa Fav Trashman,\" said tension across the city was heating up Tuesday along with the 94-degree (34.4-degree Celsius) temperature.",
      "\u201cIt's like Gotham City with water ice,\u201d he said, referencing a local treat that is famously mispronounced \u201cwooder ice\u201d by natives.",
      "\u201cWe support District Council 33 100%,\u201d Haigler said. \u201cThey deserve everything that they\u2019re asking for, but we also have to think about the residents on the other side. There are some people \u2014 elderly, mothers who have children \u2014 who can\u2019t let the trash sit for five, six, seven and eight days.\u201d",
      "A shop owner on Sweitzer's street hired Haigler to clear the block Tuesday. In turn, he hired two teenagers to help him while he drove a rental truck down the narrow, one-way street that ends at Pat\u2019s King of Steaks.",
      "\u201dOur goal is to hopefully relieve some of that tension by cleaning as many blocks as we can, picking up as much trash as we can for customers, just to give some ease and some peace,\" Haigler said.",
      "The city has designated about 60 sites as drop-off centers for residential trash, but some are overflowing, while striking workers on hand ask residents not to cross the picket line. Most libraries across the city are also closed, with support workers and security guards off the job.",
      "While Sweitzer hoped the strike would encourage more people to cut down on their trash through composting, city officials said other residents were taking advantage of the situation and discarding mattresses and other bulk items. Offenders in the city's northeast even put out rotten chicken and cooking oil. The chicken tossers were arrested and face $5,000 fines, according to Carlton Williams, director of the city's Office of Clean and Green Initiatives.",
      "\u201cThis is not a free pass for illegal dumping around the city of Philadelphia,\u201d Williams said Monday.",

      "New York City\u2019s police commissioner has declined to fire a police officer who shot and killed a man during a traffic stop",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City's police commissioner has declined to fire a police officer who shot and killed a man during a traffic stop, rejecting a recommendation from an administrative judge. The dead man's family is protesting the decision.",
      "Lt. Jonathan Rivera shot and killed 31-year-old Allan Feliz because he believed Feliz was about to run over another responding officer with his vehicle, Commissioner Jessica Tisch's written decision said.",
      "Tisch said Rivera, who was a sergeant at the time, made a \u201cfair and realistic assessment of an incredibly fast-moving, dangerous situation\u201d in which he was \u201crequired to make a split-second decision when he believed that his fellow officer\u2019s life was at immediate risk.\u201d",
      "Tisch\u2019s ruling, issued late Thursday before the July 4 holiday weekend, goes against the determination of Rosemarie Maldonado, the department's deputy commissioner of trials, who found Rivera guilty in February of excessive force and recommended his termination.",
      "The shooting happened around 3 p.m. on Oct. 17, 2019, when an officer said he spotted Feliz driving in an SUV without his seatbelt on. Responding officers ran his driver's license information and found several open warrants for relatively minor infractions, including littering, spitting and disorderly conduct.",
      "Feliz then tried to drive away, prompting a struggle in which Rivera first shot him with a Taser and then with his firearm.",
      "Tisch said her decision is consistent with the 2020 conclusion of a separate inquiry by state Attorney General Letitia James' office, which declined to prosecute Rivera, saying the evidence \u201cstrongly suggests\u201d the shooting was justified.",
      "The police officer's union representing Rivera praised Tisch's decision as \u201cbased on the facts and the law\u201d and \u201cnot because it was politically safe or expedient.\u201d",
      "Feliz's family and supporters, however, planned to rally outside police headquarters in lower Manhattan on Tuesday evening to denounce the commissioner's decision. A family statement says they are \u201cfurious and devastated by Commissioner Tisch\u2019s outrageous, cowardly and shameful decision\" not to fire or even discipline Rivera.",
      "Rally organizers said the city's Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent police oversight agency, has until Friday to respond to Tisch\u2019s decision before it becomes final. The board didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",

      "A Minnesota state senator who was shot nine times during an attack in June has been moved to a rehabilitation facility",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman, who was shot nine times by a gunman posing as a police officer who authorities say went on to kill another lawmaker, is out of the hospital and is now recovering in a transitional care unit, his family said.",
      "\u201cJohn has been moved to a rehab facility, but still has a long road to recovery ahead,\u201d the family said in a statement Monday night.",
      "The family released a photo showing a smiling Hoffman giving a thumbs-up while standing with a suitcase on rollers, ready to leave the hospital.",
      "Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were awakened around 2 a.m. on June 14 by a man pounding on the door of their home in the Minneapolis suburb of Champlin who said he was a police officer. According to an FBI agent's affidavit, security video showed the suspect, Vance Boelter, at the door wearing a black tactical vest and holding a flashlight. He was wearing a flesh-colored mask that covered his entire head.",
      "Yvette Hoffman told investigators they opened the door, and when they spotted the mask, they realized that the man was not a police officer. He then said something like \u201cthis is a robbery.\u201d The senator then lunged at the gunman and was shot nine times. Yvette Hoffman was hit eight times before she could shut the door. Their adult daughter, Hope, was there but was not injured and called 911.",
      "Boelter is accused of going to the homes of two other lawmakers in a vehicle altered to resemble a squad car, without making contact with them, before going to the home of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in nearby Brooklyn Park. He allegedly killed both of them and wounded their dog so seriously that he had to be euthanized.",
      "The chief federal prosecutor for Minnesota has called the lawmaker's killing an assassination.",
      "Yvette Hoffman was released from the hospital a few days after the attacks. Former President Joe Biden visited the senator in the hospital when he was in town for the Hortmans' funeral.",
      "Boelter, who remains jailed without bail, is charged in federal and state court with murder and attempted murder. At a hearing Thursday, Boelter said he was \u201clooking forward to the facts about the 14th coming out.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have declined to speculate on a motive. Friends have described him as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views.",
      "It will be up to Attorney General Pam Bondi to decide whether to seek the federal death penalty. Minnesota abolished its state death penalty in 1911.",

      "A federal judge ruled Monday dismissed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for rescinding nearly $800 million dollars in grants for programs supporting violence reduction and crime victims",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge has allowed the Trump administration to rescind nearly $800 million dollars in grants for programs supporting violence reduction and crime victims.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington on Monday denied a preliminary injunction sought by five organizations on behalf of all recipients of the more than 360 grant awards, and granted a motion by the federal government to dismiss the case. Mehta called the Department of Justice's actions \u201cshameful,\u201d but said the court lacked jurisdiction and the organizations had failed to state a constitutional violation or protection.",
      "\u201cDefendants\u2019 rescinding of these awards is shameful. It is likely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence,\u201d Mehta wrote in his ruling. \u201cBut displeasure and sympathy are not enough in a court of law.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department\u2019s Office of Justice Programs cancelled the grants worth more than $800 million in April, saying it had changed its priorities to, among other things, more directly support certain law enforcement operations, combat violent crime and support American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.",
      "A message left seeking comment from Democracy Forward officials was not immediately returned. A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment on the ruling.",
      "The lawsuit filed by the Democracy Forward Foundation and the Perry Law firm argued that the grant terminations did not allow due process to the organizations and lacked sufficient clarity. The lawyers also said the move violated the constitutional separation of powers clause that gives Congress appropriation powers.",
      "Many of the organizations that lost the federal money said the unexpected cancellations mid-stream had meant layoffs, program closures and loss of community partnerships.",
      "The five organizations named as plaintiffs sought class status to represent all affected grant recipients. Attorneys General from at least 18 states and the District of Columbia had filed amicus briefs in support of the action, as well as local governments and prosecuting attorneys- several of whom had lost grants for victims programs, alternatives to prosecution programs or others.",
      "The Justice Department asked Mehta to dismiss the suit, arguing in a court filing that there was \u201cno legal basis for the Court to order DOJ to restore lawfully terminated grants and keep paying for programs that the Executive Branch views as inconsistent with the interests of the United States.\u201d",
      "Noting that it intended to redirect the grant funds, it called the suit a \u201crun-of-the mill contract dispute\u201d and said it belonged in a different court.",

      "Curtis Cochran, who was first elected Swain County sheriff in 2006, retired from the post effective July 1, according to a statement from the county Board of Commissioners. The chief deputy is performing the sheriff's duties while the commissioners decide who will serve out the remainder of Cochran's four-year term through late 2026, the statement said.",
      "Cochran, 72, was charged in state courts with felonious restraint and misdemeanor sexual battery, soliciting prostitution and assault on a female, according to June 27 arrest warrants. The same day, Ashley Hornsby Welch, the district attorney for Swain and six other far western counties, filed a petition seeking to remove Cochran from office for \u201cwillful misconduct and maladministration in office.\"",
      "A Superior Court judge immediately suspended Cochran from office pending a final court ruling. But the removal petition becomes moot with Cochran's retirement. A petition-related hearing set for Monday in adjoining Graham County was canceled, online court data said.",
      "Welch\u2019s removal petition included signed affidavits by two women who allege Cochran made separate unwanted sexual advances on them while he drove on land held by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. The Eastern Band\u2019s reservation, known as Qualla Boundary, is in portions of Swain County.",
      "The county of 14,000 people is about 300 miles (483 kilometers) west of Raleigh and includes much of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park that straddles the Tennessee border.",
      "Cochran was released on bond on the state criminal charges and faces an Aug. 5 court hearing. He is also charged under Eastern Band tribal law with two counts of oppression in office and one count of abusive sexual contact, Cherokee Indian Police Department Chief Carla Neadeau said in a news release.",
      "Cochran\u2019s attorney didn\u2019t respond Monday or Tuesday to a phone message and emails seeking comment and additional details.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted.",
      "The petition alleges that on June 22 one woman \u2014 an Eastern Band member \u2014 flagged down what she believed to be a law enforcement vehicle. She was upset and crying because she and her boyfriend had been fighting verbally, and she accepted an invitation into the SUV from the driver \u2014 whom authorities identified as Cochran \u2014 because she believed it would diffuse the situation, the petition says.",
      "The petition alleges that when Cochran started driving he began touching the woman despite her objections and asked her to perform a sexual act, but she refused. He later pulled the SUV off the road, got out and positioned himself so the woman couldn't get out of vehicle and asked again, according to the petition. Cochran told the woman if \u201cthere was a time that I got in trouble, all I would have to do is say his name and he would help me,\" the woman's affidavit read. She again declined, ultimately was dropped off at her house and contacted tribal police.",
      "The affidavit signed by the other woman said that on June 23 \u2014 soon after being released from the tribal jail \u2014 she accepted a ride from what looked like a government vehicle that she said turned out to be driven by Cochran. She said Cochran starting touching her \u2014 doing so even as she pulled away \u2014 and she ultimately got out of the vehicle.",
      "The FBI and State Bureau of Investigation also participated in the criminal investigation, which included video footage, according to the petition.",
      "Cochran, a Republican, had no law enforcement experience before his first sheriff's election victory, having previously been Swain County's maintenance director.",

      "NEW YORK -- Social justice advocates are creating a queer history archive that celebrates Bayard Rustin, a major organizer in the Civil Rights Movement and key architect of the March on Washington.",
      "The Bayard Rustin Center for Social Justice will launch a digital archive this fall featuring articles, photos, videos, telegrams, speeches, and more tied to Rustin\u2019s work. Sourced from museums, archives, and personal accounts, it\u2019s designed as a central space where others can add their own stories, creating a living historical record.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this hole in our history,\u201d said Robert Martin, the center's founder and chief activist. \u201cAnd there are great resources about Bayard, but they\u2019re all spread out, and none of it has been collected and put together in the way that he deserves, and more importantly, the way the world deserves to see him.\u201d",
      "Rare footage of Rustin speaking at a 1964 New York rally for voting rights marchers who were beaten in Selma, Alabama, was recently uncovered and digitized by Associated Press archivists. Other AP footage shows him addressing a crowd during a 1967 New York City teachers strike.",
      "\u201cWe are here to tell President Johnson that the Black people, the trade union movement, white people of goodwill and the church people \u2014 Negroes first \u2014 put him where he is,\u201d Rustin states at the 1964 rally. \u201cWe will stay in these damn streets until every Negro in the country can vote!\u201d",
      "The legacy of Rustin \u2014 who died in 1987 aged 75 \u2014 reaches far beyond the estimated 250,000 people he rallied to attend the March on Washington in 1963, when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech. Rustin also played a pivotal role behind the scenes, mentoring King and orchestrating the Montgomery bus boycott.",
      "And his influence still guides activism today, reminding younger generations of the power the community holds in driving lasting change through nonviolence, said David J. Johns, a queer Black leader based in Washington, D.C.",
      "\u201cBeing an architect of not just that moment but of the movement, has enabled so many of us to continue to do things that are a direct result of his teaching and sacrifice,\u201d said Johns. He is the CEO and executive director of the National Black Justice Collective, which attributes its advocacy successes in the Black queer space to Rustin\u2019s legacy.",
      "Rustin was born into activism, according to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research & Education Institute. His grandparents, Julia Davis and Janifer Rustin, instilled in him and his 11 siblings the value of nonviolence. His grandmother was a member of the NAACP, so Rustin was surrounded and influenced by leaders including the activist and scholar W.E.B. Du Bois and James Weldon Johnson, who wrote \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing.\u201d",
      "Rustin was expelled from Wilberforce University in 1936 after he organized a strike against racial injustice. He later studied at Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, the nation\u2019s first historically Black college, then moved to New York during the Harlem Renaissance to engage more deeply with political and social activism. He attended the City College of New York and joined the Young Communist League for its stance against segregation.",
      "Rustin was arrested 23 times, including a 1953 conviction in Pasadena, California, for vagrancy and lewd conduct \u2014 charges commonly used then to criminalize LGBTQ+ people. He served 50 days in jail and lost a tooth after being beaten by police. California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a posthumous pardon in 2020, acknowledging Rustin had been subjected to discrimination.",
      "Rustin and figures such as Marsha P. Johnson, a prominent transgender activist during the gay rights movement, continue inspire the LGBTQ+ community because they \u201cwere super intentional and unapologetic in the ways in which they showed up,\u201d Johns said.",
      "\u201cI often think about Bayard and the March on Washington, which he built in record time and in the face of a whole lot of opposition,\u201d Johns said.",
      "Walter Naegle, Rustin's partner and a consultant on projects related to his life and work, said it's important for the queer community to have access to the history of social movements.",
      "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t very much of an LGBTQ+ movement until the early 50s,\u201d said Naegle. \u201cThe African American struggle was a blueprint for what they needed to do and how they needed to organize. And so to have access to all of the Civil Rights history, and especially to Bayard\u2019s work \u2014 because he was really the preeminent organizer \u2014 I think it\u2019s very important for the current movements to have the ability to go back and look at that material.\u201d",
      "Rustin's sexuality and his former association with the Young Communist League forced him to step away as a Civil Rights leader for several years.",
      "In 1960, New York congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. threatened to spread false rumors that Rustin and King were intimately involved, weaponizing widespread homophobia to undermine their cause, according to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute.",
      "But Rustin resumed his work in 1963 as chief organizer of the March on Washington, which became a defining moment in the Civil Rights Movement and paved the way for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.",
      "In 2023, Netflix released the biopic, \u201c Rustin. \u201d Filmmaker and co-writer Julian Breece, who is Black and queer grew up in the \u201990s when, he said, being gay still correlated with the spread of AIDS, leading to shame and isolation. But he learned about Rustin\u2019s impact on the Civil Rights Movement and found a peer to admire.",
      "\u201cSeeing a picture of Rustin with King, who is the opposite of all those things, it let me know there was a degree to which I was being lied to and that there was more for me potentially, if Bayard Rustin could have that kind of impact,\u201d Breece said.",

      "Antle was sentenced to one year and one day behind bars and fined $55,000 on Tuesday, nearly two years after he pleaded guilty to trafficking in exotic animals and money laundering. He pleaded guilty in November 2023.",
      "It was likely the end to the legal dramas that surrounded \"Tiger King,\" the Netflix true crime documentary that captivated a country shut down by COVID-19.",
      "The star, Joe Exotic, is serving a 21-year federal prison sentence for trying to hire two different men to kill the other star, Carole Baskin. Exotic, whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage, was a collector and private zookeeper from Oklahoma and Baskin, runs Big Cat Rescue in Florida.",
      "Antle appeared in the first season with Exotic and Baskin and was the star of the show's third season.",
      "Antle's crimes were unrelated. He laundered money used in a human smuggling scheme because he needed large amounts of cash quickly to buy animals like chimpanzees, lions, tigers, cheetahs and other creatures, Prosecutor Patrick Duggan said. These animals are illegal to sell because they are endangered, and their high prices could encourage poachers to steal them from the wild, Duggan explained.",
      "\u201cHe was knowingly and illegally trading them as part of a black market that drives another black market of poaching and smuggling,\u201d Duggan said in court Tuesday.",
      "Antle's lawyers requested a sentence of just probation or home confinement, saying their client needed to care for the 150 exotic animals that consume 1,000 pounds (454 kilograms) of meat a day at his Myrtle Beach Safari. They said many of the animals only respond to Antle.",
      "About 25 friends and family packed a federal courtroom in Charleston. Several told Judge Joseph Dawson III that Antle was generous and caring. They said he raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to fight poaching and preserve wild habitats for tigers, lions and chimpanzees.",
      "The judge was swayed. Federal guidelines called for about two years in prison, to which prosecutors agreed. But Dawson said, although Antle broke federal law, all the evidence pointed to him caring for animals.",
      "Antle apologized at the end of his sentencing hearing for causing problems for his life's work.",
      "\u201cI made a mistake, I did stupid things,\u201d Antle said, adding, \u201cI hope I'll be able to pull it back together for everybody.\u201d",
      "Antle\u2019s Myrtle Beach Safari was known for charging hundreds or thousands of dollars to let people pet and hold baby animals like lions, tigers and monkeys that were so young they were still being bottle-fed. Customers would pay $200 for five minutes and photos with a baby chimp or $7,000 for a sleepover. Antle would sometimes ride into tours on an elephant.",
      "The zoo remains open by reservation only.",
      "Prosecutors said Antle sold or bought cheetahs, lions, tigers and a chimpanzee without the proper paperwork for a decade. They said he also laundered more than $500,000 so he could quickly get cash to buy more animals.",
      "Antle knows federal law well and was able to avoid prosecution for years, prosecutors said. He would accept a large \u201cdonation\u201d for an animal to his conservation foundation. He would claim to keep the animal in the same state he bought it, but then move it to his Myrtle Beach zoo, prosecutors said.",
      "The FBI was listening to Antle\u2019s phone calls with an informant as he explained a baby chimpanzee could easily cost $200,000. Private zookeepers can charge hundreds of dollars for photos with docile young primates or other animals, but the profit window is only open for a few years before the growing animals can no longer be safely handled.",
      "\u201cI had to get a monkey, but the people won\u2019t take a check. They only take cash. So what do you do?\u201d Antle said according to a transcript of the phone call in court papers.",
      "Antle will have to give up three chimpanzees he bought as part of his plea deal.",
      "Two of Antle's employees have already been sentenced for their roles in his schemes.",
      "Meredith Bybee was given a year of probation for selling a chimpanzee while Andrew \u201cOmar\u201d Sawyer, who prosecutors said helped Antle launder money, was given two years of probation.",
      "Jason Clay, a Texas private zoo owner, pleaded guilty to illegally selling a primate and was sentenced to four months in prison, while charges were dropped against California ranch owner Charles Sammut.",

      "CENTER POINT, Texas -- Justin Rubio awoke in the wee hours to an alert on his phone, thunder, sirens and the thud of helicopter blades \u2014 the beginning of one of the largest rescue operations in Texas history. Rubio was determined to be a part of it.",
      "Even as authorities in Kerr County have repeatedly discouraged civilian volunteers, Rubio and dozens of others went out Monday to search for people still missing after flash flooding tore through the Texas Hill Country over the July Fourth weekend.",
      "The emotions wrapped up in the calamity that killed at least 100 people \u2014 and the urge to help find those still missing \u2014 at times butted up against officials' need for structure and safety as they search over 60 miles (100 kilometers) along the Guadalupe River.",
      "The river grew by the size of a two-story building in less than an hour on Friday. One survivor described a \u201c pitch-black wall of death.\" The flooding decimated shorelines, ripped trees from the ground, tossed and crushed a Ram truck, disappeared buildings and swept through a century-old summer camp packed with kids.",
      "Rubio, who picked through torn tree limbs Monday, said he couldn\u2019t help but pitch in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sad. It eats at your soul, it eats at your heart,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t just sit at home thinking about what's going on out here.\u201d",
      "The outpouring, volunteers say, is a Texas strain of solidarity, and officials have applauded the donations and volunteers in other areas.",
      "When it comes to search and rescue, however, fickle weather and a flash flood warning Sunday afternoon heightened authorities' fears that unorganized volunteers may end up adding to the missing or dead.",
      "On Sunday and Monday, officials began closing more search sites to volunteers, instead directing them to a local Salvation Army.",
      "\u201cWe need focused and coordinated volunteers, not random people just showing up and doing what they do,\u201d Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring Jr. said. \"We remain hopeful every foot, every mile, every bend of the river.\u201d",
      "Some families have been frustrated by the pace, but officials are asking for patience with the breadth of the search area and methodical, no-stone-unturned approach. It\u2019s a sweeping operation with 19 different local and state agencies, drones, dogs, boats and helicopters.",
      "Officials have laid out a grid over the search area. Each segment can reach over a mile (2 kilometers) and takes between one and three hours to search, Dalton Rice, the city manager of Kerrville, said at a news conference Monday morning.",
      "Rice reiterated for volunteers to \u201cstay out of the way\" so that first responders aren't waylaid ensuring that volunteers \u201cdon\u2019t become victims themselves.\u201d",
      "When volunteers were asked by official responders to leave sites in Kerrville, some moved to help search in the unincorporated community of Center Point on Monday, said Cord Shiflet, who'd rallied volunteers through a Facebook post.",
      "On Sunday, Shiflet had falsely claimed on Facebook that two girls had been rescued in a tree days after the flooding, but he said Monday that he had received bad information and apologized.",
      "The mistake caught the attention of U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, who represents the area and urged people to be careful about false news.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to families and it distracts law enforcement,\u201d Roy posted on the social platform X.",
      "At Center Point on Monday, dozens of undeterred volunteers gathered, including Rubio and Bryan Dutton, in the afternoon heat. Dutton, a veteran who said he had friends at an RV camp affected by the floods, had been waiting to get off work to join the droves of residents coming out to assist and provide food.",

      "A federal magistrate judge has recommended that charges proceed against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A federal magistrate judge recommended Monday that the case proceed against a Wisconsin judge who was indicted on allegations that she helped a man who is in the country illegally evade U.S. immigration agents seeking to arrest him in her courthouse.",
      "Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested in April and indicted on federal charges in May. She pleaded not guilty.",
      "The case highlighted a clash between President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and local authorities over the Republican\u2019s sweeping immigration crackdown.",
      "Democrats have accused the Trump administration of trying to make a national example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition.",
      "Dugan filed a motion in May to dismiss the charges against her, saying she was acting in her official capacity as a judge and therefore is immune to prosecution. She argued that the federal government violated Wisconsin\u2019s sovereignty by disrupting a state courtroom and prosecuting a state judge.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph on Monday recommended against dropping the charges. The ultimate decision is up to U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman, who can accept the other judge's recommendation or reject it.",
      "\u201cWe are disappointed in the magistrate judge\u2019s non-binding recommendation, and we will appeal it,\" Dugan attorney Steven Biskupic, a former federal prosecutor, said in a statement. \"This is only one step in what we expect will be a long journey to preserve the independence and integrity of our courts.\u201d",
      "Joseph wrote in her recommendation that while judges have immunity from civil lawsuits seeking monetary damages when engaging in judicial acts, that does not apply to criminal charges like those in this case.",
      "\u201cA judge\u2019s actions, even when done in her official capacity, does not bar criminal prosecution if the actions were done in violation of the criminal law,\u201d Joseph wrote.",
      "Dugan also argued that the prosecution under federal law violated the U.S. Constitution\u2019s separation of powers because it overrides the state of Wisconsin\u2019s ability to administer its courts.",
      "Whether Dugan broke the law as alleged, or she was merely performing her judicial duties as Dugan contends, are questions for a jury to decide and can\u2019t be determined in a motion to dismiss, Joseph said.",
      "Joseph also noted that both sides disagree on facts related to the case, which also can't be resolved in a motion to dismiss.",
      "\u201cIt is important to note that nothing said here speaks to the merits of the allegations against Dugan,\u201d the judge said in the recommendation. \u201cDugan is presumed innocent, and innocent she remains, unless and until the government proves the allegations against her beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury at trial.\u201d",
      "No trial date has been set.",
      "Dugan is charged with concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, and obstruction, which is a felony. Prosecutors say she escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 31, and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back door on April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were in the courthouse seeking to arrest him for being in the country without permanent legal status.",
      "Agents arrested Ruiz outside of the courthouse after a brief foot chase.",
      "Dugan could face up to six years in prison and a $350,000 fine if convicted on both counts.",
      "Her case is similar to one brought during the first Trump administration against a Massachusetts judge, who was accused of helping a man sneak out a courthouse back door to evade a waiting immigration enforcement agent. That case was eventually dismissed.",

      "Dalton Rice, the city manager of Kerrville, said Monday that authorities were reluctant to \u201ccry wolf\u201d and order evacuations, adding that rainfall \u201csignificantly\u201d exceeded the projected amounts.

      "In the 48 hours before the floods, the potential for heavy rains put precautions in motion as the state activated an emergency response plan and moved resources into the central Texas area.",
      "The National Weather Service issued a flash-flood warning at 1:14 a.m. Friday to mobile phones and weather radios, more than three hours before the first reports of flooding at low-water crossings in Kerr County at 4:35 a.m. The warning was updated at 4:03 a.m. to a flash-flood emergency.",
      "The warning included Hunt, the small town that's home to Camp Mystic. Girls who were rescued from the camp have said they were woken up after midnight by strong storms that knocked out power. Bright flashes from lightning strikes showed the river rising rapidly.",

      "The region has known significant tragedy. A 1987 flood after a heavy rain prompted the evacuation of a youth camp in the town of Comfort. A wall of water quickly swamped buses and vans. Ten teenagers died.",
      "Decades later, the Upper Guadalupe River Authority, which manages the river watershed, released a video to YouTube titled \u201cBe Flood Aware 2017.\u201d",

      "The video noted the shallow headwaters with limestone underneath the riverbed.",
      "\u201cIf you get 3 or 4 inches of rain at one time, that can be a real serious problem,\u201d the video warned.",
      "The storm that hit last Friday dumped more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) on the area in three hours. The river rose 26 feet (8 meters) in just 45 minutes.",
      "In January 2017, the Kerr County Commissioners Court unanimously approved an application for a $975,00 grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to develop a flood warning system, according to transcripts of the meeting.",

      "Former President Joe Biden's physician has requested to delay his testimony to the House oversight committee",
      "WASHINGTON -- Former President Joe Biden\u2019s physician has asked to delay his testimony before the House oversight committee this week, citing the need for an agreement that will respect doctor-patient confidentiality rules as part of the investigation into Biden's health in office.",
      "Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor, who served as Biden\u2019s physician at the White House, requested a delay until the end of July or early August \u201cto reach an accommodation that will protect the very substantial privilege and confidentiality interests of Dr. O\u2019Connor and former President Biden,\u201d according to a letter from his lawyer sent to Rep. James Comer of Kentucky on Saturday. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the letter.",
      "A spokesperson for Oversight Republicans said the committee will follow the House\u2019s deposition guidelines, which allow for witnesses to assert privilege on a question-by-question basis, with the committee chair ruling on each claim. But O'Connor is not allowed, in the committee's view, to delay or decline a congressional subpoena due to concerns over questions about potentially privileged information.",
      "The back-and-forth is part of a broader struggle over the scope of the House Republican inquiry into Biden\u2019s age and mental fitness, with serious implications for both politics and policy. Republicans have also claimed that some policies carried out by the White House \u201cautopen\u201d may be invalid if it is proven that Biden was mentally incapacitated for some part of his term.",
      "Biden has strongly denied claims that he was not in a right state of mind at any point while in office, calling the claims \"ridiculous and false.\u201d",
      "The House Oversight Committee first requested O\u2019Connor testify before the committee last July, but the Biden White House blocked his testimony. Comer renewed his request in May and later subpoenaed the doctor in June.",
      "David Schertler, the attorney for O'Connor, in the letter said the committee is refusing to \u201caccommodate to any degree Dr. O'Connor's objections\u201d over protecting privilege. He said the committee's decision was \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201calarming\u201d and warned that it threatened broader principles around medical privacy.",
      "Scherlter said O\u2019Connor could face \u201cserious consequences\" for violating his obligations as a doctor, including losing his medical license.",
      "In a June subpoena of O\u2019Connor, Comer said that claims of physician-patient privilege under the American Medical Association\u2019s code of ethics \u201clack merit\u201d because that code is not part of federal law. He said the committee\u2019s subpoena meets the AMA\u2019s own requirement that physicians must share a patient\u2019s medical information if \u201clegally compelled to disclose the information\u201d or \u201cordered to do so by legally constituted authority.\u201d",
      "Comer has promised that the committee will make all its findings public in a report after the inquiry has finished. He has subpoenaed O'Connor and Anthony Bernal, former chief of staff to former first lady Jill Biden. The committee last month heard voluntary testimony from Neera Tanden, former director of Biden's domestic policy counsel.",
      "The committee has also requested the testimony of nearly a dozen former senior Biden aides, including former White House chiefs of staff Ron Klain and Jeff Zients; former senior advisers Mike Donilon and Anita Dunn; former deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed, former counselor to the president Steve Ricchetti, former deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini and a former assistant to the president, Ashley Williams.",
      "The Trump White House has waived executive privilege, a principle that protects many communications between the president and staff from Congress and the courts, for almost 10 senior former Biden staffers. That move clears the way for those staffers to discuss their conversations with Biden while he was president.",
      "While the privilege can apply to former staffers, the decision of whether to waive it is decided by the sitting administration.",

      "Last month, the Trump administration banned Afghans hoping to resettle in the U.S. permanently and those seeking to come temporarily, with exceptions.",
      "The resolution expresses appreciation to governments hosting Afghan refugees, singling out the two countries that have taken the most: Iran and Pakistan. Shrier also objected to this, accusing Iran of executing Afghans \u201cat an alarming rate without due process\u201d and forcibly conscripting Afghans into its militias.",
      "While the resolution notes improvements in Afghanistan\u2019s overall security situation, it reiterates concern about attacks by al-Qaida and Islamic State militants and their affiliates. It calls upon Afghanistan \"to take active measures to tackle, dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organizations equally and without discrimination.\u201d",
      "The General Assembly also encouraged U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to appoint a coordinator to facilitate \u201ca more coherent, coordinated and structured approach\u201d to its international engagements on Afghanistan.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The government of El Salvador has acknowledged to United Nations investigators that the Trump administration maintains control of the Venezuelan men who were deported from the U.S. to a notorious Salvadoran prison, contradicting public statements by officials in both countries.",
      "The revelation was contained in court filings Monday by lawyers for more than 100 migrants who are seeking to challenge their deportations to El Salvador's mega-prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "The case is among several challenging President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.",
      "\u201cIn this context, the jurisdiction and legal responsibility for these persons lie exclusively with the competent foreign authorities,\u201d Salvadoran officials wrote in response to queries from the unit of the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The U.N. group has been looking into the fate of the men who were sent to El Salvador from the United States in mid-March, even after a U.S. judge had ordered the planes that were carrying them to be turned around.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that it is powerless to return the men, noting that they are beyond the reach of U.S. courts and no longer have access to due process rights or other U.S. constitutional guarantees.",
      "But lawyers for the migrants said the U.N. report shows otherwise.",
      "\u201cEl Salvador has confirmed what we and everyone else understood: it is the United States that controls what happens to the Venezuelans languishing at CECOT. Remarkably the U.S. government didn\u2019t provide this information to us or the court,\u201d American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt said in an email.",

      "The administration in March agreed to pay $6 million for El Salvador to house 300 migrants. The deal sparked immediate controversy when Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to quickly remove men it has accused of being members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is revoking the terrorism designation of a group led by Syria's new president as part of a broader U.S. engagement with the transitional government since the ouster of former leader Bashar Assad late last year.",

      "Earlier Monday, the Federal Register published an advance notice, which said Rubio made the decision on June 23 in consultation with the attorney general and treasury secretary.",
      "The decision had not been previously announced, although it was made as the Trump administration has been moving to ease or end many U.S. sanctions that had been imposed during Assad\u2019s rule.",
      "The step looks to further end Syria's isolation since a lightning rebel offensive ousted the Assad family from decades of rule and give the new government a boost as it tries to rebuild a country shattered by 13 years of civil war.",

      "\u201cI said, \u2018Well, you know, I\u2019m not that surprised. It\u2019s a tough part of the world,\u2019\u201d said Trump, who met with al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia in May. \u201cBut I was very impressed by him. But we took the sanctions off because we want to give them a chance.\u201d",
      "The brief notice offered no details about the revocation of the foreign terrorist organization designation for the al-Nusrah Front, also known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.",
      "Al-Nusrah was originally designated a foreign terrorist organization for its previous affiliation with al-Qaida. In 2017, it split and changed its name to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which the first Trump administration added to the initial designation.",
      "Syria has been improving relations with the United States and other Western countries following the fall of Assad in December in an offensive led by al-Sharaa \u2019s group.",
      "On June 30, seven days after Rubio signed the revocation, Trump inked an executive order ending many U.S. economic sanctions on Syria, following through on a promise he made to al-Sharaa when they met.",
      "\u201cThis FTO revocation is an important step in fulfilling President Trump\u2019s vision of a stable, unified, and peaceful Syria,\" Rubio said in his statement.",
      "Netanyahu, speaking across the table Monday from Trump and Rubio, agreed that the change of leadership in Syria \u201cpresents opportunities for stability, for security and eventually for peace.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to lose by going back to conflict,\" the Israeli leader said. \"And there\u2019s a lot to gain by moving towards peace.\u201d",
      "Trump's executive order did not rescind sanctions imposed on Assad, his top aides, family members and officials who had been determined to have committed human rights abuses or been involved in drug trafficking or part of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program.",
      "It also leaves intact a major set of sanctions passed by Congress targeting anyone doing business with or offering support to Syria\u2019s military, intelligence or other suspect institutions.",
      "While the Trump administration has passed temporary waivers on those sanctions, known as the Caesar Act, they can only be permanently repealed by law.",

      "The health of U.S. children has deteriorated over the past 17 years, with kids today more likely to have obesity, chronic diseases and mental health problems like depression, a new study says.",
      "Much of what researchers found was already known, but the study paints a comprehensive picture by examining various aspects of children\u2019s physical and mental health at the same time.",
      "\u201cThe surprising part of the study wasn\u2019t any with any single statistic; it was that there\u2019s 170 indicators, eight data sources, all showing the same thing: a generalized decline in kids\u2019 health,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Forrest, one of the authors of the study published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has brought children's health to the forefront of the national policy conversation, unveiling in May a much-anticipated \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d report that described kids as undernourished and overmedicated, and raised concerns about their lack of physical activity. But the Trump administration's actions \u2014 including cuts to federal health agencies, Medicaid and scientific research \u2014 are not likely to reverse the trend, according to outside experts who reviewed Monday\u2019s study.",
      "\u201cThe health of kids in America is not as good as it should be, not as good as the other countries, and the current policies of this administration are definitely going to make it worse,\u201d said Dr. Frederick Rivara, a pediatrician and researcher at the Seattle Children's Hospital and UW Medicine in Seattle. He co-authored an editorial accompanying the new study.",
      "Forrest and his colleagues analyzed surveys, electronic health records from 10 pediatric health systems and international mortality statistics. Among their findings:",
      "\u2014 Obesity rates for U.S. children 2-19 years old rose from 17% in 2007-2008 to about 21% in 2021-2023.",
      "\u2014 A U.S. child in 2023 was 15% to 20% more likely than a U.S. child in 2011 to have a chronic condition such as anxiety, depression or sleep apnea, according to data reported by parents and doctors.",
      "\u2014 Annual prevalence rates for 97 chronic conditions recorded by doctors rose from about 40% in 2011 to about 46% in 2023.",
      "\u2014 Early onset of menstruation, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, physical symptoms, depressive symptoms and loneliness also increased among American kids during the study period.",
      "\u2014 American children were around 1.8 times more likely to die than kids in other high-income countries from 2007-2022. Being born premature and sudden unexpected death were much higher among U.S. infants, and firearm-related incidents and motor vehicle crashes were much more common among 1-19-year-old American kids than among those the same age in other countries examined.",
      "The research points to bigger problems with America\u2019s health, said Forrest, who is a pediatrician at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cKids are the canaries in the coal mine,\u201d he said. \u201c When kids\u2019 health changes, it\u2019s because they\u2019re at increased vulnerability, and it reflects what\u2019s happening in society at large.\u201d",
      "The timing of the study, he said, is \u201ccompletely fortuitous.\" Well before the 2024 presidential election, Forrest was working on a book about thriving over the life span and couldn\u2019t find this sort of comprehensive data on children\u2019s health.",
      "The datasets analyzed have some limitations and may not be applicable to the full U.S. population, noted Dr. James Perrin, a pediatrician and spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics, who wasn't involved in the study.",
      "\u201cThe basic finding is true,\u201d he said.",
      "The editorial published alongside the study said while the administration's MAHA movement is bringing welcome attention to chronic diseases, \"it is pursuing other policies that will work against the interests of children.\u201d Those include eliminating injury prevention and maternal health programs, canceling investments in a campaign addressing sudden infant death and \u201cfueling vaccine hesitancy among parents that may lead to a resurgence of deadly vaccine-preventable diseases,\" authors wrote.",
      "Officials from the U.S. Health and Human Services Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Forrest said risks highlighted by the MAHA report, such as eating too much ultra-processed food, are real but miss the complex reality driving trends in children's health.",
      "\u201cWe have to step back and take some lessons from the ecological sustainability community and say: Let\u2019s look at the ecosystem that kids are growing up in. And let\u2019s start on a kind of neighborhood-by-neighborhood, city-by-city basis, examining it,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cThen they were able to reach their toolshed up higher ground, and neighbors throughout the early morning began to show up at their toolshed, and they all rode it out together,\u201d Brown said.",
      "A few miles away, rescuers maneuvering through challenging terrain filled with snakes continued their search for the missing, including 10 girls and a counselor from Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp that sustained massive damage.",

    "summary": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' lawyer says the music mogul got a standing ovation from fellow prisoners when he returned to the federal lockup in Brooklyn after the verdict.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs got a standing ovation from fellow inmates when the music mogul returned to jail after being acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering in his federal trial in New York, providing what his lawyer says might have been the best thing he could do for incarcerated Black men in America.",
      "Combs, 55, was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution, but was acquitted on the most serious charges, which carried potential life-in-prison sentences.",
      "\"They all said: 'We never get to see anyone who beats the government,'\" attorney Marc Agnifilo told The Associated Press in a weekend interview days after the jury reached its verdict.",
      "The music mogul remains jailed at a federal lockup in Brooklyn after his conviction Wednesday on the prostitution-related charges, which could put him in prison for several more years. Any sentence will include credit for time served, which currently amounts to almost 10 months.",
      "After federal agents raided Combs' homes in Los Angeles and the Miami area in March 2024, Agnifilo said he told the \"I'll Be Missing You\" singer to expect to be arrested on sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"I said: 'Maybe it's your fate in life to be the guy who wins,'\" he recalled during a telephone interview briefly interrupted by a jailhouse call from Combs. \"They need to see that someone can win. I think he took that to heart.\"",
      "Blunt trial strategy works",
      "The verdict in Manhattan federal court came after a veteran team of eight defense lawyers led by Agnifilo executed a trial strategy that resonated with jurors. Combs passed lawyers notes during effective cross-examinations of nearly three dozen witnesses over two months, including Combs' ex-employees.",
      "The lawyers told jurors Combs was a jealous domestic abuser with a drug problem who participated in the swinger lifestyle through threesomes involving Combs, his girlfriends and another man.",
      "\"You may think to yourself, wow, he is a really bad boyfriend,\" Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos told jurors in her May opening statement. But that, she said, \"is simply not sex trafficking.\"",
      "Agnifilo said the blunt talk was a \"no brainer.\"",
      "\"The violence was so clear and up front and we knew the government was going to try to confuse the jury into thinking it was part of a sex trafficking effort. So we had to tell the jury what it was so they wouldn't think it was something it wasn't,\" he said.",
      "Combs and his lawyers seemed deflated Tuesday when jurors said they were deadlocked on the racketeering count but had reached a verdict on sex trafficking and lesser prostitution-related charges. A judge ordered them back to deliberate Wednesday.",
      "\"No one knows what to think,\" Agnifilo said. Then he slept on it.",
      "Morning surprise awakes lawyer",
      "\"I wake up at three in the morning and I text Teny and say: \"We have to get a bail application together,\" he recalled. \"It's going to be a good verdict for us but I think he went down on the prostitution counts so let's try to get him out.\"",
      "He said he \"kind of whipped everybody into feeling better\" after concluding jurors would have convicted him of racketeering if they had convicted him of sex trafficking because trafficking was an alleged component of racketeering.",
      "Agnifilo met with Combs before court and Combs entered the courtroom rejuvenated. Smiling, the onetime Catholic schoolboy prayed with family. In less than an hour, the jury matched Agnifilo's prediction.",
      "The seemingly chastened Combs mouthed \"thank you\" to jurors and smiled as family and supporters applauded. After he was escorted from the room, spectators cheered the defense team, a few chanting: \"Dream Team! Dream Team!\" Several lawyers, including Geragos, cried.",
      "\"This was a major victory for the defense and a major loss for the prosecution,\" said Mitchell Epner, a lawyer who worked with Agnifilo as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey over two decades ago. He credited \"a dream team of defense lawyers\" against prosecutors who almost always win.",
      "Agnifilo showcased what would become his trial strategy \u2014 belittling the charges and mocking the investigation that led to them \u2014 last September in arguing unsuccessfully for bail. The case against Combs was what happens when the \"federal government comes into our bedrooms,\" he said.",
      "Lawyers gently questioned most witnesses",
      "During an eight-week trial, Combs' lawyers picked apart the prosecution case with mostly gentle but firm cross-examinations. Combs never testified and his lawyers called no witnesses.",
      "Sarah Krissoff, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan from 2008 to 2021, said Combs' defense team \"had a narrative from the beginning and they did all of it without putting on any witnesses. That's masterful.\"",
      "Ironically, Agnifilo expanded the use of racketeering laws as a federal prosecutor on an organized crime task force in New Jersey two decades ago, using them often to indict street gangs in violence-torn cities.",
      "\"I knew the weak points in the statute,\" he said. \"The statute is very mechanical. If you know how the car works, you know where the fail points are.\"",
      "He said prosecutors had \"dozens of fail points.\"",
      "\"They didn't have a conspiracy, they just didn't,\" he said. \"They basically had Combs' personal life and tried to build racketeering around personal assistants.\"",
      "Some personal assistants, even after viewing videos of Combs beating his longtime girlfriend, Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura, had glowing things to say about Combs on cross examination.",
      "Once freed, Combs likely to reenter domestic abusers program",
      "For Combs, Agnifilo sees a long road ahead once he is freed and resumes work on personal demons, likely reentering a program for domestic batterers that he had just started before his arrest.",
      "\"He's doing OK,\" said Agnifilo, who speaks with him four or five times daily.",
      "He said Combs genuinely desires improvement and \"realizes he has flaws like everyone else that he never worked on.\"",
      "\"He burns hot in all matters. I think what he has come to see is that he has these flaws and there's no amount of fame and no amount of fortune\" that can erase them,\" he said. \"You can't cover them up.\"",
      "For Agnifilo, a final surprise awaited him after Combs' bail was rejected when a man collapsed into violent seizures at the elevators outside the courtroom.",
      "\"I'm like: 'What the hell?'\" recalled the lawyer, who has experience in treating seizures.",
      "Agnifilo straddled him, pulling him onto his side and using a foot to prevent him from rolling backward while a law partner, Jacob Kaplan, put a backpack under the man's head and Agnifilo's daughter took his pulse.",
      "\"We made sure he didn't choke on vomit. It was crazy. I was worried about him,\" he said.",
      "The man was eventually taken away conscious by rescue workers, leaving Agnifilo to ponder a tumultuous day.",
      "\"It was like I was getting punked by God,\" he said.",

    "published": "Sun, 06 Jul 2025 12:16:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Fifty years ago, a monumental movie premiered that forever changed Hollywood. Ben Mankiewicz talks with actors Richard Dreyfuss and Lorraine Gary and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb about filming the Steven Spielberg blockbuster.",
    "story": [
      "At a dock on Martha's Vineyard is the Orca, the boat from \"Jaws.\" It's a replica, of course; the original one sank, weighed down by a five-ton man-eating shark. The guy next to the Orca, however, is the real thing. Of this Orca, Richard Dreyfuss said, \"It's too neat, by far.\"",
      "It's been a while since Dreyfuss was on Martha's Vineyard. He says his memories of making \"Jaws\" are great. But back then, he did everything he could not to be in the movie. \"I turned the film down a couple of times because I was thinking that it was gonna be a bitch to shoot. And I was not wrong!\" he laughed. \"But it was such an adventure. And if you had to pick one word to describe the shoot, it was waiting.\"",
      "Now 77, Dreyfuss remembers the standing around, but he also knows \"Jaws,\" made here on the island in the summer of 1974, turned him into a Hollywood star.",
      "I asked, \"Was there ever a moment where you think, 'We're making one of the greatest outdoor films of all time'?\"",
      "\"No,\" Dreyfuss replied. He was convinced that what they were making was obviously a turkey, \"and this thing was gonna crash and burn.\"",
      "The production was a legendary slog. This was the first Hollywood movie to shoot on the unpredictable open seas of the Atlantic. The mechanical shark rarely worked in salt water, and the budget more than doubled.",
      "But Steven Spielberg, a 27-year-old director making his first big studio picture, turned misfortune into opportunity.",
      "\"Jaws\" became one of the most influential American films of the 20th century, and ushered in the summer blockbuster. Set 50 years ago over the July 4th weekend, the plot, says Dreyfuss, is simple: \"This was the story of three guys against this shark. It was this human thing. And we were really good and we knew it. Wow, a kid getting bitten? And if you remember the beginning of the film, you are terrified before you see the shark.\"",
      "Before the shark brought terror to the big screen, it arrived at the bookstore. In 1974, Peter Benchley's novel became a bestseller. Spielberg read it and immediately wanted to direct the movie version \u2013 though he was unhappy with early drafts. So, he asked a friend, screenwriter Carl Gottlieb, to rip it to shreds.",
      "\"Steven sent it to me with a note on the cover that said, 'Eviscerate it!!'\" Gottlieb said.",
      "Gottlieb wrote a lengthy memo, noting, \"If we do our jobs right, people will feel about going in the water the way they felt about taking a shower after 'Psycho.'\"",
      "They did their jobs, all right, led by those three guys: Actor Robert Shaw as Quint, the hunter with a shark-infested backstory; Roy Scheider, the police chief afraid of the water; and Dreyfuss, who changed his mind about making \"Jaws\" after seeing (and hating) his own performance in the film he'd just made, \"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz.\"",
      "\"I said, 'If I'm not working when this film comes out, I'll never work again,'\" Dreyfuss said. \"And so, I went back to Steven and begged him for the part, and he gave it to me. They had started shooting on April 2; I was cast on the 3rd; my first day of shooting was the 4th; that was the way it all went.\"",
      "Lorraine Gary played Ellen Brody, the police chief's wife. \"I had nothing to lose,\" she said. \"I was getting older. I was 32. That's almost ancient! And it sounded like fun.\"",
      "I asked, \"What about being cast in this sounded like fun to you?\"",
      "\"Going on location to Martha's Vineyard,\" Gary replied. \"I had never been there. Robert Shaw sounded like fun!\"",
      "\"Well, I think I know what that means. But what does that mean?\"",
      "\"You know what it means. And so do you in the audience!\" Gary laughed.",
      "Her experience with Roy Scheider? That was less fun. \"I feel closer to you than I did to the man who played my husband,\" Gary said. \"I think Roy was very protective of his career. I think he was at that point in his career where he hadn't quite made it to being a big-time star. And, perhaps, he thought that I wasn't top drawer enough to be his wife. I never felt a closeness with him. I felt older, and larger. A big head.\"",
      "\"Literally big head?\" I asked.",
      "\"Literally. I mean, he told me, 'Your head is bigger than mine' in the two-shot!\" she laughed.",
      "In addition to writing the script, Gottlieb played newspaperman Harry Meadows. He earned roughly $13,000 for writing and acting in \"Jaws.\" Though he says much of the dark humor was not on the page.",
      "\"We were blessed with a cast that could kind of ad lib in character,\" he said. \"With most actors if you say, 'Ad lib,' it makes their part bigger. But these people were ad libbing relatively selflessly. When I spotted something potentially funny, or if there was humor in something, I would say to Steven, 'I think we got a laugh here if we change the line.'\" And, he said, Spielberg was always responsive to that.",
      "Then there were the delays. As the shooting schedule tripled from 55 days to 159, the actors started to get under each other's skin. Dreyfuss said, \"The thing about Robert Shaw, he knew that he had me psychologically, like, with a little pin through my stomach. And if he said that I couldn't do 25 sit-ups, I couldn't. But I could. And he would say, 'You can't jump off the top of the Orca into the water.' And I couldn't. But I could. He had me!\"",
      "I spoke to Dreyfuss at the Harbor View Hotel, where some of the cast and crew stayed \u2026 and where Oscar-winning editor Verna Fields cut much of the movie. It was also the scene of a \"Jaws\" food fight. Dreyfuss doesn't quite remember who threw the first lobster roll: \"Well, it was either Roy or me.\"",
      "\"Jaws\" surfaced on June 20, 1975. For the first time ever, a movie opened nationwide, and for the first time ever, a movie made more than $100 million.",
      "Asked why it did so well, Gottlieb replied, \"You know, why is the Mona Lisa still a hit? It had that combination of things, any three of which or five of which would've made it a hit. But ['Jaws'] had, like, ten of those.\"",
      "\"Jaws\" changed Hollywood, as well as the lives of everyone associated with it. Steven Spielberg has become the defining director of his generation, and the legacies of Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss are forever linked to this film, a movie that millions of us still think about every single time we stroll toward the ocean.",
      "Dreyfuss said, \"I will never walk from the beach into the water so that the water comes up to my chest. If and when that ever happens, I'll either be dead or in a mental institution. The fact that I can't see what's happening underneath is so real to me, I can't do it.\"",
      "I asked, \"Before 'Jaws' and after 'Jaws'?\"",
      "\"Before 'Jaws,\" I didn't care!\" Dreyfuss replied.",

    "published": "Sun, 06 Jul 2025 10:18:03 -0400",
    "summary": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer's latest book delves into the life, complexities and sardonic humor of a man who remains a vital presence in American culture.",
    "story": [
      "The Mississippi Valley is \"as tranquil and reposeful as dreamland, and has nothing this-worldly about it \u2026 nothing to hang a fret or worry upon.\" It's a beautiful sentiment, and yet it contrasts with the fretful and worried life of the man who wrote those words: Samuel Clemens, known to the world by his pen name, Mark Twain.",
      "Twain died 115 years ago, but his books are still being read, and hotly debated, around the globe. It's quite the legacy for a mischievous boy of modest means raised in Hannibal, Missouri, just steps away from the roaring Mississippi. It was, said Jim Waddell, \"the international highway of 1835.\"",
      "Waddell has portrayed Twain for three decades \u2013 a performance always in demand when Hannibal's streets are filled each spring for the Twain on Main festival. It's a good gig that requires of Waddell a clean white suit. \"You keep the suit white by doing no work!\" Waddell laughed.",
      "Korbin Asbury and Ainsley Ahrens competed against other eighth graders in the town to represent the characters Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher in Hannibal. \"I love meeting the new people, 'cause there's 44 different countries that visited Hannibal last year,\" said Asbury.",
      "Asked if she were surprised that an author who lived more than 100 years ago still seems so relevant today, Ahrens replied, \"I am, but not really, because his words that he said, they still work with us today. They're wise words.\"",
      "Wise words, with more than a touch of humor:",
      "\"Always do right. This will gratify some people, and astonish the rest.\"",
      "\"Reader, suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself.\"",
      "Twain is quoted as having called himself not just an American, but \"the American.\" \"I think that part of the continuing fascination with Mark Twain is that he combines in his person both the best and the worst of our national culture,\" said Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow. He has chronicled the lives of great Americans, perhaps most famously Alexander Hamilton, whose biography spawned the Broadway musical. Chernow's latest book tackles the life of Twain, a figure who has never left the national spotlight.",
      "Twain once wrote, \"Biographies are but the clothes and buttons of the man \u2013 the biography of the man himself cannot be written.\" \"That line was in my head every single day that I worked on this book,\" Chernow laughed. \"I kind of had this image of Mark Twain coming back to life and saying, 'I told you so.'\"",
      "Chernow traces Twain's sardonic humor to the pain in which it was rooted. Although he enjoyed boyhood adventures that would inspire \"Tom Sawyer,\" his father was a failure in business.\u00a0 The fear of poverty, and an anxious pursuit of wealth, would dominate Twain's adult life.",
      "In Hartford, Connecticut, site of Twain's home, Chernow described the sprawling mansion that he had built: \"I see his personality. All the angles and porches and turrets, it's like all of the different sides of his personality. And he always loved conspicuousness, and this is probably the most conspicuous house in the city.\"",
      "I asked, \"Was Mark Twain happy here?\"",
      "\"Not just happy here, it was far and away the happiest 17 years of his life,\" Chernow said. \"It was this idyllic period. He had this large expensive house. He had a rich and gorgeous wife. He had three beautiful and smart daughters. It was really a charmed life.\"",
      "Although Twain became wealthy as a writer and public speaker, he poured his fortune \u2013 and his wife's \u2013 into ill-fated investments. The most notorious was the Paige Compositor, a typesetting machine that Twain was sure would make him millions.",
      "The themes that run through Twain's life and his work \u2013 politics, corruption, money, class, race, get-rich-quick themes \u2013 all seem quite relevant to America today. Chernow said, \"It's a great American story, and I think that there's so many things that he said \u2013 for instance, about politics \u2013 that really resonate today. One line that used to drive him crazy was, 'My country right or wrong.' You know, he said that we should support our country always, and our government when it deserves it.\"",
      "Chernow believes President Trump would be a familiar figure to the humorist, \"to the extent that one of the great stock characters in Mark Twain's fiction is the salesman. You can see it in President Trump. You could see it in so many different figures in American life \u2013 the big talkers, the big shots.\"",
      "It's no small irony that Twain was nothing if not a big shot himself \u2013 a man who craved attention as much as money. But fame also emboldened Twain to speak truth to power, most enduringly through his masterpiece, \"Huckleberry Finn.\"",
      "Chernow said, \"One of the things that I argued in my book was that there was no White author in the late 19th century who engaged more fully, and I think more affectionately, with the Black community than Twain. Now, I had to point out early on, if you read letters that he wrote when he was a teenager, they're full of crude, racist remarks \u2013 and not only about Blacks, seems like just about everybody.\"",
      "By 1884, Twain had published \"Huck Finn,\" which, said Chernow, \"whatever its imperfections, is still, I think, the great anti-slavery novel in the language.\"",
      "For Chernow, Mark Twain is still a vital presence in American life. His words continue to make us think, and almost certainly laugh.",
      "Asked why his works have endured when so many other great authors' books are languishing, Chernow replied, \"I think it's a very, very good question. He likened a fine literature to a wine, and he said, 'My writing is water, but everyone drinks water.'\"",

    "summary": "The feuding Gallagher brothers kicked off a reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales, their first performance since their acrimonious split in 2009.",
    "story": [
      "Oasis ended a 16-year hiatus on Friday with a punchy, powerful trip through one of Britpop's greatest songbooks, kicking off a reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales to a crowd ecstatic for the band's 1990s hits.",
      "And was there brotherly love between the famously feuding Gallagher siblings? Definitely maybe.",
      "Fans traveled to the Welsh capital from around the world for a show that many thought would never happen. Guitarist-songwriter Noel Gallagher and his singer brother Liam, the heart of Oasis, had not performed together since their acrimonious split in 2009.",
      "One fan banner summed it up: \"The great wait is over.\"",
      "After a montage of headlines about the sparring siblings was capped with the words \"the guns have fallen silent,\" Oasis appeared on stage to a deafening roar, opening with the apt \"Hello\" and its refrain of \"it's good to be back.\"",
      "The brothers had a brief hand-in-hand moment but largely kept their distance onstage. Noel, 58, focused on his guitar while a parka-clad Liam, 52, snarled into the microphone with a swagger that has not dimmed in the 31 years since the band released its first album, \"Definitely Maybe.\"",
      "A crowd of more than 60,000 in the Principality Stadium was treated to a well-paced two-hour set that drew heavily on the first album and its 1995 followup, \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory,\" alongside a smattering of later tracks and fan-favorite B-sides.",
      "Song like \"Supersonic,\" \"Roll With It\" and \"Rock 'n' Roll Star\" sounded as thunderous as ever and sparked mass sing-alongs.",
      "\"Put your arms over each other like you love each other,\" a tambourine-clutching Liam exhorted the crowd before launching into \"Cigarettes and Alcohol.\"",
      "There was poignancy on \"Live Forever\" when an image of Liverpool Football Club player Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car crash on Thursday, was projected above the band.",
      "Noel took his turn on lead vocals for several songs, including the touching \"Half the World Away,\" and the show ended with encores featuring some of Oasis' most enduring tracks: \"Don't Look Back in Anger,\" \"Wonderwall\" and \"Champagne Supernova.\" The brothers shared a half-hug as they ended the final song.",
      "Multicolored, sometimes faintly psychedelic projections formed the main technological accoutrement to a show where the focus was squarely on the songs. There was little banter, though Liam paused between songs to check the audience was having a good time.",
      "\"Was it worth the 40,000 pounds you paid for the ticket?\" he quipped at one point, referring to the scramble for seats that saw some fans pay hundreds to see a show.",
      "From the roar of response, it was.",
      "The show in Cardiff kicked off a 19-date Live '25 tour in the U.K. and Ireland. Then come stops in North America, South America, Asia and Australia, ending in Sao Paulo on Nov. 23.",
      "Before the show, the streets around the stadium filled with fans who gathered in groups to sing along to the band's hits and snapped up Oasis-branded bucket hats at 35 pounds ($48) each.",
      "\"It's very, very special \u2014 emotional,\" said 44-year old Rob Maule from Edinburgh, Scotland. \"I'm here with three of my friends, childhood friends, and we used to see Oasis across the country.",
      "\"For us, it's a generational thing. It's a chapter of our lives,\" he said. \"And then the second generation, as people are taking their kids. It's really special.\"",
      "Vicki Moynehan came from Dorchester, in southwest England. She said her life has changed since she bought her ticket almost a year ago.",
      "\"Seven months pregnant \u2014 ain't gonna stop me,\" she said.",
      "Founded in the working-class streets of Manchester, England, in 1991, Oasis was one of the dominant British acts of the 1990s, releasing eight U.K. No. 1 albums.",
      "The band's sound was fueled by sing-along rock choruses and the combustible chemistry between guitarist-songwriter Noel Gallagher \u2014 a Beatles and glam rock-loving musician with a knack for memorable tunes \u2014 and younger brother Liam.",
      "Then and since, the brothers have often traded barbs \u2014 onstage, in the studio and in interviews. Liam once called Noel \"tofu boy,\" while Noel branded his brother \"the angriest man you'll ever meet. He's like a man with a fork in a world of soup.\"",
      "After a backstage bustup at a concert in France in 2009, they long resisted pressure to reunite, even with the promise of a multimillion-dollar payday.",
      "Now they have agreed on a tour that sees hem joined by former Oasis members Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs and Gem Archer on guitar, bassist Andy Bell and drummer Joey Waronker.",
      "The announcement of the U.K. tour in August sparked a ticket-buying frenzy, complete with error messages, hourslong online queues, dashed hopes and anger at prices that surged at the last minute.",
      "The ticketing troubles sparked questions in U.K. Parliament, where Arts Minister Chris Bryant criticized \"practices that see fans of live events blindsided by price hikes.\" Britain's competition regulator has since threatened Ticketmaster \u2014 which sold around 900,000 Oasis tickets \u2014 with legal action.",
      "No plans have been announced for Oasis to record any new music, and the tour is being presented as a one-off.",
      "Music writer John Aizlewood said that it's an opportunity for Oasis to \"tend the legacy\" of the band, and remind people of the power of the Oasis brand.",
      "\"There should be a sense of huge joy and life affirmation about these shows. And I think if they can just play it right, then that can be a massive burnishing of their legacy,\" he said. \"(There is) this enduring love for Oasis \u2014 and love means money.\"",
      "Fans were determined to enjoy the moment.",
      "\"I'm the oldest sibling of four brothers, so I know they'll fall out,\" said Stephen Truscott, from Middlesbrough in northeast England. \"(But) the first night, they're going to have an absolute unbelievable blast. It's going to be the best.\"",

      "\"MLE [Major League Eating] and Nathan's went to great lengths in recent months to accommodate Joey and his management team, agreeing to the appearance fee and allowing Joey to compete in a rival unbranded hot dog eating contest on Labor Day,\" Major League Eating, which sanctions the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, said in a statement at the time. \"For nearly two decades, we have worked under the same basic hot dog exclusivity provisions. However, it seems that Joey and his managers have prioritized a new partnership with a different hot dog brand over our longtime relationship.\"",
      "Chestnut ended up competing against his old rival, Takeru Kobayashi, in a hot dog eating competition that streamed on Netflix on Labor Day last year. Chestnut won that contest, which followed the same rules as the Nathan's competition.",
      "Chestnut has agreed to only endorse Nathan's hot dogs going forward, so he was allowed to return this year.",
      "Who is expected to win the hot dog eating contest?",
      "Chestnut and Sudo are far and away the favorites to win the men's and women's contests, respectively. Chestnut comes in at an enormous -2000 favorite. Bertoletti is +1200, but comes in at +155 in the Winner Without Chestnut market, according to CBS Sports.",
      "Many sportsbooks aren't even offering odds on the women's side due to Sudo's dominance, according to CBS Sports. However, betting expert Matt Severance told CBS Sports the Under 45.5 for Sudo at -105 could be a worthwhile wager.",
      "Check out CBS Sports for a more detailed breakdown of the hot dog eating contest's odds and predictions.",
      "What is the record amount of hot dogs eaten at a hot dog eating contest?",
      "Chestnut holds both the official and unofficial world records for most hot dogs eaten in a competition. He downed 83 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes during his Labor Day competition against Kobayashi, but since that event wasn't sanctioned by Major League Eating, it's not considered official.",
      "The official world record is 76, also set by Chestnut during the 2021 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest.",
      "What are the rules for Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest?",
      "The rules for the hot dog eating contest are fairly simple. Competitors have 10 minutes to eat as many hot dogs and buns as possible. They can break the hot dogs up with their hands and separate them from the buns, but the entire thing, hot dog and bun, has to be swallowed for it to count.",

    "summary": "Michael Madsen apparently went into cardiac arrest and was found unresponsive in his home in Malibu, California, on Thursday morning, according to his manager.",
    "story": [
      "Michael Madsen, the actor known for appearances in several Quentin Tarantino films, including \"Reservoir Dogs,\" \"Kill Bill Vol. 2\" and \"The Hateful Eight,\" has died, his manager told CBS News.\u00a0He was 67.",
      "Madsen apparently went into cardiac arrest and was found unresponsive in his home in Malibu, California, on Thursday morning, manager Ron Smith said.",
      "\"In the last two years Michael Madsen has been doing some incredible work with independent film including upcoming feature films Resurrection Road, Concessions and Cookbook for Southern Housewives, and was really looking forward to this next chapter in his life,\" managers Susan Ferris and Ron Smith and publicist Liz Rodriguez said in a statement.",
      "\"Michael was also preparing to release a new book called Tears For My Father: Outlaw Thoughts and Poems currently being edited. Michael Madsen was one of Hollywood's most iconic actors, who will be missed by many,\" they added.",
      "Originally from Chicago, Madsen appeared in more than 300 movies and TV shows throughout his more than four decades in Hollywood, according to IMDB.",
      "He began his career at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater.",
      "\"I am heartbroken to hear of the passing of old friend Mike Madsen,\" Steppenwolf co-founder Terry Kinney said in a statement. \"Although I knew him years ago, it was very memorable, as he acted in a production of 'Of Mice and Men' which I directed. Michael was a car mechanic when we started rehearsals. He wrote long handwritten letters to me for years about how art saved his life. He was wonderful in that production and you could see his future success from the outset. He will be missed.\"",
      "He is perhaps best known for his role as Mr. Blonde in Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut \"Reservoir Dogs,\" and the iconic scene in which he tortures a police officer while the 1973 Stealers Wheel hit \"Stuck in the Middle with You\" plays in the background.",
      "While usually not playing the lead role, his unmistakable gruff voice made him a memorable presence in smaller roles and even bit parts in films like \"Sin City,\" \"Donnie Brasco\" and \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\"",
      "Madsen has also published several collections of poetry, including \"Burning in Paradise\" and \"Expecting Rain.\"",
      "\"His work reflects the same gritty realism and emotional undercurrent that defines his acting,\" his representatives said in a statement. \"In addition to acting and writing, he is an accomplished photographer and has produced a number of independent projects.\"",
      "During a speech at his handprint ceremony at Los Angeles' famous TCL Chinese Theatre in 2020, Madsen reflected, \"I could have been a bricklayer. I could have been an architect. I could have been a garbageman. I could have been nothing. But I got lucky. I got lucky as an actor.\"",
      "Madsen also referenced \"mistakes\" he had made in his life during that speech, which was mainly addressed to his wife, DeAnna Morgan. Madsen pleaded no contest to a DUI charge in 2019, which had come within 10 years of another DUI charge. He was sentenced to four days in jail and five years probation, CBS News Los Angeles reported.",
      "He received a $500 citation for a misdemeanor after allegedly trespassing on a property in 2022, People reported at the time, which came just a month after his son, Hudson, died by suicide at 26. Two years later, he was arrested on a charge of misdemeanor domestic battery and later released after what his representative said was a \"disagreement between Michael and his wife,\" People reported.",
      "Madsen and Morgan had two other sons, Calvin and Luke. Madsen had two other sons from a previous marriage to Jeannine Bisignano, Max and Christian, both of whom are also actors.",

      "Red Panda \u2014 whose real name is Rong Niu \u2014 spent 11 hours in a Minneapolis hospital, with a pair of Lynx staffers there with her the entire time, agent Patrick Figley said. The Chinese American acrobat was heading home for treatment and recovery, which should take a few months.",
      "\"She is very grateful,\" Figley said. \"Red Panda thanks everyone for all the kind wishes and support. It means the world to her.\"",

    "summary": "The verdict in the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial comes after the high-profile proceedings started in May.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was found guilty Wednesday of transportation to engage in prostitution in his federal trial in New York City, but the music mogul was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.",
      "Combs will remain in detention while he awaits his sentencing. Judge Arun Subramanian said later Wednesday he denied bail because he disagreed with the defense's argument that the crimes shouldn't trigger mandatory detention. Combs will get 10 months credit for time served so far, the judge said, proposing a sentencing date of Oct. 3.",
      "Combs was convicted of two counts of the prostitution-related charge. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Prosecutors said their preliminary calculations indicate Combs should get at least 51 to 63 months imprisonment on the two convictions, or a sentence of roughly four to five years.",
      "How did Sean \"Diddy\" Combs react to the verdict?",
      "As the jury foreperson announced not guilty on the racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charge involving Combs' former girlfriend, Casandra Ventura \u2014 the R&B singer known as Cassie \u2014 Combs put his hand to his face, his fingers resting on his temples.",
      "When he heard the word \"guilty\" for Count 3, the first prostitution-related charge, he was startled. But then \"not guilty\" came for the second sex trafficking count involving another former girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane.\" Combs held hands with attorney Teny Geragos and leaned in to talk to her.",
      "Combs looked at his family and made prayer hands. He nodded as each juror affirmed the verdict, shaking his fists triumphantly under the table. He made prayer hands to the jury, hugged Geragos and smiled. He mouthed \"thank you\" to attorney Marc Agnifilo.",
      "Combs turned to his family, clasped his hands together and appeared to say: \"I'm coming home.\"",
      "He looked toward the reporters in the courtroom and again shook his fist under the table. Combs leaned forward and nodded in agreement at the jury as the judge thanked them. He then put his face in his hands and smiled. Combs made prayer hands and mouthed \"thank you\" to the jurors a number of times. Then he clasped his hands and kept thanking them. He leaned back and tilted his head up, again putting his face in his hands as though in disbelief.",
      "Combs\u00a0kneeled down on the ground, put his hands on his chair and prayed. He and his family erupted in loud applause, cheering loudly and whistling.",
      "Following the decision, Combs' lawyers argued for him to be released from custody immediately and be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. Prosecutors opposed the defense's request and urged Judge Arun Subramanian to keep Combs detained until his sentencing.",
      "Subramanian acknowledged that Combs didn't want to return to a federal detention center in Brooklyn where he'd been in custody since his arrest last September. Combs shook his head no.",
      "The judge asked both the prosecution and defense to submit letters as to why Combs should be released Wednesday or remain detained.",
      "Combs' attorneys proposed in their letter that a million-dollar bond be posted for him and that his travel be restricted to parts of Florida, California, New York and New Jersey. New Jersey and New York were included to accommodate Combs traveling to attend court and meet with his attorneys.",
      "Combs' attorneys also proposed surrendering his passport and undergoing drug testing when required by the court.",
      "Prosecutors proposed that Combs continued to be detained and his bail application be denied.",
      "The developments come after jurors said Tuesday they'd agreed on four of the five counts against Combs but disagreed on racketeering conspiracy. They reached a verdict on all five counts Wednesday morning.",
      "Jurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday. They said they'd reached a partial verdict Tuesday, but Subramanian sent them back to continue deliberating on the remaining count.",
      "What were the charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs?",
      "The grand jury indictment against the 55-year-old Combs, unsealed in September 2024, initially charged the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at a Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",
      "Combs pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "The charges against Combs and each verdict were:",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTYCount 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTYCount 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTYCount 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTYCount 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTY",
      "Count 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "What is the Mann Act?",
      "The prostitution-related charges allege violations of the Mann Act, a law that makes it a federal crime to transport someone across state lines for prostitution.",
      "Before jurors began their deliberations, Subramanian gave them instructions on how to apply the law to the facts presented during the trial. Jurors were told that, in order to find Combs guilty of the prostitution-related charges, prosecutors must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly transported an individual in \"interstate or foreign commerce\" and intended that the individual \"engage in an act of prostitution.\"",
      "Subramanian noted that it wasn't necessary for prosecutors to prove that engaging in prostitution was Combs' sole purpose in transporting a person across a state line or foreign border. However, prosecutors needed to prove that a \"significant or motivating purpose\" of the trip was prostitution.",
      "The charge of racketeering conspiracy requires prosecutors to prove a number of elements: that there was an agreement among two or more people to participate in a pattern of activity that would affect interstate commerce; that the defendant willfully joined it; and that members of the conspiracy committed two or more racketeering acts. The charging document lists a number of alleged racketeering acts, including kidnapping, bribery, sex trafficking and forced labor.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs denied the accusations but chose not to take the stand to testify in his defense. His attorneys did not call any witnesses during the trial, though they did conduct extensive cross-examinations of the government's witnesses. Combs' lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" part of emotional and graphic testimony",
      "The high-profile trial, which started in May, included graphic and emotional testimony from two of Combs' former girlfriends.",
      "Ventura, who spent more than a decade with him, testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura testified that he directed all the encounters, which could last for days, and that she felt forced to participate to make him happy.",
      "Ventura testified that Combs controlled every aspect of her life, and that she often did things out of fear, since physical abuse was \"frequent.\"",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual. During cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Ventura also testified about a 2016 incident which was caught on surveillance video showing Combs beating and kicking her in a California hotel hallway. Combs apologized at the time, saying his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and that he took \"full responsibility\" for his actions.",
      "Ventura testified that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that had turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly reached a settlement with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym \"Jane\" to protect her identity. She told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting up \"hotel nights.\" Jane said she felt pressured and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "In the prosecution's closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik described Combs as \"the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn't take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\"",
      "She said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law,\" Slavik said.",
      "Agnifilo countered by arguing that prosecutors \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes, combining it with recreational drug use and calling it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" Combs' lawyer said.",
      "Jericka  Duncan and \n                                                  \n                      The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Prosecutors previously said their preliminary calculations indicate Combs should get at least 51 to 63 months imprisonment on the two convictions, or a sentence of roughly four to five years. They told the judge Wednesday that Combs is wealthy and capable of fleeing.",
      "Combs has also shown no remorse or regret in abusing his ex-girlfriend \"Jane,\" the prosecution said, adding that the defense's suggestion that Combs slapping Jane while she was in the shower was in self-defense is \"insulting.\"",
      "Combs was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution involving Jane. He was also accused of sex trafficking Jane by force, fraud or coercion, a charge the jury found him not guilty of.",
      "Jane had told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. She testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Combs had drugs and supplies for another act of prostitution in the New York hotel where he stayed \u2014 and also invited Jane to come \u2014 before he was arrested.",
      "Following the seven-week jury trial, Combs' attorneys moved to have him released from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn where he has been held during the trial. They argued that the 55-year-old had been acquitted of the most serious charges and that \"continued detention of Mr. Combs is inappropriate.\"",
      "\"He is a man who's in the process of working on himself. He's been a model prisoner,\" Combs' lawyer told the judge. \"I just think we should trust him\" that he's not going to flee, the defense said.",
      "The defense said Combs should be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. In a filing submitted to the judge on Wednesday, Combs' legal team said he came to New York to surrender because he was \"committed to showing his innocence\" and that Combs should be released pending sentencing.",

      "What is it like to go through IVF?",
      "Costa knows her way around a needle; she's the co-founder and CEO of LexRx, an aesthetic injectables practice with three locations in Boston and one in Nantucket. She's also a mom of two. Her daughter, Capri, is an IVF miracle.",

      "Helping others access IVF",
      "\"They would say, 'Oh, you have an appointment? What are you doing?' I became very transparent and open with my customer base that I was going through IVF treatments in the hopes of having a second child. It really opened the conversation for my patient population to say maybe they were going through it, too. A lot of them shared their fears and anxiety around administering the medication. I had two patients who said, 'I had two rounds fail because I messed up the medications,' and that just kills you because you know the meds are expensive and it's incredibly time-consuming. Their heartbreak really spoke to me,\" Costa said. \"They almost wanted to ask, would I be willing to help with the injections? I do their Botox treatments, I do other services for them.

    "story": [
      "Former NFL player Corey Parchman appeared on \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday to discuss his new book \"IVF Playbook for Men,\" sharing his personal experience with infertility and advocating for greater awareness of male fertility issues.",
      "Parchman, now a real estate developer, wrote the book after struggling to find resources for men going through infertility treatments. At least 30% of infertility cases are related to male factors, yet men are less likely to discuss the issue or seek support.",
      "\"As I went through the process, there was nothing out there for men that were going through the process,\" Parchman said. \"There's a ton of information for women, and it should be, because women carry 99% of the load ... So I wanted to create this book as a resource for men.\"",
      "Parchman and his wife, Elisha, endured five IVF cycles over two-and-a-half years, including multiple miscarriages, before welcoming their son. He described receiving the initial diagnosis of male factor infertility as shocking.",
      "\"I asked the doctor to do a recheck. You're not talking about me, are you?\" Parchman recalled. \"It's a shock because as you grow up you think this is the process of having kids. It's as simple as ABC.'\"",
      "The former athlete said he felt like he was being \"the weakest link on the team,\" and worried he had let his partner down. Throughout the process, he struggled with feeling sidelined during a time when he wanted to be actively involved.",
      "\"I'm a person that's a fixer. I fix things. This situation I had to sit back and put the faith in my doctors and my wife,\" he explained. \"Once you get out of your own way and realize it's not about you, it's about your family, the process becomes easier.\"",
      "Parchman said there's an importance of open communication between partners during fertility treatments. He and his wife created what he called a \"safe space\" where they could express their feelings without judgment.",
      "The book also addresses how to handle well-meaning but often misguided advice from friends and family. Parchman advised giving people grace while recognizing that their suggestions may not be helpful.",
      "\"I had friends tell me, 'Eat three eggs and spin around and jump,'\" he said. \"Thanks for the advice, but I'm listening to the doctors.\"",
      "Beyond becoming a father, Parchman said the IVF journey transformed his understanding of masculinity. He now advocates for men to be more vulnerable and open about their struggles.",
      "\"It's being vulnerable, creating a space to express how you feel with your partner or friends,\" he said. \"I want to speak out and tell men it's okay to speak out about your feelings and thoughts because we all have them.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/beef-prices-record-highs-drought/",
    "published": "Tue, 08 Jul 2025 15:37:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Beef costs around the U.S. surged to a record high in May. What's driving that jump, and are prices likely to ease up?",
    "story": [
      "Soaring U.S. beef prices are hitting consumers in the wallet and raising costs for restaurants.",
      "\"Anybody should be able to afford a burger,\" said Andrew Schnipper, a managing partner at Hamburger America in New York City. \"It's never been an expensive item historically.\"",
      "Yet the restaurant may be forced to raise the price of its burgers, which start at $7.50. \"We're very focused on trying to charge the least amount we feel comfortable doing,\" he added. \"But obviously, if prices go up we have to raise prices.\"",
      "The cost of beef reached $5.98 per pound in May, according to Federal Reserve data \u2014 the highest since the Department of Labor started tracking beef prices in the 1980s. That rise hasn't come overnight. Ground beef costs have increased 45% over the last 10 years, compared with roughly 30% for the overall Consumer Price Index.",
      "Overall food prices have eased since surging during the pandemic, although they're still up nearly 17% since 2022, according to the CBS News price tracker. That means a grocery bill that cost $100 back then would cost around $116.85 as of May (the latest data available).",
      "So what accounts for higher beef prices? The answer largely comes down to simple economics, with demand outstripping supply. That has resulted in higher costs throughout the supply chain, including for meat processing companies, the restaurant industry and consumers.",
      "\"There's plenty of alternative protein sources in terms of pork and poultry, primarily in the U.S., that consumers could turn to that are in abundant supply and relatively cheaper,\" Derrell Peel, a professor in the department of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And yet beef demand has stayed remarkably robust.\"",
      "Shrinking herds and drought",
      "If the rules of supply and demand explain why beef has gotten so prices, other dynamics come into play.",
      "Notably, Americans' enduring appetite for beef has coincided with shrinking cattle herds. The number of beef cattle in 2025, 27.8 million, is the lowest it's been since the 1960s despite the growing U.S. population, Agriculture Department data shows.",
      "Over the last decade, in turn, the decline in cattle supplies has mainly been driven by drought conditions around the U,.S., which reduced the available feedstock and forced many cattle ranchers to sell off their beef cows, Peel said. \"They simply had no choice because of the drought.\"",
      "Most recently, a severe drought started in 2021 and continued through last year, sweeping through the western half of the country.",
      "\"Somewhere during that period, just about every major beef cow-producing area was subject to drought and subject to this sort of forced liquidation,\" Peel said.",
      "Even without the challenge of insufficient rainfall, herds take a long time to grow due to the biology of cattle. Cows can only have one calf at a time, and it takes the longer for them to reach the age for slaughter than other livestock, Peel said.",
      "Other factors driving up beef prices include high grain prices, tariffs and rising interest rates, according to a June\u00a0study\u00a0from NerdWallet, a financial services company.",
      "Will prices cool?",
      "Unfortunately for Americans, beef prices are expected to keep rising for some time. Diminished cattle supplies are likely to drive prices to new record highs in 2026,\u00a0according to projections from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Longer term, Peel expects beef prices to stay high for the next several years as ranchers work on rebuilding their herds.",
      "\"We're going to be in a tight supply situation, in an elevated price situation for next two to three years, probably to the rest of the decade,\" he said.",

      "Despite the modest annual increase, the rise in the share of investor home purchases is more a reflection of how much the housing market has slowed as traditional buyers face growing affordability constraints, according to BatchData.",
      "Housing sales slump",

      "They've remained sluggish so far this year, as many prospective homebuyers have been discouraged by elevated mortgage rates and home prices that have kept climbing, though more slowly.",

      "Of those, mom-and-pop investors, or those who own between 1 and 5 homes, account for 85% of all investor-owned residential properties, while those with between 6 and 10 properties account for another 5%.",
      "Institutional investors that own 1,000 or more homes account for only about 2.2% of all investor-owned homes, the firm said.",
      "And that number could get smaller, amid signs that large institutional investors are scaling back home purchases.",
      "Out of a group of eight of the biggest companies that own and lease single-family houses, including Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent, six sold more homes in the second quarter than they bought, according to data from Parci Labs.",

      "Managers across the U.S. are increasingly outsourcing personnel-related matters to a range of AI tools, despite their not being well-versed in how to use the technology, according to the survey of more than 1,300 people in manager-level positions across different organizations.",
      "The survey found that while one-third of people in charge of employees' career trajectories have no formal training in using AI tools, 65% use it to make work-related decisions. Even more managers appear to be leaning heavily on AI when deciding who to hire, fire or promote, according to the survey. Ninety-four percent of managers said they turn to AI tools when tasked with determining who should be promoted or earn a raise, or even be laid off.",
      "The growing reliance among managers on AI tools for personnel-related decisions is at odds with the notion that these tasks often fall under the purview of human resources departments. But companies are quickly integrating AI into day-to-day operations, and urging workers to use it.",
      "\"The guidance managers are getting from their CEOs over and over again, is that this technology is coming, and you better starting using it,\" Axios Business reporter Erica Pandey told CBS News. \"And a lot of what managers are doing are these critical decisions of hiring and firing, and raises and promotions. So it makes sense that they're starting to wade into the use there.\"",
      "To be sure, there are risks associated with using generative AI to determine who climbs the corporate ladder and who loses their job, especially if those using the technology don't understand it well.",
      "\"AI is only as good as the data you feed it,\" Pandey said. \"A lot of folks don't know how much data you need to give it. And beyond that ... this is a very sensitive decision; it involves someone's life and livelihood. These are decisions that still need human input \u2014 at least a human checking the work.\"",
      "In other words, problems can arise when AI is increasingly determining staffing decisions with little input from human managers.",
      "\"The fact that AI could be in some cases making these decisions start to finish \u2014 you think about a manager just asking ChatGPT, 'Hey, who should I lay off? How many people should I lay off?' That, I think is really scary,\" Pandey said.",
      "Companies could also find themselves exposed to discrimination lawsuits.",
      "\"Report after report has told us that AI is biased. It's as biased as the person using it. So you could see a lot of hairy legal territory for companies,\" Pandey said.",
      "AI could also struggle to make sound personnel decisions when a worker's success is measured qualitatively, versus quantitatively.",

      "President Trump on Monday said the U.S will impose 25% tariffs on goods from South Korea and Japan by Aug. 1, while also threatening to hit a dozen other nations with steep import duties by next month.",
      "Mr. Trump initially\u00a0posted\u00a0two nearly identical letters, addressed to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, on his Truth Social media platform outlining the new tariffs. A 90-day freeze on country-specific U.S. tariffs on dozens of nations, including Japan and South Korea, expires on July 9. That deadline, however, is no longer significant, with Mr. Trump saying on social media that \"tariffs will start being paid on Aug. 1, 2025.\"",
      "\"In other words, all money will be due and payable starting Aug. 1, 2025 \u2014 No extensions will be granted,\" he added.",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday afternoon also announced separate tariffs on an additional 12 trade partners. Myanmar and Laos face a 40% tariff rate, the highest of the new levies the U.S. is threatening to deploy. Thailand and Cambodia face potential tariffs of 36%, while Mr. Trump announced slightly lower tariffs of 35% on both Bangladesh and Serbia.",
      "Indonesia is the lone country facing a possible tariff rate of 32%. Imports from South Africa and Bosnia and Herzegovina will be subject to 30% duties as of Aug.\u00a01, while goods from Malaysia, Kazakhstan and Tunisia will be taxed at 25%, Mr. Trump said in letters posted on Truth Social. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said on Truth Social that more tariff letters \"will be sent today, tomorrow, and for the next short period of time.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a media briefing Monday that Mr. Trump is set to sign an executive order extending the July 9 tariff freeze. The order delays the deadline to \"Aug. 1 so the reciprocal tariff rate, or these new rates that will be provided in this correspondence to these foreign leaders, will be going out the door within the next month,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Leavitt also said Mr. Trump was planning to send tariff letters to \"approximately 12 other countries\" informing them of new U.S. levies on their goods. She did not indicate when the notices will be sent out, but said Mr. Trump will post them on Truth Social \"so you can enjoy them yourself.\"",
      "Trump is also expected to announce more deals with U.S. trade partners before the beginning of August, she said.",
      "Mr. Trump included identical language in each letter informing recipients that the notice \"demonstrates the strength and commitment of our Trading Relationship,\" and that \"we invite you to participate in the extraordinary Economy of the United States.\"",
      "The 25% tariffs on South Korea and Japan are in line with the so-called \"reciprocal\" rates Mr. Trump had announced when he unveiled country-specific duties on April 2. At the time, the Trump administration said it would impose tariffs of 24% and 25% on imports from Japan and South Korea, respectively.",
      "\"If none of these 14 countries manage to seal a preliminary trade deal (and assuming Trump doesn't delay implementation for another month) then the effective tariff rate on U.S. imports would rise from 15.5% to 17.3%,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a report. In 2024, the effective tariff rate on imports was 2.5%, he noted.",
      "25% tariff would bog down trade",
      "Trade policy expert Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that Monday's announcements \"are simply indications that he is making them pay full admission price to access the U.S. market.\"",
      "\"At 25%, it is possible, but challenging, to trade with Japan and Korea. This rate was carefully set at the higher side of the spectrum. In essence trade with the U.S. now is a pay to play proposition for Japan, Korea and likely others to come,\" he said.",
      "Appleton added that the country-specific rates announced Monday do not bode well for other nations looking to strike deals with the U.S., including EU countries, Canada and Switzerland.",
      "Economists warn that wide-ranging U.S. tariffs on trading partners could spark another bout of inflation and hinder economic growth, while global financial markets have heaved at the prospect of significantly higher trading costs.",

    "story": [
      "Stocks sank Monday after President Trump announced a fresh salvo of tariffs\u00a0on more than a dozen countries as he works to rectify what he views as persistent trade imbalances.",
      "The S&P 500 as fell 49 points, or 0.8%, to close at 6,230, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 422 points, or 0.9%, to close at 44,406. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 0.9%.",
      "Markets are once again feeling the heat after the president said Monday that he would impose tariffs on 14 countries starting August 1. The countries include Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia South Korea and Tunisia (which all face potential levies of 25%);\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina\u00a0and South Africa (which would be subject to 30% duties); Indonesia (32%); Bangladesh, Serbia (35%); Cambodia, Thailand (36%) and Myanmar and Laos (which face a 40% tariff rate). Mr. Trump posted tariff letters to each of the countries on Truth Social detailing the new levies.",
      "The letters come just days ahead of Wednesday, July 9, when the pause on U.S. reciprocal tariffs had originally been set to expire. The president and his team have been working to strike deals with trading partners over the last 90 days before the deadline. Mr. Trump is now expected to sign an executive order extending the tariff freeze to August 1.",
      "The president also said Sunday that he would impose an additional 10% tariffs against the BRICS bloc of developing nations, which held a summit in Brazil over the weekend.",
      "Stock indexes in Europe ended mostly higher on Monday, while Asian markets closed mostly lower.",
      "The new flurry of trade activity could pose a risk to markets, which have been climbing since April 2, when Mr. Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. The S&P 500 hit a record high in late June, with experts at the time citing favorable trade headlines as one of the main reasons for the turnaround.",

    "published": "Tue, 08 Jul 2025 05:00:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Efforts to decrease alarmingly high rates of suicide among construction workers and prevent burnout in health care workers are in jeopardy.",
    "story": [
      "In Connecticut, construction workers in the Local 478 union who complete addiction treatment are connected with a recovery coach who checks in daily, attends recovery meetings with them, and helps them navigate their return to work for a year.",
      "In Pennsylvania, doctors applying for credentials at Geisinger hospitals are not required to answer intrusive questions about mental health care they've received, reducing the stigma around clinicians seeking treatment.",
      "The workplace is the new ground zero for addressing mental health. That means companies \u2014 employees and supervisors alike \u2014 must confront crises, from addiction to suicide. The two seemingly unrelated initiatives in Connecticut and Pennsylvania have one common factor: They grew out of the work of a little known federal agency called the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.",
      "It's one of the key federal agencies leading workplace mental health efforts, from decreasing alarmingly high rates of suicide among construction workers to addressing burnout and depression among health care workers.",
      "But after gaining considerable traction during the COVID-19 pandemic, that work is now imperiled. The Trump administration has fired a majority of NIOSH staffers and is proposing severe reductions to its budget.",
      "Private industry and nonprofits may be able to fill some of the gap, but they can't match the federal government's resources. And some companies may not prioritize worker well-being above profits.",
      "About 60% of employees worldwide say their job is the chief factor affecting their mental health, according to a survey by human resources consulting company UKG. A 2015 study in Management Science suggests workplace stress causes about 120,000 deaths and accounts for up to 8% of health costs in the U.S. each year.",
      "\"Workplace mental health is one of the most underappreciated yet critical areas we could intervene on,\" said Thomas Cunningham, a former senior behavioral scientist at NIOSH who took a buyout this year. \"We were just starting to get some strong support from all the players involved,\" he said. \"This administration has blown that apart.\"",
      "NIOSH, established in 1970 by the same law that created the better-known Occupational Safety and Health Administration, is charged with producing research that informs workplace safety regulations. It's best known for monitoring black lung disease in coal miners and for testing masks, like the N95s used during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "As part of the mass firing of federal workers this spring, NIOSH was slated to lose upward of 900 employees. After pushback from members of Congress \u2014 primarily over coal miner and first responder safety \u2014 the administration reinstated 328. It's not clear if any rehired workers focus on mental health initiatives.",
      "At least two lawsuits challenging the firings are winding through the courts. Meanwhile, hundreds of NIOSH employees remain on administrative leave, unable to work.",
      "Emily Hilliard, a press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, asserted in a statement that \"the nation's critical public health functions remain intact and effective,\" including support for coal miners and firefighters through NIOSH. \"Improving the mental health of American workers remains a key priority for HHS, and that work is ongoing,\" she wrote.",
      "She did not answer specific questions from KFF Health News about whether any reinstated NIOSH employees lead mental health efforts or who is continuing such work.",
      "Reducing suicides and addiction in construction and mining",
      "Over 5,000 construction workers die by suicide annually \u2014 five times the number who die from work-related injuries, according to the Center for Construction Research and Training. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows miners suffer high rates too. And nearly a fifth of workers in both industries have a substance use disorder, double the rate among all U.S. workers, according to a report from NORC at the University of Chicago and the National Safety Council.",
      "Kyle Zimmer recognized these issues as early as 2010. That's when he started a members' assistance program for the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 478 in Connecticut. He hired a licensed clinician on retainer and developed partnerships with local treatment facilities.",
      "At first, workers pushed back, said Zimmer, who recently retired after 25 years in the union, many as director of health and safety.",
      "Their perception was, \"If I speak up about this issue, I'm going to be blackballed from the industry,\" he said.",
      "But slowly, that changed \u2014 with NIOSH's help, Zimmer said.",
      "The agency developed an approach to worker safety called Total Worker Health, which identifies physical and mental health as critical to occupational safety. It also shifts the focus from how individuals can keep themselves safe to how policies and environments can be changed to keep them safe.",
      "Over decades, the concept spread from research journals and universities to industry conferences, unions, and eventually workers, Zimmer said. People began accepting that mental health was an occupational safety issue, he said. That paved the way for NIOSH's Miner Health Program to develop resources on addiction and for Zimmer to establish the recovery coaching program in Connecticut.",
      "\"We have beat that stigma down by a lot,\" Zimmer said.",
      "Other countries have made more progress on mental health at work, said Sally Spencer-Thomas, co-chair of the International Association for Suicide Prevention's workplace special interest group. But with the growth of the Total Worker Health approach, a 2022 surgeon general report on the topic, and increasing research, the U.S. appeared to finally be catching up. The recent cuts to NIOSH suggest \"we're kind of losing our footing,\" she said.",
      "Last year, Natalie Schwatka, an assistant professor at the Colorado School of Public Health's Center for Health, Work & Environment, received a five-year NIOSH grant to build a toolkit to help leaders in labor-intensive industries, such as construction and mining, strengthen worker safety and mental health.",
      "While many companies connect people to treatment, few focus on preventing mental illness, Schwatka said. NIOSH funding \"allows us to do innovative things that maybe industry wouldn't necessarily start.\"",
      "Her team planned to test the toolkit with eight construction companies in the coming years. But with few NIOSH employees left to process annual renewals, the funds could stop flowing anytime.",
      "The consequence of losing such research is not confined to academia, Zimmer said. \"Workers' health and safety is very much in jeopardy.\"",
      "Health care sector braces for fallout from NIOSH cuts",
      "For a long time, clinicians have had troubling rates of addiction and suicide risk. Just after the height of the pandemic, a NIOSH survey found nearly half of health workers reported feeling burned out and nearly half intended to look for a new job. The agency declared a mental health crisis in that workforce.",
      "NIOSH received $20 million through the American Rescue Plan Act to create a national campaign to improve the mental health of health workers.",
      "The results included a step-by-step guide for hospital leaders to improve systems to support their employees, as well as tips and suggested language for leaders to discuss well-being and for workers to advocate for better policies.",
      "Cunningham, the behavioral scientist who left NIOSH this year, helped lead the effort. He said the goal was to move beyond asking health workers to be resilient or develop meditation skills.",
      "\"We're not saying resilience is bad, but we're trying to emphasize that's not the first thing we need to focus on,\" he said.",
      "Instead, NIOSH suggested eliminating intrusive questions about mental health that weren't relevant to keeping patients safe from hospital credentialing forms and offering workers more input on how their schedules are made.",
      "The agency partnered on this work with the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes' Foundation, named after an emergency medicine doctor who died by suicide during the pandemic. The foundation extended the campaign by helping health systems in four states implement pieces of the guide and learn from one another.",
      "Foundation leaders recently appeared on Capitol Hill with Noah Wyle, who plays an emergency physician on the TV series \"The Pitt,\" to advocate for renewed federal funding for this work.",
      "Corey Feist, foundation CEO and co-founder, said renewing that funding to NIOSH is crucial to get this guide out to all hospitals.",
      "Without those resources, \"it's just going to really delay this transformation of health care that needs to happen,\" he said.",
      "Who can fill the gap?",
      "TJ Lyons, a multidecade construction industry safety professional who has worked at big-name companies such as Gilbane, Turner, and DPR Construction, is confident that workplace mental health will remain a priority despite the NIOSH cuts.",
      "General contractors and project owners have been incorporating budget lines for mental health support for years, he said, sharing an example of a $1 billion project that included a mental health clinician on call for four hours several days a week. Workers would make appointments to sit in their pickup trucks during lunch breaks and talk to her, he said.",
      "Now when these big companies subcontract with smaller firms, they often ask if the subcontractors provide mental health support for workers, Lyons said.",
      "But others are skeptical that industry can replace NIOSH efforts.",
      "Several workplace safety experts said smaller companies lack the means to commission research studies and larger companies may not share the results publicly, as a federal agency would. Nor would they have the same credibility.",
      "\"Private industry is going to provide what the people paying them want to provide,\" said a NIOSH employee and member of the American Federation of Government Employees union, currently on administrative leave, who was granted anonymity for fear of professional retaliation.",
      "Without federal attention on workplace mental health, \"people may leave the workforce,\" she said. \"Workers may die.\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting 988. You can also chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.",
      "For more information about mental health care resources and support, The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) HelpLine can be reached Monday through Friday, 10 a.m.\u201310 p.m. ET, at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264) or email\u00a0info@nami.org.",

    "story": [
      "The European Union expects to find out on Monday whether President Donald Trump will impose punishing tariffs on America's largest trade partner in a move economists have warned would have repercussions for companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "President Trump said on social media this weekend that he would start sending tariff increase letters to countries with which the U.S. does not reach satisfactory trade deals beginning at noon on Monday. Japan and South Korea were the first recipients, with letters from the Trump administration sent to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung on Monday indicating that 25% tariffs on their respective countries will go into effect on August 1.",
      "Trump imposed a 20% import tax on all EU-made products in early April as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the United States has a trade imbalance. Hours after the nation-specific duties took effect, he put them on hold until July 9 at a standard rate of 10% to quiet financial markets and allow time for negotiations.",
      "Expressing displeasure with the EU's stance in trade talks, however, Trump said he would increase the tariff rate for European exports to 50%, which could make everything \u2014 from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals \u2014 much more expensive in the U.S.",
      "The EU's executive commission, which handles trade issues for the bloc's 27-member nations, said its leaders hope to strike a deal with the Trump administration. Without one, the EU said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNN's \"State of the Union\" program on Sunday that \"the EU was very slow in coming to the table\" but that talks were now making \"very good progress.\"",
      "Here are important things to know about trade between the United States and the European Union.",
      "\"Most important\" trade relationship",
      "The European Commission describes the trade between the U.S. and the EU as \"the most important commercial relationship in the world.\"",
      "The value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.",
      "The biggest U.S. export to Europe was crude oil, followed by pharmaceuticals, aircraft, automobiles, and medical and diagnostic equipment.",
      "Europe's biggest exports to the U.S. were pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits.",
      "Trump has complained about the EU's 198 billion-euro trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more stuff from European businesses than the other way around.",
      "However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services.",
      "The U.S. services surplus took the nation's trade deficit with the EU down to 50 billion euros ($59 billion), which represents less than 3% of overall U.S.-EU trade.",
      "Before Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained a generally cooperative trade relationship and low tariff levels on both sides. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU's averaged 1.35% for American products.",
      "Less-friendly posture toward longstanding ally",
      "But the White House has taken a much less friendly posture toward the longstanding U.S. ally since February. Along with the fluctuating tariff rate on European goods Trump has floated, the EU has been subject to his administration's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, and a 25% tax on imported automobiles and parts.",
      "Trump administration officials have raised a slew of issues they want to see addressed, including agricultural barriers such as EU health regulations that include bans on chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef.",
      "Trump has also criticized Europe's value-added taxes, which EU countries levy at the point of sale this year at rates of 17% to 27%. But many economists see VAT as trade-neutral since they apply to domestic goods and services as well as imported ones. Because national governments set the taxes through legislation, the EU has said they aren't on the table during trade negotiations.",
      "\"On the thorny issues of regulations, consumer standards and taxes, the EU and its member states cannot give much ground,\" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Germany's Berenberg bank, said. \"They cannot change the way they run the EU's vast internal market according to U.S. demands, which are often rooted in a faulty understanding of how the EU works.\"",
      "U.S. consumers would likely be hurt most",
      "Economists and companies say higher tariffs will mean higher prices for U.S. consumers on imported goods. Importers must decide how much of the extra tax costs to absorb through lower profits and how much to pass on to customers.",
      "Mercedes-Benz dealers in the U.S. have said they are holding the line on 2025 model year prices \"until further notice.\" The German automaker has a partial tariff shield because it makes 35% of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the U.S. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but the company said it expects prices to undergo \"significant increases\" in coming years.",
      "Simon Hunt, CEO of Italian wine and spirits producer Campari Group, told investment analysts that prices could increase for some products or stay the same depending what rival companies do. If competitors raise prices, the company might decide to hold its prices on Skyy vodka or Aperol aperitif to gain market share, Hunt said.",
      "Trump has argued that making it more difficult for foreign companies to sell in the U.S. is a way to stimulate a revival of American manufacturing. Many companies have dismissed the idea or said it would take years to yield positive economic benefits. However, some corporations have proved willing to shift some production stateside.",
      "France-based luxury group LVMH, whose brands include Tiffany & Co., Luis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon, could move some production to the United States, billionaire CEO Bernaud Arnault said at the company's annual meeting in April.",
      "Arnault, who attended Trump's inauguration, has urged Europe to reach a deal based on reciprocal concessions.",
      "\"If we end up with high tariffs, ... we will be forced to increase our U.S.-based production to avoid tariffs,\" Arnault said. \"And if Europe fails to negotiate intelligently, that will be the consequence for many companies. ... It will be the fault of Brussels, if it comes to that.\"",
      "Some forecasts indicate the U.S. economy would be more at risk if the negotiations fail.",
      "Without a deal, the EU would lose 0.3% of its gross domestic product and U.S. GDP would fall 0.7%, if Trump slaps imported goods from Europe with tariffs of 10% to 25%, according to a research review by Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels.",
      "Given the complexity of some of the issues, the two sides may arrive only at a framework deal before Wednesday's deadline. That would likely leave a 10% base tariff, as well as the auto, steel and aluminum tariffs in place until details of a formal trade agreement are ironed out.",
      "The most likely outcome of the trade talks is that \"the U.S. will agree to deals in which it takes back its worst threats of 'retaliatory' tariffs well beyond 10%,\" Schmieding said. \"However, the road to get there could be rocky.\"",
      "The U.S. offering exemptions for some goods might smooth the path to a deal. The EU could offer to ease some regulations that the White House views as trade barriers.",
      "\"While Trump might be able to sell such an outcome as a 'win' for him, the ultimate victims of his protectionism would, of course, be mostly the U.S. consumers,\" Schmieding said.",

      "\"Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom,\" Musk said on X.",
      "Musk on Friday hinted that his party would be focused on swaying votes in the House and Senate which currently have a razor-thin Republican majority. He said the America Party would focus \"on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts.\"",

      "Musk has not offered any details on exactly what steps he's taken toward the creation of a new political party, a complicated process which would require compliance with the diverse laws in each state as well as federal rules.",
      "Still, Musk's talk of an America Party could reignite investor worries over the fate of the Tesla brand, which was badly damaged after Musk took on a central role in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk in late May announced he would step back from the Trump administration. Now, after a public falling out with Mr. Trump over the budget bill, it seems Musk is injecting himself back into the Washington political scene.",

    "summary": "President Trump pushed to eliminate taxes on Social Security. Does his \"one big, beautiful bill\" deliver?",
    "story": [
      "As Congress was approving President Trump's\u00a0\"big, beautiful bill\" on Thursday, the Social Security Administration touted the legislation by stating that it \"eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries.\"",
      "That claim, which echoes\u00a0previous promises by Mr. Trump to remove taxes on Social Security, may have come as welcome news for the millions of older and disabled people who depend on the program for income. So does the bill deliver? Not entirely.",
      "In a press release, the SSA said that the tax and spending package, which the president is set to sign into law on Friday, \"ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits.\"",
      "That figure draws on a June\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that said 88% of seniors \u2014 or 51.4 million people \u2014 on Social Security will pay no tax on their payments under the measure because their deductions would exceed their taxable benefits. More than 70 million Americans collect Social Security benefits, according to the SSA.",
      "The bill \"includes the largest tax break in American history for our nation's seniors,\" CEA said, adding that \"the deductions ensure that seniors who earned their Social Security through years of hard work get more money back in their pockets.\"",
      "Yet while it's true that the bill offers fresh tax relief for some people on Social Security, it is misleading to suggest that the measure does away with taxes on Social Security benefits, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Rather, the bill offers relief by creating a new \"bonus\" tax deduction for beneficiaries.",
      "\"While the deduction does provide some relief for seniors, it's far from completely repealing the tax on their benefits,\" Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank, told The Associated Press this week ahead of Congress approving the bill.",
      "The Social Security Administration did not respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.",
      "How does the \"big, beautiful bill\" impact Social Security?",
      "The bill doesn't eliminate taxes on Social Security, but rather introduces a temporary deduction that beneficiaries can claim to lower their federal income tax. Notably, that deduction applies to all of a senior's income \u2014 not just to Social Security benefits.",
      "Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS MoneyWatch the bill doesn't change the taxation of Social Security benefits. Eliminating taxes on Social Security under the bill was impossible because of a congressional restriction (dubbed the Byrd Rule\u00a0after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what the Senate can include in a reconciliation bill like the Republican budget measure.",
      "What the bill does do is provide a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older. The tax break is available to people with an adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028.",
      "\"Each spouse can take the deduction, for a total of $12,000, if both are 65-plus,\" AARP explains in its analysis of the budget bill. The deduction phases out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Social Security recipients under 65 and people above the specified income thresholds are ineligible to claim the new tax deduction. It also won't benefit the many low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax because they earn too little.",
      "\"Boosting the amount that you get to write off when you already get to write off everything does not help you at all,\" Kogan said.",
      "The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research group, said in a June\u00a0report\u00a0that exempting Social Security benefits from taxation would not change the after-tax income for the bottom 20% of taxpayers, noting that \"those taxpayers are already exempt from taxation on their Social Security benefits.\"",
      "The biggest beneficiaries of the bill will be higher-income seniors, said Martha Shedden, president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, which focuses on Social Security education.",
      "\"The people who benefit by definition have to be richer, and the people who benefit the most are the richest people, before the tax cut phases out,\" Kogan added.",
      "The tax cut is fully phased out for individuals making $175,000 and for couples making $250,000.",
      "More pressure on Social Security?",
      "Providing a temporary tax deduction is likely to help some Social Security recipients, but it could also worsen the retirement program's fragile financial state, Kogan said. Social Security is on track to\u00a0deplete its trust fund by 2034 if Congress does not take action.",
      "\"We already have a problem of not enough money going into the trust fund. This bill makes even less money go into the trust fund,\" he said.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies fiscal issues, estimates that eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits would lower federal revenue by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase the federal debt by 7%\u00a0 by 2054.",
      "As the debate continues over how to shore up Social Security while offering tax relief to older Americans, one thing is clear, and perhaps politically unpalatable: cutting benefits. According to a AARP-funded survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance released in January, 85% of Americans think benefits should not be reduced, or that they should be increased, even if it means raising taxes on some or all Americans.",
      "\"Virtually all Americans want their Social Security benefits to be preserved and are willing to do what it takes to ensure the program continues to provide meaningful support for future generations,\" said AARP Chief Public Policy Officer Deb Whitman in a statement after the survey was released.",

      "Trade policy expert Barry Appleton, co-director of Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that the country-based levies are akin to membership fees guaranteeing entry into a private club.",
      "\"What's been going on since 'Liberation Day' is Trump has been receiving applications for membership,\" Appleton told CBS MoneyWatch. \"He has countries coming to him with proposals of what they would negotiate in the deal.\"",

      "Appleton added that the U.S. has the ability to charge \"whatever the market will pay, and a lot of countries desperately want access to the U.S.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump is expected to announce which countries will be subject to higher tariffs than the baseline 10% rate currently on all imports to the U.S. Those rates would likely\u00a0go into effect Aug. 1, Mr. Trump said Friday. The president had previously said they would kick in on July 9.",

      "There are three broad outcomes as far as rates go, he added.",
      "\"We have a good, bad, ugly scenario,\" Mulberry said. A 10% tariff rate would be a \"good\" outcome, whereas 20% tariffs would be bad, and anything higher would be considered \"ugly.\"",

A week later, after the financial markets had panicked, his administration suspended for 90 days most of the higher taxes on imports just as they were to take effect, but he kept the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China. Chinese goods are now subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",

Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Trump\u00a0said\u00a0the U.S. would levy 20% tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. from Vietnam, and a 40% tariff on \"any transshipping.\" The president said Vietnam would \"'OPEN THEIR MARKET TO THE UNITED STATES,' meaning that, we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.\"",

      "After narrowly squeaking through the House\u00a0on Thursday, the \"big, beautiful bill\" now heads to the president's desk for his signature. As part of the legislation, workers who rely on tips for a large share of their income, such as waiters, bartenders and hairdressers, will see relief from federal income tax on those tips.",
      "The White House has framed the tax cuts as a win for the working class. But critics such as the Independent Restaurant Coalition have pushed back on that notion, saying the benefits for tipped workers would be temporary and that this apparent tax cut wouldn't help most low-wage workers.",
      "How does \"no tax on tips\" work?",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill creates a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate versions\u00a0of the tax and spending bill vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who benefits?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all will necessarily benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants could\u00a0qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees might not\u00a0despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Jul 2025 11:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump administration faces pressure to clinch more trade deals, with a temporary tariff freeze on dozens of countries set to expire.",
    "story": [
      "A\u00a090-day freeze\u00a0on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, sowing economic uncertainty as the Trump administration works to revamp the terms of global trade.",
      "The stakes for millions of U.S. consumers and businesses are high. Economists warn that the barrage of import duties announced on April 2, which President Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" could trigger another bout of inflation, put smaller companies out of businesses and dent financial markets.",
      "As next week's deadline approaches, the Trump administration has touted new trade agreements with countries including China, the U.K. and\u00a0Vietnam, while the status of other pacts remains under wraps. Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday that the the U.S. is likely to start informing some countries on Friday what tariffs their exports will face. Earlier in the week, he said doesn't plan to extend the July 9 deadline, leaving little time to clinch bilateral deals with dozens of other countries.",
      "Under the April 2 tariffs, imports from some nations would only face a 10% universal tariff, while some Asian nations, such as Cambodia, would also be subject to duties of 49%. If the new tariffs take effect next week, country-specific rates would be added to the baseline 10% charge on all U.S. imports.",
      "That 10% duty has been in effect since early April, while the so-called reciprocal rates have largely been temporarily suspended. Additionally, many goods from Canada and Mexico have been exempted from 25% tariffs under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Chinese goods, which were temporarily subject to levies of as high as 145%, are currently subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "If the U.S. fails to arrange trade deals with some nations by the deadline, country-specific tariffs would take effect after midnight on July 9, substantially hiking duties on billions of dollar in foreign imports from all corners of the globe.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a question about whether it could announce more trade deals by the July 9 deadline.",
      "Kicking the can?",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff\u00a0pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Countries that Trump administration officials see as negotiating in good faith could be given a longer runway, while tariffs are likely to rise on July as scheduled for nations viewed as less compliant, he added.",
      "\"I think countries the administration believes are not bending at the knee or kissing the ring are likely going to face tariff snapbacks,\" Packard said.",
      "Although imposing sharply higher tariffs on dozens of countries could scare some investors and fuel concerns about higher prices in the U.S., extending the tariff freeze would prolong uncertainty for millions of U.S. businesses.",
      "\"The threat of tariffs, and this uncertainty, causes capital to sit on the sidelines. You cannot plan out a year from now if you if you can't even figure out what your costs are going to be in a week,\" Packard said. \"All of that causes uncertainty, and that's the enemy of investment and broader economic growth, which are the kinds of things we want in the economy.\"",
      "3 buckets",
      "Patrick Childress, an international trade police attorney at law firm Holland & Knight, expects the countries subject to higher U.S. tariffs to fall into three different broad categories as the clock strikes on July 9.",
      "First, he thinks \"a modest number\" of trade agreements will be finalized before the deadline. Under the new U.S. deal with Vietnam, for example, Mr. Trump said the country's imports would be subject to levies of 20%, plus a 40% tariff on goods that pass through Vietnam from other countries. In return, Vietnam will allow the U.S. to sell products in the country tariff-free, Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced the framework of what he called a \"breakthrough\"\u00a0deal with the U.K. that includes \"billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports.\" Mr. Trump added that the under the terms of the deal, the U.K. would \"reduce or eliminate\" numerous nontariff barriers. A broad agreement with China has also been reached, according to both nations.",
      "A number of other nations are likely to fall into a second category in which the U.S. keeps a 10% baseline tariff in place as trade talks continue, Childress said.",
      "A third group of U.S. trading partners, having either failed to nail down a trade deal or viewed as uncooperative by American trade officials, will be hit with sharply higher tariffs as of 12:01 a.m. on July 9.",
      "\"We don't know which trading partners will fall into which of the three buckets, or how many trading partners will end up in each of three groups,\" Childress said.",
      "What could happen next",
      "\"If no action is taken by the executive, the higher rates automatically go into effect,\" David Murphy, a customs and trade attorney with law firm GDLSK, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If he makes deals like he's done with the U.K., that pulls them out of the whole mess \u2014 their deal stands. So if he comes up with other deals and announces them before July 9, they are in that bucket as well.\"",
      "Countries that fail to come to terms with the Trump administration face potentially large tariff increases. For example, Mr. Trump has threatened to hit EU members with a 50% flat tariff.",
      "\"If this happens, the EU will likely feel compelled to respond in kind, potentially sparking a full trade war and market instability,\" analysts with investment adviser Gavekal said in a report.",
      "Because trade policy experts don't expect all, or even most, deals to be finalized by Mr. Trump's deadline, uncertainty will likely persist, they say.",
      "\"The most likely outcome seems to be some combination of very limited agreements which would allow the U.S. to grant further extensions without losing face,\" analysts with Capital Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report. \"Indeed, Trump has stated that a longer pause would be 'no big deal'. But given his unpredictability, we wouldn't rule out the possibility that some countries face Liberation Day tariffs from next week.\"",
      "Some experts also think a number of countries are unlikely to fold to U.S. pressure regardless of Mr. Trump's self-imposed deadline. That includes the European Union's 27-member nations, which account for a quarter of all U.S. exports, giving them significant leverage.",
      "Meanwhile, much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda could end up in tatters after the U.S. Court of International Trade in May ruled that most of his tariffs were illegal. Although a federal appeals count in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked, a final ruling is pending.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fireworks-fourth-of-july-4-drone-shows-2025/",
    "published": "Fri, 04 Jul 2025 05:00:03 -0400",
    "summary": "Dozens of cities across the U.S. will host drone shows on the Fourth of July this year, seeing them as preferable to fireworks. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "July 4 celebrations may look different in some cities this year as they swap the crackle of fireworks for synchronized drone displays.",
      "Independence Day drone shows are planned for dozens of cities across the country, from Salt Lake City to Sarasota, Florida. The shows, produced by a variety of vendors, involve hundreds of illuminated drones programmed to carry out choreographed routines set to catchy songs like \"Firework\" by Katy Perry.",
      "Not everyone is on board with the shift from old-school pyrotechnics, but the companies behind the drone shows promise to deliver all the pomp and circumstance of traditional fireworks shows and more, using awe-inspiring displays that capture the spirit of American independence.",
      "Salt Lake City will be hosting a drone show for the third year in a row. Andrew Wittenberg, a spokesperson for the city's mayor's office, said the main reason for adopting the new Fourth of July display was safety. Drone shows reduce the risk of fires and are touted as a more environmentally friendly option than fireworks which can leave behind debris.",
      "\"We're in drought conditions right now,\" Wittenberg said. \"And so it's a matter of practicality over any sort of other preference.\"",
      "Drone shows are also far much quieter than fireworks, making them more inclusive for people with PTSD and dogs, Jana Cunningham, a communications manager at the Salt Lake City Public Lands Department, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The city expects some 7,500 people for this year's show, which will include the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, among other iconic American images, she said.",
      "That said, drone shows are not accident-proof. Last year, a 7-year-old boy suffered severe injuries after a\u00a0drone crashed and fell\u00a0onto his head during a holiday light show in Florida. The incident prompted New York Road Runners to cancel a drone show it had planned for its annual New Year's Eve run in Central Park.",
      "Read on for more details about drone shows and what ignited their popularity.",
      "How do drone shows work?",
      "Drone shows use the remotely controlled mini-aircrafts to create patterns and animated scenes in the night sky. In the case of Sky Elements Drones \u2014 a big player in the industry for movie events (Marvel, Star Wars), sports events (Seattle SeaHawks half-time show) and more \u2014 the displays can involve thousands of drones and span up to 400-feet high and 400-feet wide.",
      "To produce the shows, Rick Boss, CEO of Sky Elements, said that his design team works with clients to create storyboards, and then programs the drones to get them ready for flight.",
      "\"A 300-drone show might take as much as 80 hours of programming just to make sure every drone knows exactly where it's supposed to be, what color it's supposed to be, throughout its flight path,\" Boss said.",
      "During the drone show performance, Sky Elements has a pilot and co-pilot monitoring a computer to make sure everything is running smoothly. Drones are programmed to stay within a \"geofence,\" Boss said, which sets limits on where the devices can fly and turns off their motors if they fly outside the boundaries.",
      "Some cities, like Nashville,Tennessee, have opted to combine drones with traditional firework displays as a way of\u00a0 increasing the wow factor. This year, the capital city is incorporating 400 drones into its Independence Day show.",
      "Sky Elements said it also has permits to load its drone shows with traditional pyrotechinics, giving them the ability to shoot off fireworks directly.",
      "Growing business",
      "Drone shows have exploded in popularity in recent years as Americans search for safer and more environmentally friendly ways to mark major events. Among the biggest adopters are\u00a0Major League Baseball and the Grammy Awards.",
      "Industry revenue is around $338 million, according to a recent\u00a0report from the Rockefeller Institute of Government, a public policy think tank.",
      "Drone shows started to appear pre-pandemic and really picked up around four years ago, according to Boss. \"The demand has just gone through the roof,\" he said.",
      "In fact, the only thing stopping Sky Elements from hosting more shows is a lack of supply, he added. The company has a fleet of 7,000, which may sound like a lot, but is still not nearly enough to keep up with demand. The company's Fourth of July shows are already sold for next year, he said.",
      "\"Bringing back the boom!\"",
      "Not all places are not ready to break up with traditional firework displays quite yet.",
      "Tahoe City and Kings Beach, which both border Lake Tahoe in California, introduced drone displays two years ago, but are now reversing course this year amid pushback from residents. Kristen Guinn, marketing director of a nonprofit group called North Tahoe Community Alliance, said the two towns made the call after a community survey found that 80% of respondents wanted regular fireworks back.",
      "\"After two years of doing a drone show for Fourth of July festivities, the community has spoken loud and clear \u2014 and the Tahoe City Downtown Association is bringing back the boom!\" reads a statement\u00a0on the group's website.",
      "Galveston, Texas, also returned to traditional fireworks in 2023 after switching to drones in 2022, according to the Rockefeller Institute of Government.",

    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 147,000 jobs in June, with the labor market remaining resilient despite slowing economic growth this year. That figure is in line with the average monthly gain of 146,000 over the last year,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Labor Department.",
      "The numbers",
      "Job growth was stronger\u00a0than expected in June. Payroll gains sailed past the 115,000 predicted by economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, down from 4.2% in May and the lowest since February. The jobless rate came in below economist forecasts of 4.3%, according to FactSet.",
      "What it means",
      "June's employment data shows that the labor market remains solid even amid significant uncertainty over U.S. trade and fiscal policy. The upshot is that employers continued to add jobs at a steady pace.",
      "Government employment rose the most in June with 73,000 jobs added, driven by gains in the state and local government education sectors. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 7,000 lost in June. Massive cuts in federal jobs by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, earlier this year have gutted several key agencies. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas says DOGE layoffs have accounted for nearly 287,000 cuts so far this year.",
      "The health care sector added 39,000 jobs.",
      "The Labor Department also revised up its numbers for April and May by a collective 16,000, a further indication the job market remains on solid ground.",
      "While the labor market remains sturdy, economists expect growth to slow in the second half of the year. Federal Chair Jerome Powell has\u00a0said tariffs could start to hobble economic activity and drive up inflation this summer. At a gathering of central bankers in Portugal earlier this week, Powell said\u00a0the Fed has held off lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "What the experts are saying",

      "The healthy level of job growth likely means the Fed will hold off cutting rates at its meeting this month, experts say. At its most recent meeting, the central bank penciled in two rate cuts by year-end, although some economists predict just one.",
      "Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, thinks U.S. inflation stemming from tariffs is likely to peak by the fourth quarter, giving the Fed room to lower rates in December to propel economic growth.",

    "published": "Thu, 03 Jul 2025 16:30:30 -0400",
    "summary": "The budget bill passed by Congress on Thursday pulls the plug on federal tax incentives for electric vehicles.",
    "story": [
      "The massive tax and spending cut bill that Congress passed Thursday ends federal tax incentives for electric vehicles.",
      "Buyers have until Sept. 30 to qualify for the federal tax credits on EVs before they are terminated. But experts say there are still strong financial reasons to consider buying the vehicles even without those incentives.",
      "Before the bill passed, new electric vehicles came with a $7,500 federal tax credit, and used EVs included up to $4,000. Those incentives were originally designed to help make the vehicles more affordable.",
      "According to the latest data from Kelley Blue Book, the average purchase price of a new EV is roughly $9,000 higher in the United States than the average new gas-powered car. Used EVs on average cost $2,000 more than comparable gas cars.",
      "Pricier EVs",
      "Those credits, paired with other incentives in many states, helped bridge that price gap. Without them, Senior Policy Director Ingrid Malmgren of the nonprofit advocacy group Plug In America said they will become unaffordable to many lower- and middle-income Americans.",
      "\"That's really disappointing because ... they're just a really great way to reduce transportation energy cost burden,\" Malmgren said.",
      "The up-front cost of an electric vehicle might be higher, but for those who can afford to consider the lifetime fuel and maintenance savings, Malmgren said the EV is still a good financial and environmental move in every state.",
      "That is because electric vehicles might not be cheaper to buy, but they are cheaper to drive. Malmgren said that even without the federal tax credits, an electric vehicle owner would still come out ahead.",
      "\"Quickly you'll end up paying less than a gas car because it costs much less to fuel, and it needs almost nothing for maintenance,\" Malmgren said.",
      "Malmgren said the point at which an EV driver's savings on fuel and maintenance outweigh the higher initial price varies. It depends on the kind of car and how often they are driven, as well as the cost of gasoline and electricity in an area. She said EV owners pay less in upkeep because the cars typically have fewer moving parts to maintain and require less frequent servicing. There are multiplecalculators online that pinpoint that moment based on some of those criteria.",
      "How much you save",
      "A 2020 study in the academic journal Joule found that the average EV in the U.S. charged with a typical mix of public and private chargers saves the driver $7,700 in fuel costs over a 15-year life span, compared to filling a car with gas.",
      "Savings vary by state. The study found that someone charging a car at home during off-peak hours, deemed as a best-case scenario, could save more than $14,000 over 15 years in Washington, where electricity is relatively affordable. The study said that an EV driver in any state exhibiting typical driving and charging behavior would save money on fuel costs. The study did not account for the car's purchase price, its maintenance cost or associated tax credits.",
      "Manufacturing an electric vehicle typically creates more pollution than making a traditional gas-powered one. But experts say that driving an EV over the long-term is still less polluting than a gas car.",
      "Once they both drive about 15,000 miles (24,000 km) \u2014 slightly more than the average American drives in a year \u2014 the total pollution that has gone into making and driving each type of car has evened out, said Peter Slowik, U.S. Passenger Vehicles Lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation.",
      "Every mile after that widens the gap between the cleaner electric car and the more pollutive gas car. By the end of the car's life, emissions caused by the average EV are roughly half the average gas car, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "Cleaner machine",
      "So unless you buy a new car each year, the EV is the cleaner choice, he said.",
      "\"They are a no-brainer,\" Slowik said. \"Electric vehicles are already inherently so much more efficient.\"",
      "A 2023 analysis by Yale Climate Connections found that electric vehicles are responsible for less carbon dioxide pollution even in areas where the electricity used to charge them comes from coal. An EV in West Virginia, which is one of the most coal-reliant states, still pollutes 31% less than an equivalent gas-powered car, according to the analysis.",
      "Slowik said that is because electric cars are better at translating energy into forward motion. For example, the most popular EVs in the U.S., the Tesla Model Y and the Tesla Model 3, can drive more than 100 miles (161 km) on energy equivalent to what is provided by a gallon of gasoline.",
      "\"If you compare that to a 25-mpg gasoline vehicle, that's already four to five times more efficient,\" Slowik said.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 14:55:26 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is withholding over $6 billion in funding for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction and more.",
    "story": [
      "Day camp providers and schools say the Trump administration's funding freeze could ruin summer for low-income American families and jeopardize some after-school programs next year.",
      "The administration is holding back over $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as it conducts a review to ensure grants are aligned with President Trump's priorities.",
      "The move creates uncertainty for states and schools as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year because they don't know if or when they'll receive the funding. Democrats say the administration is flouting the law by holding back congressionally appropriated money.",
      "Without the funds, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work and may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy, too.",
      "The Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of this funding to run their camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If it's not restored soon, the programming could end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \"If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\" Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs relying on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department didn't provide a timeline and warned that \"decisions have not yet been made\" on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\"The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,\" Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program, which serves more than 1,200 low-income students, if federal funds aren't released. There's no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\"Those hours between after school and 6 o'clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\" Browning said. \"It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\"",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Mr. Trump's 2026 budget proposal called on Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington pressed the Trump administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\"Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they'll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It's the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800 million in limbo, while Texas has over $660 million.",
      "\"Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \"The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump's political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \"put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\" said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\"They're trying to send a message,\" said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \"They don't believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\"",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she'll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\"It's an essential service in our community because we don't have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\" she said.",
      "Sipe said it's particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\"It feels preventable,\" she said, \"and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America's children.\"",
      "Associated Press correction: In a story published July 1 about the Trump administration withholding more than $6 billion for schools, The Associated Press erroneously reported the amount of money in limbo in California and Texas. California has at least $800 million in limbo, not $800,000, and Texas has more than $660 million in limbo, not $660,000. This article has been updated.",

      "Lululemon is suing Costco, accusing the discount retailer of selling \"confusingly similar\" replicas of its jackets, sweatshirts and pants.",
      "In a lawsuit filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the athletic and lifestyle apparel company claims that certain Costco products imitate its own designs so closely that it constitutes \"trade dress\" infringement, which occurs when a product mimics another so closely that it confuses consumers.",
      "The apparel company claims that Costco's \"knockoff\" designs, or product \"dupes,\" violate trademark law because \"some customers incorrectly believe these infringing products are authentic Lululemon apparel.\" In other cases, \"customers specifically purchase the infringing products because they are difficult to distinguish from authentic Lululemon products,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "\"Indeed, one of the purposes of selling 'dupes' is to confuse consumers at the point-of-sale and/or observers post-sale into believing that the 'dupes' are Plaintiffs' authentic products when they are not,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Lululemon refers to itself in the lawsuit as a \"path-breaking\" apparel company that has set a new standard for performance athletic wear, adding that its \"construction techniques\" and \"strategic fits\" help it stand out to consumers. Reached for comment, the Vancouver, Canada-based company said it fiercely defends its products.",
      "\"As an innovation-led company that invests significantly in the research, development and design of our products, we take the responsibility of protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights very seriously and pursue the appropriate legal action when necessary,\" a Lululemon company spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Costco did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "While copycat products can be so poorly constructed and designed that they pose no threat to the originals, Costco's dupes have caused a stir for their verisimilitude to the authentic Lululemon goods. A January headline in The Washington Post\u00a0read, \"Is that hoodie Lululemon or a Costco dupe? No one has to know but you.\" On social media, users post images and videos of Costco athletic-wear products with the hashtag #luludupe or #lululemondupes.",
      "What items does Lululemon say Costco copies?",

    "summary": "The owner of an Oklahoma maker of guitar pedals has had to get creative to absorb higher import costs.",
    "story": [
      "Small businesses facing higher import costs because of steeper U.S. tariffs are having to find different ways of handling the added expense.",
      "Facing hefty tariffs on parts shipped from China, one small business owner took the hit by redeeming over 1.8 million reward points on his American Express card. Robert Keeley, owner of Keeley Electronics, a roughly 33-person guitar pedal company in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, told CBS MoneyWatch he used the points, rather than cash, to cover the tariffs.",
      "That unusual approach, first reported by Bloomberg, highlights the challenges many smaller enterprises are facing in coping with higher import duties.",
      "Keeley's operation makes pedals used to create effects for electric and some acoustic guitars in a 17,000 square-foot warehouse in Oklahoma. But he's been unable to source one of the pedals' key components, a so-called potentiometer from anywhere other than China, leading to ballooning tariff charges.",
      "\"We manufacture and build nearly every part of the pedals in our factory, including the aluminum enclosures and all the circuit boards,\" Keeley told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I really love manufacturing and giving someone a job.\"",
      "Keeley said his team has tried to find a provider of potentiometers, which control voltages, outside of China, but to no avail.",
      "\"We can't find a source outside of China for our potentiometer, which is critical for our designs,\" Keeley said. \"Even when we call companies in Taiwan, they say they get theirs from China.\"",
      "$11,000 credit card bill",
      "Tariffs on the key component have surged since the start of President Trump's second term in January, according to Keeley. His business was on the hook for tariffs of 25% until March, when the duties temporarily shot up to more than 100%. Now the company pays a rate of 55% for potentiometers, he said.",
      "A 90-day freeze on country-based tariffs, including those in place on China, expires on July 9. Keeley is hoping the current rate will come down, but uncertainty lingers. Trade experts also say Mr. Trump could again extend the tariff pause if trade deals are not reached by the deadline.",
      "Keeley's most recent credit card bill, which included shipping and tariff fees, totaled nearly $11,000, according to a copy of the statement viewed by CBS MoneyWatch. Instead of paying cash, Keeley used the credit card points he'd accrued by paying previous tariff charges with plastic.",
      "\"I decided to use my points because I wasn't redeeming them for other things like gift cards. So I thought it would be clever to apply them to my bills for tariffs,\" Keeley said, noting that the charge is only a sliver of his tariff-related cost. \"It sounds like a lot of points, and that gives you a sense of how much I am paying in tariffs.\"",
      "Keeley emphasized he doesn't like depending on China for manufacturing his company's wares, saying that amounts to what he described as a \"single point of failure.\" Although he hasn't yet raised prices for customers to offset the higher costs, the business may have no choice but to do so if stiff tariffs on Chinese imports remain in place, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I want to make sure I am releasing exciting products that the world wants to buy,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If I don't pay attention to what I'm trying to sell and what people want, then I will go out of business. But for now, I am in a stable place.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday lifted a lower court order that blocked sweeping layoffs of federal workers at nearly two dozen agencies while a legal battle over President Trump's plans to drastically cut the size of the government moves forward.",
      "The high court's order clears the way for the Trump administration to resume its efforts to reorganize and scale back the federal government, which has been led by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The Justice Department turned to the Supreme Court for emergency relief after a federal judge in May ordered a halt to the job cuts and enforcement of other orders by DOGE to slash programs or staff.",
      "In a brief unsigned opinion, the Supreme Court said that the injunction issued by the district court was based on its view that Mr. Trump's executive order and directives from the Office of Management and Budget and Office of Personnel Management implementing that action are unlawful.",
      "\"Because the government is likely to succeed on its argument that the executive order and memorandum are lawful \u2014 and because the other factors bearing on whether to grant a stay are satisfied \u2014 we grant the application,\" the court said. \"We express no view on the legality of any agency [reduction-in-force] and reorganization plan produced or approved pursuant to the executive order and memorandum. The district court enjoined further implementation or approval of the plans based on its view about the illegality of the executive order and memorandum, not on any assessment of the plans themselves. Those plans are not before this court.\"",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the court's decision and accused it of demonstrating an \"enthusiasm for greenlighting this president's legally dubious actions in an emergency posture.\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a separate statement that while the president cannot restructure federal agencies in a way that is inconsistent with congressional mandates, the agency plans for reductions-in-force are not yet before the Supreme Court.",
      "\"[W]e thus have no occasion to consider whether they can and will be carried out consistent with the constraints of law,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"I join the court's stay because it leaves the district court free to consider those questions in the first instance.\"",
      "A coalition of labor unions, nonprofit organizations, cities and counties that brought the case said it is disappointed by the Supreme Court's order.",
      "\"Today's decision has dealt a serious blow to our democracy and puts services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy,\" the coalition said in a statement. \"This decision does not change the simple and clear fact that reorganizing government functions and laying off federal workers en masse haphazardly without any congressional approval is not allowed by our Constitution.\"",
      "The legal battle",
      "Mr. Trump began taking steps to shrink the government shortly after he returned to the White House. The president created DOGE, a cost-cutting task force that had been led by Elon Musk, and his administration began taking steps to dismantle agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump issued an executive order directing agencies to make plans to initiate \"large-scale\" reductions-in-force, the government's term for layoffs. On the heels of the president's directive, the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Management of Budget issued a memo directing agencies to submit plans for two phases of job cuts.",
      "Several department heads began executing their workforce cuts earlier this year, with thousands of federal employees losing their jobs. Other federal entities had planned to make significant reductions in the coming weeks and months. The reductions-in-force are separate from the mass terminations of probationary workers, who generally were in their positions for one or two years. But those firings, which took place in February, have also been the focus of lawsuits.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's executive order, labor unions, nonprofit groups and local governments sued nearly every federal agency to block the layoffs, arguing that the executive order exceeded the president's authority and violated the separation of powers. The Department of Education was not part of the unions' suit.",
      "A federal judge in San Francisco agreed to issue a temporary restraining order that prevented the Trump administration from moving forward with its existing reductions-in-force or planning any future layoffs as directed by Mr. Trump. The order also bars administration officials from enforcing any further orders by DOGE to cut programs or staff in connection to the president's executive order.",
      "U.S. District Judge Susan Illston extended that block in May, finding that the president can restructure federal agencies, but only after obtaining approval from Congress. Her injunction applies to 22 federal agencies, including the Cabinet-level Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, and State, among others.",
      "\"Presidents may set policy priorities for the executive branch, and agency heads may implement them. This much is undisputed,\" Illston wrote. \"But Congress creates federal agencies, funds them, and gives them duties that \u2014 by statute \u2014 they must carry out. Agencies may not conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates, and a president may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress.\"",
      "The Trump administration turned to the Supreme Court after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined to lift Illston's order. The appeals court said in a 2-1 decision in late May that Mr. Trump's executive order \"far exceeds\" his supervisory powers under the Constitution.",
      "In arguing for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the district court's order is \"flawed\" and rests on an \"indefensible premise,\" namely that the president needs authorization from Congress to oversee personnel decisions within the executive branch.",
      "\"It interferes with the Executive Branch's internal operations and unquestioned legal authority to plan and carry out RIFs, and does so on a government-wide scale,\" he wrote. \"More concretely, the injunction has brought to a halt numerous in-progress RIFs at more than a dozen federal agencies, sowing confusion about what RIF-related steps agencies may take and compelling the government to retain \u2014 at taxpayer expense \u2014 thousands of employees whose continuance in federal service the agencies deem not to be in the government and public interest.\"",
      "Lawyers for the unions urged the Supreme Court to reject the Trump administration's request for emergency relief and warned that allowing Mr. Trump to move forward with his planned reorganization of the federal government before the merits of the case can be decided would do irreversible damage.",
      "\"[O]ffices, and functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs,\" they wrote. \"There will be no way to unscramble that egg.\"",
      "The unions said that if the injunction remains in place, it would not prevent the president from going to Congress and securing its approval for a reorganization of the government.",

      "Washington \u2014 Congressional leaders are meeting this week with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after some lawmakers accused the Israeli leader of trying to drag the U.S. into another war.",
      "Netanyahu met with House Speaker Mike Johnson Tuesday after meeting earlier in the day with Vice President JD Vance. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, postponed a trip to Israel in June to address the Israeli parliament, known as the Knesset, as war broke out with Iran.",
      "In a statement, Johnson said he and Netanyahu discussed the United States' commitment to Israel's security and a ceasefire agreement in Gaza.",
      "\"America and Israel's strong stand in the 12-Day War dealt a devastating blow to the greatest enemy of peace in the region, leaving the Iranian regime weaker than at any point in decades. We are hopeful that this marks the dawn of a new chapter of peace in the Middle East,\" Johnson said.",
      "Netanyahu's meeting with a bipartisan group of senators was delayed until Wednesday.",
      "Netanyahu's visit to the U.S. Capitol comes as Mr. Trump faces criticism from Democrats and some Republicans over his decision to strike three locations central to Iran's nuclear program last month.",
      "Lawmakers introduced several measures in the Senate and House seeking to restrict Mr. Trump from taking further action against Iran without approval. The Senate voted down a war powers resolution introduced by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, while the other measures have yet to receive a vote.",
      "Netanyahu met with administration officials Monday and had dinner at the White House with the president. Speaking to reporters Monday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that there will be a ceasefire with Hamas soon. And on U.S.-Iran talks, he forecasted that more details would come out Tuesday.",
      "Following his meeting with Johnson on Tuesday afternoon, Netanyahu told reporters that the \"resolute decision of president Trump to act with us against those who seek to destroy Israel and threaten the peace of the world has made a remarkable change in the Middle East.\"",
      "\"There are opportunities for peace that we intend to realize,\" Netanyahu added. \"We're working together on this. We have still to finish the job in Gaza, release all our hostages, eliminate and destroy Hamas' military and governance capabilities because Gaza must have a different future for ours sake, for everyone's sake.\"",
      "Netanyahu said the coordination between the U.S. and Mr. Trump has been \"unmatched.\" The president and prime minister are expected to meet again later in the day.",
      "The meetings come after Johnson postponed a planned trip to Israel last month, where he was scheduled to address Israel's parliament in Jerusalem, amid open warfare between Israel and Iran. It would have been one of a small number of foreign trips he's made since becoming speaker. Johnson met with Netanyahu in Washington in February. During that visit, Netanyahu also met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and a bipartisan group of senators.",
      "The Israeli prime minister addressed a joint meeting of Congress nearly a year ago as he sought to shore up support for Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, while criticizing those who had protested against the conflict.",

    "story": [
      "The Treasury Department has levied sanctions against a North Korean cyber operative and notorious member of Kim Jong Un's military intelligence agency, formally known as the \"Reconnaissance General Bureau.\"",
      "The U.S. has accused Song Kum Hyok of facilitating an IT worker scheme and charges that the member of the \"Andariel\" hacking group recruited North Korean cyber operatives to pose as American remote workers for hire at unwitting companies worldwide. The sprawling scheme, according to the Treasury Department, allowed North Koreans operating in China and Russia to collect paychecks as a way of fundraising for Kim's nuclear missile program. In some cases, North Korean IT workers have gone as far as to plant malware into company networks.",
      "In 2022, Song began choreographing the moneymaking plot that stole personal information of U.S. citizens \u2013 including names, Social Security numbers, and addresses \u2013 in order to create aliases for the hired foreign workers disguised as American job applicants, with whom he ultimately split the proceeds.",
      "As CBS News has reported, North Korea deploys IT workers worldwide to fraudulently seek jobs with top companies, allowing North Korean cyber operatives to take home a hefty paycheck that is ultimately funneled to the regime. The moneymaking scheme is worth hundreds of millions, according to FBI senior officials.",
      "Treasury officials said North Korea's IT worker scheme employs \"thousands of highly skilled workers\" who are primarily located in China and Russia, ultimately channeling funds to Kim Jong Un's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.",
      "As part of its crackdown on Kim Jong Un's growing cyber espionage campaign and attempted impersonation of American workers, the department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, known as OFAC, is also sanctioning four entities that it found were funneling money to North Korea as part of a Russia-based IT worker scheme.",
      "The Treasury Department is also targeting the Russia-based \"Asatryan IT Worker Network.\" The network's founder, Gayk Asatryan, according to the department,\u00a0 was found to have signed a 10-year contract with the North Korean regime in 2024, agreeing to dispatch as many as 30 North Korean IT workers to work in Russia for his company, part of a broad money-making scheme.",
      "The government's efforts to undercut North Korea's \"unlawful weapons development,\" stem from a March 2016 United Nations Security Council Resolution.",
      "\"Today's action underscores the importance of vigilance on the DPRK's continued efforts to clandestinely fund its WMD and ballistic missile programs,\" Treasury Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender told CBS News in a statement, reaffirming the government's goal of \"using all available tools to disrupt the Kim regime's efforts to circumvent sanctions through its digital asset theft, attempted impersonation of Americans, and malicious cyber-attacks.\"",
      "According to the Treasury, North Korean cyber operatives engaged in IT worker schemes routinely hide their locations and use proxy accounts, stolen identities and falsified or forged documentation to apply for jobs at employers in wealthier countries.",
      "Applications and software developed by North Korean IT workers span popular industry sectors like business, health and fitness, social networking, sports, entertainment and lifestyle, according to the Treasury Department. The North Korean cyber operatives often take on projects involving virtual currency exchanges, enabling them to more easily launder money back to the regime, undetected.",
      "In May, CBS Mornings profiled \"Steven Smith,\" a suspected member of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's cyber army. Smith was caught red-handed a by the cryptocurrency firm Kraken after a \"do not hire\" list circulated by law enforcement flagged him as a potential North Korean spy.",

      "An \"unknown actor\" created a Signal account and used artificial intelligence to impersonate Secretary of State Marco Rubio and contact government and foreign officials, according to a State Department cable obtained by CBS News.",
      "The cable was sent to \"All Diplomatic and Consular Posts,\" and alerted them that the account was created in mid-June 2025 with the display name marco.rubio@state.gov.",
      "\"The individual contacted at least five non-Department individuals, including three foreign ministers, a U.S. governor, and a U.S. member of Congress,\" the cable said. \"The actor left voicemails on Signal for at least two targeted individuals, and in one instance, sent a text message inviting the individual to communicate on Signal.\"",
      "In a statement, the State Department said it is \"aware of this incident and is currently investigating this matter.\" The Department said it \"continuously takes steps to improve the department's cybersecurity posture to prevent future incidents.\"",
      "The story was first reported by The Washington Post.",
      "The cable says the alleged imposter \"likely aimed to manipulate targeted individuals using AI-generated text and voice messages, with the goal of gaining access to information or accounts.\"",
      "According to the cable, this effort resembled an incident in May 2025 that was investigated by the FBI of someone impersonating other senior U.S. government officials.",
      "There was a separate and unrelated campaign that began in April 2025 of Russia-linked cyber threat actor conducting a spear-fishing campaign that targeted personal Gmail accounts associated with think tank scholars, Eastern European-based activists and dissidents, journalists and former State Department officials. In that incident, the actor allegedly posed as a fictitious State Department official and invited the targets to a meeting in an attempt to link a third-party application to their Gmail accounts. The cable said that if clicked, the application would \"almost certainly\" grant the actor persistent access to the Gmail accounts' contents. For this second campaign, industry partners attributed it to a cyber threat actor associated with the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).",
      "The cable also listed other instances of threat actors impersonating\u00a0 Department accounts in the past few years.",
      "The news also follows \"Signalgate\" in March, when journalist Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently added to a group chat on Signal that included Rubio, Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and then-National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. On the chat, the officials discussed plans to strike Houthi targets in Yemen and Waltz was later ousted due in part to the incident.",

      "\"We're going to send some more weapons. We have to. They have to be able to defend themselves,\" Mr. Trump told reporters during a White House event with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday night.",
      "The president said the shipments will consist of \"defensive weapons, primarily,\" saying Ukraine is \"getting hit very hard\" and \"so many people are dying in that mess.\"",
      "\"At President Trump's direction, the Department of Defense is sending additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to ensure the Ukrainians can defend themselves while we work to secure a lasting peace and ensure the killing stops,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement later Monday night. \"Our framework for POTUS to evaluate military shipments across the globe remains in effect and is integral to our America First defense priorities.\"",

      "Asked Tuesday about Mr. Trump's announcement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow that \"these actions probably do not align with attempts to promote a peaceful resolution\" to the war in Ukraine, according to Russia's state-run news agencies.",

    "summary": "President Trump said the U.S. will impose steep levies on imports from 14 countries starting next month, raising pressure on trading partners.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday said the U.S will impose 25% tariffs on goods from South Korea and Japan by Aug. 1, while also threatening to hit a dozen other nations with steep import duties by next month.",
      "Mr. Trump initially\u00a0posted\u00a0two nearly identical letters, addressed to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, on his Truth Social media platform outlining the new tariffs. A 90-day freeze on country-specific U.S. tariffs on dozens of nations, including Japan and South Korea, expires on July 9. That deadline, however, is no longer significant, with Mr. Trump saying on social media that \"tariffs will start being paid on Aug. 1, 2025.\"",
      "\"In other words, all money will be due and payable starting Aug. 1, 2025 \u2014 No extensions will be granted,\" he added.",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday afternoon also announced separate tariffs on an additional 12 trade partners. Myanmar and Laos face a 40% tariff rate, the highest of the new levies the U.S. is threatening to deploy. Thailand and Cambodia face potential tariffs of 36%, while Mr. Trump announced slightly lower tariffs of 35% on both Bangladesh and Serbia.",
      "Indonesia is the lone country facing a possible tariff rate of 32%. Imports from South Africa and Bosnia and Herzegovina will be subject to 30% duties as of Aug.\u00a01, while goods from Malaysia, Kazakhstan and Tunisia will be taxed at 25%, Mr. Trump said in letters posted on Truth Social. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said on Truth Social that more tariff letters \"will be sent today, tomorrow, and for the next short period of time.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a media briefing Monday that Mr. Trump is set to sign an executive order extending the July 9 tariff freeze. The order delays the deadline to \"Aug. 1 so the reciprocal tariff rate, or these new rates that will be provided in this correspondence to these foreign leaders, will be going out the door within the next month,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Leavitt also said Mr. Trump was planning to send tariff letters to \"approximately 12 other countries\" informing them of new U.S. levies on their goods. She did not indicate when the notices will be sent out, but said Mr. Trump will post them on Truth Social \"so you can enjoy them yourself.\"",
      "Trump is also expected to announce more deals with U.S. trade partners before the beginning of August, she said.",
      "Mr. Trump included identical language in each letter informing recipients that the notice \"demonstrates the strength and commitment of our Trading Relationship,\" and that \"we invite you to participate in the extraordinary Economy of the United States.\"",
      "The 25% tariffs on South Korea and Japan are in line with the so-called \"reciprocal\" rates Mr. Trump had announced when he unveiled country-specific duties on April 2. At the time, the Trump administration said it would impose tariffs of 24% and 25% on imports from Japan and South Korea, respectively.",
      "\"If none of these 14 countries manage to seal a preliminary trade deal (and assuming Trump doesn't delay implementation for another month) then the effective tariff rate on U.S. imports would rise from 15.5% to 17.3%,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a report. In 2024, the effective tariff rate on imports was 2.5%, he noted.",
      "25% tariff would bog down trade",
      "Trade policy expert Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that Monday's announcements \"are simply indications that he is making them pay full admission price to access the U.S. market.\"",
      "\"At 25%, it is possible, but challenging, to trade with Japan and Korea. This rate was carefully set at the higher side of the spectrum. In essence trade with the U.S. now is a pay to play proposition for Japan, Korea and likely others to come,\" he said.",
      "Appleton added that the country-specific rates announced Monday do not bode well for other nations looking to strike deals with the U.S., including EU countries, Canada and Switzerland.",
      "Economists warn that wide-ranging U.S. tariffs on trading partners could spark another bout of inflation and hinder economic growth, while global financial markets have heaved at the prospect of significantly higher trading costs.",
      "Trump administration officials have said stiff U.S. tariffs can ensure fair global trade while also boosting the American manufacturing sector.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal magistrate judge said Monday that the Justice Department's criminal case against Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan should move forward and recommended that her bid to dismiss the indictment be denied.",
      "Dugan was arrested in April and charged with two federal counts after she was accused of helping a man who is in the U.S. illegally evade federal immigration authorities during a law enforcement operation at her courthouse in Milwaukee. She pleaded not guilty to one count of concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, and one count of obstruction, a felony.",
      "Dugan has argued that the case against her should be dismissed on the grounds that she was acting within the scope of her official duties as a state court judge and is therefore entitled to judicial immunity. She also said that the federal prosecution violates Wisconsin's sovereignty by interfering with the duties of an elected state judge and disrupting active proceedings.",
      "In a filing seeking to dismiss the indictment, Dugan's lawyers called the government's prosecution \"virtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional.\"",
      "But federal prosecutors said the charges should not be dropped and urged a federal judge to deny Dugan's bid to dismiss the case. They said Dugan's request for a dismissal is \"unprecedented\" and would ignore \"well-established law that has long permitted judges to be prosecuted for crimes they commit.\"",
      "\"Such a ruling would give state court judges carte blanche to interfere with valid law enforcement actions by federal agents in public hallways of a courthouse, and perhaps even beyond,\" they wrote in a filing last month. \"Dugan's desired ruling would, in essence, say that judges are 'above the law,' and uniquely entitled to interfere with federal law enforcement.\"",
      "In a report filed Monday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph recommended that Dugan's attempt to dismiss the charges should be rejected.",
      "\"It is well-established and undisputed that judges have absolute immunity from civil lawsuits for monetary damages when engaging in judicial acts,\" she wrote in a 37-page filing. \"This, however, is not a civil case. And review of the case law does not show an extension of this established doctrine to the criminal context.\"",
      "Joseph stressed, however, that her recommendations, which are non-binding, do not speak to the merits of the allegations against Dugan, who is presumed innocent until proven guilty. A jury trial before U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman was set to begin July 21, but has been delayed.",
      "In arguing that she should be shielded from federal prosecution, Dugan cited the Supreme Court's 2024 ruling in a case involving President Trump and the 2020 presidential election. The high court found that the president is immune from prosecution for official acts taken while in office.",
      "But Joseph wrote she is \"unconvinced\" that common law or the Supreme Court's decision in Mr. Trump's case \"provide the authority for applying the civil framework of absolute judicial immunity for judicial acts to the prosecution of judges for crimes that relate to official duties.\"",
      "The magistrate judge concluded that judicial immunity does not shield Dugan from prosecution for allegedly violating criminal laws while performing her official judicial duties.",
      "\"There is no firmly established absolute judicial immunity barring criminal prosecution of judges for judicial acts,\" Joseph said.",
      "Adelman will have the final word on whether to grant Dugan's request to dismiss the indictment. Federal prosecutors and Dugan's lawyers are set to appear before the judge Wednesday to discuss the status of the case and address additional scheduling matters.",

      "\"There's nobody like us in the United States Senate,\" Osborn said in a campaign video announcing the bid Tuesday, touting his background as a mechanic, a Navy veteran, and a registered independent.",
      "Osborn, 50, was a political newcomer when he launched his 2024 Senate bid. A union leader who led the strike at Omaha's Kellogg plant in 2021, his campaign received a surge of outside funding that forced Republicans to redouble their efforts in a race that was thought to be an easy win. Osborn went on to significantly outperform Kamala Harris in the deep-red state. But he ultimately lost to Sen. Deb Fischer, the Republican incumbent, by seven percentage points.",
      "Now, Osborn is taking on Ricketts, while positioning the bid as representative of a broader fight between the \"billionaire class\" and the working class.",
      "\"I'm running for Senate because Congress shouldn't just be a playground for the rich,\" Osborn said.",
      "\"Sen. Ricketts has consistently worked for and voted to secure the border and cut taxes for Nebraska workers, families, and seniors,\" Ricketts' campaign spokesman Will Coup said in a statement. \"Dan Osborn is bought and paid for by his liberal, out-of-state, coastal donors. Dan Osborn will side with Chuck Schumer over Nebraska families and vote with Democrats to open the border, hike taxes, and stop the America First agenda.\"",
      "Ricketts was appointed to the Senate in 2023 upon former Sen. Ben Sasse's resignation to become president of the University of Florida. Last year, Ricketts handily won his bid in a special election to serve out the remaining two years of Sasse's term. Ricketts, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, is the son of Omaha billionaire Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade, and owner of the Chicago Cubs.",
      "Osborn has accused Ricketts of \"trying to buy power in Nebraska,\" while saying that when \"working people need his help,\" it's \"always the same old story: Crickets from Ricketts.\"",
      "In his announcement Tuesday, Osborn urged that \"we've got to make things more affordable, secure the border and take on the corruption in Washington,\" echoing the populist message and moderate positions he stressed in his first campaign \u2014 like opposition to national abortion restrictions, support for \"reasonable gun safety measures\" and stronger border security.",
      "In the 2024 race, Fischer accused her independent challenger of being a \"Democrat in disguise,\" while leaning on an endorsement from President Trump. The president endorsed Ricketts in April, claiming that Osborn is a \"Radical Left Open Border Extremist, who will put our Country, and Safety, LAST,\" while \"Pete, on the other hand, will ALWAYS put Nebraska, and America, FIRST.\"",
      "Fisher also backed Ricketts and previewed the race in an April post on X, saying, \"Dan Osborn tried to fool Nebraskans last year. He failed.\"",
      "\"Unlike Dan Osborn, Pete Ricketts has nothing to hide,\" Fisher said. \"He's honest, hardworking, and represents Nebraska's values.\"",

      "DHS officials on Tuesday confirmed CBS News' reporting, sharing the full list of the nationalities of those detained at Guantanamo Bay, as well as the names and criminal histories of more than two dozen detainees. They are being held separately from the remaining prisoners held there as a result of the U.S. war on terror.",
      "The list shows Guantanamo Bay is housing detainees from all continents other than Antarctica.",
      "The detainees, DHS said, hail from Brazil, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Liberia, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Peru, Romania, Russia, Somalia, St. Kitts-Nevis, the United Kingdom, Venezuela and Vietnam.",
      "The criminal records of the detainees whose names were shared by DHS officials include convictions for homicide; sexual offenses, including against children; child pornography; assault with a weapon; kidnapping; drug smuggling; and robbery. DHS officials said they all have final deportation orders.",
      "Those with criminal records are classified as \"high-risk\" detainees and held at Camp IV, the post-9/11 prison complex at Guantanamo Bay that also holds around a dozen war on terror-era detainees, though in a distinct part of the facility. Those without serious criminal records or any at all \u2014 deemed to be \"low-risk\" detainees \u2014 are housed at a barrack-like facility known as the Migrant Operations Center.",
      "As of this week, there were 72 immigration detainees at Guantanamo Bay, 58 of them classified as high-risk and 14 in the low-risk category, two U.S. officials told CBS News, requesting anonymity to discuss internal data.",
      "The administration began using the base to hold immigration detainees in early February.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to use controversial detention centers and prisons to warn those in the U.S. illegally \u2014 particularly those convicted of serious crimes \u2014 that they will be found, detained and deported if they don't turn themselves in or self-deport.",
      "In a statement, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin said the detention of foreigners with criminal records at Guantanamo Bay shows that President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are using \"every tool available to get criminal illegal aliens off our streets and out of our country.\"",
      "\"Whether it is CECOT, Alligator Alcatraz, Guantanamo Bay or another detention facility, these dangerous criminals will not be allowed to terrorize U.S. citizens,\" McLaughlin said, referencing the Salvadoran prison where the U.S. sent more 200 Venezuelan deportees and the facility set up by Florida officials in the Everglades.",
      "The use of Guantanamo Bay for immigration detention \u2014 which is supposed to be civil, and not punitive, in nature \u2014 has alarmed some Democrats and civil rights advocates. The base has been at the center of controversy for the past two decades due to indefinite detention of war on terror detainees, some of whom were found to have faced abuse and torture.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have also denounced the costs involved in turning Guantanamo Bay into an immigration detention center. The Department of Defense told Congress in May that as of April 8 it had spent $21 million transporting detainees to Guantanamo Bay.",
      "The government staff supporting the immigration detention efforts at Guantanamo Bay include more than 520 Department of Defense service members and roughly 130 DHS personnel, according to a Defense official. The base has held 663 immigration detainees so far, the official said, far below the 30,000 number referenced by Mr. Trump when he ordered his administration to start detaining immigrants awaiting deportation there.",
      "Civil rights advocates have called the detention of immigration detainees at Guantanamo Bay punitive and unlawful, arguing in an active lawsuit that federal law does not allow the government to hold those awaiting deportation outside of U.S. territory. The base sits on Cuban land that the U.S. has stipulated for decades is being leased, though the current Cuban government has long rejected U.S. payments and demanded the base's return.",
      "Lee Gelernt, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer seeking to block the transfers to Guantanamo Bay, said the Trump administration's effort is \"more about theatrics than following the law and pursuing sound policies.\"",
      "\"Every prior administration has understood that Congress did not authorize the detention of immigrants in foreign countries,\" he said. \"That is true whether or not the immigrant has a criminal conviction.\"",

    "story": [
      "Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren, one of the most liberal members of the U.S. Senate, is teaming up with Montana Republican Tim Sheehy, one of the upper chamber's most conservative, to advance a new Pentagon policy that has earned support from top Trump administration officials.",
      "Warren and Sheehy are introducing legislation on Tuesday that would give the Department of Defense the \"right to repair\" its own military equipment, a policy that could save the Pentagon money, resources and, most critically, time, CBS News has exclusively learned. The legislation, called \"The Warrior Right to Repair Act,\" has bipartisan support and is expected to be included in the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act, which approves funds and policy for the DOD.",
      "Traditionally, defense contractors who provide the U.S. military with equipment often restrict the DOD's ability to conduct its own repairs, leading to higher costs, delays and waste.",
      "Warren and Sheehy pointed to instances where the Navy had to fly contractors out to sea to perform routine fixes or Marines in Japan had to send engines back to the U.S. for repair instead of on site, and Marines in Korea having to choose between violating contracts or delaying training exercises because machinery was inoperable. And, they said, in some instances, the Army can't write its own training manual without sign off from a contractor.",
      "The senators also note the exorbitant costs of repair by a contractor compared to that by a service member, and that many defense contracts prohibit sharing intellectual property and technical data with the DOD that would enable service members to repair their own equipment.",
      "Warren and Sheehy both sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and are concerned about the impact on military readiness and flexibility as well as on national security. And each has a unique approach to the policy.",
      "Warren has long advocated for this change, and views it as fighting against consolation and for more competition. Warren pushed the issue during Army Secretary Dan Driscoll's confirmation hearing, and he agreed with her concerns.",
      "In April, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the Army to include right-to-repair provisions in all new and existing contracts.",
      "\"To build a leaner, more lethal force, the Army must transform at an accelerated pace by divesting outdated, redundant, and inefficient programs, as well as restructuring headquarters and acquisition systems,\" Hegseth wrote in a memo to Pentagon leadership.",
      "The secretary of the Navy has also expressed support for a similar policy.",
      "The Warren-Sheehy legislation would not only codify that into law, but would also apply across military branches.",
      "\"It's common sense for members of our military to be able to fix their own weapons. Sen. Sheehy and I are fighting to improve military readiness and save taxpayers billions,\" Warren said in a statement to CBS. \"It's about time we stand up to Pentagon contractors that are squeezing every last cent from us at the expense of our national security.\"",

      "The Department of Veterans Affairs has dropped plans revealed in a memo earlier this year to lay off tens of thousands of personnel in August, a news release from the department indicated Monday.",
      "The VA announced it's currently on pace to reduce its staff by about 30,000 employees by the end of this fiscal year, in September, thereby \"eliminating the need for a large-scale reduction-in-force,\" or RIF.",
      "The department originally planned to reduce its staff to 2019 levels, or just under 400,000, according to a memo obtained by CBS News in March. The VA said in its release that it had \"roughly 484,000 employees on Jan. 1, 2025\" \u2014 meaning the initial plans would have required the VA to cut upwards of 80,000 jobs.",
      "In a statement included in the release, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins said that as a result of a \"holistic\" department-wide review, the VA \"is headed in the right direction \u2014 both in terms of staff levels and customer service. A department-wide RIF is off the table, but that doesn't mean we're done improving VA.\"",
      "The VA acknowledged in the release that the agency \"had been considering a department-wide RIF to reduce staff levels by up to 15%,\" but said \"employee reductions through the federal hiring freeze, deferred resignations, retirements and normal attrition have eliminated the need for that RIF.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the VA said in a statement Monday that it spent \"nearly four months conducting a holistic review of the department to see what needs to be changed.\" The department claimed that in recent months, the VA has improved services for veterans, citing \"huge drops in the number of Veterans waiting for disability benefits, sizeable increases in claims processing productivity, and extraordinary progress regarding our electronic health record modernization.\"",
      "The spokesperson said the original number of 80,000 staff cuts \"got employees thinking outside of the box to come up with new and better ways of serving Veterans,\" and the \"main goal all along has been creating the best possible experiences and outcomes\" for veterans and their families.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the VA hired tens of thousands of workers, in part to help administer the\u00a0PACT Act, which addresses toxic exposures veterans suffered while serving in the military. The Trump administration initially looked at cutting staff levels to pre-Biden administration levels.",
      "The Trump administration imposed a broader hiring freeze on many government jobs earlier this year, part of a push to cut the size of the federal workforce. The VA exempted some roles from that freeze, including many health care jobs at the agency's hospital network. The administration also offered a voluntary \"deferred resignation\" deal that allowed thousands of federal workers to leave their jobs in early February and get paid until September.",
      "Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut took note of the reversal of the planned mass layoffs at the VA and blamed the work environment at the department.",
      "\"This announcement makes clear VA is bleeding employees across the board at an unsustainable rate because of the toxic work environment created by this Administration and DOGE's slash and trash policies,\" Blumenthal, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, said in a statement. \"This is not 'natural' attrition, it is not strategic, and it will inevitably impact veterans' care and benefits \u2014 no matter what blanket assurances the VA Secretary hides behind.\"",
      "Blumenthal noted the VA workforce usually expands by about 10,000 \"in a typical year,\" and its statement that it was losing 30,000 this year means the VA \"still stands to lose tens of thousands more employees than ever before.\" He complained that the administration \"repeatedly refused to share any additional information about this plan to cut 83,000 VA employees and what positions would be targeted.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A Justice Department and FBI review of the investigation related to disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein found that there was no \"client list\" or evidence that he blackmailed prominent figures, according to a memo detailing the findings.",
      "The review also concluded that Epstein died by suicide while in custody at a Manhattan correctional facility in August 2019. Epstein was facing federal sex trafficking charges, and his death was subsequently investigated by the Justice Department's internal watchdog and the FBI.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI said in their memo that video footage reviewed by bureau investigators\u00a0 \u2014 and made available to the public \u2014 confirmed that Epstein was locked in his cell and nobody entered tiers of the unit where he was housed at the time of his death.",
      "Investigators also \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate any investigation against uncharged third parties,\" according to the memo.",
      "\"This systematic review revealed no incriminating 'client list.' There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions,\" the Justice Department and FBI said in their two-page document detailing the conclusions.",
      "Axios was first to report the memo with the Justice Department's findings.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI leaders had pledged to release information about Epstein after President Trump returned to the White House earlier this year. Files related to Epstein's case, as well as the circumstances surrounding his death, have been the subject of conspiracy theories for years. Among the speculation about the records involving Epstein was that the federal government was concealing information to shield powerful and prominent figures who were allegedly named in them.",
      "While Bondi suggested during a Fox News interview in February that a \"client list\" was sitting on her desk, the purported document never materialized.",
      "In February, a group of 15 right-wing social media influencers went to the White House and were given binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" The influencers said they received the binders from Bondi during a meeting that Mr. Trump, FBI Director Kash Patel and Vice President JD Vance also attended.",
      "But any hopes of new information were quickly dashed, as the social media figures said the binders contained documents that were already in the public domain. Bondi confirmed that the first tranche of declassified files largely contained records that were leaked but had not been made public by the federal government.",
      "Still, after Elon Musk and Mr. Trump had a falling out last month, the billionaire entrepreneur claimed that the administration had withheld the so-called Epstein files because the president was named in them. In response, Mr. Trump shared a social media post that rebuffed Musk's claim.",
      "The president told NBC News in an interview that any alleged links between him and Epstein were \"old news,\" and said he had not been friendly with the convicted sex offender for 18 years before his death.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the administration's approach to Epstein's case on Monday, telling reporters that it is \"committed to truth and to transparency.\"",
      "\"That's why the attorney general and the FBI director pledged, at the president's direction, to do an exhaustive review of all of the files related to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes and his death, and they put out a memo in conclusion of that review,\" she said. \"There was material they did not release, because, frankly, it was incredibly graphic and it contained child pornography, which is not something that's appropriate for public consumption. But they committed to an exhaustive investigation. That's what they did, and they provided the results of that.\"",
      "When asked about the \"client list\" that Bondi said was on her desk, Leavitt said the attorney general was referring to \"the entirety of all of the paperwork, all of the paper in relation to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes.\"",
      "The FBI and Justice Department said in their memo that the review confirmed that Epstein harmed more than 1,000 victims, each of whom suffered \"unique trauma.\"",
      "\"One of our highest priorities is combatting child exploitation and bringing justice to victims. Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends,\" the memo said.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI added that while they have \"labored to provide the public with maximum information\" about Epstein and examine evidence in the government's possession, they determined that \"no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"",

The group, formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra, has been on the U.S.'s list of foreign terrorist organizations for more than a decade, dating back to its affiliation with al Qaeda. The terrorist designation makes it harder for the group or its leaders to accept assistance from Americans, work with American banks or travel to the U.S.",

Al-Sharaa participated in the insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq in the 2000s, before he was sent to Syria to help lead the al Qaeda-allied Jabhat al-Nusra in the fight against Bashar al-Assad's government. Jabhat al-Nusra was designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization in 2014, and al-Sharaa had a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head until last year.",
      "More than a decade ago, the group broke with insurgent leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and refused to merge with his now-infamous organization, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Since 2016, al-Sharaa's group has distanced itself from al Qaeda, and al-Sharaa has said he disagrees with some of the global terrorist organization's methods. He told PBS's \"Frontline\" in 2021, \"our involvement with al Qaeda in the past was an era, and it ended.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-beautiful-bill-social-security-tax-trump/",
    "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 15:15:23 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump pushed to eliminate taxes on Social Security. Does his \"one big, beautiful bill\" deliver?",
    "story": [
      "As Congress was approving President Trump's\u00a0\"big, beautiful bill\" on Thursday, the Social Security Administration touted the legislation by stating that it \"eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries.\"",
      "That claim, which echoes\u00a0previous promises by Mr. Trump to remove taxes on Social Security, may have come as welcome news for the millions of older and disabled people who depend on the program for income. So does the bill deliver? Not entirely.",
      "In a press release, the SSA said that the tax and spending package, which the president is set to sign into law on Friday, \"ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits.\"",
      "That figure draws on a June\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that said 88% of seniors \u2014 or 51.4 million people \u2014 on Social Security will pay no tax on their payments under the measure because their deductions would exceed their taxable benefits. More than 70 million Americans collect Social Security benefits, according to the SSA.",
      "The bill \"includes the largest tax break in American history for our nation's seniors,\" CEA said, adding that \"the deductions ensure that seniors who earned their Social Security through years of hard work get more money back in their pockets.\"",
      "Yet while it's true that the bill offers fresh tax relief for some people on Social Security, it is misleading to suggest that the measure does away with taxes on Social Security benefits, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Rather, the bill offers relief by creating a new \"bonus\" tax deduction for beneficiaries.",
      "\"While the deduction does provide some relief for seniors, it's far from completely repealing the tax on their benefits,\" Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank, told The Associated Press this week ahead of Congress approving the bill.",
      "The Social Security Administration did not respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.",
      "How does the \"big, beautiful bill\" impact Social Security?",
      "The bill doesn't eliminate taxes on Social Security, but rather introduces a temporary deduction that beneficiaries can claim to lower their federal income tax. Notably, that deduction applies to all of a senior's income \u2014 not just to Social Security benefits.",
      "Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS MoneyWatch the bill doesn't change the taxation of Social Security benefits. Eliminating taxes on Social Security under the bill was impossible because of a congressional restriction (dubbed the Byrd Rule\u00a0after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what the Senate can include in a reconciliation bill like the Republican budget measure.",
      "What the bill does do is provide a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older. The tax break is available to people with an adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028.",
      "\"Each spouse can take the deduction, for a total of $12,000, if both are 65-plus,\" AARP explains in its analysis of the budget bill. The deduction phases out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Social Security recipients under 65 and people above the specified income thresholds are ineligible to claim the new tax deduction. It also won't benefit the many low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax because they earn too little.",
      "\"Boosting the amount that you get to write off when you already get to write off everything does not help you at all,\" Kogan said.",
      "The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research group, said in a June\u00a0report\u00a0that exempting Social Security benefits from taxation would not change the after-tax income for the bottom 20% of taxpayers, noting that \"those taxpayers are already exempt from taxation on their Social Security benefits.\"",
      "The biggest beneficiaries of the bill will be higher-income seniors, said Martha Shedden, president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, which focuses on Social Security education.",
      "\"The people who benefit by definition have to be richer, and the people who benefit the most are the richest people, before the tax cut phases out,\" Kogan added.",
      "The tax cut is fully phased out for individuals making $175,000 and for couples making $250,000.",
      "More pressure on Social Security?",

      "The Trump administration said Monday it will soon revoke the legal immigration status of more than 70,000 immigrants from Honduras and Nicaragua, its latest effort to curtail humanitarian programs that allow foreigners to stay in the U.S. temporarily.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said it would terminate the longstanding Temporary Protected Status programs for Honduras and Nicaragua in early September, paving the way for those enrolled in the initiative to be at risk of deportation unless they have other legal means to remain in the U.S.",
      "Roughly 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans \u2014 many of whom arrived in the 1990s \u2014 have work permits and deportation protections under the TPS policy, according to the official termination notices published by DHS on Monday.",
      "Since it was established by Congress in 1990, the U.S. government has used TPS to give certain foreigners a temporary safe haven, if returning to their home countries is deemed too dangerous due to armed conflict, environmental disasters or other crises.",
      "The Biden administration greatly expanded TPS, offering hundreds of thousands of immigrants, mainly from Haiti and Venezuela, the opportunity to apply for the program. But President Trump, who ran on mass deportation and hardline immigration policies, has sought to severely limit TPS, as his administration works towards what the president has promised will be the largest deportation campaign in U.S. history.",
      "The administration has now moved to dismantle TPS programs for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Venezuela, dramatically expanding the pool of those eligible to be arrested and deported by federal immigration authorities.",

      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said to Justice Department attorney Bridget O'Hickey, \"You made three arguments, defendants, and none are availing \u2026 meritless.\"",
      "Xinis, who had ordered the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. after he was sent to El Salvador in March, questioned O'Hickey about whether the U.S. had indicted him in order to facilitate his return. The government did not notify Xinis or Abrego Garcia's attorneys when he was returned to the U.S. in June and immediately indicted.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, was part of a group of more than 250 Venezuelan and Salvadoran men who were deported from the U.S. to El Salvador and held in CECOT, a maximum security prison, in mid-March. Soon afterward, he sued the government over his deportation. His amended suit asks Xinis that he be held in custody in Maryland, rather than in Tennessee, where he's currently being detained, as well as to block his deportation.",
      "\"Obviously you did have power to produce Mr. Abrego because you produced him less than a week later.\" Xinis told the government, citing the May 21 date of a sealed indictment against Abrego Garcia in Tennessee filed six days after a motion in Maryland that said the government had no power to return him to the U.S.",
      "Xinis said she found it \"highly problematic\" that there had been a plan by the government to investigate Abrego Garcia and bring him back for prosecution without informing her court that it was doing so. \"We knew it was coming because eventually it was unsealed,\" she said. Abrego Garcia's attorneys told Xinis they found out about his return to the U.S. from news reports.",
      "Abrego Garcia was transported to the U.S. in June and immediately indicted on human trafficking charges in Tennessee that stemmed from a traffic stop in 2019. He is being held in Tennessee pending trial.",
      "Arguing that Abrego Garcia's lawsuit should be dismissed, O'Hickey said the government had been in ongoing conversations with El Salvador to bring him back to the U.S. at the same time the Justice Department filed its motion to dismiss.",
      "\"How can this representation be one I can credit,\" Xinis asked.",
      "\"At some point, don't you have an obligation to me to say, 'Judge, we have the power, we produced him, moot,'\" she asked O'Hickey.",
      "She questioned whether the department's attorneys in Abrego Garcia's case knew the indictment in Tennessee was coming.",
      "O'Hickey said that at the time, the U.S. was still negotiating with El Salvador, and \"it was uncertain what agreement would be released with the foreign sovereign and how all that would play out.\"",
      "\"The proceedings were moving in tandem and negotiations were ongoing,\" O'Hickey said. She told Judge Xinis, \"Defendants certainly took steps to facilitate his return.\"",
      "\"Is the indictment one of those steps? Since we are talking about my court order,\" Xinis replied.",
      "Abrego Garcia \"wasn't under investigation until April \u2026 a month after this case started,\" Xinis said, a contention O'Hickey denied.",
      "\"I don't believe that's true, your honor,\" O'Hickey responded, contradicting law enforcement statements in Abrego Garcia's criminal case in Tennessee.",
      "Xinis also denied a second motion to dismiss by the Justice Department, which argued that the lawsuit is now moot, since Abrego Garcia is now in the U.S.",
      "She expressed concern that if Abrego Garcia were released from custody, he could be removed again, but listed actions the government could take to assure the court that her order would be followed.",
      "The government could \"name a specific country (where Abrego Garcia could be deported) and then give a reasonable amount of time\" to challenge that removal, Xinis said. And she offered that the government could \"clarify all of this\" in a \"binding way,\" if it stipulated that he would receive due process \u2014 that he would not be removed without notice and would have the opportunity to be heard before a court.",
      "Referring to his deportation as an \"isolated error,\" O'Hickey said, \"We've acknowledged this was an error and have now acknowledged that error and have no intention of making that error a second time.\"",
      "\"For three months your clients told the world they weren't going to do anything to bring him back,\" Xinis responded. \"Doesn't that matter?\" The president said it in two interviews. [Homeland Security Secretary Kristi] Noem said it. Arguably, [Attorney General Pam] Bondi said it. Am I really supposed to ignore all that?\"",
      "\"I have been told that there was no error,\" Xinis said, and denying the government's second motion to dismiss, ruled, \"I don't find at the moment that this case is moot.\"",
      "Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn said that if Abrego Garcia were released from pretrial detention in Tennessee while his criminal case unfolds, that the Department of Homeland Security intends to remove him from the U.S., but the government has not yet decided whether to remove him to a third country or challenge a previous court order that bars his removal to El Salvador.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said it deported a group of eight men convicted of serious crimes in the United States to the conflict-ridden African country of South Sudan, following a legal saga that had kept the deportees stuck in a military base in Djibouti for weeks.",
      "Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the deportation flight carrying the deportees landed in South Sudan just before midnight Eastern time on Friday. A photo provided by the department showed the deportees, with their hands and feet shackled, sitting inside an aircraft, guarded by U.S. service members.",
      "The deportations to South Sudan \u2014 a country plagued by armed conflict and political instability that the U.S. government warns Americans not to visit \u2014 mark an unprecedented new frontier in President Trump's government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "None of the deportees is from South Sudan. They hail from Cuba, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam, and were ordered deported from the U.S. after being convicted of crimes, including murder, homicide, sexual assault, lascivious acts with a child and robbery.",
      "The high-profile legal battle over the fate of the men culminated when two federal judges on Friday denied a last-ditch attempt by immigration rights advocates to halt the deportations, saying their hands were tied by recent orders from the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The deportations signify a major political victory for the Trump administration, which has sought to convince countries around the world \u2014 irrespective of their human rights record \u2014 to accept deportees who are not their citizens, including those convicted of serious crimes.",
      "\"A district judge cannot dictate the national security and foreign policy of the United States of America,\" said McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman. \"This Independence Day marks another victory for the safety and security of the American people.\"",
      "The deportations have also alarmed human rights advocates, who fear the men could face jail time, torture or other harms in South Sudan. They've argued the deportations to South Sudan are designed to punish the men for their crimes, even though they have already served criminal sentences in the U.S.",
      "\"The U.S. State Department warns Americans against all travel to South Sudan, yet deported these men there without any due process,\" said Trina Realmuto, an attorney for the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, which tried to halt the deportations. \"Make no mistake about it, these deportations were punitive and unconstitutional.\"",
      "It's unclear exactly how the deportees will be treated in South Sudan. A Justice Department attorney told a federal judge Friday that South Sudan informed the U.S. it would offer the men a temporary immigration status, but the lawyer could not confirm whether they would be detained. The Trump administration has said in court filings that South Sudanese officials have made assurances that the deportees will not face torture.",
      "The men's deportation was made possible by a Supreme Court order earlier this week. At the request of the Trump administration, the Supreme Court on Thursday clarified the scope of an earlier order it had issued to pause a lower court ruling barring deportations to third-party countries without a degree of due process and notice.",
      "That April lower court ruling by U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Massachusetts had required the Trump administration to give detainees sufficient notice and a chance to be interviewed by a U.S. asylum officer before any deportation to a country where they did not hail from. That case thwarted several deportation efforts, including a plan to send detainees to Libya.",
      "When he learned of the administration's plan to deport the eight men to South Sudan in May, Murphy blocked that effort, mandating the U.S. to retain custody of the detainees and to offer them a chance to contest their deportation. The administration transferred the detainees to the Camp Lemonnier naval base in Djibouti, where U.S. officials described dangerous conditions, including concerns about malaria, rocket attacks, inadequate security protocols and triple-digit outdoor temperatures.",
      "But the Supreme Court last month suspended Murphy's ruling from April. And on Thursday, it said Murphy could no longer require the government to allow the detainees in Djibouti to contest their deportation, since the order underpinning that requirement had been paused.",
      "Hours later, immigrant rights advocates asked a different federal judge, Randolph Moss in Washington, D.C., to halt the deportations to South Sudan. He did so on Friday, but only briefly before saying the request should be handled by Murphy.",
      "Moss expressed concern about risks to the men's \"physical safety\" and said the U.S. government should not be in the business of inflicting \"pain and suffering\" on people who have already served their sentence, even for a \"terrible crime.\" But he said his hands were tied, telling the advocates they needed to ask Murphy for any intervention.",

      "Kligman remembers looking at the jawbone under a microscope at the Smithsonian \u2014 where he is a Peter Buck postdoctoral fellow and where the fossil had been sent \u2014 and running through his \"Rolodex\" of Triassic jaw anatomy, thinking about what species could have a similar jaw. He wanted to solve the mystery of where the delicate jawbone belonged.",
      "Through the process of elimination, and thinking of the features pterosaurs have that no other animal has, Kligman said he and other researchers were able to conclude that, \"Oh yeah, this is definitely a pterosaur \u2014 therefore, this is a very important discovery.\"",
      "The team named the pterosaur the Eotephradactylus mcintireae, which means \"ash-winged dawn goddess.\" The species name references its discoverer, Suzanne McIntire, who volunteered in the Smithsonian's FossiLab for 18 years.",
      "McIntire discovered the pterosaur fossil, which had been brought to the museum from the Petrified Forest National Park along with 1,200 other individual fossils, including bones, teeth, fish scales and coprolites, or fossilized excrement.",
      "Volunteers painstakingly clean each fossil, flag ones of interest and perform other fossil conservation tasks. McIntire unearthed the jawbone and noticed the teeth were still in the bone, making it easier to identify.",
      "The winged reptile \u2014 a close cousin of dinosaurs and the first animals after insects to evolve powered flight \u2014 would've been small enough to comfortably perch on a person's shoulder.",
      "\"It could've sat on your shoulder, like a small seagull,\" Kligman said of the species.",
      "Researchers were able to date the fossil back to 209.2 million years ago \u2014 an unusually precise date, Kligman said, because of the level of volcanic ash where the fossil was found. The finding helps fill in a gap in the fossil record that predates the end-Triassic extinction, he said. Very few pterosaur fossils exist, Kligman said. After their extinction, their fragile bones preserved poorly, so pterosaur fossils are frequently incomplete. They also did not live close to places where fossils tend to form.",
      "\"It helps us understand what a pterosaur was and how they became what they would become,\" Kligman said.",
      "Along with the pterosaur, the study also detailed other findings, including one of the world's oldest turtle fossils, giant amphibians and armored crocodile relatives, which lived alongside evolutionary upstarts like frogs, turtles and pterosaurs.",

    "summary": "From the Clotilda to the Titanic, archaeologist James Delgado shares insights from his 50-year career.",
    "story": [
      "Renowned underwater archaeologist James Delgado appeared on \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday to discuss his new book, \"The Great Museum of the Sea,\" and reflect on more than 50 years of searching for historic shipwrecks around the world.",
      "Delgado, who has investigated more than 100 shipwrecks globally, gained international attention in 2019 when he discovered the Clotilda, the last known slave ship to arrive in the United States. The discovery was later featured in a \"60 Minutes\" segment with Anderson Cooper.",
      "The archaeologist's fascination with shipwrecks began in childhood while growing up in the San Francisco Bay area, where he learned about ships from the 1849 Gold Rush. He said locating shipwrecks requires extensive preparation.",
      "\"It takes a team. And that team includes oceanographers, people that understand currents. We're also looking at old records and charts. You're also trying to understand the forensics of it,\" he said.",
      "The process involves analyzing factors like ship speed and sailing patterns. Once located, the wrecks often don't match popular expectations.",
      "\"We have great images that people think of as shipwrecks, but there are a pile of rockets and timber and anchor, and then you go, all right, what exactly am I looking at here,\" he said.",
      "In his book, Delgado describes the sea as \"the largest museum on Earth\" and argues that every shipwreck has a story to tell.",
      "\"I think the most important thing for people to remember about shipwrecks is that it's okay for them to have different meanings,\" Delgado said. \"Some people like them because they inspire you with the stories of bravery. Others are tragic and sad. For some, they're the graves of family. But for others, they're a great opportunity to dive and to explore.\"",
      "The archaeologist has also explored the Titanic, describing the experience as overwhelming despite the ship's fame.",
      "\"Nothing prepares you for seeing 'Titanic,'\" he said.",
      "After a 2.5-hour descent in a Russian submersible, with pressure so intense that \"a regular styrofoam coffee cup gets squeezed down\" when strapped to the outside, Delgado said the anticipation suddenly disappeared when the ship appeared.",
      "\"There it was looming out of the darkness,\" he recalled. \"This massive hull rising twice as high as the ceiling here. Still painted but streaked with rust and rusticles that are orange and yellow and red. And then a porthole that's open and another closed.\"",
      "Delgado described one particularly eerie moment: \"One of the spookiest moments \u2014 because 'Titanic' is a ship of the dead \u2014 is when I first looked through the porthole, 2.5 miles down, the lights \u2014 I could see a face looking back at me in the porthole. It was my own reflection.\"",
      "He reflected on the ship's enduring power: \"This ship sitting on the bottom ruined and deteriorating still is the stage upon which some of the most powerful drama played out that we all know about with the shipwreck. And you're there.\"",
      "\"The Great Museum of the Sea\" is available wherever books are sold.",

    "summary": "The move is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from the New World screwworm fly, which could devastate its beef industry and even kill household pets.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.",
      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\"It's an exceptionally good technology,\" said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \"It's an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\"",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of\u00a0the New World Screwworm fly.\u00a0The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them. They mate with females in the wild, and the eggs laid by the female aren't fertilized and don't hatch. There are fewer larvae, and over time, the fly population dies out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "The scientific name for the parasite, Cochliomyia hominivorax, is roughly translated to \"man-eater,\" according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "\"When NWS fly larvae (maggots) burrow into the flesh of a living animal, they cause serious, often deadly damage to the animal,\" the\u00a0USDA\u00a0says. \"NWS can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds and, in rare cases, people.\"",
      "Threats to the beef industry",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",
      "\"A thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,\" said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.",
      "Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant \u2014 and cripple an animal with pain.",
      "Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.",
      "\"It smelled nasty,\" he said. \"Like rotting meat.\"",
      "Scientists plan to use the fly's biology against it",
      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Why does the U.S. want to breed more flies?",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "Raising hundreds of millions of flies",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \"You've got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly's cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",
      "Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University's Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.",
      "Risks associated with dropping flies from an airplane",
      "Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico's border with Guatemala, killing three people.",
      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \"Whiz Packer.\"",
      "The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.",
      "Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA's \"crowning achievements.\"",
      "Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn't be shuttered after another successful fight.",
      "\"Something we think we have complete control over \u2014 and we have declared a triumph and victory over \u2014 can always rear its ugly head again,\" Burgess said.",

      "With the creation of the academy, leading artificial intelligence companies are stepping up their efforts to bring AI to schools across the U.S. OpenAI has committed to giving $10 million over five years, while Microsoft will provide $12.5 million. Anthropic, meanwhile, will contribute $500,000 the first year, said Andrew Crook, a spokesperson for the AFT.",
      "While some educators have expressed concern over being replaced by AI, AFT said it seeks to embrace the technology in a way that protects teachers' place at the head of the classroom. With this in mind, the foundation said reached out to tech companies for their assistance in developing the AI-training academy.",
      "\"The direct connection between a teacher and their kids can never be replaced by new technologies, but if we learn how to harness it, set commonsense guardrails and put teachers in the driver's seat, teaching and learning can be enhanced,\" AFT President Randi Weingarten said in the\u00a0announcement.",
      "\"We want to do it in a way that teachers can really master the tools,\" Weingarten told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Courses will begin this fall at the United Federation of Teachers' facility in Manhattan, New York. Funding from the tech trio will also go toward the buildout of additional hubs throughout the U.S., which are set to open in 2030, according to Crook. UFT is an affiliate of AFT.",
      "The companies say the training academy will offer a space for educators to learn how to harness AI and implement it safely and ethically in their classrooms. The programming, designed by AI experts and educators, will include workshops, online courses and hands-on training sessions, according to the AFT.",
      "\"We're at a pivotal moment in education, and how we introduce AI to educators today will shape teaching for generations to come,\" Anthropic co-Founder Jack Clark said in an emailed statement on the partnership.",
      "AFT said the academy will offer free virtual training to all 1.8 million members in its union, starting with K-12 educators. The federation's ultimate goal is to train 400,000 educators \u2014 about 10% of the U.S. teaching workforce \u2014 at the in-person facility over the next five years.",
      "AI in education",

      "The rapid rise of AI has raised concerns about students using the technology to cheat or complete their assignments, with some schools\u00a0implementing AI detection software.",
      "Meanwhile, research is also beginning to tease apart how AI affects our thinking. A recent study from MIT found that over-reliance on artificial intelligence can reduce brain activity and critical cognitive functions.",

      "Mr. Trump began taking steps to shrink the government shortly after he returned to the White House. The president created DOGE, a cost-cutting task force that had been led by Elon Musk, and his administration began taking steps to dismantle agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump issued an executive order directing agencies to make plans to initiate \"large-scale\" reductions-in-force, the government's term for layoffs. On the heels of the president's directive, the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Management of Budget issued a memo directing agencies to submit plans for two phases of job cuts.",
      "Several department heads began executing their workforce cuts earlier this year, with thousands of federal employees losing their jobs. Other federal entities had planned to make significant reductions in the coming weeks and months. The reductions-in-force are separate from the mass terminations of probationary workers, who generally were in their positions for one or two years. But those firings, which took place in February, have also been the focus of lawsuits.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's executive order, labor unions, nonprofit groups and local governments sued nearly every federal agency to block the layoffs, arguing that the executive order exceeded the president's authority and violated the separation of powers. The Department of Education was not part of the unions' suit.",
      "A federal judge in San Francisco agreed to issue a temporary restraining order that prevented the Trump administration from moving forward with its existing reductions-in-force or planning any future layoffs as directed by Mr. Trump. The order also bars administration officials from enforcing any further orders by DOGE to cut programs or staff in connection to the president's executive order.",
      "U.S. District Judge Susan Illston extended that block in May, finding that the president can restructure federal agencies, but only after obtaining approval from Congress. Her injunction applies to 22 federal agencies, including the Cabinet-level Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, and State, among others.",
      "\"Presidents may set policy priorities for the executive branch, and agency heads may implement them. This much is undisputed,\" Illston wrote. \"But Congress creates federal agencies, funds them, and gives them duties that \u2014 by statute \u2014 they must carry out. Agencies may not conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates, and a president may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress.\"",
      "The Trump administration turned to the Supreme Court after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined to lift Illston's order. The appeals court said in a 2-1 decision in late May that Mr. Trump's executive order \"far exceeds\" his supervisory powers under the Constitution.",
      "In arguing for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the district court's order is \"flawed\" and rests on an \"indefensible premise,\" namely that the president needs authorization from Congress to oversee personnel decisions within the executive branch.",
      "\"It interferes with the Executive Branch's internal operations and unquestioned legal authority to plan and carry out RIFs, and does so on a government-wide scale,\" he wrote. \"More concretely, the injunction has brought to a halt numerous in-progress RIFs at more than a dozen federal agencies, sowing confusion about what RIF-related steps agencies may take and compelling the government to retain \u2014 at taxpayer expense \u2014 thousands of employees whose continuance in federal service the agencies deem not to be in the government and public interest.\"",
      "Lawyers for the unions urged the Supreme Court to reject the Trump administration's request for emergency relief and warned that allowing Mr. Trump to move forward with his planned reorganization of the federal government before the merits of the case can be decided would do irreversible damage.",
      "\"[O]ffices, and functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs,\" they wrote. \"There will be no way to unscramble that egg.\"",
      "The unions said that if the injunction remains in place, it would not prevent the president from going to Congress and securing its approval for a reorganization of the government.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, is expected to appear before senators next week for his confirmation hearing, a source familiar with the schedule confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Waltz left Congress to become Mr. Trump's national security adviser, a post he vacated in May after he came under scrutiny for his role in putting together a Signal chat in which a journalist was mistakenly included. In the chat, Trump's top national security officials discussed sensitive plans for a military strike on Houthi targets in Yemen.",
      "Axios first reported the hearing's timing.",
      "In nominating Waltz, Mr. Trump withdrew his first choice for the position, Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, whom he asked to remain in Congress, where she could help advance his legislative agenda amid a tight GOP majority.",
      "Waltz is likely to face combative questioning from Democrats on the the Senate Foreign Relations Committee over the Signal controversy. The hearing also follows Mr. Trump's recent decision to strike Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said in May that she expected the confirmation hearing to be \"brutal\" for Waltz.",
      "\"He's not qualified for the job, just by nature of the fact that he participated in this Signal chain,\" Duckworth, a member of the committee, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

    "story": [
      "The search for people still missing after flash floods devastated central Texas has entered a fifth day, with death tolls from various counties collectively topping 100 and expected to climb.",
      "At least 109 people are confirmed dead as of Tuesday and dozens remain unaccounted for, according to local officials. Rescue operations were underway to find anyone lost in the debris after last week's catastrophic storm, which caused the sprawling Guadalupe River to swell rapidly to near-unprecedented levels.",
      "President Trump has signed a federal disaster declaration at the request of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deploy its own teams to support local rescue and recovery initiatives as those operations press on. Ongoing storms have made the efforts especially challenging, officials said, but National Weather Service forecasts indicated conditions would begin to abate Tuesday.",
      "Camp Mystic tragedy",
      "Kerr County \u2014 located in the flood-prone Hill Country west of Austin, the state capital \u2014 bore the brunt of the disaster. Of all of the deaths confirmed so far, 87 were from that county alone, officials said Tuesday.",
      "At Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp with cabins along the river in a rural part of Kerr County near Hunt, at least 27 campers and counselors died in what the camp and surviving campers described as \"catastrophic flooding.\" They said they woke up to water rushing through the windows. Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said Tuesday that crews continued to search for five missing campers and one counselor from Camp Mystic.",
      "Hundreds of rescuers, including teams from local, state and federal agencies, as well as volunteers, are involved in the search, said Texas Game Warden Ben Baker at a Tuesday news conference. They have recovered the bodies of 56 adults and 30 children since Friday, when the floods first hit, but have yet to identify 26 of them, Leitha said at the briefing.",
      "\"It's very tragic whenever you see human life. But to see a child in that loss of life, is extremely tragic,\" Baker told a reporter, who had asked about the impacts on rescuers' mental health.",
      "26 feet of water rose from Guadalupe River",
      "Friday was the last time a missing person was found alive in Kerr County, according to authorities. But search crews continued to survey 26 miles of the Guadalupe River on Tuesday in hopes of locating others who may have been lost in the floods that inundated Kerr County, Baker told reporters.",
      "The river runs for approximately 230 miles through a region that sits between Austin and San Antonio, starting in Kerr County and ending along the Gulf Coast. It's nicknamed \"flash flood alley\" because the terrain makes it vulnerable to inundation.",
      "Officials in five other counties along the river have confirmed 22 additional deaths in the flooding: seven in Travis County, which includes Austin; five in Burnet County; seven in Kendall County; two in Williamson County; and one in Tom Green County, where the San Angelo Police Department said 62-year-old Tanya Burwick died in floodwaters that submerged her vehicle as she was driving.",
      "During the early hours of Friday morning, the Guadalupe River in Hunt rose to about 26 feet \u2014 roughly the height of a two-story building \u2014 over the course of 45 minutes, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said at a news conference Friday.",
      "Camp Mystic was \"horrendously ravaged,\" Abbott wrote in a social media post after visiting the site, which had about 750 children staying there when the flood happened.",
      "Sisters Natalie and Emily Raiford told CBS News correspondent Jason Allen about finding a young camper who'd been swept down the river for six miles before being rescued.",
      "\"All of the sudden we just hear somebody say, 'help, help,'\" one of the sisters recalled. \"She said that her cabin was flooding and someone opened a window and she just flew out of it.\"",
      "Scrutiny over weather forecasts",
      "Whether communities in the path of the flooding received adequate warnings has been heavily scrutinized, and is the subject of ongoing debate.",
      "Kerr County officials declined to respond to reporters' inquiries on the matter at their Tuesday news conference.",
      "Some have questioned if the Trump administration's cuts earlier this year to the National Weather Service, and its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, potentially prevented local forecast offices from sufficiently preparing the public for the extent of the flooding.",
      "Mr. Trump and his team have repeatedly rejected any suggestions that federal firings impacted forecasting or emergency preparedness ahead of the floods.",
      "A\u00a0CBS News analysis found that 22 warnings from the National Weather Service were issued for Kerr County around the storms and flash flooding, which used escalating language as time went on. But some local residents said they did not receive emergency alerts on their phones nor did they understand how serious the situation had truly become until it actually happened.",
      "The San Antonio and San Angelo weather forecasts offices also issued warnings for the areas affected by flooding. Officials with the union representing National Weather Service workers told CBS News there are 23 meteorologists staffed between those offices, which together have 10 vacant positions.",
      "In San Antonio, the office is missing a warning coordination meteorologist, a vital role that essentially liaises between forecasters and emergency management agencies in the region to plan how information about an extreme weather event will be disseminated to the public, and which steps to take to protect them.",
      "Nim Kidd, the chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, said his office received a forecast Wednesday that predicted several inches of rain, but \"the amount of rain that fell at this specific location was never in any of those forecasts.\"",
      "Dalton Rice, the city manager for Kerrville, in Kerr County, said at the same briefing that the storm \"dumped more rain than what was forecasted.\"",
      "Judge Rob Kelly, of Kerr County, said his area does \"not have a warning system\" in place for inclement weather, which may have been why people were not as prepared as they could have been. County officials had previously\u00a0discussed a public alarm system but did not proceed with it because of the cost. Former Kerr County commissioner Tom Moser told CBS News the county had applied for a grant in the past to built the system but the application was not approved.",
      "\"If they can't afford to do it, then let us do it,\" Patrick said Monday, noting that the state could offer resources for Kerr County to implement a system. \"We have a special session starting two weeks from today, and I think we can take that up and do some other things of funding these sirens. ... If there had been a siren, maybe that would have sparked people to say 'Oh, we have a massive disaster like five minutes away.'\"",

    "published": "Tue, 08 Jul 2025 15:37:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Beef costs around the U.S. surged to a record high in May. What's driving that jump, and are prices likely to ease up?",
    "story": [
      "Soaring U.S. beef prices are hitting consumers in the wallet and raising costs for restaurants.",
      "\"Anybody should be able to afford a burger,\" said Andrew Schnipper, a managing partner at Hamburger America in New York City. \"It's never been an expensive item historically.\"",
      "Yet the restaurant may be forced to raise the price of its burgers, which start at $7.50. \"We're very focused on trying to charge the least amount we feel comfortable doing,\" he added. \"But obviously, if prices go up we have to raise prices.\"",
      "The cost of beef reached $5.98 per pound in May, according to Federal Reserve data \u2014 the highest since the Department of Labor started tracking beef prices in the 1980s. That rise hasn't come overnight. Ground beef costs have increased 45% over the last 10 years, compared with roughly 30% for the overall Consumer Price Index.",
      "Overall food prices have eased since surging during the pandemic, although they're still up nearly 17% since 2022, according to the CBS News price tracker. That means a grocery bill that cost $100 back then would cost around $116.85 as of May (the latest data available).",
      "So what accounts for higher beef prices? The answer largely comes down to simple economics, with demand outstripping supply. That has resulted in higher costs throughout the supply chain, including for meat processing companies, the restaurant industry and consumers.",
      "\"There's plenty of alternative protein sources in terms of pork and poultry, primarily in the U.S., that consumers could turn to that are in abundant supply and relatively cheaper,\" Derrell Peel, a professor in the department of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And yet beef demand has stayed remarkably robust.\"",
      "Shrinking herds and drought",
      "If the rules of supply and demand explain why beef has gotten so prices, other dynamics come into play.",
      "Notably, Americans' enduring appetite for beef has coincided with shrinking cattle herds. The number of beef cattle in 2025, 27.8 million, is the lowest it's been since the 1960s despite the growing U.S. population, Agriculture Department data shows.",
      "Over the last decade, in turn, the decline in cattle supplies has mainly been driven by drought conditions around the U,.S., which reduced the available feedstock and forced many cattle ranchers to sell off their beef cows, Peel said. \"They simply had no choice because of the drought.\"",
      "Most recently, a severe drought started in 2021 and continued through last year, sweeping through the western half of the country.",
      "\"Somewhere during that period, just about every major beef cow-producing area was subject to drought and subject to this sort of forced liquidation,\" Peel said.",
      "Even without the challenge of insufficient rainfall, herds take a long time to grow due to the biology of cattle. Cows can only have one calf at a time, and it takes the longer for them to reach the age for slaughter than other livestock, Peel said.",
      "Other factors driving up beef prices include high grain prices, tariffs and rising interest rates, according to a June\u00a0study\u00a0from NerdWallet, a financial services company.",
      "Will prices cool?",
      "Unfortunately for Americans, beef prices are expected to keep rising for some time. Diminished cattle supplies are likely to drive prices to new record highs in 2026,\u00a0according to projections from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Longer term, Peel expects beef prices to stay high for the next several years as ranchers work on rebuilding their herds.",
      "\"We're going to be in a tight supply situation, in an elevated price situation for next two to three years, probably to the rest of the decade,\" he said.",

Speaking to reporters Monday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that there will be a ceasefire with Hamas soon. And on U.S.-Iran talks, he forecasted that more details would come out Tuesday.",
      "Following his meeting with Johnson on Tuesday afternoon, Netanyahu told reporters that the \"resolute decision of president Trump to act with us against those who seek to destroy Israel and threaten the peace of the world has made a remarkable change in the Middle East.\"",

      "\"Diddy\" denied bail ahead of sentencing",
      "While Combs was acquitted of the most severe charges after a seven-week trial, Judge Arun Subramanian ordered he remain in detention while awaiting sentencing. Subramanian said he disagreed with the defense's argument that Combs' crimes shouldn't trigger mandatory detention.",
      "Prosecutors told the judge Wednesday that Combs is wealthy and capable of fleeing.",

    "summary": "Song Kum Hyok is accused of masterminding a scheme in which North Korean cyber operatives posed as U.S. remote IT workers for unwitting companies.",
    "story": [
      "The Treasury Department has levied sanctions against a North Korean cyber operative and notorious member of Kim Jong Un's military intelligence agency, formally known as the \"Reconnaissance General Bureau.\"",
      "The U.S. has accused Song Kum Hyok of facilitating an IT worker scheme and charges that the member of the \"Andariel\" hacking group recruited North Korean cyber operatives to pose as American remote workers for hire at unwitting companies worldwide. The sprawling scheme, according to the Treasury Department, allowed North Koreans operating in China and Russia to collect paychecks as a way of fundraising for Kim's nuclear missile program. In some cases, North Korean IT workers have gone as far as to plant malware into company networks.",
      "In 2022, Song began choreographing the moneymaking plot that stole personal information of U.S. citizens \u2013 including names, Social Security numbers, and addresses \u2013 in order to create aliases for the hired foreign workers disguised as American job applicants, with whom he ultimately split the proceeds.",
      "As CBS News has reported, North Korea deploys IT workers worldwide to fraudulently seek jobs with top companies, allowing North Korean cyber operatives to take home a hefty paycheck that is ultimately funneled to the regime. The moneymaking scheme is worth hundreds of millions, according to FBI senior officials.",
      "Treasury officials said North Korea's IT worker scheme employs \"thousands of highly skilled workers\" who are primarily located in China and Russia, ultimately channeling funds to Kim Jong Un's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.",
      "As part of its crackdown on Kim Jong Un's growing cyber espionage campaign and attempted impersonation of American workers, the department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, known as OFAC, is also sanctioning four entities that it found were funneling money to North Korea as part of a Russia-based IT worker scheme.",
      "The Treasury Department is also targeting the Russia-based \"Asatryan IT Worker Network.\" The network's founder, Gayk Asatryan, according to the department,\u00a0 was found to have signed a 10-year contract with the North Korean regime in 2024, agreeing to dispatch as many as 30 North Korean IT workers to work in Russia for his company, part of a broad money-making scheme.",
      "The government's efforts to undercut North Korea's \"unlawful weapons development,\" stem from a March 2016 United Nations Security Council Resolution.",
      "\"Today's action underscores the importance of vigilance on the DPRK's continued efforts to clandestinely fund its WMD and ballistic missile programs,\" Treasury Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender told CBS News in a statement, reaffirming the government's goal of \"using all available tools to disrupt the Kim regime's efforts to circumvent sanctions through its digital asset theft, attempted impersonation of Americans, and malicious cyber-attacks.\"",
      "According to the Treasury, North Korean cyber operatives engaged in IT worker schemes routinely hide their locations and use proxy accounts, stolen identities and falsified or forged documentation to apply for jobs at employers in wealthier countries.",
      "Applications and software developed by North Korean IT workers span popular industry sectors like business, health and fitness, social networking, sports, entertainment and lifestyle, according to the Treasury Department. The North Korean cyber operatives often take on projects involving virtual currency exchanges, enabling them to more easily launder money back to the regime, undetected.",
      "In May, CBS Mornings profiled \"Steven Smith,\" a suspected member of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's cyber army. Smith was caught red-handed a by the cryptocurrency firm Kraken after a \"do not hire\" list circulated by law enforcement flagged him as a potential North Korean spy.",

    "story": [
      "Here's a scary thought: Your job security could be in the hands of AI.",
      "That's according to a new study from career site\u00a0Resumebuilder.com, finding that more managers are relying on tools like ChatGPT to make hiring and firing decisions.",
      "Managers across the U.S. are increasingly outsourcing personnel-related matters to a range of AI tools, despite their not being well-versed in how to use the technology, according to the survey of more than 1,300 people in manager-level positions across different organizations.",
      "The survey found that while one-third of people in charge of employees' career trajectories have no formal training in using AI tools, 65% use it to make work-related decisions. Even more managers appear to be leaning heavily on AI when deciding who to hire, fire or promote, according to the survey. Ninety-four percent of managers said they turn to AI tools when tasked with determining who should be promoted or earn a raise, or even be laid off.",
      "The growing reliance among managers on AI tools for personnel-related decisions is at odds with the notion that these tasks often fall under the purview of human resources departments. But companies are quickly integrating AI into day-to-day operations, and urging workers to use it.",
      "\"The guidance managers are getting from their CEOs over and over again, is that this technology is coming, and you better starting using it,\" Axios Business reporter Erica Pandey told CBS News. \"And a lot of what managers are doing are these critical decisions of hiring and firing, and raises and promotions. So it makes sense that they're starting to wade into the use there.\"",
      "To be sure, there are risks associated with using generative AI to determine who climbs the corporate ladder and who loses their job, especially if those using the technology don't understand it well.",
      "\"AI is only as good as the data you feed it,\" Pandey said. \"A lot of folks don't know how much data you need to give it. And beyond that ... this is a very sensitive decision; it involves someone's life and livelihood. These are decisions that still need human input \u2014 at least a human checking the work.\"",
      "In other words, problems can arise when AI is increasingly determining staffing decisions with little input from human managers.",
      "\"The fact that AI could be in some cases making these decisions start to finish \u2014 you think about a manager just asking ChatGPT, 'Hey, who should I lay off? How many people should I lay off?' That, I think is really scary,\" Pandey said.",
      "Companies could also find themselves exposed to discrimination lawsuits.",
      "\"Report after report has told us that AI is biased. It's as biased as the person using it. So you could see a lot of hairy legal territory for companies,\" Pandey said.",
      "AI could also struggle to make sound personnel decisions when a worker's success is measured qualitatively, versus quantitatively.",
      "\"If there aren't hard numbers there, it's very subjective,\" Pandey said. \"It very much needs human deliberation. Probably the deliberation of much more than one human, also.\"",

    "story": [
      "The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) on Tuesday announced the fall launch of the National Academy for AI Instruction, a $23 million endeavor funded by Anthropic, Microsoft and OpenAI, three main players in the\u00a0generative AI revolution.",
      "With the creation of the academy, leading artificial intelligence companies are stepping up their efforts to bring AI to schools across the U.S. OpenAI has committed to giving $10 million over five years, while Microsoft will provide $12.5 million. Anthropic, meanwhile, will contribute $500,000 the first year, said Andrew Crook, a spokesperson for the AFT.",
      "While some educators have expressed concern over being replaced by AI, AFT said it seeks to embrace the technology in a way that protects teachers' place at the head of the classroom. With this in mind, the foundation said reached out to tech companies for their assistance in developing the AI-training academy.",
      "\"The direct connection between a teacher and their kids can never be replaced by new technologies, but if we learn how to harness it, set commonsense guardrails and put teachers in the driver's seat, teaching and learning can be enhanced,\" AFT President Randi Weingarten said in the\u00a0announcement.",
      "\"We want to do it in a way that teachers can really master the tools,\" Weingarten told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Courses will begin this fall at the United Federation of Teachers' facility in Manhattan, New York. Funding from the tech trio will also go toward the buildout of additional hubs throughout the U.S., which are set to open in 2030, according to Crook. UFT is an affiliate of AFT.",
      "The companies say the training academy will offer a space for educators to learn how to harness AI and implement it safely and ethically in their classrooms. The programming, designed by AI experts and educators, will include workshops, online courses and hands-on training sessions, according to the AFT.",
      "\"We're at a pivotal moment in education, and how we introduce AI to educators today will shape teaching for generations to come,\" Anthropic co-Founder Jack Clark said in an emailed statement on the partnership.",
      "AFT said the academy will offer free virtual training to all 1.8 million members in its union, starting with K-12 educators. The federation's ultimate goal is to train 400,000 educators \u2014 about 10% of the U.S. teaching workforce \u2014 at the in-person facility over the next five years.",

      "\"We are still holding out hope,\" she said. \"They are broken; they are in shock.\"",
      "Jane Ragsdale",
      "Jane Ragsdale, 68, devoted her life to the Heart O' the Hills Camp, a summer camp for girls in Texas Hill Country. She was a camper and counselor there herself in the 1970s before becoming a co-owner. By the 1980s, she was director of the camp in Hunt.",
      "\"She was the heart of The Heart,\" the camp said in a statement. \"She was our guiding light, our example, and our safe place. She had the rare gift of making every person feel seen, loved, and important.\"",
      "Since the camp was between sessions, no children were staying there when the floodwaters rose. The camp's facilities, directly in the path of the flood, were extensively damaged and access to the site remained difficult, according to camp officials. The camp has been in existence since the 1950s.",
      "Camp officials said Ragsdale would be remembered for her strength and wisdom.",
      "\"We are heartbroken. But above all, we are grateful,\" the camp said. \"Grateful to have known her, to have learned from her, and to carry her light forward.\"",
      "In a 2015 oral history for the Kerr County Historical Commission, Ragsdale, whose first name was Cynthie, but went by her middle name Jane, talked about how her father was also a camp director and how much she enjoyed her experiences.",
      "\"I loved every minute of camp from the first time I stepped foot in one,\" she recalled.",
      "Videos of Ragsdale strumming a guitar and singing to campers during a recent session were posted in a memorial on the camp's Facebook page: \"Life is good today. So keep singing 'til we meet, again.\"",
      "Blair and Brooke Harber",
      "Sisters Blair and Brooke Harber, both students at St. Rita Catholic School in Dallas, had been staying alongside the Guadalupe River when their cabin was swept away, according to the school. The sister's bodies were found together 15 miles downriver, CBS Texas reported.",
      "Pastor Joshua J. Whitfield of St. Rita Catholic Community, which shares a campus with the school, said the girls' parents, Annie and RJ Harber, were staying in a different cabin and were safe. However, their grandparents were unaccounted for. Annie Harber has been a longtime teacher at the school.",
      "\"This tragedy has touched every corner of our hearts,\" the church said in a statement Sunday.",
      "Blair, who was enrolled in advanced classes, was involved in numerous school activities from volleyball and basketball to speech and drama. Brooke was a rising sixth grader and a student athlete in volleyball and lacrosse, among other sports. She also participated in speech and drama, according to the church.",
      "Both were remembered for their kind hearts and warm personalities.",
      "\"We will honor Blair and Brooke's lives, the light they shared, and the joy they brought to everyone who knew them,\" Whitfield wrote in a Saturday letter to parishioners. \"And we will surround Annie, RJ, and their extended family with the strength and support of our St. Rita community.\"",
      "The church held a special prayer service Saturday afternoon and offered counseling.",
      "\"Please keep the Harber family in your prayers during this time of profound grief,\" Whitfield wrote. \"May our faith, our love, and our St. Rita community be a source of strength and comfort in the days ahead.\"",
      "Reece and Paula Zunker",
      "Reece Zunker was described as \"a passionate educator and a beloved soccer coach\" by Tivy High School in Kerrville, Texas.",
      "\"His unwavering dedication to our students, athletes, and the Tivy community touched countless lives and will never be forgotten,\" the school posted online Sunday.",
      "Paula Zunker was a former teacher at the school. \"The care and impact she shared with her students continue to be felt, even years later,\" the post said.",
      "The couple's young children, Lyle and Holland, were still missing, the school said.",
      "The family had been staying at a river house in Hunt.",
      "Tanya Burwick",
      "The last time Tanya Burwick's family heard from her was a frantic phone call about the floodwaters as she headed to work at a Walmart early Friday in the San Angelo area. When Burwick didn't show up for work, her employer filed a missing persons report and sent a colleague to look for her.",
      "Police investigating the 62-year-old's disappearance found Burwick's unoccupied SUV fully submerged later that day. Her body was found the next morning blocks from the vehicle.",
      "\"She lit up the room and had a laugh that made other people laugh,\" said Lindsey Burwick, who added that her mom was a beloved parent, grandparent and colleague to many.",
      "She and her brother Zac said the day was especially difficult because it happened on July Fourth as they were working at a fireworks stand that's been in the family for generations. As word of Tanya Burwick's disappearance spread, people from Blackwell, a small community of about 250 people, showed up to the stand that's run out of a trailer painted orange.",
      "\"People came to our aid,\" Lindsey Burwick said.",
      "Police in San Angelo said more than 12,000 houses, barns and other buildings have been affected by the floods in the community of roughly 100,000 people.",

    "story": [
      "Flash floods in Texas killed at least 109 people over the Fourth of July holiday weekend and left others still missing, including girls attending a summer camp. On Monday, Camp Mystic confirmed at least 27 campers and counselors had died in the flooding.",
      "The devastation along the Guadalupe River, west of Austin and northwest of San Antonio, has drawn a massive search effort as officials face questions over their preparedness and the speed of their initial actions.",
      "Here's what to know about the deadly flooding, the colossal weather system that drove it in and around Kerr County, Texas, and ongoing efforts to identify victims.",
      "Massive rain hit at just the wrong time, in a flood-prone place",
      "The floods grew to their worst at the midpoint of a long holiday weekend when many people were asleep.",
      "The Texas Hill Country in the central part of the state is naturally prone to flash flooding due to the dry dirt-packed areas where the soil lets rain skid along the surface of the landscape instead of soaking it up. An area of cliffs and steep hills called the Balcones Escarpment is also a factor.",
      "\"When warm air from the Gulf rushes up the escarpment, it condenses and can dump a lot of moisture. That water flows down the hills quickly, from many different directions, filling streams and rivers below,\" Hatim Sharif, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at The University of Texas at San Antonio, wrote in an article in The Conversation.",
      "In addition to the geography, multiple weather factors contributed to Friday's heavy rainfall, meteorologists say.",
      "\"First and foremost, you had Barry,\" a tropical system that had made landfall in eastern Mexico early last week and was weakening, CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Kate Bilo said Monday.",
      "Moisture from that system was lifted northward \"right on up into Texas,\" Bilo said. There were also other weather systems \u2014 a low-level jet stream and an upper-level disturbance \u2014 adding more moisture.",
      "\"Nothing was really moving so you just had all of this rain coming down over the same areas and heavy, heavy rainfall rates because of all of that deep, deep moisture in the atmosphere,\" Bilo explained.",
      "After a flood watch notice midday Thursday, the National Weather Service office issued an urgent warning around 4 a.m. that raised the potential of catastrophic damage and a severe threat to human life. By at least 5:20 a.m., some in the Kerrville City area said water levels were getting alarmingly high. The massive rain flowing down hills sent rushing water into the Guadalupe River, causing it to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes.",
      "Death toll is expected to rise as campers remain missing",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott said there were dozens of people unaccounted for across the state and more could be missing.",
      "In Kerr County, home to youth camps in the Texas Hill Country, at least 87 people, including 31 children, have died, officials said Monday. Fatalities in nearby counties brought the total number of deaths to at least 109 as of Monday night.",
      "Ten girls and a counselor were still unaccounted for at Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along the river.",
      "The campers who died include 8-year-old Linnie McCown of Austin, 8-year-old Eloise Peck of Dallas and 9-year-old Lila Bonner of Dallas, their families said. Chloe Childress, an 18-year-old counselor from the Houston area, also died in the floods, according to the Kinkaid School, where she had recently graduated.",
      "Camp Mystic's owner and director, Dick Eastland, died while trying to save girls at the camp, according to local media reports. The obituary section of the Kerrville community news site was dotted with tributes to victims, including Eastland.",
      "For past campers, the tragedy turned happy memories into grief.",
      "Beyond the Camp Mystic campers unaccounted for, the number of missing from other nearby campgrounds and across the region had not been released.",
      "\"We don't even want to begin to estimate at this time,\" Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said Saturday, citing the likely influx of visitors during the July Fourth holiday.",
      "Officials face scrutiny over flash flood warnings",
      "Survivors have described the floods as a \"pitch black wall of death\" and said they received no emergency warnings.",
      "Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly, who lives along the Guadalupe River, said Saturday that \"nobody saw this coming.\" Various officials have referred to it as a \"100-year flood,\" meaning the water levels were highly unlikely based on the historical record.",
      "And records behind those statistics don't always account for human-caused climate change. Though it's hard to connect specific storms to a warming planet so soon after they occur, meteorologists say a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture and allow severe storms to dump even more rain.",
      "Additionally, officials have come under scrutiny about why residents and youth summer camps along the river were not alerted sooner than 4 a.m. or told to evacuate.",
      "Officials noted that the public can grow weary from too many flooding alerts or forecasts that turn out to be minor.",
      "Kelly said authorities were shocked by the ferocity of the floods. \"We had no reason to believe that this was gonna be any, anything like what's happened here. None whatsoever,\" Kelly told \"CBS Evening News.\"",
      "Kerr County officials said they had presented a proposal for a more robust flood warning system, similar to a tornado warning system, but that members of the public reeled at the cost. Tom Moser, a former Kerr County commissioner, told CBS News the county had previously applied for a grant to build the system, but it wasn't approved, leading to concerns about the local budget if the county were to try to fund the system alone. He also noted there was local resistance over the possibility that the sirens could inadvertently be triggered, causing unwanted noise in the community.",
      "Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told CBS News on Monday that the state could possibly step in to fund the system.",
      "\"If they can't afford to do it, then let us do it,\" he said, adding: \"We have a special session starting two weeks from today, and I think we can take that up and do some other things of funding these sirens.\"",
      "On Sunday, officials walked out of a news briefing after reporters asked them again about delays in alerts and evacuations.",
      "Search for victims and monumental cleanup",
      "Crews are searching urgently for the missing. Volunteers, search dogs and drones have joined the effort, with some rescuers maneuvering through challenging terrain filled with snakes.",
      "U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem\u00a0said in a social media post\u00a0that the U.S. Coast Guard was responsible for saving more than 200 people, as dramatic\u00a0video\u00a0showed Guard members conducting aerial rescues near Kerrville while dark water covered the ground.",
      "The flash floods have erased campgrounds and torn homes from their foundations.",
      "\"It's going to be a long time before we're ever able to clean it up, much less rebuild it,\" Kelly said Saturday after surveying the destruction from a helicopter.",
      "Other massive flooding events have driven residents and business owners to give up, including in areas struck last year by Hurricane Helene.",
      "President Trump signed a major disaster declaration Sunday for Kerr County and said he would likely visit Friday: \"I would have done it today, but we'd just be in their way.\"",
      "\"It's a horrible thing that took place, absolutely horrible,\" he told reporters.",
      "At the Vatican, Pope Leo extended a prayer to the flooding victims during Sunday Mass, saying: \"I express my sincere condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones, in particular their daughters who were at summer camp, in the disaster caused by the flooding of the Guadalupe river in Texas in the United States.\"",

      "Badly beaten and with no identification, the woman became a Jane Doe. Her killer's identity was also a mystery.",

      "Less than 24 hours later, Jones received a call about another crime scene at the nearby Sportsman's Lodge Motel.",
      "As investigators worked to see if the two were connected, they learned that the woman's unconventional relationship held the answers.",
      "For Franklin County assistant prosecutor, Jarred Patterson, the sleepy, Gulf Coast town of Apalachicola and surrounding countryside are among the last remnants of a bygone era.",
      "Jarred Patterson: Apalachicola, Florida is a wonderful small place \u2026 It's certainly still harkens back to a time before there was condos on every inch of the beach and before there were high-rises. \u2026 We're referred to here, the counties along this area of the coast, as the Forgotten Coast.",
      "But when a couple heading to a nearby fishing pond discovered Aileen Seiden's battered body on April 23, 2018, Patterson wondered what had brought a killer to Florida's Forgotten Coast?",
      "Jarred Patterson: The horror that it really was \u2026 It absolutely shocked people.",
      "Ronnie Jones: It looked like \u2026 someone was in a hurry. Whoever it was dumped the body and took off.",
      "Lead investigator Lt. Ronnie Jones, then with the Franklin County Sheriff's Office, says documenting Aileen's unsettling dump site was the first of two ominous events over the next 24 hours. He was soon dispatched to the second crime scene at the Sportsman's Lodge Motel and a bloody spectacle inside room 15.",

      "THE HORROR INSIDE ROOM 15",
      "Ronnie Jones: As soon as I came in, I noticed the bed. I mean, it's \u2014 you couldn't miss it. \u2026 I mean, this whole area was covered and had blood stains on it.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And when you saw that kind of blood loss, what did that tell you?",
      "Ronnie Jones: I just put two and two together and I automatically put that back to the, um, body that was found the day before.",
      "Peter Van Sant: You did that quickly, like (snaps fingers) that?",
      "Ronnie Jones: Had to have. \u2026 It wasn't just somebody cut theirself and bled a little bit on the bed. I mean the amount of blood that was on this bed tells me that whoever was here was probably deceased.",
      "Jones recalled there was a smell of vinegar in the room.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And what did that tell you?",
      "Ronnie Jones: That someone attempted to clean the crime scene.",
      "A luminol test for traces of human blood revealed what an apparently hasty clean up couldn't hide.",
      "Ronnie Jones: The whole entire bathroom lit up.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So, that was the scene of perhaps some of her most vicious attacks \u2014 was inside that bathroom.",
      "Ronnie Jones: Yes.",
      "And Jones says the shower curtain rod was a possible weapon.",
      "Ronnie Jones: On the rod was located a palm print and also, uh, blood.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And that's significant evidence, right?",
      "Ronnie Jones: That's right.",

      "Franceasca Seiden: He said my sister was murdered. \u2026 I don't know, like, what do you do? You look for support. That's all I could do. \u2026I didn't understand why, like, it was given to me, again, like to handle another loss.",
      "While growing up in Miami, then-16-year-old Franceasca and 9-year-old Aileen faced their first tragedy when their beloved mother, Murtha, passed away from cancer.",
      "Peter Van Sant: How did the two of you deal with this?",
      "Franceasca Seiden: We didn't talk about it. \u2026 because it was so fast.",

      "Franceasca Seiden: I signed the papers, and I became her legal guardian.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And what did that mean? What were your responsibilities?",
      "Franceasca Seiden: I became a parent. \u2026 I had to take her to school. I had to pick her up from school. \u2026 I had to finish my own school. I was working. \u2026 I didn't have time to grieve. And I don't think that she did either.",
      "Seven years later, Franceasca moved to Los Angeles on her own. That's when she says Aileen, by then in her 20s, began grieving their parents.",
      "Franceasca Seiden: She started to think a lot. \u2026 She became more sensitive.",
      "Allie: Something like losing her parents \u2026 has \u2026 long-lasting effects throughout your life. And it's obvious that it did.",
      "Aileen's best friend, not wanting her name associated with this case, has asked \"48 Hours\" to refer to her as \"Allie.\" She remembers a strong and determined Aileen making it on her own in Miami.",
      "Allie: She worked as a property manager \u2026 She lived in a great apartment, you know, she paid her own rent, she made her bills. She was very independent.",
      "Franceasca saw that independence firsthand when Aileen made an extended visit to L.A. in 2016.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Looking back, do you wish she had stayed with you?",
      "Franceasca Seiden: 100% percent. \u2026 Because whatever happened when she went back to Miami is when she reconnected with Zach.",
      "Zach was Zachary Abell, who Aileen had known since they were teenagers.",
      "Allie: I'm not sure if he had the best reputation in high school. \u2026 At first, she wasn't really sure about him.",

      "Allie: I think in the beginning Aileen found Zach fun, but I think it changed pretty quickly.",
      "Investigators in Franklin County would soon learn all about Zach Abell. They discovered that Zach, Aileen and another woman named Christina Araujo had all been seen in the Apalachicola area. Detectives also learned the three shared a room at the Sportsman's Lodge Motel: room 15.",

      "Back in 2018, Picavet would play a central role in Aileen Seiden's murder investigation. He knew Aileen and her boyfriend Zach Abell well.",

      "Mike Picavet: He came up to me at Duffy's and said, \"Hey, I like your shirt.\" And I'm like, \"OK \u2026\"",
      "Mike Picavet: And then, uh, Christina came up.",
      "Christina Araujo \u2014 Abell's girlfriend at the time. The two had been dating for about four years. Picavet says Araujo immediately started boasting about her powerful father.",
      "Mike Picavet: Right outta the gate, she said, \"Oh, yeah, my dad's a major with the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Department, and if we ever get into any trouble with the law, he can take care of it.\" And I was like, \"What?\" Who says that?",
      "Despite their odd first meeting, Picavet says he began hanging out with the couple. What followed were years of wild nights, wild parties, and lots of heavy drinking.",
      "Mike Picavet: That was their go-to thing: \"OK, we've gotta do shots of this, shots of this.\"",
      "But Picavet says there was an interesting power dynamic in the couple's relationship with Araujo, who is eight years older than Abell, calling the shots.",
      "Mike Picavet: She was very controlling and very directing. \u2026 He would follow her lead with stuff.",
      "One day in 2016, Abell stopped by Picavet's boat \u2014 but not with Araujo. Instead, Abell introduced Picavet to Aileen Seiden. Picavet could tell Abell now had two women in his life.",
      "Mike Picavet: It was the weirdest thing. \u2026 If your relationship's not working, just end it and move on.",
      "However, Picavet says that Abell couldn't make a clean break from Araujo, who was also his business partner.",
      "Mike Picavet: He tried so many times. He just didn't know how to \u2026 and then also, uh, all the threats all the time that she could make him disappear. \u2026 Every time she got drunk, she'd say some weird things.",
      "Aileen's best friend, Allie, says Abell and Aileen began to secretly date.",
      "Allie: She seemed to love him so much that she was still hoping that he would, you know, decide to be with her. \u2026 He would lead her on to think, he was trying to end it with Christina.",
      "In 2017, Aileen unexpectedly lost her job as a property manager.",
      "Allie: She was really starting to lose control of her own life.",
      "Allie says that may explain why Aileen eventually started working at Abell and Araujo's used car dealership.",
      "Allie: It wasn't the independent life that she had always lived.",
      "Allie says Aileen continued to pressure Abell to break up with Araujo for good. But when Abell finally tried to end things with Araujo, she countered with an unconventional proposal.",
      "Allie: It was not the answer that anyone expected. \u2026 Christina came back and said, \"Well, why don't we try and all be in a relationship then?\" \u2026 It now became this opportunity for this \"throuple\", three-way kind of relationship.",
      "A throuple is a romantic relationship among three people. Allie says Aileen was against the idea.",
      "Allie: Aileen said, \"Absolutely not. There's no way. It's never going to work.\" And there was kind of crickets for a few weeks.",
      "But Allie says Aileen later changed her mind. The trio was now a throuple.",
      "Allie: I was in shock really. \u2026 But also a little bit happy for them that maybe this could work.",
      "But it didn't work. Before long, there was trouble.",
      "Allie: This whole dynamic started to change where one of them always seemed to be the odd man out or was jealous. \u2026 And at that point it just started to spiral out of control.",
      "According to Picavet, things escalated, leading to irrational behavior and fights fueled by alcohol. He says Aileen and Araujo traded punches often \u2014 usually resulting in black eyes \u2014 on one or both of the women; that they'd sometimes hide behind big sunglasses.",
      "Mike Picavet: It was an everyday thing \u2014 every second day thing, I could say.",
      "Allie remembers things differently. She says Abell was the main aggressor in the relationship.",
      "Allie: Aileen would call me \u2026 and would say, \"You have to come over here, like he hurt me again.\" And I'd rush over there and photograph her and beg her to go to the police.",

      "Aileen's sister Franceasca was furious when she learned of the abuse.",
      "Franceasca Seiden: I wanted my sister out of the situation \u2026 I wanted her out.",
      "Peter Van Sant: It's hard to leave.",
      "Franceasca Seiden: It's hard to leave. \u2026 And \u2026 I had this feeling that Christina was more \u2026 violent of the two.",
      "Allie: It was really difficult to see her going through a time like this. It was just so hard. \u2026 And she was scared to death.",
      "Once, Allie says the abuse got so bad, she took Aileen to the emergency room.",
      "Allie: I took her to the hospital because \u2026 they have to report things. But she wouldn't say where the bruises came from.",
      "Aileen's best friend had to deliver a hard truth.",
      "Allie: \"Aileen, you have to break up with this guy. Someone's gonna end up dead.\"",
      "\"I THINK THEY'RE GONNA KILL ME\"",
      "Allie: When Aileen was in real trouble, it was hard to get anyone to come rescue her.",
      "The path that led to Aileen Seiden's murder may have begun weeks earlier. In 2018, Allie was surprised that despite the physical violence in their relationship, Aileen had decided to move in with Zach Abell and Christina Araujo. The throuple was now working together, sleeping together, and living together.",
      "Allie: Aileen was trapped in the relationship because she was trapped financially. \u2026 But she felt that that was one last chance to make it work. \u2026 It was like a one month or two-month trial.",
      "But within a few weeks, Allie says Aileen had had enough.",
      "Allie: Aileen \u2026 was going to move out. \u2026 She was really done with the relationship.",
      "But Aileen's plans to leave were halted on April 7, 2018, after Abell and Araujo had gotten into a violent fight. Allie says she got a call from Aileen on Abell's phone.",
      "Allie: She was going to leave and get Zach out of the house. But like to go to a coffee shop. \u2026 The next call I got was from Christina. \u2026 She was angry and furious.",
      "Allie says Araujo threatened to report the car Aileen and Abell were driving in as stolen in an apparent attempt to keep them from leaving her behind. Allie immediately warned Aileen and Abell.",
      "Allie: Instead of coming around and coming back, like I thought they would, they hit the gas and went to Georgia. \u2026 I said, \"What are you doing, Aileen? You don't have your phone. You don't have a wallet. This is crazy.\" \u2026 She said, \"We're going on a road trip. \u2026 This is a good thing.\"",
      "But the road trip wasn't a good thing to Christina Araujo. She began harassing Abell and Aileen, sending a storm of angry texts: \"U 2 deserve each other.\" Araujo sent more than 150 texts in roughly 24 hours. All went unanswered, including this one: \"My dad will be calling u.\" Later, Araujo issued this threat: \"you f***** me over and now I'm f****** u over\"",
      "Allie: I was just trying to tell her, \"Christina \u2026why don't you worry about \u2026 your own life?\"",
      "About 48 hours into the road trip, Abell and Aileen were heading to Texas and Araujo seemed to have a change of heart, texting: \"\u2026 if you want to come back home come back. You never have to question my love \u2026\"",
      "For reasons that are unknown, instead of coming home, Abell invited Araujo to join them, and she flew to Dallas.",
      "But with the throuple united, the old problems returned.",
      "Allie: Aileen started to call me from Zach's phone at night saying, you know, \"This is getting bad. And I don't know what to do.\" \u2026 It wasn't until Christina arrived, that that started to happen. \u2026 I was really worried someone would get hurt.",
      "By day 10 of the road trip, Aileen's older sister, Franceasca was also worried. She hadn't heard from Aileen in a while. When the trio stopped in New Orleans, Aileen finally called Franceasca and shared an alarming suspicion.",
      "Franceasca Seiden: She's like \u2026 \"I think they're gonna kill me.\" No joke. \u2026 So I was like, \"Aileen, run to the nearest gas station.\" \u2026 \"Go tell the person \u2014\"",
      "Peter Van Sant: Call 911.",
      "Franceasca Seiden: Yeah! \u2026 \"Run to like \u2014\"\u00a0 I said \"run, get the \u2014 get out of there.\" \u2026 \"Go!\" \u2026She's like, \"I can't.\"",
      "Franceasca, desperate to help, tried to get more details from Aileen.",
      "Franceasca Seiden: If I had where the address was, I would've called the police then and there, but she had to go, she had to get off and she hung up. \u2026 I was extremely frustrated but I \u2014 and I was scared.",
      "With no way to help her sister, Franceasca hoped Aileen would stay safe.",
      "The road trip continued into its second week. The trio then headed to Panama City, Florida, but a missed exit led them to the Forgotten Coast.",
      "David Adlerstein: The road trip is difficult to understand; partying one day and murdering the next.",
      "David Adlerstein is a reporter for The Apalachicola Times, one of the oldest newspapers in Florida.",
      "David Adlerstein: I've been covering the Aileen Seiden case since the week it happened.",
      "On the evening of April 21, the trio \u2014 captured on surveillance footage \u2014 stumbled into the quiet peace of Franklin County.",
      "David Adlerstein: They went to a popular restaurant, the Red Pirate, played miniature golf, partied.",
      "At the recommendation of a local, the throuple headed to the nearby Sportsman's Lodge Motel. They reserved the last vacancy of the night: Room 15. The next morning, on April 22, 2018, the throuple made a plan.",
      "David Adlerstein: They decided they'd spend another day there, not get back on the road, and make it a \u2014 a party. So they got up in the morning and went to the liquor store.",
      "Here they are in a screenshot from the store's surveillance footage. While there, the trio purchased large bottles of vodka and Fireball whiskey.",
      "David Adlerstein: When I went to investigate \u2026 their path that day and went to the liquor store \u2026 the clerk, she pointed out that the Fireball that they bought was the largest bottle you could buy, and this is just the three of them.",
      "The throuple then returned to the Sportsman's Lodge Motel.",
      "Allie: I don't think Aileen was having fun. I think she was just trying to maybe get by and stay alive.",
      "Allie says she spoke to Aileen that day.",
      "Allie: Aileen said \u2026 \"I need to leave him. I'm telling you. I'm like a sex slave. He has this really scary look in his eye. It's very scary. It's different.\" \u2026 \u00a0And she said, \"I need your help.\"",
      "Allie says the two friends had crafted an escape plan: Aileen would get on a bus from Tampa \u2014 the trio's next destination.",
      "Allie: I bought her a Greyhound ticket because she didn't have a wallet.",
      "The bus would drop Aileen off near Miami and Allie would take her home. Aileen just needed to get on that bus, and she'd be safe.",
      "Allie: And then, you know, I never heard back. I never heard anything after that \u2026",
      "The next night, hundreds of miles away in Fort Lauderdale, Mike Picavet was home and alone. There was a knock at the door. It was Christina Araujo and Zach Abell.",
      "Mike Picavet: I was like, \"OK, where's Aileen?\" And right away, Christina says, \"Oh, she ran away.\" \u2026 And I said, \"Bulls***.\" I said, \"Where is she?\" And Zach right away \u2026 started to choke up, and he said, \"She's dead.\"",
      "The news was shocking enough, but Picavet says once Araujo was out of earshot, Abell told him what happened.",
      "Mike Picavet: He said that Christina killed her. He woke up. \u2026 She was dead next to him. And, uh, he tried to give her CPR, then, uh, wanted to call 911. Christina said \"No\" and told him, \"You can't call 911.\" \u2026 For some reason, he kept on saying he had to protect Christina. \u2026And I'm like, \"What do you gotta protect her for?\"",
      "Picavet says he wanted to protect both of his friends. He feared a violent outcome if he called 911.",
      "Mike Picavet: I didn't want them to get killed \u2026 I just wanted to make sure that \u2026 they were brought in in a safe, uh, way. \u2026 The only thing that I could think about \u2026 is to go talk to her father.",
      "Christina's father, Colonel Tony Araujo. The one, Picavet says, Christina had always bragged could make her problems go away. When Abell and Christina fell asleep on the sofa, Picavet took a photo of Abell and Araujo on his couch, and says he went online to search for Christina's father \u2014 a man he had never met.",
      "Mike Picavet: So, I was panicking, trying to find his phone number.",
      "When Picavet finally got ahold of Colonel Araujo, he didn't immediately reveal the deadly news.",
      "Mike Picavet: I said, \"I gotta talk to you. It's about Christina. It's very important.\"",
      "Picavet says Araujo's father directed Mike to meet him at an odd place: a gas station.",
      "Mike Picavet: So I went up there \u2026 I said, \"Christina killed somebody.\" And he says, \"You know I'm a cop, right?\" And I'm like, \"Yes, sir. I do.\" \u2026 He right away said, \"Wait right there.\"",
      "Picavet says Araujo's father then brought him to the sheriff's office to make a formal statement.",
      "Mike Picavet: He did what was the right thing to do. \u2026 He \u2026 got two other people to ask me all the questions.",
      "Later that day, Picavet was shown a photo, and he was the one to identify the battered body of Aileen Seiden. With that confirmation, police descended on Picavet's home as Abell and Araujo were about to leave. They were arrested and brought back to Franklin County. The pair was later charged with first-degree murder. It would take almost six years before they would face a jury \u2014 and by then, only one of them would stand trial.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE ROOM 15?",
      "For almost six years, Franceasca Seiden lived in agonizing limbo as her sister Aileen's case \u2014 complicated by having two defendants \u2014 faced delay after frustrating delay.",
      "Franceasca Seiden: (crying) You're healing, you're doing the things that you need to heal and then you're stopped. \u2026 And now you're gonna get ready for this big moment. \u2026 and then it stops again.",
      "Finally, in January 2024, at the Franklin County Courthouse in Apalachicola, Florida, Zach Abell was about to face trial. He had pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and would stand before the jury alone. Eight months earlier, Christina Araujo took a plea deal for a lesser charge of second-degree murder.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So, she admitted taking part in this?",
      "Jarred Patterson: Yes. \u2026 she implicated herself \u2026 in the actual beating of Aileen.",
      "After studying a mountain of evidence, prosecutor Jarred Patterson believes Abell was more responsible in Aileen's murder. And the state is relying on the jury believing Araujo's version of what happened inside room 15.",
      "Jarred Patterson: The only one who has told us anything about what happened in that room is Christina Araujo.",
      "David Adlerstein: Once Christina made her plea deal, she would become the prosecution's star witness.",
      "Print reporter David Adlerstein, camera in hand, was there as Christina Araujo transported the courtroom back to the evening of April 22, 2018. Araujo testified that she, Zach Abell and Aileen were relaxing in the room at the Sportsman's Lodge Motel after a day of heavy drinking.",
      "JARRED PATTERSON (in court): When Zach drinks, does he act differently?",
      "CHRISTINA ARAUJO (in court): Yes \u2026 He becomes very aggressive, very mean.",
      "Abell became violently enraged, says Araujo, when Aileen posed a seemingly innocent question.",
      "CHRISTINA ARAUJO (in court): She said, \"Christina, guess what?\"",
      "Peter Van Sant: And she looks over at Christina and says, hey \"Christina, guess what \u2026\" How would that sentence be finished?",
      "Jarred Patterson: I have no idea 'cause she never got to finish it.",
      "CHRISTINA ARAUJO (in court): Zachary got up immediately and went over to her, and was in her face, hitting her. \u2026 He's just yelling at her, telling her, \"You always start problems.\" (crying)",
      "Araujo admits to also hitting Aileen as she demanded to know what she was about to say. She never got an answer.",
      "CHRISTINA ARAUJO (in court): And I got so frustrated, I just went and got \u2014 I left the room.",
      "After stepping outside room 15 for a few minutes, Araujo claims she returned to find Abell and Aileen in the bathroom.",
      "CHRISTINA ARAUJO (in court): When I opened the door, he had something white in his hand, like if he was poking at her.",
      "Jarred Patterson: The medical examiner was able to identify small circular bruising to the body of Aileen that \u2026 could be consistent with a shower curtain rod.",
      "Like the shower curtain rod investigators recovered that had palm print impressions in Aileen's blood.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Whose palm was it?",
      "Jarred Patterson: The palm print belonged to Zach Abell.",
      "The assault continued near the beds says Araujo, where she says Abell reached for his wooden walking stick.",
      "CHRISTINA ARAUJO (in court): He hits her several times with it. \u2026 When he hit her in the \u2014 the back though, the stick broke.",
      "Jarred Patterson: We had actually found pieces of that wooden staff in the hotel room \u2026 we didn't realize the significance of it until we found the other piece in the vehicle that contained our victim's DNA.",
      "Araujo says she watched in terror as Abell began using that stick to sexually assault Aileen.",
      "David Adlerstein: Christina's description of the crime was \u2026 horrifying to listen to. \u2026 Aileen clearly suffered a terrible death.",
      "Adlerstein recalls the medical examiner saying Aileen's injuries reminded him of those he had seen in motor vehicle crashes.",
      "David Adlerstein: As a reporter, I try very hard to not be emotional. I distinctly remember \u2026 fighting back tears.",
      "Araujo claims she eventually put herself between Abell and Aileen, and the attack finally stopped. Aileen was badly beaten but still alive, she says. And the exhausted trio just fell sleep.",
      "CHRISTINA ARAUJO (in court): I didn't think she was gonna die from it.",
      "Araujo claims it wasn't until she woke up the next morning that she realized Aileen was dead. She says she only participated in the coverup out of fear of what Abell might do to her.",
      "David Adlerstein: She seemed to me genuinely remorseful \u2026 Others had different opinions.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Who is Christina Araujo in your book?",
      "Alex Morris: Manipulative, cunning, a chameleon. \u2026 I think that there's evil in her.",
      "Alex Morris is Zach Abell's attorney. He says Christina Araujo acted alone.",
      "Alex Morris: I believe that she is the murderer.",
      "Morris says, it was Christina Araujo who beat Aileen, and that photo taken by Mike Picavet at his home after the murder shows she had injuries to her hands and feet.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Which tells you, Christina must have been the attacker.",
      "Alex Morris: That's right.",
      "Araujo was the one with homicidal intent, says Morris, triggered when Abell and Aileen took off with her in the rearview mirror. And he says those threatening texts that she sent to Abell's phone before joining them on the road trip read like a confession.",
      "Alex Morris: There are threats of bodily harm to both Aileen and Zach in the messages.",
      "Peter Van Sant (reading Araujo's text): \"You come near me hoe, I will kill you.\"",
      "Alex Morris: I think it speaks for itself. And that's exactly what happened.",
      "After Aileen's murder, Morris says Araujo wiped down the motel room\u2014using the vinegar that Ronnie Jones would later smell. He says Abell's palm prints on the curtain rod got there when he moved it during the cleanup.",
      "Alex Morris: He was instructed to pick the curtain rod up over there and put it over there.",
      "Peter Van Sant: By?",
      "Alex Morris: Christina.",
      "A toll booth surveillance photo from after the murder shows that Christina Araujo, and not Zach Abell, was the one driving the car. And therefore, Morris says, she was the one in control.",
      "Alex Morris: The evidence indicates Christina to be \u2026 the one giving the directions \u2026 and had everything to be able to manipulate the situation.",
      "Manipulating Zach Abell, says Morris, because of those threats she had been making for years about her father's influence in solving her problems.",
      "Alex Morris: Bottom line is Zach was fearful of Christina's father.",
      "Abell chose not to testify. When Morris made his final arguments to the jury, he concluded the evidence showed there was only one person who wanted Aileen Seiden dead.",
      "ALEX MORRIS (in court): They haven't proven any motive as to why Mr. Abell would be interested in murdering Ms. Seiden, but I'll tell you where motive lies and it's clear as day, and that's with Ms. Araujo.",
      "Alex Morris: The motive being: I want rid of the person who's taken my man.",
      "Peter Van Sant: So jealousy?",
      "Alex Morris: Yes.",
      "In his closing, Patterson said Christina Araujo already accepted her role in this crime. He asked the jury to hold Zach Abell accountable for his part by finding him guilty of murder.",
      "JARRED PATTERSON (in court): They lived together. \u2026They worked together. They own a business together. \u2026 They went to the Sportsman's Lodge together. \u2026 They emptied out the room together. \u2026 They ran away together. \u2026 \u00a0They got arrested together. The only thing they didn't do together was kill Aileen Seiden? No way.",
      "But who would the jury believe?",
      "A QUESTION UNANSWERED",
      "Ronnie Jones: She wasn't born here. \u2026 And she didn't live here. But she was left here. And she'll always be remembered by Franklin County.",
      "Residents of Florida's Forgotten Coast will now long remember Aileen Seiden, says Ronnie Jones. Almost six years after her death, the community waited for justice for the stranger they now had come to embrace as one of their own.",
      "Peter Van Sant: What was going through your mind as the jury begins its deliberation?",
      "Ronnie Jones: Make it quick.",
      "David Adlerstein: I was told by the jury foreman that when they first went in \u2026 there was 10 in favor of first-degree premeditated murder with two holdouts.",
      "After about five hours of deliberations, the jury reached a consensus.",
      "JUDGE ALLMAN (in court): In the case of the State of Florida vs. Zachary Ray Abell \u2026 the defendant is guilty of the lesser included offense of second-degree murder.",
      "Second-degree murder just like Christina Araujo. Adlerstein says the jury foreman told him they just couldn't decide if Abell had actually intended to kill Aileen.",
      "David Adlerstein: They knew that, uh, Christina had pled guilty to second, and I think they eventually said \u2026 we're going to give him the same.",
      "Mike Picavet: It doesn't tell me that they're equally responsible.",
      "Mike Picavet says even with the verdict, he is convinced his friend played no part in Aileen's death.",
      "Mike Picavet: To me, there's an innocent man sitting in jail.",
      "Ronnie Jones: I think they're both just as guilty as the other.",
      "Now retired from law enforcement, Ronnie Jones spends his days tending his bar in Apalachicola. He says he's still left wondering what really happened inside room 15.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Is this case a mystery to you?",
      "Ronnie Jones: It's not a mystery on exactly what happened, but exactly why it happened \u2026 That is what still bothers me to this day. Why?",
      "Like what Aileen might have been about to say that sparked the attack.",
      "Ronnie Jones: It was my understanding in the rumors \u2026 that she was fixing to disclose the fact that she was pregnant.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Pregnant. And was she pregnant? Did you learn that at the autopsy?",
      "Ronnie Jones: I was at the autopsy, and she was not pregnant. \u2026 I don't know if she thought she was or not.",
      "When it was time for sentencing, Abell finally spoke and told the courtroom another twist in this tortured story.",
      "ZACH ABELL (at sentencing): I had stopped, and I had grabbed a Ring Pop. And I proposed to her with a Ring Pop and asked her to marry me. And she said, \"Yes.\" \u2026 And me and Aileen were gonna go our way and leave Christina out of it.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Zach spoke at his sentencing and said that he'd actually proposed to Aileen during this trip.",
      "Franceasca Seiden: Uh, I think that is just \u2026 BS. \u2026 Uh, it's a great story, but no.",
      "JUDGE ALLMAN (at sentencing): I have been in the justice system in one form or another, for 40 years, rarely have I seen the sort of injuries \u2026 that I saw on Aileen Seiden.",
      "The judge told Abell he wished he could impose a harsher punishment before sentencing him to the maximum: life in prison.",
      "Jarred Patterson: In the state of Florida, life means life, we don't have parole.",
      "At her sentencing, Araujo's father Colonel Tony Araujo set the record straight. He said he never used his influence to benefit his daughter, and he recalled the conversation he had with her after the murder.",
      "COL. TONY ARAUJO (at sentencing): \"You will own up to the truth. You will accept responsibility. You will be the voice of the victim, and you will testify under oath in a court of law. \u2026 And then whatever is sentenced to you, that's fine.\"",
      "Jarred Patterson: There was no agreement with her as to the length of sentence \u2026 She gave her statement with the knowledge that she could still receive life in prison.",
      "CHRISTINA ARAUJO (at sentencing): I think about that day every day of my life. \u2026 The details haunt me, and the memories keep me up.",
      "The judge acknowledged her cooperation, and sentenced Araujo to 25 years.",
      "Ronnie Jones: Justice has been served. He won't beat up anymore females; neither will she.",
      "Allie: I think that every woman kind of thinks, \"I would leave if I was in that situation. I would just get up and leave. I would never tolerate that.\"",
      "Aileen's best friend Allie hopes there will be more compassion for those trapped in abusive relationships.",
      "Allie: It's always that, \"I'm sorry. It's never going to happen again.\" \u2026 \u00a0and you believe it, because you're in love and things are good 95% of the time. But the 5% that are bad are so bad.",
      "Peter Van Sant: With your sister gone, how do you want her to be remembered?",
      "Franceasca Seiden: I want her to be remembered as a sweet, loving human being whom \u2026 unfortunately had \u2026 lost her parents at such a young age, but she was still so sweet. Like she was such a sweetheart. Her soul was so kind.",
      "In January 2025, \"Allie\" passed away. \u00a0She was 42.",

    "summary": "The suspects in Aileen Seiden's murder case \u2014 her romantic partners Zach Abell and Christina Aruajo \u2014 each claims the other is her killer.",
    "story": [
      "From reality television, to the plot of \"Bridgerton,\" 2024 might very well be the year of the \"throuple.\" The polyamorous relationship involving three romantic partners, instead of the more conventional two, seems to be popping up everywhere.",
      "And a throuple is at the center of a murder investigated by \"48 Hours\" and correspondent Peter Van Sant in \"Who Killed Aileen Seiden in Room 15?\"\u00a0An encore of the broadcast airs Saturday, July 12 at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "\"We needed to know what happened inside that hotel room outside of three people entered and two came out carrying a body,\" said Franklin County Assistant Prosecutor Jarred Patterson.",
      "The case began when investigators learned of a bloody crime scene in room 15 at a Florida motel and the remains of a woman dumped by the side of a road about six miles away.",
      "\"She had bruises \u2026 from head to toe, covering her entire body,\" lead investigator Ronnie Jones told Van Sant. \"She suffered \u2026 I've never seen anything like it.\"",
      "Jones, now retired from the Franklin County Sheriff's Office, says that not long after the woman's remains were discovered at an abandoned cul-de-sac on April 23, 2018, he connected it to the bloody motel room.",
      "\"I just put two and two together,\" Jones said. \"It wasn't just somebody cut theirself and bled a little bit on the bed. I mean the amount of blood \u2026 tells me that whoever was here was probably deceased.\"",
      "The woman was soon identified as Aileen Seiden, a 31-year-old from about 400 miles away in Miami. Investigators learned that Seiden had been visiting Franklin County and stayed at the motel in room 15, with two other people \u2014 Zachary Abell and Christina Araujo. Learning what happened inside the motel room would mean first understanding the dynamic of Seiden, Abell and Araujo's relationship.",
      "Seiden's best friend spoke to \"48 Hours\" asking that we do not to use her real name and to refer to her as \"Allie.\" She says that when Seiden began dating both Abell and Araujo in 2017, it didn't take long for trouble to start.",
      "\"This whole dynamic started to change where one of them always seemed to be the odd man out or was jealous,\" said Allie. \"And at that point it just started to spiral out of control.\"",
      "Allie says that Seiden would tell her that Abell would physically abuse her.",
      "\"Aileen would call me\u2026 and say, 'You have to come over here, like he hurt me again,'\" Allie said.",
      "Seiden also had physical altercations with Araujo, says Allie, but her friend was afraid to call 911 or go to police for help.",
      "\"She wouldn't tolerate being messed with usually by anyone,\" said Allie. \"However, there was something different about this.\"",
      "Allie says she learned that Seiden's fear about going to police stemmed from threats made by Araujo. According to Allie, Araujo would often say her father \u2014 who has a high position at a south Florida sheriff's department \u2014 could make her problems go away.",
      "\"And the same answer was always that she came from police royalty that she had gotten away with \u2026 everything in the past,\" said Allie.\u00a0 \"And there was going to be no solutions to\u2026 someone like Aileen getting hit.\"",
      "Allie says Seiden suffered through the relationship until the throuple went on a road trip that led them to Franklin County. That was when Allie says Aileen called her saying she needed to find a way out.",
      "\"She said, 'I need your help.'\"",
      "Allie crafted a plan to help Seiden get away from Abell and Araujo, but it wasn't long after that she learned Seiden was dead.",
      "Abell and\u00a0 Araujo were both charged in Seiden's murder. For years, they claimed their innocence. It would take almost six years to bring the case to court, but by then only one of them would be on trial.",

      "At least 109 people are dead and dozens are still missing after devastating flash floods slammed Texas Hill Country, with water rescues taking place along the Guadalupe River, which rose rapidly early Friday morning to the height of a two-story building. Several people remain missing from Camp Mystic\u00a0in Kerr County, a girls' summer camp, officials said.",
      "Of the fatalities so far, 87 have occurred in Kerr County, officials said. Camp Mystic, located along the river in Hunt, Texas,\u00a0confirmed Monday that at least 27 campers and counselors died in the flooding.",
      "\"Our hearts are broken alongside our families that are enduring this unimaginable tragedy. We are praying for them constantly,\" the camp said in a statement. \"We have been in communication with local and state authorities who are tirelessly deploying extensive resources to search for our missing girls. We are deeply grateful for the outpouring of support from community, first responders and officials at every level.\"",
      "At least five Camp Mystic campers are still missing, along with one counselor, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said on Tuesday. There were about 750 children at Camp Mystic when the floods hit, the sheriff said earlier.",
      "President Trump signed a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, at Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's request. On Saturday, Abbott said he visited the summer camp, describing the scene as \"horrendously ravaged.\"",
      "\"Today I visited Camp Mystic. It, and the river running beside it, were horrendously ravaged in ways unlike I've seen in any natural disaster,\" Abbott wrote in a social media post. \"The height the rushing water reached to the top of cabins was shocking. We won't stop until we find every girl who was in those cabins.\"",
      "Operations would continue around the clock to search for anyone affected by the deadly storm, the governor said during a briefing Sunday afternoon.",
      "\"Especially in the Kerrville area, there were so many people camping out near the river, people in RVs and things like that,\" he said. \"There are people that are not known, confirmed missing because we do not know yet who they are.\"",
      "Abbott said searches will persist throughout the Guadalupe River system in the hope of locating anyone else, and he asked the public to contact local officials with information about friends or relatives believed to be lost.",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday he ordered three swiftwater rescue teams to Texas.",
      "Mr. Trump plans to visit Texas on Friday, telling reporters he had wanted to go immediately but would have been \"in their way.\"",
      "At the Vatican, Pope Leo extended a prayer to the flooding victims during Sunday Mass, saying, \"I express my sincere condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones, in particular their daughters who were at summer camp, in the disaster caused by the flooding of the Guadalupe River in Texas in the United States.\"",
      "Although Kerr County was hit hardest by flooding, people have been confirmed dead across five other Texas counties. About 150 miles east of Camp Mystic, Travis County confirmed at least seven deaths, according to local officials. Travis County includes the Texas capital city of Austin. Deaths have also been confirmed in Burnet, Kendall, Williamson, and Tom Green counties.",
      "Officials have conducted more than 160 air rescues, Leitha said in an earlier update, adding that 850 uninjured and eight injured people have been rescued overall as of Saturday.",
      "U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem\u00a0said in a social media post\u00a0that the U.S. Coast Guard was responsible for saving 223 of those people, as dramatic\u00a0video showed Guard members conducting aerial rescues near Kerrville, while dark water covered the ground.",
      "Noem also said Coast Guard rescue swimmer and Petty Officer Scott Ruskan \"saved an astonishing 165 victims in the devastating flooding in Central Texas.  This was the first rescue mission of his career and he was the only triage coordinator at the scene.\" She called Ruskan \"an American hero.\" The Department of Homeland Security oversees the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",
      "\"We've been rescuing people out of these camps by the hundreds, you know, all day,\" Dalton Rice, the city manager for Kerville, said on Saturday night. \"There's a lot of folks that are shelter in place, so we leave them in place to make sure that we get them food, water.\"",
      "Abbott originally signed a federal disaster declaration in the immediate aftermath of the floods early Friday, which he later updated to include several other counties in Texas that were damaged by storms.",
      "Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said in Saturday's briefing that his property was also devastated by the flooding and he \"barely got home\" on Friday. Kelly also said he had visited a funeral home and \"got to see firsthand many of the body bags\" before going on a helicopter ride with Sen. John Cornyn and Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring to survey the damage.",
      "\"It's gonna be a long time before we're ever going to be able to clean it up, much less rebuild it,\" Kelly said. \"We didn't know. We knew we'd get rain, we know the river rises, but nobody saw this coming.\"",
      "Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said during a news briefing on Friday that there hadn't been \"a drop of rain until the tragedy struck\" earlier in the day, and that the Guadalupe River had risen about 26 feet in 45 minutes. Alerts went out around 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. local time Friday, he said.",
      "As questions circulate as to whether the flood warnings and alerts were sufficient and effective, another summer camp near the Guadalupe River, Presbyterian Mo-Ranch Assembly, has received praise for its rapid evacuation.",
      "Lisa Winters, the communications director for the camp, told The Associated Press\u00a0that the facilities manager at Mo-Ranch noticed the river beginning to rise at about 1 a.m. local time Friday. Although camp leadership said they had not received evacuation guidance from local authorities, they quickly relocated about 70 children and adults who were staying overnight in a building near the water.",
      "Speaking to reporters late Friday night aboard Air Force One, Mr. Trump called the floods a \"terrible thing.\" On Saturday, he said his administration was working with state and local officials \"on the ground\" in Texas to respond to the flooding.",

      "How did the Guadalupe River flood so quickly?",
      "Meteorologists say storms in the area converged with remnant moisture from what was formerly\u00a0Tropical Storm Barry, which made landfall in eastern Mexico early last week and moved northward. That produced exceptionally high rainfall totals in a region that is susceptible to flooding.",
      "Rice, Kerrville's city manager, explained how the Guadalupe River flooded so quickly.",
      "\"When you look at the headwaters of the Guadalupe ... there's a north and a south fork,\" Rice said Friday night. \"Since 1987, under normal conditions, if you can call it that, you'll hit water in one of those areas, and those two forks will converge into the Guadalupe, which comes through the city of Kerrville.\"",
      "\"This rain event sat on top of that and dumped more rain than what was forecasted on both of those forks,\" Rice continued. \"When we got the report, it was about 7 feet or so on the south fork, and within a matter of minutes it was up to 29 feet, and all of that converged at Guadalupe.\"",
      "The Guadalupe River at Hunt reached its second-highest height on record, higher than the famous 1987 flood,\u00a0the city said, citing the National Weather Service.",
      "The Texas Division of Emergency Management had multiple meetings since Thursday to prepare, but the National Weather Service \"did not predict the amount of rain\" that actually fell, officials said, adding that forecasters originally estimated up to 8 inches of rainfall for the area.",
      "Kerr County Judge Kelly said the area does \"not have a warning system,\" and authorities were shocked by the ferocity of the floods.",
      "\"We had no reason to believe that this was gonna be any, anything like what's happened here. None whatsoever,\" Kelly told \"CBS Evening News.\"",
      "Texas issued flash flood emergencies in five counties in West Texas on Friday as Hill Country continued to be slammed by severe rain and flooding. Between 5 and 11 inches of rain have fallen in northwestern Bandera County, Central Kerr County, Northeastern Tom Green County, East Central Kerr County and West Central Kendall County,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Weather Service.",
      "Search and rescue operations are ongoing",
      "Hundreds of people on the ground from various units are helping with search and rescue operations, officials said. The operations have included drones, helicopters, rescue divers, boats and high-water vehicles, after Abbott signed a disaster declaration for several counties hit by flooding.",
      "At a news conference, the governor said his declaration \"ensures all the counties will have access to every tool, strategy, personnel that the state of Texas can provide to them, which will be limitless.\"",
      "\"We will stop at nothing to ensure that every asset and person and plane, whatever is needed, is going to be involved in the process of rescuing every last person and ensure everybody involved in this is going to be fully accounted for,\" Abbott said.",
      "Lorena Gullen, who owns a restaurant right next to an RV park that was affected by the floods, said \"raging water\" swept away vehicles, some with people still inside. Residents at the park had been celebrating the Fourth of July.",
      "\"You could also see vehicles coming from up the river with the lights on and hear somebody honking, and they were washing away but they kept going,\" she told \"CBS Evening News.\" \"It was impossible.\"",
      "Some victims identified, including young campers",
      "The confirmed deaths at Camp Mystic include 8-year-old Linnie McCown of Austin, her father told CBS News, and Chloe Childress, an 18-year-old counselor from the Houston area, according to the Kinkaid School, where she had recently graduated.",
      "Campers Eloise Peck, 8; Lila Bonner, 9; and Hadley Hanna, 8, all from the Dallas area, also died, their families said.",
      "Two sisters from Dallas\u00a0\u2014 13-year-old Blair Harber and 11-year-old Brooke Harber \u2014 were among those confirmed dead Saturday by the St. Rita Catholic Community Church in Dallas. The sisters were not at Camp Mystic but were staying with their grandparents in an area along the Guadalupe River where the flooding occurred. Their grandparents remained unaccounted for, according to the church. The girls' parents were in a separate cabin and were not harmed.",
      "On Friday, Patrick addressed the parents of children at Camp Mystic. The lieutenant governor, who briefly acted as governor while Abbott was on vacation, said they are praying for all those missing \"to be found alive.\"",
      "\"If they are alive and safe, we will find them and bring them home to you,\" Patrick said Friday.",
      "Camp Mystic is an all-girls summer camp that runs several camps attended by thousands of children during the summer, Patrick said. In a statement read Friday by the lieutenant governor, the camp said they did not have power, water or Wi-Fi in the aftermath of what it called a \"catastrophic level\" of flooding. The statement added that \"the highway has washed away, so we are struggling to get more help.\"",

      "Here's where you can donate to help central Texas flood recovery",
      "The camp sits on a strip known as \"flash flood alley,\" Austin Dickson, CEO of the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, told The Associated Press. The foundation is a charitable endowment that collects donations to help nonprofits responding to the disaster.",
      "\"When it rains, water doesn't soak into the soil,\" Dickson said. \"It rushes down the hill.\"",
      "Meteorologists say the area has been under extreme drought conditions, which only made the flooding worse because dry, parched soil doesn't have the capacity to absorb a deluge of water as quickly and becomes overwhelmed, leading to flash flooding.",
      "Climate change intensifies both droughts and flooding because a warmer climate can extend both intense dry spells and extreme precipitation.",
      "Campers describe evacuations",
      "Elinor Lester, 13, told The AP that she and her cabinmates were evacuated from Camp Mystic by helicopter. Her cabin was on elevated ground, but younger campers bunked in cabins situated along the riverbank, she said. Those were the first to flood. Younger campers came up the hill for shelter.",
      "\"The camp was completely destroyed,\" she said. \"It was really scary. Everyone I know personally is accounted for, but there are people missing that I know of and we don't know where they are.\"",
      "One 8-year-old camper was swept six miles down the river but survived, sisters Natalie and Emily Raiford told CBS News correspondent Jason Allen.",
      "\"All of the sudden we just hear somebody say, 'help, help,'\" one of the sisters said. \"She said that her cabin was flooding and someone opened a window and she just flew out of it.\"",
      "Two other camps along the Guadalupe River,\u00a0Camp La Junta\u00a0and\u00a0Camp Waldemar, said in Instagram posts that all of their campers and staff there were safe.",
      "Two young brothers, Braeden and Brock Davis, were among the campers at Camp La Junta.",

      "DETECTIVE 2: What we need from you that would probably \u2026 make a lot more sense is to \u2026 tell us what that argument was about.",
      "MELISSA TURNER: I would say he woke me up and we got in an argument over that. Because he was still up at four in the morning drinking.",
      "DETECTIVE 2: OK. So, just so I'm clear, you do have memory of what happened, right?",
      "MELISSA TURNER: Yes.",
      "DETECTIVE: At 4 o'clock.",
      "MELISSA TURNER: Yes.",
      "DETECTIVE: Why were you yellin' at him, \"Bitch, get up. Bitch, get up\"?",

      "DETECTIVE: You also said a couple of other things like, \"Stay down. So f***ing die.\" what are you talking about?",
      "MELISSA TURNER: That was me being pissed off at him that he fell over.",

      "Up until then, Sean and Jennifer say the couple didn't appear to have any problems, but Sean says that Melissa did put a wedge between him and Matthew.",
      "Sean Trussler: She just totally isolated him, and her, from the rest of the world. \u2026 and the truth is, like \u2026 how controlling and manipulating Rose was.",
      "Sean says he hadn't seen Matthew during the last six months of his life. The brothers had had a falling out after Matthew stopped working with Sean at his construction business.",

      "Jennifer Giles: And I really feel like \u2014 the pressure, and the stress, and the fact that it was more, and more, and more just paid its toll on him.",

      "The two met in 2012 when they were studying make-up effects at Douglas Education Center near Pittsburgh. Back then, Melissa was running a popular fitness blog after losing 100 pounds, later documenting her transformation on social media.",

      "Cameron Walega: She would scream at times that it would pierce your ear. \u2026 There were times where she was just unpredictable. Absolutely unpredictable.",
      "Sean and Jennifer now wonder if Melissa's volatility may have escalated an argument with Matthew on the night he died. Did he want out of the adult entertainment business?",
      "Sean Trussler: I think maybe that night he was like \"Yo, I'm done with this. I'm washin' my hands.\"",
      "Jennifer Giles: She didn't like whatever he said to her. And it made her blow her top.",

      "Melissa Turner: Matt \u2026 had his knife out. It was the black \u2014 tactical switchblade.",
      "Melissa Turner: There were times where he would get really upset and he would try and use it on himself. \u2026 and, so, it was a common thing for me to try and take a knife away from him.",
      "Melissa Turner: On this night \u2026 He didn't want to let go of the knife.",
      "Melissa says Matthew was drunk and despondent. They struggled over the knife, she says, but after she managed to take it away, she says Matthew grabbed her by the neck and squeezed \u2014 a detail she failed to tell detectives during her interrogation.",

Prosecutors believed it didn't show any suspicious activity the night of Matthew's death. But just before the trial, they discovered they misread the time and date.",
      "Katherine Fand: I'll be honest, I misunderstood the timing. It's not recorded in Eastern Standard Time. It is recorded in Universal Time.",

      "Melissa Turner: It'll be a world of weight off my shoulders for this trial to just be over.",
      "The jury will hear nothing about her videos \u2014 her cosplay modeling and acting out fantasies online. The judge ruled it wasn't relevant to the case. Prosecutor Chinwe Fossett sees it differently.",

      "Melissa's attorney, John Trevena, told the jury that she didn't mean to kill Matthew. That she stabbed him in self-defense during that struggle over the knife.",
      "JOHN TREVENA (in court): Who killed Matthew Trussler? Matthew Trussler killed Matthew Trussler.",
      "John Trevena: He did. He did it to himself because of his actions and his behaviors. \u2026 His drinking, his emotional abuse.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You're saying that Melissa had the right to kill him because he was drunk?",
      "John Trevena: No. \u2026 Melissa had the right to kill him to defend herself from being strangled.",

      "Erin Moriarty: Why do you believe that Melissa killed Matthew Trussler.",
      "Chinwe Fossett: I think she was intoxicated, and I do think that she went far beyond anything she thought she would do. \u2026 Maybe she was just so frustrated with his drinking. \u2026 that she harms him so badly that he ends up dying.",
      "At trial, Melissa decided to take a risk and testify. She described Matthew as an alcoholic who had exhibited abusive and unsettling behaviors in the past",
      "MELISSA TURNER (in court): There were times where he would push me \u2026 and punch the walls beside my head.",
      "MELISSA TURNER (in court): I had seen him cut himself, burn himself, stab himself.",

      "At 4:01 a.m., the video shows Melissa running from the direction of the kitchen; she appears distressed. This is also around the time when the camera across the street picks up audio of screaming and yelling. The next video clip is at 4:08 a.m.",

    "summary": "President Trump said the U.S. will impose steep levies on imports from 14 countries starting next month, raising pressure on trading partners.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday said the U.S will impose 25% tariffs on goods from South Korea and Japan by Aug. 1, while also threatening to hit a dozen other nations with steep import duties by next month.",
      "Mr. Trump initially\u00a0posted\u00a0two nearly identical letters, addressed to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, on his Truth Social media platform outlining the new tariffs. A 90-day freeze on country-specific U.S. tariffs on dozens of nations, including Japan and South Korea, expires on July 9. That deadline, however, is no longer significant, with Mr. Trump saying on social media that \"tariffs will start being paid on Aug. 1, 2025.\"",
      "\"In other words, all money will be due and payable starting Aug. 1, 2025 \u2014 No extensions will be granted,\" he added.",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday afternoon also announced separate tariffs on an additional 12 trade partners. Myanmar and Laos face a 40% tariff rate, the highest of the new levies the U.S. is threatening to deploy. Thailand and Cambodia face potential tariffs of 36%, while Mr. Trump announced slightly lower tariffs of 35% on both Bangladesh and Serbia.",
      "Indonesia is the lone country facing a possible tariff rate of 32%. Imports from South Africa and Bosnia and Herzegovina will be subject to 30% duties as of Aug.\u00a01, while goods from Malaysia, Kazakhstan and Tunisia will be taxed at 25%, Mr. Trump said in letters posted on Truth Social. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said on Truth Social that more tariff letters \"will be sent today, tomorrow, and for the next short period of time.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a media briefing Monday that Mr. Trump is set to sign an executive order extending the July 9 tariff freeze. The order delays the deadline to \"Aug. 1 so the reciprocal tariff rate, or these new rates that will be provided in this correspondence to these foreign leaders, will be going out the door within the next month,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Leavitt also said Mr. Trump was planning to send tariff letters to \"approximately 12 other countries\" informing them of new U.S. levies on their goods. She did not indicate when the notices will be sent out, but said Mr. Trump will post them on Truth Social \"so you can enjoy them yourself.\"",
      "Trump is also expected to announce more deals with U.S. trade partners before the beginning of August, she said.",
      "Mr. Trump included identical language in each letter informing recipients that the notice \"demonstrates the strength and commitment of our Trading Relationship,\" and that \"we invite you to participate in the extraordinary Economy of the United States.\"",
      "The 25% tariffs on South Korea and Japan are in line with the so-called \"reciprocal\" rates Mr. Trump had announced when he unveiled country-specific duties on April 2. At the time, the Trump administration said it would impose tariffs of 24% and 25% on imports from Japan and South Korea, respectively.",
      "\"If none of these 14 countries manage to seal a preliminary trade deal (and assuming Trump doesn't delay implementation for another month) then the effective tariff rate on U.S. imports would rise from 15.5% to 17.3%,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a report. In 2024, the effective tariff rate on imports was 2.5%, he noted.",
      "25% tariff would bog down trade",
      "Trade policy expert Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that Monday's announcements \"are simply indications that he is making them pay full admission price to access the U.S. market.\"",
      "\"At 25%, it is possible, but challenging, to trade with Japan and Korea. This rate was carefully set at the higher side of the spectrum. In essence trade with the U.S. now is a pay to play proposition for Japan, Korea and likely others to come,\" he said.",
      "Appleton added that the country-specific rates announced Monday do not bode well for other nations looking to strike deals with the U.S., including EU countries, Canada and Switzerland.",
      "Economists warn that wide-ranging U.S. tariffs on trading partners could spark another bout of inflation and hinder economic growth, while global financial markets have heaved at the prospect of significantly higher trading costs.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal magistrate judge said Monday that the Justice Department's criminal case against Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan should move forward and recommended that her bid to dismiss the indictment be denied.",
      "Dugan was arrested in April and charged with two federal counts after she was accused of helping a man who is in the U.S. illegally evade federal immigration authorities during a law enforcement operation at her courthouse in Milwaukee. She pleaded not guilty to one count of concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, and one count of obstruction, a felony.",
      "Dugan has argued that the case against her should be dismissed on the grounds that she was acting within the scope of her official duties as a state court judge and is therefore entitled to judicial immunity. She also said that the federal prosecution violates Wisconsin's sovereignty by interfering with the duties of an elected state judge and disrupting active proceedings.",
      "In a filing seeking to dismiss the indictment, Dugan's lawyers called the government's prosecution \"virtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional.\"",
      "But federal prosecutors said the charges should not be dropped and urged a federal judge to deny Dugan's bid to dismiss the case. They said Dugan's request for a dismissal is \"unprecedented\" and would ignore \"well-established law that has long permitted judges to be prosecuted for crimes they commit.\"",
      "\"Such a ruling would give state court judges carte blanche to interfere with valid law enforcement actions by federal agents in public hallways of a courthouse, and perhaps even beyond,\" they wrote in a filing last month. \"Dugan's desired ruling would, in essence, say that judges are 'above the law,' and uniquely entitled to interfere with federal law enforcement.\"",
      "In a report filed Monday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph recommended that Dugan's attempt to dismiss the charges should be rejected.",
      "\"It is well-established and undisputed that judges have absolute immunity from civil lawsuits for monetary damages when engaging in judicial acts,\" she wrote in a 37-page filing. \"This, however, is not a civil case. And review of the case law does not show an extension of this established doctrine to the criminal context.\"",
      "Joseph stressed, however, that her recommendations, which are non-binding, do not speak to the merits of the allegations against Dugan, who is presumed innocent until proven guilty. A jury trial before U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman was set to begin July 21, but has been delayed.",
      "In arguing that she should be shielded from federal prosecution, Dugan cited the Supreme Court's 2024 ruling in a case involving President Trump and the 2020 presidential election. The high court found that the president is immune from prosecution for official acts taken while in office.",
      "But Joseph wrote she is \"unconvinced\" that common law or the Supreme Court's decision in Mr. Trump's case \"provide the authority for applying the civil framework of absolute judicial immunity for judicial acts to the prosecution of judges for crimes that relate to official duties.\"",
      "The magistrate judge concluded that judicial immunity does not shield Dugan from prosecution for allegedly violating criminal laws while performing her official judicial duties.",
      "\"There is no firmly established absolute judicial immunity barring criminal prosecution of judges for judicial acts,\" Joseph said.",
      "Adelman will have the final word on whether to grant Dugan's request to dismiss the indictment. Federal prosecutors and Dugan's lawyers are set to appear before the judge Wednesday to discuss the status of the case and address additional scheduling matters.",

      "\"There's nobody like us in the United States Senate,\" Osborn said in a campaign video announcing the bid Tuesday, touting his background as a mechanic, a Navy veteran, and a registered independent.",
      "Osborn, 50, was a political newcomer when he launched his 2024 Senate bid. A union leader who led the strike at Omaha's Kellogg plant in 2021, his campaign received a surge of outside funding that forced Republicans to redouble their efforts in a race that was thought to be an easy win. Osborn went on to significantly outperform Kamala Harris in the deep-red state. But he ultimately lost to Sen. Deb Fischer, the Republican incumbent, by seven percentage points.",
      "Now, Osborn is taking on Ricketts, while positioning the bid as representative of a broader fight between the \"billionaire class\" and the working class.",
      "\"I'm running for Senate because Congress shouldn't just be a playground for the rich,\" Osborn said.",
      "\"Sen. Ricketts has consistently worked for and voted to secure the border and cut taxes for Nebraska workers, families, and seniors,\" Ricketts' campaign spokesman Will Coup said in a statement. \"Dan Osborn is bought and paid for by his liberal, out-of-state, coastal donors. Dan Osborn will side with Chuck Schumer over Nebraska families and vote with Democrats to open the border, hike taxes, and stop the America First agenda.\"",
      "Ricketts was appointed to the Senate in 2023 upon former Sen. Ben Sasse's resignation to become president of the University of Florida. Last year, Ricketts handily won his bid in a special election to serve out the remaining two years of Sasse's term. Ricketts, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, is the son of Omaha billionaire Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade, and owner of the Chicago Cubs.",
      "Osborn has accused Ricketts of \"trying to buy power in Nebraska,\" while saying that when \"working people need his help,\" it's \"always the same old story: Crickets from Ricketts.\"",

      "In the 2024 race, Fischer accused her independent challenger of being a \"Democrat in disguise,\" while leaning on an endorsement from President Trump. The president endorsed Ricketts in April, claiming that Osborn is a \"Radical Left Open Border Extremist, who will put our Country, and Safety, LAST,\" while \"Pete, on the other hand, will ALWAYS put Nebraska, and America, FIRST.\"",

      "Officials have laid out a grid over the search area. Each segment can reach over a mile and take between one and three hours to search, Dalton Rice, the city manager of Kerrville, said at a news conference Monday morning.",
      "Rice reiterated for volunteers to \"stay out of the way\" so first responders aren't waylaid ensuring that volunteers \"don't become victims themselves.\"",
      "Some volunteers move elsewhere",
      "When volunteers were asked by official responders to leave sites in Kerrville, some moved to help search in the unincorporated community of Center Point on Monday, said Cord Shiflet, who'd rallied volunteers through a Facebook post.",
      "On Sunday, Shiflet had falsely claimed on Facebook that two girls had been rescued in a tree days after the flooding, but he said Monday that he'd received bad information and apologized.",
      "The mistake caught the attention of U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, who represents the area and urged people to be careful about false news.",
      "\"It's not fair to families and it distracts law enforcement,\" Roy posted on the social platform X.",
      "At Center Point on Monday, dozens of undeterred volunteers gathered, including Rubio and Bryan Dutton, in the afternoon heat. Dutton, a veteran who said he had friends at an RV camp affected by the floods, had been waiting to get off work to join the droves of residents coming out to assist and provide food.",
      "\"We do what we can do,\" Dutton said. \"That's how Texas is.\"",

    "summary": "Efforts to decrease alarmingly high rates of suicide among construction workers and prevent burnout in health care workers are in jeopardy.",
    "story": [
      "In Connecticut, construction workers in the Local 478 union who complete addiction treatment are connected with a recovery coach who checks in daily, attends recovery meetings with them, and helps them navigate their return to work for a year.",
      "In Pennsylvania, doctors applying for credentials at Geisinger hospitals are not required to answer intrusive questions about mental health care they've received, reducing the stigma around clinicians seeking treatment.",
      "The workplace is the new ground zero for addressing mental health. That means companies \u2014 employees and supervisors alike \u2014 must confront crises, from addiction to suicide. The two seemingly unrelated initiatives in Connecticut and Pennsylvania have one common factor: They grew out of the work of a little known federal agency called the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.",
      "It's one of the key federal agencies leading workplace mental health efforts, from decreasing alarmingly high rates of suicide among construction workers to addressing burnout and depression among health care workers.",
      "But after gaining considerable traction during the COVID-19 pandemic, that work is now imperiled. The Trump administration has fired a majority of NIOSH staffers and is proposing severe reductions to its budget.",
      "Private industry and nonprofits may be able to fill some of the gap, but they can't match the federal government's resources. And some companies may not prioritize worker well-being above profits.",
      "About 60% of employees worldwide say their job is the chief factor affecting their mental health, according to a survey by human resources consulting company UKG. A 2015 study in Management Science suggests workplace stress causes about 120,000 deaths and accounts for up to 8% of health costs in the U.S. each year.",
      "\"Workplace mental health is one of the most underappreciated yet critical areas we could intervene on,\" said Thomas Cunningham, a former senior behavioral scientist at NIOSH who took a buyout this year. \"We were just starting to get some strong support from all the players involved,\" he said. \"This administration has blown that apart.\"",
      "NIOSH, established in 1970 by the same law that created the better-known Occupational Safety and Health Administration, is charged with producing research that informs workplace safety regulations. It's best known for monitoring black lung disease in coal miners and for testing masks, like the N95s used during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "As part of the mass firing of federal workers this spring, NIOSH was slated to lose upward of 900 employees. After pushback from members of Congress \u2014 primarily over coal miner and first responder safety \u2014 the administration reinstated 328. It's not clear if any rehired workers focus on mental health initiatives.",
      "At least two lawsuits challenging the firings are winding through the courts. Meanwhile, hundreds of NIOSH employees remain on administrative leave, unable to work.",
      "Emily Hilliard, a press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, asserted in a statement that \"the nation's critical public health functions remain intact and effective,\" including support for coal miners and firefighters through NIOSH. \"Improving the mental health of American workers remains a key priority for HHS, and that work is ongoing,\" she wrote.",
      "She did not answer specific questions from KFF Health News about whether any reinstated NIOSH employees lead mental health efforts or who is continuing such work.",
      "Reducing suicides and addiction in construction and mining",
      "Over 5,000 construction workers die by suicide annually \u2014 five times the number who die from work-related injuries, according to the Center for Construction Research and Training. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows miners suffer high rates too. And nearly a fifth of workers in both industries have a substance use disorder, double the rate among all U.S. workers, according to a report from NORC at the University of Chicago and the National Safety Council.",
      "Kyle Zimmer recognized these issues as early as 2010. That's when he started a members' assistance program for the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 478 in Connecticut. He hired a licensed clinician on retainer and developed partnerships with local treatment facilities.",
      "At first, workers pushed back, said Zimmer, who recently retired after 25 years in the union, many as director of health and safety.",
      "Their perception was, \"If I speak up about this issue, I'm going to be blackballed from the industry,\" he said.",
      "But slowly, that changed \u2014 with NIOSH's help, Zimmer said.",
      "The agency developed an approach to worker safety called Total Worker Health, which identifies physical and mental health as critical to occupational safety. It also shifts the focus from how individuals can keep themselves safe to how policies and environments can be changed to keep them safe.",
      "Over decades, the concept spread from research journals and universities to industry conferences, unions, and eventually workers, Zimmer said. People began accepting that mental health was an occupational safety issue, he said. That paved the way for NIOSH's Miner Health Program to develop resources on addiction and for Zimmer to establish the recovery coaching program in Connecticut.",
      "\"We have beat that stigma down by a lot,\" Zimmer said.",
      "Other countries have made more progress on mental health at work, said Sally Spencer-Thomas, co-chair of the International Association for Suicide Prevention's workplace special interest group. But with the growth of the Total Worker Health approach, a 2022 surgeon general report on the topic, and increasing research, the U.S. appeared to finally be catching up. The recent cuts to NIOSH suggest \"we're kind of losing our footing,\" she said.",
      "Last year, Natalie Schwatka, an assistant professor at the Colorado School of Public Health's Center for Health, Work & Environment, received a five-year NIOSH grant to build a toolkit to help leaders in labor-intensive industries, such as construction and mining, strengthen worker safety and mental health.",
      "While many companies connect people to treatment, few focus on preventing mental illness, Schwatka said. NIOSH funding \"allows us to do innovative things that maybe industry wouldn't necessarily start.\"",
      "Her team planned to test the toolkit with eight construction companies in the coming years. But with few NIOSH employees left to process annual renewals, the funds could stop flowing anytime.",
      "The consequence of losing such research is not confined to academia, Zimmer said. \"Workers' health and safety is very much in jeopardy.\"",
      "Health care sector braces for fallout from NIOSH cuts",
      "For a long time, clinicians have had troubling rates of addiction and suicide risk. Just after the height of the pandemic, a NIOSH survey found nearly half of health workers reported feeling burned out and nearly half intended to look for a new job. The agency declared a mental health crisis in that workforce.",
      "NIOSH received $20 million through the American Rescue Plan Act to create a national campaign to improve the mental health of health workers.",
      "The results included a step-by-step guide for hospital leaders to improve systems to support their employees, as well as tips and suggested language for leaders to discuss well-being and for workers to advocate for better policies.",
      "Cunningham, the behavioral scientist who left NIOSH this year, helped lead the effort. He said the goal was to move beyond asking health workers to be resilient or develop meditation skills.",
      "\"We're not saying resilience is bad, but we're trying to emphasize that's not the first thing we need to focus on,\" he said.",
      "Instead, NIOSH suggested eliminating intrusive questions about mental health that weren't relevant to keeping patients safe from hospital credentialing forms and offering workers more input on how their schedules are made.",
      "The agency partnered on this work with the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes' Foundation, named after an emergency medicine doctor who died by suicide during the pandemic. The foundation extended the campaign by helping health systems in four states implement pieces of the guide and learn from one another.",
      "Foundation leaders recently appeared on Capitol Hill with Noah Wyle, who plays an emergency physician on the TV series \"The Pitt,\" to advocate for renewed federal funding for this work.",
      "Corey Feist, foundation CEO and co-founder, said renewing that funding to NIOSH is crucial to get this guide out to all hospitals.",
      "Without those resources, \"it's just going to really delay this transformation of health care that needs to happen,\" he said.",
      "Who can fill the gap?",
      "TJ Lyons, a multidecade construction industry safety professional who has worked at big-name companies such as Gilbane, Turner, and DPR Construction, is confident that workplace mental health will remain a priority despite the NIOSH cuts.",
      "General contractors and project owners have been incorporating budget lines for mental health support for years, he said, sharing an example of a $1 billion project that included a mental health clinician on call for four hours several days a week. Workers would make appointments to sit in their pickup trucks during lunch breaks and talk to her, he said.",
      "Now when these big companies subcontract with smaller firms, they often ask if the subcontractors provide mental health support for workers, Lyons said.",
      "But others are skeptical that industry can replace NIOSH efforts.",
      "Several workplace safety experts said smaller companies lack the means to commission research studies and larger companies may not share the results publicly, as a federal agency would. Nor would they have the same credibility.",
      "\"Private industry is going to provide what the people paying them want to provide,\" said a NIOSH employee and member of the American Federation of Government Employees union, currently on administrative leave, who was granted anonymity for fear of professional retaliation.",
      "Without federal attention on workplace mental health, \"people may leave the workforce,\" she said. \"Workers may die.\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

      "\"We're going to send some more weapons. We have to. They have to be able to defend themselves,\" Mr. Trump told reporters during a White House event with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday night.",
      "The president said the shipments will consist of \"defensive weapons, primarily,\" saying Ukraine is \"getting hit very hard\" and \"so many people are dying in that mess.\"",
      "\"At President Trump's direction, the Department of Defense is sending additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to ensure the Ukrainians can defend themselves while we work to secure a lasting peace and ensure the killing stops,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement later Monday night. \"Our framework for POTUS to evaluate military shipments across the globe remains in effect and is integral to our America First defense priorities.\"",
      "Matthew Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said the president has taken issue with Russia's strikes on Ukrainian cities.",

      "Asked Tuesday about Mr. Trump's announcement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow that \"these actions probably do not align with attempts to promote a peaceful resolution\" to the war in Ukraine, according to Russia's state-run news agencies.",
      "The United States has provided Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in weapons and other assistance since February 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of the country, according to the Council on Foreign Relations think tank.",
      "Last week, the White House confirmed it had decided to halt some shipments to Ukraine. A White House official said the pause was part of a broader review of weapons transfers to other countries. A U.S. official told CBS News the administration was concerned about military stockpiles falling too low.",
      "But during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he doesn't know who ordered the pause in weapons shipments to Ukraine.",
      "\"Putin is not treating human beings right. He's killing too many people,\" the president told reporters during the meeting. \"So we're sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine, and I've approved that.\"",
      "In comments to reporters last week, Mr. Trump said his administration\u00a0was still sending weapons to Ukraine, but former President Joe Biden \"emptied out our whole country giving them weapons, and we have to make sure that we have enough for ourselves.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week. Mr. Trump told reporters he was \"very disappointed\" with the Putin call, saying he \"didn't make any progress\" with the Russian leader.",
      "Mr. Trump also said Monday he's \"not happy with President Putin at all.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said his call with Mr. Trump was \"very important and fruitful,\" adding the two leaders \"agreed that we will work together to strengthen protection of our skies.\"",

At least 30,000 people were killed by the military, some tossed out of airplanes into the ocean after being tortured.

      "Logan pointed to the company's human exploitation policy, which includes removing \"content where a third-party actor recruits for, facilitates or benefits from commercial sexual activity,\" as well as the company's adult sexual solicitation policy which, amongst other things, removes \"content that offers, asks or provides methods of contact for prostitution.\"",
      "Royal Garden Club's Telegram channel explicitly offered potential clients access to \"over 7,000 girls worldwide for fun dates, relationships and hot sex.\" That included advertising a \"VIP lifetime\" offer of $8,000 of \"top models, bloggers, actresses, athletes, magazine cover girls, adult stars.\"",
      "Royal Garden Club claimed on its Telegram that it is a \"full-service escort agency operating legally,\" pointing to the fact that the business, R GARDEN LLP, is registered in the United Kingdom.

      "Reached on Telegram, an anonymous moderator for the Royal Garden Club channel declined to comment when asked how it was able to promote ads on Instagram, and what type of service the company offers.",
      "Another paid Instagram ad was promoted by an account called men.s_dreams, which appeared to be a shell account with very little content and very few followers. That advertisement promoted \"meeting beautiful girls\" and included a link to a Telegram channel. The Telegram channel in question, called \"Meeting with Girls,\" had messages written in both Russian and English promoting \"girls ready to fly with you anywhere in the world.\"",
      "That channel posted profile pictures of hundreds of women and noted their nationalities. CBS News could not independently verify the identity of the women, nor verify if they had consented to their images being shared by the channel. The anonymous moderator of the account repeatedly posted messages on the public channel asking prospective clients to send private messages if they wanted to \"know something about girls, sex or anything.\"",
      "CBS News has also sought comment from this account about how it was able to pay for ads on Instagram.",
      "While Meta has strict content moderation policies, Telegram is known for its hands-off approach. The platform's content moderation policies outlined on its website do not include anything beyond banning \"illegal pornographic content on publicly viewable Telegram channels,\" or engaging in \"activities that are recognized as illegal in the majority of countries.\" CBS News has sought comment from Telegram as to whether the channels in question violate the platform's policies or will cause Telegram to review its policies.",
      "In recent months, Meta has struggled to combat a rise in sexualized paid advertisements appearing for some users, despite such ads violating its terms of use. A CBS News investigation last month\u00a0uncovered hundreds of ads\u00a0on its platforms promoting \"nudify\" apps \u2014 AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfake images of real people.",
      "Many of these ads targeted male users between the ages of 18 and 65, in the United States and the European Union.",

    "summary": "Yemen's Houthi rebels killed 3 mariners with an attack on a ship in the Red Sea, a European naval force says, fueling concern over a possible new wave of attacks by the Iran-backed group.",
    "story": [
      "Dubai, United Arab Emirates\u00a0\u2014 An attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on a Liberian-flagged cargo ship in the Red Sea killed three mariners and wounded two others, a European Union naval force said Tuesday. The attack on the Greek-owned Eternity C followed a claim by the Houthis to have attacked and sank another vessel on Monday in the Red Sea, a vital maritime trade route.",
      "The twin assaults are the first Houthi attacks on shipping since November 2024 and could signal the start of a new campaign by the Iran-backed Yemeni rebels threatening the waterway, which had begun to see more ships pass through it in recent weeks.",
      "The Eternity C bulk carrier had been heading north toward the Suez Canal when it came under fire by men in small boats and by bomb-carrying drones on Monday night. Security guards on board also fired their weapons. The European Union Operation Aspides and the private security firm Ambrey both reported those details.",
      "While the Houthis haven't claimed the attack, Yemen's exiled government and the EU force blamed the rebels for the attack.",
      "The EU force offered the casualty information, saying one of the wounded crew members lost his leg in the attack. The crew remain stuck on board the vessel, which is now drifting in the Red Sea.",
      "The Houthis separately attacked the Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned bulk carrier Magic Seas on Sunday with drones, missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire, forcing its crew of 22 to abandon the vessel. The rebels later said the Magic Seas sank in the Red Sea.",
      "The two attacks, and a round of Israeli airstrikes early Monday morning targeting infrastructure in rebel-held areas of Yemen, have raised fears of a renewed Houthi campaign against shipping that could again draw in U.S. and Western forces, particularly after President Trump's administration targeted the rebels in a major airstrike campaign in April.",
      "The attacks come at a sensitive moment in the Middle East, as a possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war hangs in the balance, and as Iran weighs whether to restart negotiations over its nuclear program following American airstrikes targeting its most sensitive atomic sites during the Israel-Iran war in June.",
      "The Houthis started launching strikes against vessels in the Red Sea, including U.S. warships, and against Israel, in what they describe as solidarity with the Palestinians, soon after Hamas sparked\u00a0the war in Gaza\u00a0by launching its unprecedented terrorist attack on Israel in October 2023.",
      "Between November 2023 and January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. Their campaign has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually. Shipping through the Red Sea, while still lower than normal, has increased in recent weeks.",
      "The Houthis paused attacks until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. That ended weeks later and the Houthis hadn't attacked a vessel until this weekend, though they did continue occasional missile attacks targeting Israel.",

      "In Urk, a fishing village in the northern Netherlands, the sea has long been the lifeblood for families \u2014 but has often taken loved ones in return.",
      "Some bodies never surfaced. Others washed ashore on German or Danish coasts and were buried in unnamed graves.",
      "Despite the tragedy, Van den Berg \u2014 the last of six children \u2014 became a fisherman like his brothers, defying their mother's terror that the North Sea would claim her sons too.",
      "\"We never found his body,\" he told AFP in a low voice, mumbling under the brim of his hat.",
      "But after decades of uncertainty, advances in DNA technology and artificial intelligence have given Van den Berg renewed hope.",

      "\"With AI, we search for press articles published after a body washed ashore, possibly in specific circumstances,\" said Frans Hakvoort, 44.",
      "\"We enter all this information into a database to see if we can establish a link. If so, we contact local authorities to see if they can exhume the body.\"",
      "The Netherlands leads other North Sea countries in identifying the missing, he said, with about 90 percent of unknown bodies exhumed and all DNA profiles stored in a European database.",
      "Given the usual fishing areas and prevailing currents, Urk fishermen are more likely to be buried on German or Danish coasts, he said.",
      "The foundation has called on the public to help identify unknown graves in Germany and Denmark.",
      "\"Denmark and Germany in particular are of great importance at the moment, because we expect that relatively many fishermen have washed ashore there. All help is welcome, we also want to appeal to holidaymakers,\" Frans Hakvoort\u00a0told the Het Ukerland newspaper.",
      "The foundation works mainly with volunteers and has to make do with money from donors and sponsors. Hakvoort told NOS that recently one member of the public donated 5,000 euros to the cause.",
      "\"It remains an open wound\"",
      "Jan van den Berg runs his fingers over his father's name, engraved on a monument overlooking Urk beach to honour lost fishermen.",
      "The list is long. More than 300 names \u2014 fathers, brothers, and sons, with dates stretching back to the 18th century.",
      "Among the names are about 30 fishermen never found. Kees Korf, missing since 1997, aged 19. Americo Martins, 47, in 2015.",
      "A statue of a woman, her back turned to the sea, represents all these mothers and wives hoping their loved-one returns.",
      "\"My father disappeared during a storm on a freezing October night in 1954,\" says Van den Berg.",

      "The tragedy still haunts the family to this day.",
      "\"When they pulled the nets on deck with fish, my older brothers always feared there might be something that looked like a human,\" Van den Berg said.",

      "He was among those who found the body of Jan Jurie, the eldest, four months later.",
      "The others were never found.",
      "\"Not a day goes by without thinking of them, all those men, and that is why I take part in the searches and give my DNA, because it remains an open wound,\" he said. \"I would like to have at least a small bone of my father to place in my mother's grave.\"",

    "summary": "Trump has made it clear that he wants an Israel-Hamas ceasefire to be his next diplomatic achievement. Can he convince Netanyahu the time is right to make a deal?",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv, Israel\u00a0\u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump sought to take a victory lap Monday after their recent joint strikes on Iran, hailed by both as an unmitigated success. But as they meet for the third time this year at the White House, the outwardly triumphant visit will be dogged by Israel's 21-month war against Hamas in Gaza and questions over how hard Mr. Trump will push for an end to the conflict.",
      "\"This is a historic victory,\" Netanyahu said at the White House of the strikes against Iran. \"This has already changed the face of the Middle East.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has made it clear that following the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, he would like to see the Gaza conflict end soon, ideally with a ceasefire agreement reached this week. The meeting between Mr. Trump and Netanyahu could give new urgency to a U.S. ceasefire proposal being discussed by Israel and Hamas, but whether it will lead to a deal that ends the war is unclear.",
      "\"The optics will be very positive,\" said Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington. \"But behind the victory lap are going to be some very serious questions.\"",
      "Before departing for Washington on Sunday, Netanyahu praised the cooperation with the U.S. for bringing a \"huge victory over our shared enemy.\" He struck a positive note on a ceasefire for Gaza, saying he was working \"to achieve the deal under discussion, on the terms we agreed to.\"",
      "\"I think that the discussion with President Trump can certainly help advance that result, which all of us hope for,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Israel and Hamas appear to be inching toward a new ceasefire agreement that would bring about a 60-day pause in the fighting, send aid flooding into Gaza and free at least some of the remaining 50 hostages held in the territory, 20 of whom Netanyahu says are still alive.",
      "But a perennial sticking point is whether the ceasefire will end the war altogether. Hamas has said it is willing to free all the hostages in exchange for an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu has said the war will only end when Hamas is militarily defeated or surrenders, disarms and goes into exile \u2014 something the terrorist group's remaining leaders have refused to do.",
      "Trump's quest to be known as peacemaker",
      "Mr. Trump has made it clear that he wants to be known as a peacemaker. He's repeatedly touted recent peace deals that his administration helped to facilitate \u2014 between India and Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, and Israel and Iran \u2014 and for years he has made little secret of the fact that he covets a Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "Ahead of a dinner with U.S. and Israeli officials in the White House's Blue Room on Monday, Netanyahu presented Mr. Trump with a letter he said he wrote nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Netanyahu told Mr. Trump that it's \"well-deserved, and you should get it.\"",
      "\"This is very meaningful,\" Mr. Trump said.\u00a0  He has been pressuring Israel and Hamas to wrap up their own conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, ravaged Gaza, deepened Israel's international isolation and made any resolution to the broader conflict between Israel and the Palestinians more distant than ever.",
      "But the precise details of the proposed ceasefire deal, and whether it can lead to an end to the war, are still in flux. In the days before Netanyahu's visit, Mr. Trump seemed less certain of the chances of an imminent breakthrough.",
      "Asked on Friday how confident he was that a ceasefire deal would come together, he told reporters: \"I'm very optimistic \u2014 but you know, look, it changes from day to day.\"",
      "On Sunday evening, he seemed to narrow his expectations, telling reporters that he thought an agreement related to the remaining hostages would be reached in the coming week.",
      "Gaza peace hinged on Trump and Netanyahu's personal ties?",
      "After Mr. Trump's decision to get involved in Israel's war in Iran with strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, he and Netanyahu have looked and sounded more in sync than ever. But that's not always been the case.",
      "As recently as Netanyahu's last visit to Washington in April, the tone was markedly different.",
      "Mr. Trump used the photo-op with Netanyahu to announce that the U.S. was entering into negotiations with Iran over its nuclear deal \u2014 appearing to catch the Israeli leader off guard and at the time, slamming the brakes on any Israeli military plan.",
      "He also praised Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a fierce critic of Israel's, in front of Netanyahu, and the two made no apparent progress on a trade deal at the height of Mr. Trump's tariff expansion.",
      "Mr. Trump, whose policies have largely aligned with Israel's own priorities, pledged last week to be \"very firm\" with Netanyahu on ending the war, without saying what that would entail. Pressure by Mr. Trump may have helped to convince Netanyahu in the past, with a previous ceasefire deal having been reached right as the president was taking office for his second term.",
      "Netanyahu has to balance the demands of his American ally with the far-right parties in his governing coalition who hold the key to his political survival and oppose ending the war.",
      "But given the strong U.S. support in Israel's war against Iran, highlighted by joint airstrikes on three key Iranian nuclear sites, Netanyahu may have a tough time saying no.",
      "When asked Monday whether he would consider another strike against Iran, Mr. Trump told reporters, \"I hope we're not going to have to do that. I can't imagine wanting to do that.\"",
      "\"They want to meet. They want to work something out,\" Mr. Trump said of Iran. \"They're very different now than they were two weeks ago.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he hoped the war between Iran and Israel is over, adding that he believes Iran wants \"to make peace.\"",
      "\"I'm all for it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Now, if that's not the case, we are ready, willing and able, but I don't think we're going to have to be.\"",
      "Netanyahu left the door open to the war resuming, telling reporters Monday that \"when you remove a tumor, that doesn't mean it can't come back.\"",
      "On Sunday evening, Mr. Trump said one of the matters he expected to discuss with Netanyahu \"is probably a permanent deal with Iran.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also may expect something in return for his recent calls for Netanyahu's corruption trial to be canceled \u2014 a significant interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state.",
      "\"Trump thinks that Netanyahu owes him,\" said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel affairs at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. \"And if Trump thinks that he needs to end the war In Gaza, then that is what he will need to do.\"",
      "Trump's vision for a remade Middle East hinged on Gaza",
      "But beyond Iran is Mr. Trump's grand vision for a new Middle East, where he hopes that additional countries will join the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements normalizing relations between Arab countries and Israel brokered during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Netanyahu and Mr. Trump are likely to discuss how to bring Syria into the fold. The country, a longtime enemy of Israel's, has new leadership after the fall of President Bashar Assad, and experts say conditions might be ripe for some kind of nonbelligerency agreement.",
      "Just last week, Mr. Trump signed an executive order lifting a raft of U.S. sanctions against the Syrian government, paving the way for the nation's new leaders \u2014 former Islamist militants who publicly embraced secularism after toppling Assad \u2014 to further cement their governance and join the international community.",
      "\"I think there's an opportunity to explore. I think that everyone understands the situation has changed. Before that, Iran was essentially running Syria directly through Hezbollah. Hezbollah has been brought to its knees. Iran is out of the picture. So I think this presents opportunities for stability, for security and eventually for peace,\" Netanyahu said Monday at the White House.",
      "But Mr. Trump's ultimate goal is to include regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia.",
      "The Saudis, whose clout could open the door for other Arab or Muslim countries to join, have expressed interest in normalizing ties with Israel but only if it is accompanied by serious steps toward resolving Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. For starters, that would seem to require action in Gaza.",
      "\"The most important thing (for Mr. Trump) is to end the war in Gaza,\" Gilboa said. \"That is the key to all the regional peace in the Middle East.\"",

    "story": [
      "The European Union expects to find out on Monday whether President Donald Trump will impose punishing tariffs on America's largest trade partner in a move economists have warned would have repercussions for companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "President Trump said on social media this weekend that he would start sending tariff increase letters to countries with which the U.S. does not reach satisfactory trade deals beginning at noon on Monday. Japan and South Korea were the first recipients, with letters from the Trump administration sent to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung on Monday indicating that 25% tariffs on their respective countries will go into effect on August 1.",
      "Trump imposed a 20% import tax on all EU-made products in early April as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the United States has a trade imbalance. Hours after the nation-specific duties took effect, he put them on hold until July 9 at a standard rate of 10% to quiet financial markets and allow time for negotiations.",
      "Expressing displeasure with the EU's stance in trade talks, however, Trump said he would increase the tariff rate for European exports to 50%, which could make everything \u2014 from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals \u2014 much more expensive in the U.S.",
      "The EU's executive commission, which handles trade issues for the bloc's 27-member nations, said its leaders hope to strike a deal with the Trump administration. Without one, the EU said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNN's \"State of the Union\" program on Sunday that \"the EU was very slow in coming to the table\" but that talks were now making \"very good progress.\"",
      "Here are important things to know about trade between the United States and the European Union.",
      "\"Most important\" trade relationship",
      "The European Commission describes the trade between the U.S. and the EU as \"the most important commercial relationship in the world.\"",
      "The value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.",
      "The biggest U.S. export to Europe was crude oil, followed by pharmaceuticals, aircraft, automobiles, and medical and diagnostic equipment.",
      "Europe's biggest exports to the U.S. were pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits.",
      "Trump has complained about the EU's 198 billion-euro trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more stuff from European businesses than the other way around.",
      "However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services.",
      "The U.S. services surplus took the nation's trade deficit with the EU down to 50 billion euros ($59 billion), which represents less than 3% of overall U.S.-EU trade.",
      "Before Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained a generally cooperative trade relationship and low tariff levels on both sides. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU's averaged 1.35% for American products.",
      "Less-friendly posture toward longstanding ally",
      "But the White House has taken a much less friendly posture toward the longstanding U.S. ally since February. Along with the fluctuating tariff rate on European goods Trump has floated, the EU has been subject to his administration's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, and a 25% tax on imported automobiles and parts.",
      "Trump administration officials have raised a slew of issues they want to see addressed, including agricultural barriers such as EU health regulations that include bans on chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef.",
      "Trump has also criticized Europe's value-added taxes, which EU countries levy at the point of sale this year at rates of 17% to 27%. But many economists see VAT as trade-neutral since they apply to domestic goods and services as well as imported ones. Because national governments set the taxes through legislation, the EU has said they aren't on the table during trade negotiations.",
      "\"On the thorny issues of regulations, consumer standards and taxes, the EU and its member states cannot give much ground,\" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Germany's Berenberg bank, said. \"They cannot change the way they run the EU's vast internal market according to U.S. demands, which are often rooted in a faulty understanding of how the EU works.\"",
      "U.S. consumers would likely be hurt most",
      "Economists and companies say higher tariffs will mean higher prices for U.S. consumers on imported goods. Importers must decide how much of the extra tax costs to absorb through lower profits and how much to pass on to customers.",
      "Mercedes-Benz dealers in the U.S. have said they are holding the line on 2025 model year prices \"until further notice.\" The German automaker has a partial tariff shield because it makes 35% of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the U.S. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but the company said it expects prices to undergo \"significant increases\" in coming years.",
      "Simon Hunt, CEO of Italian wine and spirits producer Campari Group, told investment analysts that prices could increase for some products or stay the same depending what rival companies do. If competitors raise prices, the company might decide to hold its prices on Skyy vodka or Aperol aperitif to gain market share, Hunt said.",
      "Trump has argued that making it more difficult for foreign companies to sell in the U.S. is a way to stimulate a revival of American manufacturing. Many companies have dismissed the idea or said it would take years to yield positive economic benefits. However, some corporations have proved willing to shift some production stateside.",
      "France-based luxury group LVMH, whose brands include Tiffany & Co., Luis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon, could move some production to the United States, billionaire CEO Bernaud Arnault said at the company's annual meeting in April.",
      "Arnault, who attended Trump's inauguration, has urged Europe to reach a deal based on reciprocal concessions.",
      "\"If we end up with high tariffs, ... we will be forced to increase our U.S.-based production to avoid tariffs,\" Arnault said. \"And if Europe fails to negotiate intelligently, that will be the consequence for many companies. ... It will be the fault of Brussels, if it comes to that.\"",
      "Some forecasts indicate the U.S. economy would be more at risk if the negotiations fail.",
      "Without a deal, the EU would lose 0.3% of its gross domestic product and U.S. GDP would fall 0.7%, if Trump slaps imported goods from Europe with tariffs of 10% to 25%, according to a research review by Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels.",
      "Given the complexity of some of the issues, the two sides may arrive only at a framework deal before Wednesday's deadline. That would likely leave a 10% base tariff, as well as the auto, steel and aluminum tariffs in place until details of a formal trade agreement are ironed out.",
      "The most likely outcome of the trade talks is that \"the U.S. will agree to deals in which it takes back its worst threats of 'retaliatory' tariffs well beyond 10%,\" Schmieding said. \"However, the road to get there could be rocky.\"",
      "The U.S. offering exemptions for some goods might smooth the path to a deal. The EU could offer to ease some regulations that the White House views as trade barriers.",
      "\"While Trump might be able to sell such an outcome as a 'win' for him, the ultimate victims of his protectionism would, of course, be mostly the U.S. consumers,\" Schmieding said.",

    "story": [
      "Indonesia's rumbling Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki erupted twice on Monday, sending a column of volcanic materials up to 11 miles into the sky, dumping ash on villages and causing dozens flight cancellations.",
      "No casualties were immediately reported. The volcano on Flores island has been at the highest alert level since an eruption on June 18, and an exclusion zone was doubled to a 4.3-mile radius as eruptions became more frequent.",
      "Indonesia's Geology Agency recorded an avalanche of searing gas clouds mixed with rocks and lava traveling up to 3 miles down the slopes of the 5,197-foot mountain. Observations from drones showed lava filling the crater, indicating deep movement of magma that set off earthquakes.",
      "The initial column of hot clouds that rose just after 11:00 a.m. local time (0305 GMT) was the volcano's highest since a major eruption in November 2024\u00a0that killed nine people and injured dozens, said Muhammad Wafid, the Geology Agency chief. It also erupted in March.",
      "\"An eruption of that size certainly carries a higher potential for danger, including its impact on aviation,\" Wafid told The Associated Press. \"We shall reevaluate to enlarge its danger zone that must be cleared of villagers and tourist activities.\"",
      "In a statement, Wafid urged the public and tourists to stay at least four miles from the eruption, remain calm and follow the directions of the local government.",
      "\"The public is asked not to believe information from unclear sources,\" Wafid said. \"In addition, people around disaster-prone areas should be aware of the potential for lava floods if heavy rain occurs.\".",
      "The volcano erupted again just after 7:30 p.m. (1100 GMT), spewing lava and sending clouds of ash up to 8 miles into the air, according to the Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation.",
      "By Monday afternoon, at least 24 flights between Bali and Australia, Singapore and South Korea were cancelled and many others were delayed. Flights on four domestic routes were cancelled, said Ahmad Syaugi Shahab, spokesperson for Bali's Ngurah Rai international airport.",
      "He said the airport was running normally despite the cancellations, as monitoring showed the volcanic ash had not affected Bali's airspace.",
      "\"Several airlines serving the routes to Labuan Bajo (on Flores), Australia, Singapore, and South Korea have confirmed cancellations and delays,\" he said in a statement.",
      "He said the airlines included Virgin Australia, Jetstar Airways and AirAsia Indonesia.",
      "Australia's Jetstar said several flights were cancelled \"due to volcanic ash caused by an eruption of Mount Lewotobi.\"",
      "Falling ash after the initial eruption blanketed several villages with debris and blocked sunlight for almost half an hour, Hadi Wijaya, head of the Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation, said in a statement.",
      "He said volcanic materials, including thumb-size fragments of gravel and ash, were thrown up to 5 miles from the crater. He warned residents to be vigilant about heavy rainfall that could trigger lava flows in rivers originating from the volcano.",
      "Photos and videos circulated on social media showed the ash cloud expanding into a mushroom shape as tons of volcanic debris covered houses up to their rooftops in nearby villages. Some residents ran in panic under the rain of volcanic material or fled with motorbikes and cars.",
      "Monday's eruptions were the result of the accumulation of energy due to a blockage of magma in the crater, which reduced detectable seismic activity while building up pressure, Wijaya said.",
      "The initial eruption was one of Indonesia's largest since 2010 when Mount Merapi, the country's most volatile volcano, erupted on the densely populated island of Java. That killed 353 people and forced over 350,000 people to evacuate.",
      "Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 280 million people with frequent seismic activity. It has 120 active volcanoes and sits along the \"Ring of Fire,\" a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.",

    "story": [
      "The State Department said Monday it will lift Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's designation as a foreign terrorist organization, months after the group's leader defeated the Assad regime and swept to power as Syria's president.",
      "The change will take effect on Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement. The group, formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra, has been on the U.S.'s list of foreign terrorist organizations for more than a decade, dating back to its affiliation with al Qaeda. The terrorist designation makes it harder for the group or its leaders to accept assistance from Americans, work with American banks or travel to the U.S.",
      "Rubio said the revocation of the group's terrorist status \"recognizes the positive actions taken by the new Syrian government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa.\"",
      "Led by al-Sharaa, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, helped lead a stunning offensive that swept into Damascus late last year, ending the Assad family's 54-year grip on Syria. Since then, al-Sharaa has served as Syria's interim president, and has sought to portray his government as a moderate and inclusive force \u2014 and a possible bulwark against Iranian influence.",
      "Al-Sharaa said earlier this year that HTS will be disbanded, along with all the other rebel groups that fought the Assad government during Syria's bloody 13-year civil war. Rubio cited that move, and the new government's \"commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms,\" in his decision to lift the terrorist designation.",
      "President Trump made a surprise announcement in May that he would lift sanctions against Syria, a significant boost to the country's new government. Syria had faced severe U.S. sanctions for more than a decade, a holdover from the Assad family's brutal dictatorial rule that restricted Syria's economy and made it difficult to accept foreign money.",
      "Mr. Trump also met with al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia in May.",
      "\"Young, attractive guy, tough guy, strong past,\" Mr. Trump said about the new Syrian leader.",
      "But HTS's past as a hardline Islamist rebel group has made some observers wary. Al-Sharaa participated in the insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq in the 2000s, before he was sent to Syria to help lead the al Qaeda-allied Jabhat al-Nusra in the fight against Bashar al-Assad's government. Jabhat al-Nusra was designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization in 2014, and al-Sharaa had a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head until last year.",
      "More than a decade ago, the group broke with insurgent leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and refused to merge with his now-infamous organization, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Since 2016, al-Sharaa's group has distanced itself from al Qaeda, and al-Sharaa has said he disagrees with some of the global terrorist organization's methods. He told PBS's \"Frontline\" in 2021, \"our involvement with al Qaeda in the past was an era, and it ended.\"",

      "Russia's Minister of Transport reportedly killed himself just hours after being fired by President Vladimir Putin, according to the country's state-run news agency, which cited the national Investigative Committee. A second senior Transport Ministry official reportedly died soon after, for reasons which remain unclear.",
      "Roman Starovoy fatally shot himself Monday in his car in Odintsovo, a city west of Moscow, according to a statement from the committee that was reported by Russia's TASS news agency.",
      "\"The circumstances of the incident are being established,\" TASS cited the Investigative Committee as saying. \"The main hypothesis is suicide.\"",
      "Forbes Russia reported that Starovoy, 53, died \"presumably overnight between Saturday and Sunday,\" citing an anonymous source close to state investigators. It was not possible to explain the discrepancy between the times of death reported by Forbes and the official Russian media.",
      "Putin had dismissed Starovoy just hours earlier, according to a decree published by the Kremlin. No official reason was given, but ongoing Ukranian drone attacks on Russia caused chaos for air traffic in the country over the weekend, prompting the cancellation of hundreds of flights and stranding passengers.",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed to have intercepted at least 120 drones over 10 different regions of the country between Saturday night and Sunday morning.",
      "Officials in Ukraine, meanwhile, said Monday that at least 11 civilians were killed and more than 80 others injured, including seven children, in Russian drone attacks. Russia has intensified its missile and drone strikes, including many that hit civilian areas, in recent days.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that over the past week alone, Russia had launched about 1,270 drones, 39 missiles and nearly 1,000 glide bombs at Ukraine.",

    "summary": "Researchers were able to date the fossil of the flying reptile, a close cousin of dinosaurs, back to more than 209 million years ago.",
    "story": [
      "For paleontologist Ben Kligman, the question was: Is this fragile jawbone a pterosaur or not?",
      "Other researchers also had questions about the fossil, unearthed along with thousands of others during a decades-long archaeological dig at a remote bone bed in the Petrified Forest National Park\u00a0in Arizona. Some thought the bone could've been a mammal, Kligman told CBS News.",
      "Now, their new research offers insight into North America's oldest known flying reptile that Kligman and other paleontologists say was the size of a \"small seagull.\"",
      "The Smithsonian-led paper,\u00a0published Monday\u00a0in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, details the new pterosaur fossil discovery along with several others, providing insight into the late Triassic period.",
      "Kligman remembers looking at the jawbone under a microscope at the Smithsonian \u2014 where he is a Peter Buck postdoctoral fellow and where the fossil had been sent \u2014 and running through his \"Rolodex\" of Triassic jaw anatomy, thinking about what species could have a similar jaw. He wanted to solve the mystery of where the delicate jawbone belonged.",
      "Through the process of elimination, and thinking of the features pterosaurs have that no other animal has, Kligman said he and other researchers were able to conclude that, \"Oh yeah, this is definitely a pterosaur \u2014 therefore, this is a very important discovery.\"",
      "The team named the pterosaur the Eotephradactylus mcintireae, which means \"ash-winged dawn goddess.\" The species name references its discoverer, Suzanne McIntire, who volunteered in the Smithsonian's FossiLab for 18 years.",
      "McIntire discovered the pterosaur fossil, which had been brought to the museum from the Petrified Forest National Park along with 1,200 other individual fossils, including bones, teeth, fish scales and coprolites, or fossilized excrement.",
      "Volunteers painstakingly clean each fossil, flag ones of interest and perform other fossil conservation tasks. McIntire unearthed the jawbone and noticed the teeth were still in the bone, making it easier to identify.",
      "The winged reptile \u2014 a close cousin of dinosaurs and the first animals after insects to evolve powered flight \u2014 would've been small enough to comfortably perch on a person's shoulder.",
      "\"It could've sat on your shoulder, like a small seagull,\" Kligman said of the species.",
      "Researchers were able to date the fossil back to 209.2 million years ago \u2014 an unusually precise date, Kligman said, because of the level of volcanic ash where the fossil was found. The finding helps fill in a gap in the fossil record that predates the end-Triassic extinction, he said. Very few pterosaur fossils exist, Kligman said. After their extinction, their fragile bones preserved poorly, so pterosaur fossils are frequently incomplete. They also did not live close to places where fossils tend to form.",
      "\"It helps us understand what a pterosaur was and how they became what they would become,\" Kligman said.",
      "Along with the pterosaur, the study also detailed other findings, including one of the world's oldest turtle fossils, giant amphibians and armored crocodile relatives, which lived alongside evolutionary upstarts like frogs, turtles and pterosaurs.",

      "A man \u2014 who has not been named \u2014 was hiking Friday on the Fee Glacier in southern Switzerland, with his white and brown long-haired Chihuahua, when he took a step on a snow bridge and plunged suddenly 26 feet into a crevasse.",
      "Stuck deep in the glacier ice, the man used an amateur walkie-talkie he was carrying to call for help, according to a statement posted online by the Air Zermatt rescue service. A person nearby received the distress call and relayed it to emergency services, but they were unable to locate the man, according to Air Zermatt.",

    "summary": "Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the deportation flight carrying the deportees landed in South Sudan just before midnight EST on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said it deported a group of eight men convicted of serious crimes in the United States to the conflict-ridden African country of South Sudan, following a legal saga that had kept the deportees stuck in a military base in Djibouti for weeks.",
      "Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the deportation flight carrying the deportees landed in South Sudan just before midnight Eastern time on Friday. A photo provided by the department showed the deportees, with their hands and feet shackled, sitting inside an aircraft, guarded by U.S. service members.",
      "The deportations to South Sudan \u2014 a country plagued by armed conflict and political instability that the U.S. government warns Americans not to visit \u2014 mark an unprecedented new frontier in President Trump's government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "None of the deportees is from South Sudan. They hail from Cuba, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam, and were ordered deported from the U.S. after being convicted of crimes, including murder, homicide, sexual assault, lascivious acts with a child and robbery.",
      "The high-profile legal battle over the fate of the men culminated when two federal judges on Friday denied a last-ditch attempt by immigration rights advocates to halt the deportations, saying their hands were tied by recent orders from the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The deportations signify a major political victory for the Trump administration, which has sought to convince countries around the world \u2014 irrespective of their human rights record \u2014 to accept deportees who are not their citizens, including those convicted of serious crimes.",
      "\"A district judge cannot dictate the national security and foreign policy of the United States of America,\" said McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman. \"This Independence Day marks another victory for the safety and security of the American people.\"",
      "The deportations have also alarmed human rights advocates, who fear the men could face jail time, torture or other harms in South Sudan. They've argued the deportations to South Sudan are designed to punish the men for their crimes, even though they have already served criminal sentences in the U.S.",
      "\"The U.S. State Department warns Americans against all travel to South Sudan, yet deported these men there without any due process,\" said Trina Realmuto, an attorney for the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, which tried to halt the deportations. \"Make no mistake about it, these deportations were punitive and unconstitutional.\"",
      "It's unclear exactly how the deportees will be treated in South Sudan. A Justice Department attorney told a federal judge Friday that South Sudan informed the U.S. it would offer the men a temporary immigration status, but the lawyer could not confirm whether they would be detained. The Trump administration has said in court filings that South Sudanese officials have made assurances that the deportees will not face torture.",
      "The men's deportation was made possible by a Supreme Court order earlier this week. At the request of the Trump administration, the Supreme Court on Thursday clarified the scope of an earlier order it had issued to pause a lower court ruling barring deportations to third-party countries without a degree of due process and notice.",
      "That April lower court ruling by U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Massachusetts had required the Trump administration to give detainees sufficient notice and a chance to be interviewed by a U.S. asylum officer before any deportation to a country where they did not hail from. That case thwarted several deportation efforts, including a plan to send detainees to Libya.",
      "When he learned of the administration's plan to deport the eight men to South Sudan in May, Murphy blocked that effort, mandating the U.S. to retain custody of the detainees and to offer them a chance to contest their deportation. The administration transferred the detainees to the Camp Lemonnier naval base in Djibouti, where U.S. officials described dangerous conditions, including concerns about malaria, rocket attacks, inadequate security protocols and triple-digit outdoor temperatures.",
      "But the Supreme Court last month suspended Murphy's ruling from April. And on Thursday, it said Murphy could no longer require the government to allow the detainees in Djibouti to contest their deportation, since the order underpinning that requirement had been paused.",
      "Hours later, immigrant rights advocates asked a different federal judge, Randolph Moss in Washington, D.C., to halt the deportations to South Sudan. He did so on Friday, but only briefly before saying the request should be handled by Murphy.",
      "Moss expressed concern about risks to the men's \"physical safety\" and said the U.S. government should not be in the business of inflicting \"pain and suffering\" on people who have already served their sentence, even for a \"terrible crime.\" But he said his hands were tied, telling the advocates they needed to ask Murphy for any intervention.",
      "Later on Friday, Murphy denied the advocates' request, saying the Supreme Court orders were \"binding.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 01:52:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Australian Erin Patterson was found guilty of murdering three of her estranged husband's relatives by deliberately serving them poisonous mushrooms for lunch.",
    "story": [
      "Melbourne, Australia \u2014 Australian Erin Patterson was found guilty Monday of murdering three of her estranged husband's relatives by deliberately serving them poisonous mushrooms for lunch.",
      "The jury in the Supreme Court trial in Victoria state returned a verdict after six days of deliberations, following a nine-week trial that gripped Australia. Patterson faces life in prison and will be sentenced later, but a date for the hearing hasn't been scheduled.",
      "Patterson, who sat in the dock between two prison officers, showed no emotion but blinked rapidly as the verdicts were read.",
      "Three of Patterson's four lunch guests - her parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson - died in the hospital after the 2023 meal at her home in Leongatha, at which she served individual beef Wellington pastries containing death cap mushrooms.",
      "She was also found guilty of attempting to murder Ian Wilkinson, Heather's husband, who survived the meal.",
      "It wasn't disputed that Patterson served the mushrooms or that the pastries killed her guests. The jury was required to decide whether she knew the lunch contained death caps, and if she intended for them to die.",
      "The guilty verdicts, which were required to be unanimous, indicated that jurors rejected Patterson's defense that the presence of the poisonous fungi in the meal was a terrible accident, caused by the mistaken inclusion of foraged mushrooms that she didn't know were death caps. Prosecutors didn't offer a motive for the killings, but during the trial highlighted strained relations between Patterson and her estranged husband, and frustration that she had felt about his parents in the past.",
      "Victims' relatives asked for privacy in the wake of the jury's decision, police said, according to French news agency AFP.",
      "The families \"have asked for privacy at this time,\" Victoria Police said in a statement. \"We will continue to support them in every way possible following this decision.\"",
      "Facts of case weren't disputed so Patterson's intentions were key",
      "The case turned on the question of whether Patterson meticulously planned a triple murder or accidentally killed three people she loved, including her children's only surviving grandparents. Her lawyers said she had no reason to - she had recently moved to a beautiful new home, was financially comfortable, had sole custody of her children and was due to begin studying for a degree in nursing and midwifery.",
      "But prosecutors suggested Patterson had two faces - the woman who publicly appeared to have a good relationship with her parents-in-law, while her private feelings about them were kept hidden. Her relationship with her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, who was invited to the fatal lunch but didn't go, deteriorated in the year before the deaths, the prosecution said.",
      "The simplest facts of what happened that day and immediately afterward were hardly disputed. But Patterson's motivations for what she did and why were pored over in detail during the lengthy trial, at which more than 50 witnesses were called.",
      "The individual beef Wellington pastries Patterson served her guests was one point of friction, because the recipe she used contained directions for a single, family-sized portion. Prosecutors said that she reverted to individual servings so she could lace the other diners' portions, but not her own, with the fatal fungi - but Patterson said that she was unable to find the correct ingredients to make the recipe as directed.",
      "Nearly every other detail of the fateful day was scrutinized at length, including why Patterson sent her children out to a film before her guests arrived, why she added additional dried mushrooms to the recipe from her pantry, why she didn't become ill when the other diners did, and why she disposed of a food dehydrator after the deaths and told investigators she didn't own one.",
      "Patterson acknowledged some lies during her evidence - including that she'd never foraged mushrooms or owned a dehydrator. But she said those claims were made in panic as she realized her meal had killed people.",
      "She said she didn't become as ill as the other diners since she vomited after the meal because of an eating disorder. She denied she told her guests she had cancer as a ruse to explain why she invited them to her home that day.",
      "The case gripped Australia",
      "The bizarre and tragic case has lingered in the minds of Australians and has provoked fervor among the public and media.",
      "During the trial, five separate podcasts analyzed each day of the proceedings and several news outlets ran live blogs giving moment-by-moment accounts of more than two months of evidence.",
      "At least one television drama and a documentary about the case are slated for production. Prominent Australian crime writers were seen in court throughout the trial.",
      "As it became clear half-an-hour before the verdict that court was reconvening, about 40 members of the public queued outside the courthouse in the rural town of Morwell in hope of watching the outcome in person. News outlets reported that no family members of victims were there.",
      "Before the verdict, newspapers published photos of black privacy screens erected at the entrance to Erin Patterson's home. Dozens of reporters from throughout Australia and from news outlets abroad crowded around friends of Patterson's as they left the courthouse Monday.",
      "\"I'm saddened, but it is what it is,\" said one friend, Ali Rose, who wore sunglasses and fought back tears. Asked what she thought Patterson felt as the verdicts were read, Rose said, \"I don't know.\"",
      "Details on the poisonous mushrooms that were served",
      "\"Death caps\" -- or amanita phalloides - are the deadliest mushrooms in the world, causing some 90 percent of fungus-related fatalities, according to AFP.",
      "It's easy to mistake the brown-and-white mushrooms for others, and they're said to have a\u00a0 pleasant taste when cooked.",
      "But toxicologist Dimitri Gerostamoulos testified that they're saturated with deadly chemicals known as amatoxins.",
      "\"They can lead to someone experiencing symptoms of diarrhoea, vomiting, feeling really unwell and they progressively get worse if the toxins are not removed,\" Gerostamoulos said."

      "Hamas has sought guarantees that the initial truce would lead to a total end to the war and withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Previous negotiations have stalled over Hamas' demands for guarantees that further negotiations would lead to the war's end, while Netanyahu has insisted on Israel being able to resume fighting to fulfill his goal of destroying the militant group.",
      "\"I am committed to all three missions: the release and return of all our hostages, both living and dead, the elimination of Hamas' capabilities \u2014 to remove it from there, and to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel,\" Netanyahu said Sunday.",
      "A Palestinian official familiar with the talks and close to Hamas told AFP the talks in Doha would focus on conditions for a possible ceasefire, including hostage and prisoner releases. The official said Hamas would also seek the reopening of Gaza's Rafah crossing to evacuate the wounded.",
      "The war in Gaza began when Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage. Many of those hostages have since either been released or their bodies have been recovered in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",

But yeah, it does freak me out. It makes me sad to see everyone suddenly becoming skinny because I think it's very triggering for a lot of people our age that grew up in the \u201880s and \u201990s.

He doesn't love us or value us anymore or less depending on how we look. He's a God of the heart that judges the heart, and it's all about who we are on the inside. And that is where I will continually go back to.

I want to enjoy them to the fullest. So I want a strong body. I want to lift weights. I want to eat well to nourish my body so that I can have a long life with my children and my grandchildren and my husband and I want to be active. Those are my whys.\"",
      "\"And whether weight-loss drugs are included for you in that journey to be your best, that's up to each individual. And I kind of let that go,\" she added. \"You see so much of Hollywood getting skinny all of a sudden, and there's a little place of jealousy as a woman that it's like, \u2018Oh, this is the easy way out.\u2019 And yet I know that's not true for everybody.

      "\"But what I've learned over the years in knowing Him and knowing His character is that He's always there, literally always there,\" she added. \"So, sometimes, in the scariest moments, when I'm like, \u2018God, I need you with me. I need to feel your presence. Bring me through this.\u2019 And sometimes you want the win at the end, He brings you through, and you're like, \u2018Yes, I did it.\u2019",

You actually helped push me through, even if it ended up being a failure, even if I don't feel very courageous, and I feel like it just wasn't what I wanted it to be. The fact that I actually did it, I pushed through the fear, I had the courage, or I had the stamina to walk another step, that's because of You.'\"",

      "While changing the way the government gives citizenship to babies born in the United States is still an uphill climb, the high court\u2019s ruling raised the possibility that Trump\u2019s new policy to end automatic citizenship could, at least temporarily, take effect in some parts of the country.",
      "Lawyer Carrie Severino, president of the conservative legal advocacy group JCN, said it was unclear at this stage of litigation how Trump\u2019s policy would work logistically or to whom it would apply. The Supreme Court's decision, issued June 27, barred Trump\u2019s executive order from becoming active for 30 days.",

      "The order dramatically changed the scope of birthright citizenship, which is outlined under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution and allows babies born to noncitizens in the United States to automatically receive U.S. citizenship in most cases.",
      "Courts uniformly rejected Trump\u2019s policy and blocked it by issuing universal injunctions, which applied to the whole country and not just certain pregnant noncitizens being represented in court.",

      "Coughenour later said that if Trump wanted to change the \"exceptional American grant of birthright citizenship,\" then the president would need to work with Congress to amend the Constitution, rather than attempt to redefine the amendment through an executive order.",

      "American Immigration Council\u2019s Michelle Lapointe wrote online there was a \"real possibility\" that if the judges overseeing the current lawsuits do not find a way in the next few weeks to issue broad injunctions blocking birthright citizenship, then some states might see the policy take effect.",

      "\"It's a challenging issue, in part because our immigration system looks so dramatically different now than it did at the time of the 14th Amendment, because the sort of immigration we're looking at was not really on their radar, nor was the type of entitlement state that we are living in,\" Severino said.",

It states that babies born in the United States and \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" are citizens.

      "The Trump administration has said that as part of its immigration crackdown, it wants to curtail abuse of the 14th Amendment, which can include foreigners traveling to the United States strictly to give birth with no intention of legally settling in the country.

      "Firing bricks made from coffee waste. (Swinburne University)",
      "Bricks from recycled coffee grounds are cheaper and greener to make",
      "At Swinburne University of Technology, researchers found a creative way to cut both construction emissions and material costs by making bricks from recycled coffee grounds. Instead of letting all that coffee waste go to landfills, they partnered with local coffee shops to collect spent grounds straight from espresso machines. Then, by blending the coffee waste with natural clay and an alkali activator, they developed a recipe for low-emission bricks that are not only more sustainable but also faster and cheaper to produce than traditional clay ones.",
      "Coffee grounds from an espresso machine. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why bricks from recycled coffee grounds are a smarter use of waste",
      "Coffee is the world\u2019s second most popular beverage, beaten only by tea. As such, there are approximately two and a quarter billion cups of coffee consumed daily. If you average out the espressos, cappuccinos, and americanos, then each cup brews using roughly eleven grams of freshly ground coffee. However, that leads to over nine million tonnes of coffee bean grounds. In turn, this generates an estimated eighteen million tonnes of damp, burnt byproduct dumped into landfills every single year. So, there is an abundance of supply, but how can coffee grounds be more efficient than traditional clay bricks?",
      "How bricks from recycled coffee grounds cut construction costs",
      "This innovative method of using spent coffee grounds drastically reduces the energy needed to mold bricks. Even low-quality traditional clay bricks must be baked in a kiln at over 900 degrees Celsius. These new coffee bricks only need to be cooked at 200 degrees Celsius. That\u2019s an 80 percent reduction in energy usage, meaning that these bricks are significantly more efficient for both the environment and manufacturing costs.",
      "The lead scientist, Dr. Wong, claimed,\u00a0\"It\u2019s lighter on energy, faster to produce, and designed to reduce electricity-related CO\u2082 emissions by up to 80 percent per unit.\"",
      "Not only are the manufacturing costs lower, but experts claim these coffee bricks are remarkably durable. According to Green Brick, they double \"the Australian minimum standard for strength.\"",
      "Analysis of spent coffee grounds. (Swinburne University)",
      "Bricks from recycled coffee grounds offer sustainable building solutions",
      "In June, Swinburne University of Technology took a major step forward by signing an IP licensing deal with Australian company Green Brick. This partnership paves the way for using bricks made from recycled coffee grounds in real-world construction projects. Green Brick founder Philip Ng explained,\u00a0\"For the last century, materials have been judged by one thing: cost per square meter. But in the next chapter, we'll judge them by carbon, transparency, and circularity, and those metrics favor a new product.\"",
      "While Swinburne's team is transforming coffee waste, others around the world are exploring similar paths. In London, a group of researchers has developed \"sugarcrete,\" a bio-brick made from sugarcane waste. As these kinds of innovations gain traction, recycled organic materials are starting to look like a practical and scalable alternative for the construction industry.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "It turns out your coffee habit might be more powerful than you think, not just for waking you up, but for building a cleaner future. Bricks from recycled coffee grounds are a creative solution to two big problems: construction pollution and coffee waste. As more researchers and companies get behind ideas like this, the future of sustainable building is looking a lot more grounded and a little more caffeinated.",

      "Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are transforming how we learn. But what does this mean for AI and learning retention? While these tools provide instant answers and personalized support, experts are beginning to question whether this convenience might actually reduce our ability to retain knowledge in the long term.",

      "ChatGPT app on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How AI changes the learning experience",
      "AI-powered platforms can personalize education by adapting to each learner's pace, style, and needs. This tailored approach is credited with boosting engagement and, in some cases, improving retention rates by up to 30%. Features like adaptive quizzes, intelligent tutoring, and spaced repetition are designed to reinforce memory and help information stick. For students who struggle with traditional methods, AI can break down barriers, making learning more accessible and inclusive.",
      "The double-edged sword: Convenience vs. deep learning",
      "However, recent research suggests that the very convenience AI offers may undermine long-term learning retention. In a series of experiments at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, participants who used LLMs like ChatGPT to research topics showed weaker understanding and produced less original insights compared to those who used traditional search engines. The reason? AI often delivers concise, ready-made answers, reducing the need for active engagement, critical thinking, and synthesis-key ingredients for lasting learning.",
      "A similar pattern emerged in a 2024 study involving high school students: those who relied on AI tools performed better on immediate assignments but scored lower on later tests that required recall and understanding without AI assistance. The researchers found that passive use of AI, simply asking for answers, can lead to superficial learning, where information is quickly forgotten.",
      "ChatGPT being used on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI affects learning retention more than you think",
      "Experts point to a \"motivation problem.\" When learners believe AI is smarter than they are, they may stop putting in effort, leading to shallower processing and weaker retention. Over-reliance on AI can also reduce opportunities to practice critical thinking and problem-solving, skills that are essential for deep, durable learning.",
      "Finding the right balance with AI and learning retention",
      "Despite these concerns, AI is not inherently bad for learning. When used thoughtfully, such as prompting students to critique AI-generated drafts or ask probing questions, AI can encourage deeper engagement and support retention. The key is to integrate AI as a supplement, not a substitute, for active learning and human guidance.",
      "Educators play a vital role in this balance. By designing lessons that require students to interact with AI critically and reflect on what they learn, teachers can harness AI's benefits while minimizing its drawbacks.",
      "ChatGPT running on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "If you eat a bunch of candy all the time, you are likely going to gain weight and help your dentist with a car payment when cavities show up. AI is a lot like candy.\u00a0 Moderation is the name of the game. Using AI in smart ways rather than in abundance replacing your own critical thinking can be bad for your health.",
      "AI is reshaping education, offering unprecedented personalization and accessibility. Yet, when it comes to learning retention, the way we use AI matters as much as the technology itself. Passive reliance on AI tools can erode deep understanding, but strategic, active engagement can turn AI into a powerful ally for lasting learning. As AI continues to evolve, fostering critical thinking and self-directed learning will be essential to ensure that knowledge doesn't just come quickly-but sticks for the long haul.",

      "This type of phishing combines fake calendar events, Microsoft branding, and social engineering tactics to trick users into handing over personal information or clicking on malicious content.",
      "It starts with a fake billing alert: The message appears to be from Microsoft 365, warning that your subscription renewal has either failed or been renewed. Some versions include an .htm attachment designed to look like a billing portal that captures credit card details.",

      "A team at the University of Tartu Institute of Computer Science in Northern Europe's Estonia has found a creative way to give outdated phones a new purpose. Instead of letting them gather dust or pollute the environment, these phones are being repurposed into tiny data centers. By connecting old smartphones together, the team enables them to efficiently process and store data for research and community projects, an innovative idea with significant impact.",
      "How researchers turn smartphones into low-cost data centers",
      "Turning old smartphones into data centers is surprisingly affordable. Researchers removed the batteries (to prevent chemical leaks) and used external power sources. They then connected the phones, placed them in 3D-printed holders, and created a working prototype. These mini-data centers have already been tested in real-world scenarios, like monitoring marine life underwater tasks that would normally require expensive equipment.",

      "Artificial intelligence and robotics may help with nursing shortage.",
      "A breakthrough in medical technology could soon change how sinus infections are treated. Scientists have created micro-robots for sinus infection treatment that can enter the nasal cavity, eliminate bacteria directly at the source, and exit without harming surrounding tissue.

      "A woman with a sinus infection. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What are micro-robots for sinus infection treatment?",
      "These microscopic robots are smaller than a speck of dust. They are made of magnetic particles enhanced with copper atoms. Doctors insert them through a narrow duct in the nostril. Once inside, the micro-robots are guided by magnetic fields to reach the infected area.",
      "At that point, a fiber optic light heats the particles and triggers a chemical reaction. This reaction breaks through thick mucus and destroys harmful bacteria at the infection site. As a result, treatment becomes faster, more precise, and far less invasive.",
      "This latest advancement comes from a collaboration of researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, along with universities in Guangxi, Shenzhen, Jiangsu, Yangzhou, and Macau. Their work, published in\u00a0\"Science Robotics,\" has helped move micro-robotic medical technology closer to real-world applications.",
      "Why use micro-robots instead of antibiotics?",
      "Traditional antibiotics circulate throughout the entire body. In contrast, micro-robots target only the infected area. This reduces side effects and lowers the risk of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, patients may recover faster because the treatment goes straight to the source.",
      "A woman with a sinus infection. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Are micro-robots safe?",
      "So far, animal trials have shown promising results. Micro-robots successfully cleared infections in pig sinuses and live rabbits, without causing tissue damage. However, scientists still need to ensure that every robot exits the body after treatment. Leftover particles could pose long-term risks.",
      "In addition, public acceptance remains a challenge. The idea of tiny machines inside the body makes some people uncomfortable. Nevertheless, experts believe those fears will fade over time.",
      "What other uses are possible?",
      "Researchers are already exploring how micro-robots could treat infections in the bladder, stomach, intestines, and bloodstream. Several teams around the world are working to make the technology more advanced and adaptable for deep internal use. If successful, these innovations could revolutionize the way we fight bacteria in the human body.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy addresses virtual private network blocks.",
      "Your personal data is a highly valuable commodity. Companies often treat it like a resource to be mined and traded. In practice, this means that everything you do on the Internet, what you search, what you click, where you shop, feeds a vast industry. Many people feel they have little control over this.",
      "In fact, a Pew Research survey found that roughly six in ten Americans say it's not possible to go through daily life without having data collected about them. We may use \"free\" services, but we usually pay in data. As the U.S. Federal Trade Commission explains,\u00a0\"The things we do throughout the course of our day give businesses access to information about our habits, tastes, and activities. Some might use it to deliver targeted ads to you... Others might sell or share that information\".",

      "A person working on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does your data get collected",
      "Almost everything we do online or even offline can generate data. Here are some common sources:",
      "1) Social media platforms:\u00a0Social networks like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter collect a wide array of data from your posts, likes, location check-ins, connections, and more. Social media companies harvest sensitive data about individuals' activities, interests, personal characteristics, and purchasing habits. In short, even casual sharing on these sites adds to a detailed profile about you.",
      "2) Online shopping and loyalty programs:\u00a0Every time you shop online or use a store loyalty card, data about your purchases is recorded. Retailers track what you buy, when, and how (with coupon or card). Even offline purchases using a rewards card feed into databases. Over time, this builds a detailed purchasing history linked to your identity.",
      "3) Browser fingerprinting: This technique collects bits of information about your browser and device (such as which plugins you have, screen size, time zone, etc.) to create a unique \"fingerprint.\" That fingerprint can identify you uniquely across sites, even without cookies.",
      "4) Mobile app identifiers and SDKs:\u00a0On phones, each app often reports usage data back to its developer or advertising partners. For example, iOS and Android assign a unique advertising ID to your device, and apps can read that ID and log your activity. Many apps also include third-party SDKs (software development kits) from analytics or ad companies that silently collect data on your in-app behavior and send it off for profiling.",
      "5) Cookies and tracking pixels:\u00a0A cookie is a small file your browser saves from a website. It lets the site recognize your device later. A tracking pixel (also called a web beacon) is a tiny, invisible image embedded in a webpage or email that reports back when you view it. Together, cookies and pixels allow companies to \"remember\" your visits, log which pages you view, and build a record of your browsing even after you leave a site.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What data brokers are and how hey sell your information",
      "Data brokers are companies whose entire business is buying, aggregating, and reselling personal information. They collect data about you from many places and bundle it into profiles. This industry is massive (estimated at around $200 billion per year) with thousands of firms globally. Big-name brokers include companies like Experian, Acxiom, Epsilon, and many lesser-known \"people search\" sites.",
      "Using sources like public records, social media, data breaches, and data brokers assemble extensive dossiers on individuals. They collect ordinary details such as names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, as well as sensitive traits: gender, marital status, education level, occupation, income range, hobbies, and interests. Brokers may even buy data about your health (like what drugs you purchase) or political views gathered from public voter records or social media activity.",
      "After building these profiles, brokers sell or license them to anyone who will pay. Typical customers include Marketers and Advertisers, Insurers and Lenders, People Search and Data Services, Employers and Background Checkers, and more.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happens to your data after it\u2019s sold",
      "Once your data is in the hands of others, it\u2019s used to profile and segment people in ways that can affect what we see and the opportunities we receive. Profiling simply means grouping people by common traits or habits, such as \"young urban pet owners\" or \"people likely to buy a new car this year.\" These profiles are then used to serve you targeted ads and offers.",
      "Targeted advertising can feel creepy or manipulative. For example, you might notice ads for products you only briefly mentioned in a private message or web search, because your data was shared with dozens of advertisers behind the scenes. Every time you load a page with ads, your data profile is broadcast to companies through automated ad auctions, and they bid to show you ads.",
      "Beyond advertising, there can be more serious consequences such as identity theft and stalking. Broader profiles mean more tempting targets for criminals. People-search websites, which get data from brokers, can show your address, phone number, family members\u2019 names, and even your Social Security number. This information can be used to steal your identity or harass you.",
      "How you can take back control",
      "There are many ways to take control of your personal data, several of which are listed in the section below, but the most effective is to consider a data removal service.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",
      "A personal data removal service can help you remove all this personal information from the internet. It has a very clean interface and will scan 195 websites for your information and remove it and keep it removed.",

      "A person surfing on their laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4 ways additional ways to protect your data",
      "You can take steps to reclaim some control over your data, and you don\u2019t have to be a tech expert to do it. Here are some practical tips and resources:",
      "1) Review privacy settings: Take a few minutes to explore the privacy and security settings on the services you use. For example, limit who can see your social media posts, disable unnecessary location-sharing on your phone, and consider turning off ad personalization on accounts like Google and Facebook. Most browsers let you block third-party cookies or clear tracking data. The FTC suggests comparing the privacy notices of different sites and apps and choosing ones that let you opt out of sharing when possible.",
      "2) Use privacy-friendly tools: Install browser extensions or plugins that block ads and trackers. You might switch to a more private search engine (like DuckDuckGo or Brave) that doesn\u2019t log your queries. Consider using a browser\u2019s \"incognito\" or private mode when you don\u2019t want your history saved. Even small habits, like logging out of accounts when not in use or using a password manager, make you less trackable.",
      "3) Be cautious with personal data: Think twice before sharing extra details. Don\u2019t fill out online surveys or quizzes that ask for personal or financial information unless you trust the source. Create separate email addresses for sign-ups (so marketing emails don\u2019t go to your main inbox). Only download apps from official stores, and check app permissions.",
      "4) Opt out of data broker lists: Many data brokers offer ways to opt out or delete your information, though it can be a tedious process. For example, there are sites like Privacy Rights Clearinghouse or the Whitepages opt-out page that list popular brokers and their opt-out procedures. The FTC\u2019s consumer guide \"Your Guide to Protecting Your Privacy Online\" includes tips on opting out of targeted ads and removing yourself from people-search databases. (Keep in mind you may have to repeat this every few months.)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You may not be able to completely escape the data economy, but you can limit its impact on your life. By using privacy tools, being mindful of what you share, and demanding transparency, you make it harder for companies to treat your personal information as a free-for-all. Each small step, whether it's tweaking settings, clicking \"opt out,\" or simply pausing before hitting \"submit\" on a form, helps you regain control. Ultimately, pushing for accountability from businesses and lawmakers is also part of the solution. After all, privacy is a fundamental right that deserves strong safeguards for everyone.",

A series of international wire transfers to accounts on the Federal Trade Commission's restricted list has been flagged. There have been reports of suspicious activities associated with your Social Security Number in Texas and New Mexico. We would like to inform you that this document contains sensitive information and should be managed carefully. The document presented here is an official communication from the Social Security Administration, authorized by the Texas Attorney General. The Texas Court has directed the suspension of your Social Security Number due to its association with money laundering activities involving your bank accounts.\"",
      "At first glance, the email looks official enough to cause real panic. It name-drops major authorities like the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Texas Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission to make the threat sound credible. By tying your SSN to federal crimes, the scammers are not just suggesting you might be in trouble. They imply serious legal consequences, even the possibility of arrest.",
      "This is urgency weaponized. The goal is to make you act before you think, pushing you to click a link or download a document out of fear. In that moment of panic, a person might forget the basic rules of cybersecurity.",
      "Another psychological trick the scammers use is overwhelming the reader with details. They mention multiple states such as Texas and New Mexico, wire transfers and restricted lists, all to create the impression that the situation is deeply serious and far beyond an individual's control.

      "Scammers love to make things sound urgent, like claiming your Social Security number is about to be suspended or that you're suddenly under investigation for something serious. It's all about creating panic so you'll act before you think. Remember, real government agencies don't send scary emails demanding immediate action, threaten you with arrest or ask for payment in gift cards or wire transfers. If you get a message that feels rushed, alarming or just \"off,\" hit pause. Take a breath, double-check the facts, and never click a link or respond until you're absolutely sure it's legit.",

      "Goldman shared his thoughts on LinkedIn after the company's closure. He expressed sadness and frustration, noting that Pazzi had reached many of its goals and built strong partnerships. He also reflected on the challenges. According to Goldman, hardware startups require significant time and money to succeed. He found that the robotics ecosystem in France was not mature enough to support such a venture. He also realized that running a tech company and a restaurant simultaneously posed unique challenges. The two industries have different cultures, customer expectations and business models.",

Instead of reflexively reaching for your phone, try doing nothing or something analog. Read a book, breathe deeply or just let your mind wander. These \"in-between\" moments are where clarity often happens.",

      "Replace doom-scrolling with quick wins:\u00a0Build a list of low-effort, high-reward alternatives to scrolling. Think: a five-minute stretch, stepping outside, organizing a drawer or sending a voice message to a friend. The key is having options ready when the urge to scroll hits.",
      "Involve someone else:\u00a0Accountability works. Whether it's a friend, partner or roommate, ask someone to check in with you, or even hold the screen time passcode. Just knowing someone else is watching can make mindless scrolling less appealing.",

Scammers often use lookalike pages to steal your information.

    "story": [
      "A growing number of fire departments across the country are turning to artificial intelligence to help detect and respond to wildfires more quickly.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence in education is forcing schools and universities to rethink everything from homework policies to how final exams are administered. With tools like ChatGPT now widespread, students can generate essays, solve complex math problems or draft lab reports in seconds, raising urgent questions about what authentic learning looks like in 2025.",
      "To fight back, some schools are turning to an unlikely solution: pen and paper. The old-school \"blue book,\" a lined booklet used for handwritten test answers, is staging a comeback, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal. And while it might seem like a relic of a pre-digital era, educators say it's one of the most effective tools they have to ensure students are actually doing their own work.",

      "FOX NEWS AI NEWSLETTER: CHATGPT REWIRING YOUR BRAIN",
      "Exam blue book\u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How common is AI cheating in schools today?",
      "While it's difficult to measure precisely, recent surveys suggest up to 89% of students have used AI tools like ChatGPT to help with coursework. Some admit to using it only for brainstorming or grammar fixes, but others rely on it to write entire papers or take-home tests. As reported, the spike in academic dishonesty has left faculty scrambling to preserve academic standards.",
      "Universities have reported a sharp rise in disciplinary cases tied to AI, but many incidents likely go undetected. Detection software like Turnitin's AI writing checker is being used more widely, but even those tools admit their systems aren't foolproof.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why AI cheating in schools is so hard to detect",
      "One reason this trend is so hard to police is that generative AI has become surprisingly good at mimicking human writing. Tools can tailor tone and style and even match a student's previous work, making plagiarism nearly impossible to identify without sophisticated forensics or human intuition.",
      "In blind tests, teachers have often been unable to distinguish between human and AI-written responses. Making matters worse, some schools that initially tried detection software have started abandoning it due to accuracy concerns and privacy issues.",
      "A student using ChatGPT on his laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why schools are bringing back blue books to stop AI cheating",
      "In response, a growing number of professors are bringing exams back into the classroom, with pen and paper. Schools like Texas A&M, University of Florida and UC Berkeley have all reported surging demand for blue books over the last two years. The logic is simple: If students have to write their essays by hand during class time, there's no opportunity to copy from ChatGPT or another AI assistant. It's not just nostalgia; it's a strategic shift. In-person, handwritten exams are harder to game, and some instructors say the quality of student thinking actually improves without digital shortcuts.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Are handwritten exams enough to stop AI cheating in schools?",
      "Still, not everyone is convinced this is the answer. Critics argue that relying on in-class, timed writing may shortchange students on deeper research skills and analytical thinking, especially for complex topics that benefit from time, revision and outside sources. Plus, blue books do little to prevent AI misuse on homework, group projects or take-home essays.",
      "Should schools ban AI tools or teach responsible use?",
      "Some educators are pushing for a more balanced response: Instead of banning AI tools, teach students how to use them responsibly. That means integrating AI literacy into the curriculum, so students learn where the line is between inspiration and plagiarism and understand when it's appropriate to use tools like ChatGPT or Grammarly.",
      "\"AI is part of the professional world students will enter,\" said one university dean quoted in The Wall Street Journal.\u00a0\"Our job is to teach them how to think critically, even with new tools in hand.\"",
      "A teacher teaching a lesson and a student using her smartphone\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What\u2019s next in the fight against AI cheating in schools?",
      "As AI tools evolve, so will the strategies schools use to ensure honest learning. Some are shifting toward oral exams, where students must explain their reasoning out loud. Others are assigning more process-based work, such as annotated drafts, recorded brainstorming sessions or group projects that make cheating harder. There's no silver bullet, but one thing is clear: the AI genie isn't going back in the bottle, and the education system must adapt quickly or risk losing credibility.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI cheating in education has forced schools to take a hard look at how they assess student learning. The return of the blue book is a sign of just how serious the problem has become and how far educators are willing to go to protect academic integrity. But the real solution will probably involve a mix of old and new, using analog tools like blue books, embracing digital detection methods and teaching students why honest work matters. As AI continues to evolve, education will have to evolve with it. The goal isn't just to stop cheating, it's to make sure students leave school with the skills, knowledge and values they need to succeed in the real world.",

      "You don't need spy-grade tech to hack a phone. The truth is, most phones get compromised not by brute force, but by everyday tricks that prey on users' habits and software gaps.",
      "Phishing is one of the most common methods. This usually involves receiving a fake text, email or even a phone call designed to trick you into clicking a malicious link or sharing sensitive information. It could look like a message from your bank, a delivery service or even a friend.",
      "SIM-swapping is another major threat. In this scam, someone convinces your phone provider to move your number to a SIM card. Once they gain control, they can read your texts, take calls and access accounts that rely on your number.",
      "Malicious apps are also a big risk, especially on devices where users sideload apps or install them from unofficial sources. Some apps appear harmless but are designed to spy on your activity, steal data or give remote access to an attacker.",
      "Public Wi-Fi networks can be another weak spot.\u00a0On an unsecured network, hackers can intercept your data or inject malware into websites. Even Bluetooth can be a vulnerability if it's left on in public. In rare cases, tools exist that allow hackers to connect to your phone without your knowledge, especially if your software isn't up to date.",

      "If your phone is suddenly acting strange, like sending texts you didn\u2019t write, installing apps you don\u2019t recognize or draining your battery much faster than usual, it could be a sign that something is wrong. Unexpected pop-ups, background noise during calls or your phone heating up even when idle can also be red flags.",
      "Another clue is if your contacts start getting messages or calls from you that you didn\u2019t send. This might mean someone has access to your messaging apps or social media accounts. If you\u2019re locked out of accounts linked to your phone number, or if your mobile service suddenly stops working, it could point to SIM swapping.",

Always double-check the sender\u2019s email address or phone number before clicking links or downloading attachments. Even though smartphones have built-in security, installing a trusted antivirus app adds an important extra layer of protection. Strong antivirus software can scan your device for malware, spyware and other malicious programs that might be lurking unnoticed.

Developers release updates not only to add new features but also to patch security flaws that hackers can exploit. Ignoring updates leaves your device vulnerable to attacks, so make it a habit to install them as soon as they become available.",
      "Two-factor authentication is one of the simplest and most effective ways to protect your accounts.

Hackers often hide malware inside seemingly harmless apps or files, so clearing these out can stop threats before they escalate. It's a simple but powerful step to help secure your device.",
      "If your phone has been compromised, it's possible that your personal information, like your name, address, phone number or email is already being shared or sold online. Hackers often collect this data to commit identity theft or launch targeted phishing attacks. A personal data removal service can scan data broker sites and request your information be deleted, reducing your risk of further exposure. These services offer ongoing monitoring to help you stay protected even after a hack.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "If your phone continues to act strangely after you\u2019ve tried other fixes, a factory reset on your iPhone or Android might be necessary. This process erases all data and settings, essentially giving you a fresh start. Before doing this, back up your important files, photos and contacts because a factory reset will delete everything on your device. Once reset, reinstall only trusted apps to reduce the risk of reinfection.",
      "Note: While a factory reset removes most malware, extremely advanced spyware may persist. If you suspect this level of compromise, consult a cybersecurity expert or consider replacing the device.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Phone hacking may seem like something that only happens in movies or to high-profile individuals, but the truth is anyone can be a target. Most attacks rely on simple tricks and human error, not advanced hacking skills.

There's no need for bulky wearables or complicated training. Instead, you simply move your limbs, and the system instantly records and communicates those movements and the associated muscle activity. Equipped with a display and speakers, the interface also provides real-time audiovisual feedback, creating a two-way connection that feels intuitive and engaging.",

The Capsule Interface also has significant potential for disaster response, enabling operators to control robots in hazardous environments without risk to human life. In everyday life, it can assist with household chores, support elderly family members and help farmers manage agricultural robots remotely.",

In simple terms, this means the device would not only let you control a robot, but also allow you to feel what the robot is doing, like sensing resistance when lifting something heavy or feeling the texture of an object through the robot.",
      "By giving you this kind of physical sensation, the experience becomes much more lifelike, making remote collaboration and communication feel even more natural and engaging.

      "There has been little change in U.S. energy consumption over the past decade. Increased efforts to make energy use more efficient have kept levels low. But over the next five years, demand for electricity to power data centers is expected to more than double. Some estimates show the facilities are expected to require as much energy in 2030 as the entire country of Japan does today.",
      "\"Every investor is lining up to invest in the next AI breakthrough. But when it comes to energy, there is a challenge in terms of permitting, the reality of construction timelines for new power plants and new grid capabilities,\" said senior advisor with the Wadhwani A.I. center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"All of this could slow down A.I. just as the research and development is preparing for takeoff.\"",
      "The demand from tech firms comes amid skepticism from consumers. According to a Fox News Poll on how voters felt about A.I. in society, 43% saw it as a good thing, while 47% thought it was a bad thing.",
      "\"I think it's natural that people will always have, call it a mixture of hopes and anxieties about what a new technology, including any new technology and especially AI may bring,\" Microsoft President Brad Smith said. \"The truth is we all rely on AI already, even if we don't think about it.\"",

      "Over the next five years, demand for electricity to power data centers is expected to more than double. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "While positive views have increased faster than negative views, according to polling from 2023, subgroups surveyed expressed opinions all over the board. Most rural voters, White voters, women and those over the age of 45 viewed A.I. as a bad thing. Urban voters, non-White voters, men and those younger than 45 viewed the technology as good. Among major political parties, registered Republicans were most optimistic about A.I. but no party\u2019s approval was above 50%.",
      "Despite the somewhat negative sentiment of most voters, tech companies are powering on.",
      "\"A.I. relies on a lot of what we call compute. A lot of chips that do a lot of calculations and a lot of data that is accessed and is stored. So all of that requires more electricity. And it's why we have to pursue new partnerships as we are with the kinds of companies that generate electricity,\" Smith said.",
      "At least two nuclear plants are scheduled to restart thanks to big tech partnerships.",
      "\"I think this will all become an increasing part of the nation's electricity future,\" Smith said. \"It only makes sense for a power company to invest, to bring something like Three Mile Island back online if it has a guarantee that somebody's gonna purchase it.

      "\"Very small traces of radioactivity have been released from the plant,\" said Metropolitan Edison Vice President John \"Jack\" Herbein at the time.",
      "While there were no detectable health effects, the incident changed how nuclear plants operate. Three Mile Island Unite 1 closed in 2019 for economic reasons. Constellation and Microsoft plan to restart the reactor as early as 2027 at what is now called Crane Energy Center. It will add more than 800 megawatts of energy. That\u2019s enough to power more than 800,000 homes. Nuclear power has the highest energy efficiency rate, yet energy producers say the U.S. should remain diversified.",

      "Microsoft is working to add the amount of power back to the grid that the company\u2019s data centers will use from the regional transmission system.",
      "\"Our philosophy as a company is that we will invest to bring onto the electric grid as much or more power than we will consume,\" Smith said. \"We will do that in a way that ensures that none of the neighbors are going to see rise in their electricity rates.\"",
      "Constellation is also partnering with Meta to relicense its Clinton Clean Energy Center in central Illinois for another 20 years.",

Google is partnering with Elementl Power on three nuclear projects, each expected to produce 600 megawatts.",
      "\"This is all nuclear. It's a hot industry. It's a brilliant industry,\" President Donald Trump said as he signed several executive orders in May. Those are intended to quadruple domestic nuclear power production within the next 25 years.",
      "\"To win the AI race, we're going to need a lot of energy,\" White House A.I. and Crypto Czar David Sacks said. \"The new AI data centers are very power hungry. They consume a lot of electricity. And the U.S. electric grid really hasn't grown very much over the past decade.\"",

      "At the center of the controversy is the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), a company jointly owned by several of the largest U.S. airlines, including Delta, American Airlines and United. ARC\u2019s core business includes managing ticket settlements between airlines and travel agencies. However, under a lesser-known initiative called the Travel Intelligence Program (TIP), ARC collects and monetizes vast amounts of data from domestic flight bookings. This includes names, complete itineraries and payment details.",
      "Internal government records and procurement documents reveal that Customs and Border Protection (CBP), part of the Department of Homeland Security, has purchased access to ARC's TIP data to track individuals of interest across the U.S. While CBP maintains that this data supports criminal and administrative investigations, critics argue that the arrangement raises major privacy concerns.",
      "The data is shared without travelers' knowledge or consent, and ARC reportedly requested that the agency keep its identity confidential unless legally required to disclose it.",
      "The documents confirm that CBP\u2019s initial contract with ARC began in June 2024. It has already been extended and may continue through 2029. Although the initial amounts seem modest, around $11,000 with a recent $6,800 update, the implications are far-reaching.",

The system can be queried by name, credit card or even travel agency. Importantly, it does not include data from tickets purchased directly through airline websites, focusing instead on bookings made via travel agencies, such as Expedia.",

      "The DHS has justified its use of TIP data in a public Privacy Impact Assessment, noting the program helps in active investigations.

      "6 ways you can protect your privacy from data brokers",
      "If you want to take back control of your personal information, here are six smart steps you can take right now to reduce your exposure to data brokers.",
      "1. Book flights directly on airline websites:\u00a0Whenever you can, avoid using third-party travel sites like Expedia, Orbitz or travel agencies. These platforms are the main sources of the data collected by the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) through its Travel Intelligence Program. When you book directly on an airline\u2019s official website or mobile app, your data is far less likely to be shared with ARC or sold to government agencies. While it might be tempting to look for deals on aggregator sites, once you find a fare you like, try to book it directly through the airline.",
      "2. Use virtual or disposable credit cards:\u00a0The ARC system allows queries by credit card number, which means your travel activity can be tracked even if your name is not directly searched. To protect yourself, consider using a virtual credit card or a disposable card number for flight bookings. These are often available through banking apps or fintech services like Revolut, Privacy.com or certain American Express accounts. Virtual cards are tied to your main account but generate a temporary number that can only be used once or at a specific merchant. This makes it much harder for brokers to link future bookings to you.",
      "3. Share the bare minimum when booking:\u00a0Be cautious about the personal information you enter during the booking process. Unless it is legally required, avoid adding unnecessary details like your frequent flyer number, passport data for domestic flights or secondary phone numbers. You can also create a separate email address specifically for travel bookings to reduce the risk of cross-linking data with your other online accounts. When it comes to loyalty programs, consider opting out or using a separate identity if you are concerned about data being shared across companies.",
      "4. Remove your data from the internet:\u00a0The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Delete",
      "5. Use a privacy-focused browser and email service: Prevent tracking at the source by using privacy-first tools.

      "Netanyahu called the military operation \"a historic victory,\" adding that it \"set back the two tumors that were threatening the life of Israel \u2013 the nuclear tumor and the ballistic missile tumor.\" But, he warned, \"just like a tumor, it can grow back... \u00a0You have to constantly monitor the situation to make sure that there's no attempt to bring it back.\"",
      "Michael Makovsky, CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), told Fox News Digital that one key goal of the meeting was to define red lines for future action.",
      "\"The war with Iran was ended a little abruptly by Trump,\" Makovsky said. \"The Israelis wanted to continue it a couple more days, or at least until there was an understanding with the U.S. about what would trigger another response.\"",

      "Trump, however, emphasized his peacemaking ambitions. \"I\u2019m stopping wars,\" he said.",

We cherish life.\"",

Palestinians should have it. And I hope that we can secure it.\"",
      "Makovsky said Trump now sees Gaza and Iran as sequential \"episodes.\" \"He sees the war with Iran as a successful episode \u2013 it\u2019s time to end that and pivot to peace,\" he said. \"He wants to move toward expanding the Abraham Accords, particularly with Saudi Arabia.\"",
      "The two leaders also touched on Syria. \"I think there\u2019s an opportunity to explore,\" Netanyahu said, referencing recent shifts after the collapse of the Assad regime. Makovsky said Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa may be seeking \"some sort of arrangement\" with Israel to gain U.S. support. \"He\u2019s incredibly flexible and practical,\" Makovsky noted.",

      "\"We've entered a new era of the U.S.-Israel strategic partnership as a result of this conflict,\" John Hannah, Senior Fellow at\u00a0the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA) specializing in defense and strategy, said during a press briefing in reference to the strikes against Iran ahead of the Monday meeting.",
      "\"For the first time in history, the United States and Israel have gone to war together jointly in offensive operations against the military capabilities of a primary common adversary,\" he added. \"That's a very big deal.\"",
      "Experts agree that Trump and Netanyahu are expected to address the future of U.S.-Israeli relations, not only as it relates to deterring Iran\u2019s nuclear program, but because the Jewish leader will look to cement this level of U.S. support.",
      "\"I think he's going to try to make that case with President Trump about what a critical ally Israel could be for the rest of his term,\" JINSA President and CEO, Michael\u00a0Makovsky, told reporters.",
      "But when asked by Fox News Digital if the security experts expected the president to provide Israel with additional military aid, like B-2 bombers as some reporting has recently suggested, they were both skeptical given the sophisticated nature of the arms.",
      "While Netanyahu will look to cement U.S. support for Israel, Trump will also be looking to leverage the aid that Washington has already provided to secure political wins at home.",

      "Trump has repeatedly said he wants the war in the Gaza Strip to end and to see the return of all 50 hostages, including the two remaining Americans still held by the Hamas terrorist network, Omer Neutra and Itay Chen.",
      "But his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has been unable to secure a deal that both Hamas and Israel can agree to \u2014 the hiccup largely centering around the inability to find a solution that ends Israeli military operations as well as establishes a \u2018day after\u2019 plan for Gaza.",
      "Witkoff was expected to visit Egypt for additional negotiations in the coming days, though no official travel plans have yet been announced.",
      "Neither the White House nor the State Department confirmed with Fox News Digital whether a date would be set after Trump\u2019s meeting with Netanyahu.",
      "But Trump is expected to pressure his Israeli counterpart to finally end the more than 20-month-long war.",

      "Makovsky said that despite the U.S.\u2019s recent decision not to send some previously pledged aid to Ukraine, Trump is unlikely to back off aid to Israel.",

    "story": [
      "Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will visit with President Trump at the White House next Monday",
      "President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet at the White House on Monday. One of the most difficult questions on the table is what Gaza might look like without Hamas.",
      "Experts tell Fox News Digital that while the need for an alternative is clear, almost every proposed solution comes with serious structural, political and security limitations.",
      "John Hannah, a senior fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA) and veteran of both Republican and Democratic administrations, said building an alternative to Hamas must happen in parallel with dismantling it.",
      "THE HISTORY OF GAZA AMID TRUMP'S PLAN TO REBUILD ENCLAVE",
      "Hamas terrorists emerge from the shadows as they surround Red Cross vehicles. (TPS-IL)",
      "\"Part of how you win is by showing there\u2019s a viable alternative,\" Hannah said. \"People need to see there\u2019s a future beyond Hamas\"",
      "That future, experts believe, lies in a non-Hamas technocratic government \u2013 comprised of Palestinians unaffiliated with either Hamas or the PLO \u2013 backed by a coalition of key Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and the UAE.",
      "\"While a new administration in Gaza should be independent, some\u00a0symbolic link to the Palestinian Authority\u00a0could enhance its\u00a0legitimacy\u00a0with the Arabs.\u00a0Perhaps\u00a0Ramallah\u00a0could serve as a pass-through for paying salaries. But the PA won\u2019t call the shots,\" Hannah said.",
      "\"The default right now, if Israel ends up leaving Gaza, is Hamas,\" said Ghaith al-Omari, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \"There is no one on the ground who can challenge them. And there is no Arab involvement without the defeat of Hamas. Not just a ceasefire \u2013 actual disarmament.\"",
      "Palestinians carry bags and boxes containing food and humanitarian aid packages delivered by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.-backed organization, in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, June 16, 2025. (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)",
      "At best, said al-Omari who served as the former executive director of the American Task Force on Palestine, the PA might offer a \"kosher stamp\" to satisfy Arab states, which have made clear they will only intervene in Gaza under a Palestinian national umbrella.",
      "TRUMP PRESSURES ISRAEL TO END GAZA CONFLICT AS HE EYES ABRAHAM ACCORDS EXPANSION",
      "\"Without that symbolic PA invitation, Egypt and others won\u2019t come in,\" said al-Omari. \"But they still need a political framework \u2013 some commitment to a two-state solution. Without that, they have absolutely no incentive to play a role in Gaza.\"",
      "Securing Israeli approval for any new Gaza administration is another major hurdle. An Israeli security official told Fox News Digital that any deal would need to include guarantees that Israel retains counterterrorism access to prevent Hamas from reemerging.",
      "\"Something like what exists in the West Bank \u2013 buffer zones, perimeter security, and the right of the IDF or Shin Bet to act on intelligence when needed,\" Hannah said.",
      "IDF forces operating in Rafah, in the Gaza Strip. (IDF Spokesman's Office)",
      "That framework, he noted, would require intensive American-led diplomacy with sustained presence and coordination.",
      "\"I can\u2019t see anyone else but the United States doing it \u2013 there are too many inner-Arab rivalries,\" Hannah said, \"No other actor has the relationships, resources or trust required to bridge the deep divides between Israel, Arab states and international players. Everyone\u2019s going to want the U.S. at the center of this. And there\u2019s no doubt President Trump wants to solve it.\"",
      "\"Qatar is the elephant in the room,\" said Hannah, \"They bring a lot of\u00a0much-needed\u00a0money,\u00a0but\u00a0they\u2019ve had\u00a0a\u00a0deeply problematic\u00a0relationship with Hamas. If they want a seat at the table, it has to be with strict conditions \u2013 money flowing through trusted, externally controlled channels. But they can\u2019t\u00a0be a key player in\u00a0this effort.\"",
      "The United Nations, meanwhile, is largely out. \"UNRWA\u2019s days are over,\" said Hannah. \"They can\u2019t run education or the economy in Gaza anymore. At most, the U.N. might endorse a U.S.-Arab-Israeli plan with a Security Council resolution \u2013 but they won\u2019t play an operational role.\"",

      "One proposal gaining quiet traction in Israeli and American circles is the idea of empowering local clans to establish self-governing enclaves.",
      "Joseph Braude, president of the Center for Peace Communications, has spoken extensively with activists on the ground and believes this model could mark the beginning of an alternative.",
      "\"It may not be realistic to talk about one civil administration managing all of Gaza right now,\" Braude said, \"But in discrete geographical enclaves within the strip, you can pilot non-Hamas self-rule. Local Gazans patrol internally while the IDF or another force secures the perimeter. \"",
      "\"There\u2019s a fiber of educated, civically minded individuals in Gaza \u2013 from engineers to teachers \u2013 who are not Islamists,\" he added, \"If vetted properly, they can manage administration, education and basic services. But you have to start by identifying who they are and what they actually believe.\"",
      "Braude pointed to one such case: Yasser Abu Shabab, a local militia leader. \"This is the first anti-Hamas militia to emerge in Gaza in a generation. He\u2019s a local fighter from a Bedouin clan with family ties to Egyptian forces battling ISIS in Sinai. He says he wants to invite civil servants to begin staffing an administration.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin meets with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House on April 7, 2025. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)",
      "But not everyone agrees this is feasible. \"These groups are fragmented, displaced and lack the legitimacy or cohesion to govern,\" said al-Omari. \"You might use these militias to secure aid deliveries in a specific area, but they can\u2019t form the basis of governance.\"",
      "Dr. Michael Milstein, head of the Forum for Palestinian Studies at Tel Aviv University, told Fox News Digital, \"Since the war began, several attempts to promote clans as an alternative to Hamas have also failed, like the Doghmush clan, whose leaders were executed by Hamas in early 2024.\"",
      "\"Even now, figures like Abu Shabab in Rafah or the Barbakh family in Khan Younis are fringe cases,\" Milstein added. \"Hamas still controls most of the public space. Clans may offer localized solutions, but they are no cohesive or legitimate alternative. Many are openly loyal to Hamas.\"",

      "\"Many say, until Palestinians teach their children to love themselves more than they hate Israel, there will never be peace,\" Braude said, \"That\u2019s true. But who is actually working to foster a Palestinian leadership [that] does so? That\u2019s the challenge \u2013 and the opportunity \u2013 right now.\"",

      "This new wave of paranoia and fear, he explained, mirrors tactics seen in North Korea \u2014 where citizens vanish without explanation and information is tightly controlled. During the recent conflict, Iran\u2019s leadership imposed a total internet blackout to isolate the population, blocking Israeli evacuation alerts, and pushed propaganda that framed Israel as targeting civilians indiscriminately.",

      "Earlier this week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order lifting most U.S. sanctions on Syria, in a move experts say reflects growing recognition inside the administration that Syria, long a battleground for Iranian influence and Islamist terror, may now offer the U.S. a rare opportunity to reclaim regional leverage, counter enemies, and support allies like Israel and Jordan.",
      "At a White House press briefing Monday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, \"This is another promise made and promise kept by this president,\" she said, referring to Trump\u2019s recent meeting with Syria\u2019s new transitional leader Ahmed al-Sharaa during a trip to Saudi Arabia. \"He\u2019s committed to supporting a Syria that is stable, unified, and at peace with itself and its neighbors.\"",

      "Javed Ali, former senior official at the National Security Council and professor at the University of Michigan, told Fox News Digital, \"It\u2019s a strategic calculation. A Syria that no longer hosts Iranian proxies, cooperates on counterterrorism, and integrates with Arab neighbors serves U.S. interests on every front.\"",
      "According to Schenker, Syria has taken steps the U.S. has long demanded: allowing inspections by the IAEA and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, sharing intelligence on ISIS, and cooperating with American liaison officers on counterterrorism. \"These groups have declared al-Sharaa an infidel. They themselves are being attacked by ISIS,\" he noted.",

      "For the U.S., the stakes extend far beyond sanctions relief. Schenker said a stable Syria focused on education and social services, rather than military buildup, would be far less fertile ground for ISIS or Iranian influence.",
      "Ali described the current moment as part of a broader Trump strategy: \"Now with Assad gone, it\u2019s another blow to the Islamic Republic of Iran. This creates an opportunity to coalesce the Sunni Arab states \u2013 either around the Abraham Accords or a growing anti-Iran coalition.\"",
      "The U.S. military still maintains a small but critical footprint in Syria \u2013 approximately 1,000 troops across three to four bases in the northeast \u2013 providing vital intelligence and rapid strike capability. \"That footprint has been one of our most important counterterrorism outposts,\" Ali said. \"We\u2019ve seen multiple targeted operations this year alone.\"",

      "Meanwhile, the diplomatic implications of Trump\u2019s move are drawing global attention. Syria\u2019s new leadership has publicly distanced itself from Iran, reportedly blocked Hezbollah weapon shipments, and dismantled multiple Iranian military posts across the country.",
      "\"The president is genuinely focused on expanding the Abraham Accords,\" said Schenker. \"He sees Syria as the next possible candidate.\"",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital. \"President Trump is working towards lasting peace in the Middle East, which includes supporting a Syria that is stable, unified, and at peace with itself and its neighbors. The President is empowering Syria\u2019s success by lifting sanctions on export controls while maintaining sanctions on terrorists and all other potential threats to the United States. The President made a promise to give Syria a chance to rebuild and thrive by lifting sanctions, and this President keeps his promises.\"",
      "A masked Islamic State terrorist holds the ISIS flag in 2015. (Pictures from History/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Still, normalization with Israel remains politically fraught. Syria remains officially at war with the Jewish state, and while Sharaa has hinted at accepting the pre-1974 ceasefire lines, jihadist factions and Islamist groups within Syria remain staunchly opposed. \"There have already been reported assassination attempts on Sharaa,\" Schenker said. \"It\u2019s going to get harder if he moves from non-belligerency to full normalization.\"",
      "Charles Lister, director of the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, told Fox News Digital, \"Syria has always been an open wound in the center of the region \u2013 an engine of instability\u2026 But if it stabilizes now, it unlocks a path for broader regional integration. It connects Israel and Jordan to a more secure arc and reduces the need for heavy U.S. military involvement.\"",

He argued that this is part of the terror group\u2019s \"primary objective,\" which he says is \"to get the IDF to kill as many civilians as possible so they can achieve what they have achieved, which is the vilification of Israel, the isolation of Israel, and the condemnation of Israel \u2014 the accusations of war crimes and genocide \u2014 none of which are true.\" He commended the IDF, saying that Israeli forces have \"done a quite extraordinary job that no other army probably could do of maximizing the destruction of Hamas while minimizing the deaths of civilians.\"",
      "While on the ground in Gaza, Kemp had the opportunity to speak with civilians and visit aid distribution sites run by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). He said the civilians who spoke with him were grateful for the aid and recognized the role the U.S., under President Donald Trump, has played. At the same time, they hold Hamas responsible for putting them in \"the terrible situation they're in now.\"",
      "People carry boxes of relief supplies from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private US-backed aid group that has bypassed the longstanding UN-led system in the territory, as displaced Palestinians return from an aid distribution center in the central Gaza Strip on June 8, 2025. The UN and major aid organizations have refused to cooperate with the GHF, citing concerns that it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.\u00a0 (EYAD BABA/AFP via Getty Images)",

      "When asked about the criticism GHF has faced from the international community \u2014 particularly the United Nations \u2014 Kemp said that the organization is working in a way that is \"uniquely suitable\" for the situation in Gaza. He argued that the U.N. is attempting to apply a \"standard template solution,\" which does not work for Gaza, as evidenced by the amount of aid stolen by Hamas.",
      "\"Some of them told me it was the first time since the war began, 20 months ago, that they have actually received any free aid at all,\" Kemp told Fox News Digital. He said that in some instances, Hamas would steal aid and sell the goods at premium prices that many civilians could not afford.",

      "\"No other country that I know of has directly contributed funding to the GHF, and they should do so because the GHF, not the U.N., is the future of aid deliveries into Gaza,\" Kemp told Fox News Digital. He also acknowledged that the U.N. has a role to play, but added that it must be \"in the interest of the people of Gaza, not bureaucracy.\"",

      "Modern weather forecasts have never been so accurate, but they still have their limits.",
      "The intense rainfall that sent floodwaters coursing through central Texas last week and surprised even some Texas officials with the severity has brought into stark focus the challenge of forecasting the most severe storms and what even the best weather models can\u2019t deliver.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an expectation a catastrophe like this is going to be able to be forecast hours or days in advance and that\u2019s just not the case,\u201d said Alan Gerard, a former director of the analysis and understanding branch at the National Severe Storms Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Models \u201ccan basically show there will be areas of intense rainfall, but they very rarely put it in the exact right spot.\u201d",
      "Efforts to close that rift are at risk. Climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme rainfalls, making improvements to models all the more urgent. NOAA is working to improve forecasting tools to better predict rainfall intensity and precise location, but the Trump administration\u2019s most recent budget request for the agency, which proposes to cut the budget by more than $2 billion, would shut down much of the agency\u2019s severe storm research.",
      "While National Weather Service forecasters had warned broadly about flash flooding in central Texas in advance, Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon said the best weather models could not predict precisely where the most intense rainfall would fall, or that the deluge would stall out over a flood-prone basin."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/deadly-texas-floods-one-town-warning-siren-rcna217202",
    "published": "Tue, 08 Jul 2025 00:17:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Officials in Texas Hill Country are starting to focus on alert systems like the one in Comfort as they search for answers on how the flash flooding swept away so many in Kerrville.",
    "story": [
      "As heavy rain triggered flash flood warnings along the Guadalupe River in Texas Hill Country early Friday, the small unincorporated town of Comfort had something its neighbors upriver in Kerr County didn\u2019t: wailing sirens urging residents to flee before the water could swallow them.",
      "Comfort had recently updated its disaster alert system, installing a new siren in the volunteer fire department\u2019s headquarters and moving the old one to a low-lying area of town along Cypress Creek, a tributary of the Guadalupe that is prone to flooding. Friday was the first time the new two-siren system had been used outside of tests, providing a last-minute alarm for anyone who hadn\u2019t responded to previous warnings on their cellphones or evacuation announcements from firefighters driving around town.",
      "\u201cPeople knew that if they heard the siren, they gotta get out,\u201d said Danny Morales, assistant chief of the Comfort Volunteer Fire Department.",
      "Morales said that no one died in Comfort, a town of about 2,300 people in Kendall County. But in Kerr County about 20 miles away, dozens of people, including young girls staying at Camp Mystic, a riverside Christian summer camp, were washed away when the Guadalupe surged over its banks and swamped the surrounding countryside. As of Monday evening, officials said, 104 people had been confirmed dead, 84 of them in Kerr County, including dozens of children. Kerr County has no siren system despite years of debate, in part because some local officials felt it was too expensive to install.",
      "The part of Texas Hill Country known as \u201cflash flood alley\u201d has seen rising waters many times before, but the swift and punishing destruction over the Fourth of July has focused attention on whether local officials are doing enough to protect their residents as climate change causes more frequent and severe weather disasters and the federal government is slashing spending on emergency preparedness.",
      "The swollen river has receded, leaving behind heartbreaking signs of the devastation: little girls\u2019 suitcases and clothes strewn along the wrecked cabin grounds and plush toys caked with detritus, twisted metal and gnarled vehicles. Three days after the flooding, searchers were still picking through downed trees and hunting through thick black mud for those still missing. Parents\u2019 hopes were dimming as the days dragged on with no signs of life.",
      "It is impossible to know whether a siren system in Kerr County would have saved lives; they are meant to alert people who are outdoors, not in bed indoors, as many of Kerr County\u2019s victims were when the river rose overnight \u2014 at one point by 26 feet in just 45 minutes.",
      "The weather service issued a flood watch for the area Thursday afternoon and an urgent flash flood warning for Kerr County at 1:14 a.m. Friday, a move that triggers the wireless emergency alerts on cellphones.",
      "By the time flooding inundated low-lying parts of Kendall County, where Comfort is located, it was later Friday morning. The first weather service flash flood alert for Kendall came at 7:24 a.m. When the sirens went off, many residents were already awake and aware of the dangerous flooding. A Facebook video recorded by Jeff Flinn, the managing editor of The Boerne Star, shows the emergency sirens in Comfort sounding at 10:52 a.m.; he said the alert lasted for about 30 seconds.",
      "Kerr County was relying on the emergency alerts that blare on cellphones. Those alerts may not get through, particularly in rural areas with bad service or in the night when phones are off or when there are no phones around; the girls at the summer camp weren\u2019t allowed to bring them. And some may choose to ignore them, because they\u2019re bombarded by phone alerts.",
      "Some Texas officials have blamed the National Weather Service, arguing it didn\u2019t do a good enough job forecasting rainfall and issuing timely flood warnings. But some independent meteorologists and a former weather service official told NBC News that the agency performed as well as it could given the unpredictability of rain and flash flooding and the timing of the disaster.",
      "Tom Moser, a former Kerr County commissioner, said he began looking into a warning system for his area after flooding in Hays County, which was overwhelmed by the Blanco River, killed 13 people over Memorial Day weekend in 2015.",
      "Kerr County officials debated various options, including one for an alert system that included sensors and sirens, and the cost was about $1 million, Moser said.",
      "\u201cThere were a number of people that did not like the sirens going off because they go off accidentally,\u201d Moser said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want that disturbance in the Hill Country.\u201d",
      "At a March 2016 commissioners\u2019 meeting, Rusty Hierholzer, then the Kerr County sheriff, was adamant that the deadly flooding in the Hays County community of Wimberley was a warning for the need to install sirens in addition to a phone app notification system known as Code Red already in use.",
      "In Wimberley, some people didn\u2019t get alerts on their phones, \u201cso yes, you need both,\u201d Hierholzer said, according to a transcript of the meeting. \u201cYou need the sirens, and you need Code Red to try and make sure we\u2019ll notify everybody as we can when it\u2019s coming up.\u201d",
      "During a follow-up discussion about the proposal that August, then-Commissioner H.A. \u201cBuster\u201d Baldwin questioned the flood warning system they were considering, saying, \u201cI think this whole thing is a little extravagant for Kerr County, with sirens and such,\u201d according to a transcript.",
      "They estimated the system would cost $1 million, and they didn't have the money to add it to the budget.",
      "Moser said they also didn\u2019t get disaster relief funding they\u2019d asked for from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. \u201cAs a matter of fact, there were no grants available we thought we could get in a timely fashion,\u201d Moser said."

There has been no change to this date, and there will be no change. In other words, all money will be due and payable starting AUGUST 1, 2025 \u2014 No extensions will be granted. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\u201d",
      "Stocks, already on edge after Trump began sending out warning letters Monday, fell meaningfully into the red after the post went live, though returned to nearly flat on the day shortly after noon Tuesday.",
      "In remarks to reporters around 12:30 p.m. Tuesday, Trump clarified, \u201cWe can do things over the years, too. \u2026 We\u2019re not hard-line.\u201d",
      "He also appeared to backpedal on announcing deals that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday would materialize in 48 hours.",
      "\u201cThe deals are mostly my deal to them,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re picking a number that\u2019s low.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhile continued noise around tariffs could well generate some volatility in the near term, we think the bar for another major sell-off remains quite high,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump announced the new deadline while publishing more than a dozen letters warning countries their goods would be subject to tariff levels close to the eye-watering ones he laid out in his shock \u201cLiberation Day\u201d speech in April.",
      "\u201cThe tariff rollercoaster ride continues,\u201d ING analysts wrote in a note Monday. \u201cWhile the \u2018letters\u2019 leave some more room for continued frontloading \u2014 although shipping times need to be considered \u2014 and negotiations, they also mean that the tariff saga continues.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe ongoing uncertainty could do almost as much economic harm as actual tariffs,\u201d they added.",
      "Other Wall Street analysts estimated that the tariff rates contained in the 14 letters sent out so far could add slightly to consumer inflation, even though many of the recipients are small trading partners.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab noted that the letters sent Monday would hike the effective tariff rate on U.S. consumers to the highest since 1934.",
      "Bank of America analysts said in a note that they \u201cdon\u2019t think the tariffs announced on Monday are a done deal,\u201d adding that \u2014 despite Trump\u2019s assertions \u2014 they view the deadline extension to Aug. 1 as a suggestion that \u201cthere is still room for negotiation.\u201d",
      "With passage of his controversial tax cut and spending bill now behind him, Trump is once again stoking the fires of his trade war. He remains fixated on closing the U.S.\u2019s trade gap \u2014 or the difference in how much America imports versus how much it exports \u2014 with other nations.",
      "It\u2019s a preoccupation many economists dismiss as simplistic, since it merely reflects the fact that the U.S. is a large, advanced economy that no longer needs to produce goods, from clothing to school supplies, that can be made more cost-effectively elsewhere.",
      "Meanwhile, the economies of the smaller nations that the U.S. relies on to supply it with those lower-cost goods stand to be devastated by any changes to trade flows.",
      "Nations around the world have responded by signaling resistance to the latest round of Trump\u2019s threats. Chinese state media warned the Trump administration Tuesday against striking deals that sideline China, especially tariffs on transshipments aimed at circumventing China\u2019s duties. Meanwhile, Germany\u2019s finance minister warned that the European Union would impose retaliatory measures on U.S. goods if a \u201cfair\u201d deal does not materialize.",
      "\u201cWe want an agreement with the Americans, but I also say very clearly that this deal must be fair,\u201d Lars Klingbeil told German parliament members Tuesday. \u201cAnd if we do not succeed in reaching a fair deal with the United States, then the European Union will have to take countermeasures to protect our economy.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Newly released interviews and documentation further bolster evidence that Hamas systematically used sexual violence as a weapon of war during its Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack, according to a report by a group of Israeli gender and legal scholars.",
      "The report unveiled Tuesday, titled \"A Quest for Justice,\" was published by the Dinah Project, a legal research initiative led by Ruth Halperin-Kaddari, women's rights activist and law professor at of Tel Aviv\u2019s Bar-Ilan University; Sharon Zagagi-Pinhas, a lawyer and the former chief military prosecutor at the Israel Defense Forces; and Nava Ben-Or, a former judge and deputy attorney general.",
      "Partly funded by the British government and Jewish nonprofit organizations, the report contains previously unheard accounts from 15 returned hostages from Gaza, along with testimony from a rape survivor from the Nova music festival, one of at least six different locations where Hamas carried out its attacks.",
      "It also includes eyewitness testimony from at least 17 different incidents of sexual assault, as well as accounts from first responders, forensic evidence, and audio and visual documentation.",
      "The issue of sexual assault and rape during the Oct. 7 attacks is highly emotive and charged, with some in Israel accusing United Nations observers of betraying survivors by downplaying the issue. Meanwhile, some international observers, including a United Nations official appointed to investigate, say that while there is evidence of cases of rape and sexual assault, this evidence does not point to those incidents having been systematic or directed by militant leaders.",
      "Hamas has denied that its militants committed sexual crimes on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The report states that clear patterns emerged of sexual violence being perpetrated, including victims who were found \u201cpartially or fully naked with their hands tied, often to structures like trees or poles; evidence of gang rapes followed by execution; genital mutilation; and public humiliation.\u201d The details add to and corroborate past reporting on sexual violence that took place during the attacks.",
      "The sexual violence \"continued in captivity, with many returnees reporting forced nudity, physical and verbal sexual harassment, sexual assaults and threats of forced marriage,\u201d the report adds.",
      "The victims also include two returned male hostages who were released in January and February after being held captive for about 500 days, where they were subjected to \"sexual humiliation, which included forced nudity and physical abuse when naked,\" according to the report.",
      "In light of the testimonies, the report aims to have the sexual violence acknowledged as crimes against humanity and to hold the perpetrators accountable.",
      "Notably, it calls on the U.N. to send a fact-finding mission and blacklist Hamas as a group. \u201cWe hence call upon the U.N. Secretary-General to blacklist Hamas as an organization responsible for the tactical use of sexual violence as a weapon of war,\u201d it states.",
      "Reem Alsalem, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on violence against women and girls, said in a statement that she and fellow rapporteurs and experts emphasized that reports of such violence needed to be independently verified and investigated and perpetrators be held accountable.",
      "She added that the U.N. special commission appointed to investigate \"found patterns indicative of sexual violence against Israeli women at different locations.

    "story": [
      "A provision tucked inside a sweeping bill signed into law by President Donald Trump last week will make it harder for thousands of aspiring doctors to finance their education as the country faces a growing shortage in that profession.",
      "The move will cap the amount of federal loans students can borrow for graduate school to $20,500 a year \u2014 with a total limit of $100,000 \u2014 and cap loans for professional programs, such as  medical, dental or law school, at $50,000 a year, with a total limit of $200,000.",
      "While those limits may sound like large amounts, medical school students graduate with an average of more than $264,000 in educational debt and the cost of medical school programs can exceed $300,000 at private universities, according to the Education Data Initiative. \u200b\u200bWithout the ability to take out more federal loans, prospective students say they will have to turn to  private loans, which can have stricter borrowing or repayment options, or potentially put off their medical school plans.",
      "\u201cI have watched a lot of students get into debt, and it is scary, but part of the medical training and the medical education system, it\u2019s an expensive journey. I think that it\u2019s something that the government needs to understand,\u201d said Zoe Lewczak, a 26-year-old bioethics master\u2019s student at Harvard Medical School, who is in the process of applying to 30 schools for MD-Ph.D. programs. \u201cWhat is currently happening, I think this is going to create a major gap in who is able to access medical education and pursue it.\u201d",
      "The legislation, which Republicans have dubbed the \u201cone big, beautiful bill,\u201d largely focuses on providing trillions of dollars in tax cuts for businesses, increased spending for immigration enforcement and cuts to health insurance programs. But within the nearly 900-page law are several changes to student loan programs, including the elimination of a loan program put in place in 2006 called Grad PLUS, which allows students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance.",
      "The Grad PLUS loans were initially intended to help more people attend graduate and professional programs. But opponents of the loan program have argued that it has allowed colleges and universities to increase tuition unchecked because students have been able to borrow essentially unlimited amounts of money, leaving borrowers with financially crippling levels of debt.",
      "Medical schools have warned the loan cap could discourage students from going into medicine at a time when the country is already on track to have a shortage of as many as 86,000 physicians by 2036, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. The group said that medical school tuition increases have slowed since the introduction of the loan program.",
      "\u201cThis will intensify challenges for medical students to finance their education due to some of the complexities of private loans, and we believe it will result in an additional financial barrier to attending medical school,\u201d said Kristen Earle, AAMC program leader for student financial aid services. \u201cThis added barrier could deter qualified candidates from pursuing a medical degree altogether, ultimately worsening the existing and expected physician shortage.\u201d",
      "The student loan cap comes as universities are already struggling with wider funding cuts. Trump has sought to cut off various forms of federal funding for institutions that have policies with which he disagrees, and the Department of Government Efficiency has cut or frozen medical and scientific funding schools rely on.",
      "For Lewczak, the loan cap will likely force her to find financial assistance beyond the government. At her top-choice medical school, the average student leaves with $400,000 in debt \u2014 double the loan limit that will be imposed by the bill. With the new loan cap, she\u2019s considering taking out private loans, something she thinks should be an option since she has built up good credit.",
      "\u201cThere seems to be this misconception that federal student loans are just like free handouts, and that is very much false,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are signing an agreement, you are paying it back with the interest rate.\u201d",
      "While private loans will still be an option for some students, those loans aren\u2019t eligible for public service loan forgiveness programs, like those for doctors who work in underserved communities. Private loans can also come with less flexible repayment options or require the borrower to have a co-signer, Earle said.",
      "As a first-generation college student, Lewczak created a TikTok account to help students figure out how to fund graduate school in higher education. She predicts the new law will create a gap in students who want to pursue medicine and students who can actually access that education.",
      "Other current and prospective medical school students have also taken to social media to share their concerns over the loan limit.",
      "Shae-Marie Stafford-Trujillo, 23, who is completing a one-year post-bachelor certificate program at Baylor School of Medicine in Houston, said the bill is already dashing her hopes of studying at some of her top-choice medical schools, like Stanford University, where one year of attendance costs more than $150,000.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine how almost surreal it feels to not even be able to go to an institution and study that,\u201d said Stafford-Trujillo, who hopes to specialize in research around narcolepsy, a condition she has personally struggled with. \u201cIt\u2019s not even across the world, it\u2019s potentially only a couple of 100 miles away, but now I don\u2019t even have the opportunity to go and study at some of these institutions.\u201d",
      "Unless she gets into an MD-Ph.D. program, which could be fully paid for, Stafford-Trujillo likely will only be able to afford an in-state medical school in Texas.",
      "\u201cYou could imagine and empathize with now students are no longer able to apply broadly or to apply to programs, potentially their dream school,\u201d she said.",
      "Lauren Garkow, 25, is halfway through a four-year medical school based in the Caribbean and is interested in pursuing a career in pathology when she graduates. She said her classmates have already struggled to afford even the basic necessities \u2014 a struggle she expects to get even worse if loans are limited.",
      "\u201cI really fear for all the medical students who have to deal with that new bill,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHealth care as a whole will be affected,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is going to have a ripple effect on all of us.\u201d"

      "If your exercise routine has hit a summer slump, it may be because your workouts aren\u2019t suited to your personality, new research suggests.",
      "Personality traits can influence which physical activities people enjoy, as well as how often and how much benefit they get from exercise, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.",
      "About 31% of adults fall short of the recommended 150 minutes of moderately intense physical activity per week, highlighting the need for tailored exercise programs to get people motivated, scientists at University College London said.",
      "\u201cUnderstanding personality factors in designing and recommending physical activity programs is likely to be very important in determining how successful a program is, and whether people will stick with it and become fitter,\u201d senior author Paul Burgess, a professor at the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, said in a news release.",
      "The researchers recruited 132 adults, who underwent baseline fitness testing before they were split into two groups.",
      "For eight weeks, one group was asked to follow a home fitness regimen that included strength training and cycling workouts of varying intensity. Those in the control group were provided with stretching exercises but otherwise continued their typical lifestyles.",
      "It\u2019s expected that introverts would gravitate toward solo workouts and extroverts would shine in group fitness classes, but the study showed some surprises.",
      "To participate, the volunteers filled out questionnaires that measured the so-called Big Five personality traits:",
      "AgreeablenessConscientiousnessExtraversionNeuroticismOpenness",
      "Agreeableness",
      "Conscientiousness",
      "Extraversion",
      "Neuroticism",
      "Openness",
      "The more extroverted participants did enjoy high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts and aerobic fitness lab testing.",
      "However, people who scored high on extraversion were less likely to complete follow-up testing, so only 86 participants overall completed the study. In addition, extroverts didn\u2019t have greater fitness improvements.",
      "\u201cExtroverts often prefer team sports or group fitness classes, and they get energy from fellow exercisers,\u201d Dr. Blaise Aguirre, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at McLean Hospital in Arlington, Massachusetts, said in an email. \u201cOn the other hand, others who are more conscientious would be drawn to structured, schedule-based activities \u2014 say, a specific class at a gym where a specific and predictable routine is followed \u2014 and this is because this fits their organized, goal-oriented nature.\u201d",
      "People who scored higher on neuroticism \u2014 that is, a tendency to be moody or anxious \u2014 liked low-intensity exercise sessions at home as opposed to being supervised in the lab. They were also less likely to self-monitor their heart rates.",
      "\u201cPeople who are very anxious might avoid challenging forms of exercise or ones that involve others for fear of embarrassment, and because of this gravitate toward solo or less intense activities,\u201d wrote Aguirre, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.",
      "An important finding for people with anxiety: Participants with high neuroticism in the exercise group were the only ones who showed decreased stress, the authors noted.",
      "At baseline, the participants who were more conscientious demonstrated better physical fitness and worked out more hours per week. That trait wasn\u2019t a predictor of how much someone enjoyed exercising, though.",
      "Participants who scored high in openness were less likely to enjoy the HIIT workouts and threshold rides \u2014 or cycling to boost aerobic power \u2014 which involved varying intensities. But they were likelier to complete follow-up testing.",
      "People who are high in openness might be willing to experiment and seek out novel or varied routines, Aguirre said in email. \u201cFor instance, if they typically go to the gym and like to jog, they may be open to trying dance, hiking or some new fitness trends.\u201d",
      "The trait of agreeableness predicted more enjoyment of an \u201ceasy, long\u201d bike ride, the study found.",
      "Which workouts work for my personality?",
      "The link between personality and physical activity goes both ways, Aguirre said.",
      "\u201cIn as much as your personality shapes your exercise routine, exercise can shape personality in return, in that it can also help reinforce positive traits (like being more disciplined and more sociable) and reduce negative ones (like anxiety or emotional instability),\u201d he said.",
      "Whether you\u2019re looking to refresh your exercise regimen or starting from scratch, Aguirre recommends keeping these tips in mind:",
      "Know yourself and your nature.Choose activities that match your traits.Start small and build consistency.Seek support if needed.Be patient with yourself.",
      "Know yourself and your nature.",

      "The president, who announced on Tuesday a 50% tariff on imported copper and said long-threatened levies on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals were coming soon, said he has long favored simple tariffs over tedious trade talks that often involve red lines for some countries and their own requests for U.S. concessions.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba focused on the positive, saying his government would press ahead with negotiations toward a deal that \u201cbenefits both countries, while protecting Japan\u2019s national interest.\u201d",
      "Facing a 25% general U.S. tariff, Japan wants relief for its export-dependent auto industry from Trump\u2019s separate 25% automotive tariffs. It also has resisted demands for increased purchases of American rice.",
      "Japan, once viewed as an early favorite for a deal, faces an upper house election on July 20 and too many concessions could put Ishiba\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party at risk.",
      "\u201cThese countries are not folding. They\u2019re not giving him what he wants, so he\u2019s added another threat,\u201d said William Reinsch, a former U.S. Commerce Department official who is a senior trade adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cHe\u2019s put a new number to it and extended the deadline.\u201d",
      "South Korea, where President Lee Jae Myung has been in office less than a month, also pledged to intensify talks for \u201ca mutually beneficial result\u201d while analysts warned he would not be \u201ca pushover\u201d for Trump or put South Korea at a disadvantage to Japan.",
      "Stephen Miran, chairman of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, told Fox News on Tuesday more deals were possible even before the end of this week, as long as countries made concessions deemed worthy by Trump.",
      "India, in particular, looked close to a deal, but prospects were less clear for smaller countries such as South Africa, Thailand and Malaysia, which face tariffs of 30%, 36% and 25%, respectively.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa pushed back on Trump\u2019s 30% tariff rate, calling it out of sync with an average 7.6% South African tariff rate. But he instructed his negotiators to \u201curgently engage\u201d with Trump\u2019s team on a framework first submitted by the South African side on May 20.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s negotiating time may be eaten up with larger partners, such as the EU, which did not get a warning letter or a change to its prescribed 20% tariff rate, double the 10% baseline.",
      "Sources familiar with the EU talks have told Reuters a deal could involve carve-outs for aircraft and parts, medical equipment and alcoholic spirits. They say the EU also wants certain automakers to export to the U.S. at rates below the 25% auto tariff.",
      "Such a deal would be similar to a framework agreement with the United Kingdom that had carve-outs for autos, steel and aircraft engines.",
      "Final squeeze",
      "After announcing his global \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs of 11%-50% in early April, Trump quickly dialed them back to 10% for most countries amid bond market turmoil to buy time for negotiations to lower foreign tariffs and trade barriers.",
      "Ryan Majerus, another former U.S. Commerce official, said Trump\u2019s three-month pause had not produced the desired results, and now the president was seeking to maximize his negotiating leverage.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to pressure-test things and see how far they can go, particularly for countries where there hasn\u2019t been any movement in the talks,\u201d said Majerus, who is a partner at Washington\u2019s King and Spalding law firm.",
      "Steadier markets and strong economic data give Trump some room to maneuver, but time is short and \u201cthe more granular you get in negotiating these things, the tougher the sledding gets,\u201d he added.",
      "The deadline extension provides no relief to companies that are trying to keep up with Trump\u2019s tariffs. Executives say the rapidly shifting tariff landscape has paralyzed decision-making as they try to adjust their supply chains and cost structures to avoid tariff-induced price hikes.",
      "\u201cNo company can really prepare for this,\u201d said Hubertus Breier, chief technology officer for Germany\u2019s Lapp Holdings, a family-owned maker of cables, wires and robotics for factories. \u201cWe are already incurring losses simply because of the uncertainty of the daily changing situation.\u201d",
      "Lapp has difficult choices \u2014 absorb additional costs or pass them on to customers. Assuming permanently higher prices and costs, however, could threaten its long-term existence, Breier added.",
      "DeMejico, a family business in Valencia, California with a plant in Mexico that builds traditional Spanish and Mexican-style furniture, is struggling to adapt to Trump\u2019s 50% tariffs on imported steel. Robert Luna, the company\u2019s president, said the firm is importing heavy steel latches, hinges and trim parts separately to simplify the tariff calculation process and installing them at its Los Angeles-area showroom.",
      "The tariffs and higher U.S. wage costs are already inflating prices, and DeMejico faces further cost increases on furniture if Trump hits Mexico with a reciprocal tariff, Luna said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to do anything about this as a small business owner, so I just try to be stoic and see what happens,\u201d Luna said, adding: \u201cMy biggest worry is just keeping the company alive.\u201d",
      "Luna said he thought the Trump administration was \u201csetting up the foundation to train people to pay tariffs.\u201d",

      "Boeing delivered 60 airplanes last month, the most since December 2023, as the plane maker seeks to raise production of its bestselling 737 Max jets after a series of manufacturing and safety problems.",
      "The tally was the highest since before a door plug from one of its new 737 Max 9 planes blew out midair in January 2024, sparking a new crisis for the company and slowing production and deliveries of aircraft. Of the monthly total, 42 were 737 Maxes, going to customers including Southwest Airlines, Alaska Airlines and United Airlines.",
      "CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took the top job at Boeing last August, has said the company has made progress in improving production rates and quality on its factory lines.",
      "For the three months ended June 30, Boeing handed over 150 airplanes, its best second quarter since 2018, before two crashes of Max planes five months apart grounded the jets and sparked a multiyear crisis at the top U.S. exporter. That was also the last year Boeing posted an annual profit. Its problems also gave rival Airbus a bigger lead over Boeing.",
      "Boeing this spring had been producing about 38 Max aircraft a month and will need Federal Aviation Administration approval to go above that limit, which the agency set after the door plug accident. Ortberg said at a Bernstein investor conference in late May that he\u2019s confident that the company could increase production to 42 of the jets a month.",
      "The company booked 116 gross orders in June, or 70 net orders when including cancellations and accounting adjustments. Boeing often removes or adds orders to its backlog for a variety of reasons including customers\u2019 financial health.",
      "Boeing\u2019s backlog stood at 5,953 as of June 30.",
      "The manufacturer is set to report second-quarter financial results on July 29, when investors will be focused on Ortberg\u2019s plan to increase production and aircraft deliveries.",

    "story": [
      "An unknown individual or group using artificial intelligence impersonated Secretary of State Marco Rubio to contact at least five high-level government officials in mid-June, according to a State Department cable obtained by NBC News.",
      "The cable was first reported by The Washington Post.",
      "\u201cThe actor likely aimed to manipulate targeted individuals using Al-generated text and voice messages, with the goal of gaining access to information or accounts,\u201d the memo said.",
      "At least three foreign ministers, a U.S. governor and a member of Congress all received outreach from the fake Rubio, the cable said. It sent at least one of the targets a text message urging them to speak on Signal, and sent Signal voice messages to at least two of them.",
      "The sender used the display name marco.rubio@state.gov, which is not a functional email address, as their Signal nickname. Signal allows users to choose their own nickname, and such a nickname would not necessarily mean that the user has access to that email address.",
      "Rubio was among the senior Trump administration officials who were a part of \u201cSignalgate,\u201d an incident in March in which the group discussed sensitive military strikes  in Yemen after inadvertently adding Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg into a group chat on the Signal app .",
      "The cable noted that the campaign to impersonate Rubio echoed another effort to impersonate unnamed senior U.S. officials that was investigated by the FBI in May. The White House confirmed that month that someone had been impersonating President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Susie Wiles, in texts and phone calls to government officials.",
      "A senior state department official confirmed the clandestine campaign and said the agency is investigating the matter.",
      "\u201cThe department takes seriously its responsibility to safeguard its information and continuously takes steps to improve the department\u2019s cybersecurity posture to prevent future incidents,\u201d the official said. \u201cFor security reasons, and due to our ongoing investigation, we are not in a position to offer further details at this time.\"",
      "It was not immediately clear how the individual or group impersonated Rubio, but foreign disinformation operations have begun to routinely use generative AI chat apps like ChatGPT in order to create text in convincing English.",
      "Meanwhile, AI-enabled voice cloning technology has rapidly become extremely sophisticated, and it can be very difficult for many people to distinguish a synthetic voice from a real person\u2019s voice.",
      "While there is no direct cyber threat to the State Department from the campaign, the diplomatic cable warned that \u201cinformation shared with a third party could be exposed if targeted individuals are compromised.\u201d The cable signed by Rubio was sent to all domestic and overseas U.S. diplomatic posts last week, said U.S. diplomats may warn their external partners that cyber threat actors are impersonating State officials and accounts."

      "Previously, users were required to be at least 18 years old to sign up for a Waymo account, but the age range expansion comes as the company seeks to increase ridership amid a broader expansion of its ride-hailing service across U.S. cities. Alphabet has also been under pressure to monetize AI products amid increased competition and economic headwinds.",
      "Waymo said it will offer \u201cspecially-trained Rider Support agents\u201d during rides hailed by teens and loop in parents if needed. Teens can also share their trip status with their parents for real-time updates on their progress, and parents receive all ride receipts.",

      "\u201cIn this context, the jurisdiction and legal responsibility for these persons lie exclusively with the competent foreign authorities,\u201d Salvadoran officials wrote in response to queries from the unit of the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The U.N. group has been looking into the fate of the men who were sent to El Salvador from the United States in mid-March, even after a U.S. judge had ordered the planes that were carrying them to be turned around.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that it is powerless to return the men, noting that they are beyond the reach of U.S. courts and no longer have access to due process rights or other U.S. constitutional guarantees.",

CNBC\u2019s official sports empire valuations determined that the world\u2019s 20 most valuable sports ownership groups are worth a combined $225 billion.",
      "According to sports bankers and executives interviewed by CNBC, empires function much like software companies that manage highly valuable intellectual property. That centralized structure enhances value and profitability.

It owns the NHL\u2019s Washington Capitals, the NBA\u2019s Washington Wizards, the WNBA\u2019s Washington Mystics and the Monumental Sports Network. MSE is valued at $7.8 billion, according to CNBC\u2019s valuations.",

Galaxy \u2014 AEG\u2019s sports portfolio centers on major entertainment venues. These include Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, The O2 in London and Barclays Arena in Hamburg, Germany. It also operates the AccorHotels Arena in Paris and holds a minority stake in T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. AEG also owns the ticketing firm AXS, which services many events hosted at its venues.",
      "City Football Group, ranked 20th, is owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan and is focused on a single sport: soccer. Its primary asset is the English team Manchester City, but CFG also holds a majority stake in MLS\u2019 New York City FC and investments in soccer clubs across Brazil, Australia, Japan, China and India. CFG is valued at $7.7 billion, according to CNBC\u2019s valuations.",

Lakers in 2021 and owns several other sports properties, including MLB\u2019s Los Angeles Dodgers \u2014 agreed to buy a controlling interest in the Lakers for $10 billion.

      "President Donald Trump expressed mounting frustration Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, promising during a lively Cabinet meeting to boost U.S. military aid to Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWe get a lot of bull--- thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth,\u201d Trump told reporters, who attended a nearly two-hour stretch of the meeting. \u201cHe\u2019s very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.\u201d",
      "The comments echoed his remarks from Monday, when he described himself as \u201cnot happy\u201d and \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Putin\u2019s actions. The last known conversation between the two leaders was last Thursday, July 3.",
      "When asked about a reported pause of some weapons shipments to Ukraine, Trump seemed to dismiss the idea, saying he wanted to equip \u201cbrave\u201d Ukrainians with defensive arms. Putin \u201cis not treating human beings right,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s killing too many people, so we\u2019re sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine, and I\u2019ve approved that.\u201d",
      "At last month\u2019s NATO summit at The Hague, Trump suggested the U.S. was exploring options to send Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine. \u201cThey do want to have the anti-missile missiles,\u201d Trump said of Kyiv at the time. \u201cAs they call them, the Patriots, and we\u2019re going to see if we can make some available.\u201d",
      "However, a subsequent shipment that included dozens of Patriot interceptors capable of defending against incoming Russian missiles was paused over concerns about low U.S. stockpiles, according to two defense officials, two congressional officials and two sources with knowledge of the decision. When pressed on who ordered the pause, Trump responded sharply: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Why don\u2019t you tell me?\u201d",
      "Trump also said on Tuesday that he was closely eyeing a sanctions bill targeting Russia, saying that he might support it.",
      "U.S. officials had been attempting to broker a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, but negotiations have stalled in recent weeks. Trump had promised to resolve the conflict on the first day of his second term, though he has since claimed he was joking or exaggerating.",
      "The Cabinet meeting, Trump\u2019s sixth since taking office in January, covered a broad range of topics, including the recent Texas floods, tariff negotiations, U.S. strikes on Iran, Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop and the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Trump also launched into an extended screed about wind farms and a lengthy discussion about the artwork in the room.",
      "Trump also discussed a meeting at the White House on Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he defended amid his ongoing criminal trial. The two plan to meet again to focus on the Gaza conflict.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s coming over later and we\u2019re going to be talking about, I would say, almost exclusively, Gaza,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy. And he wants to get it solved, and I want to get it solved, and I think the other side wants to get it solved.\u201d",
      "The meeting highlighted the absence of Elon Musk, once a key adviser who drove an initiative to streamline government efficiency. Musk, who spent a quarter-billion dollars to help elect Trump in 2024, according to campaign finance reports, has since parted ways with the administration and threatened to launch a third political party, a move that could challenge Republican prospects.",
      "Trump appeared unfazed, responding, \u201cI think it\u2019ll help us.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll probably\u2014 third parties have always been good for me, I don\u2019t know about Republicans, but for me,\u201d the president added."

      "Trump also said he would soon announce tariffs \u201cat a very, very high rate, like 200%,\u201d on pharmaceutical imports.",

    "story": [
      "A group of immigrants with temporary legal status in the U.S. is suing the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security terminated the legal protections for some 60,000 people from Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal.",
      "Seven plaintiffs from the affected countries, along with the National TPS Alliance, an advocacy group, have filed the lawsuit against DHS and the agency\u2019s secretary, Kristi Noem, alleging that the terminations were, at least in part, motivated by racial animus and violated the Constitution.",
      "Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal  have experienced natural disasters that have made it unsafe for their nationals to return home, leading to Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations. On Monday, the Trump administration terminated the designation for those from Nicaragua, with a DHS spokesperson saying in a news release that the status \u201cnever meant to last a quarter of a century.\u201d It also terminated TPS for Honduras, with Noem similarly saying that TPS was designed to be \u201cjust that \u2014 temporary.\u201d Just over a month ago, DHS terminated the designation for Nepal.",
      "The terminations, the lawsuit said, will impose \u201cextraordinary and irreparable harm\u201d on TPS holders if the decisions aren\u2019t reversed.",
      "\u201c\u200b\u200bI work in a hospital, caring for cardiac patients. I\u2019ve been doing it the \u2018right way\u2019 the whole time,\u201d Jhony Silva, a Honduran TPS holder and a plaintiff in the case, said in a  release from the ACLU of Southern California, one of the legal groups representing the plaintiffs. \u201cNow, I am facing losing my job, the ability to care for my family, and the only home I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the lawsuit \u201cignores the President\u2019s constitutionally vested powers.\u201d",
      "\u201cTPS was never intended to be a de facto asylum program, yet that\u2019s how previous administrations have used it for decades,\u201d McLaughlin said in a statement. \u201cThe Trump administration is restoring integrity to our immigration system to keep our homeland and its people safe. We have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Noem, Trump and other officials made \u201cnumerous\u201d statements against non-white, non-European TPS holders based on their perceived race, ethnicity and national origin. In many cases, the suit said, officials disparaged TPS holders as \u201ccriminals.\u201d",
      "Under Noem\u2019s tenure, DHS has criticized the program for being responsible for, the suit says, allowing \u201chalf a million poorly vetted migrants into this country \u2014 from MS-13 gang members to known terrorists and murderers\u201d \u2014 referring to a DHS social media post from May after the Supreme Court allowed Trump to revoke TPS from nationals of four countries. However, the suit points out, TPS is available only to those who are already in the U.S. And anyone with more than one misdemeanor conviction does not qualify for the status.",
      "The suit also claims that the Trump administration\u2019s decision was based on predetermined political decisions and that DHS failed to give TPS holders a sufficient transition period. According to DHS announcements, TPS holders are being given 60 days before they will be stripped of their legal status and work authorizations. This means those from Nepal will have their status until Aug. 5. The lawsuit alleges that DHS violated the Administrative Procedure Act by abandoning the longstanding practice of providing a transition period of at least six months when terminating TPS designations in place for more than three years, as they were in the cases of all three countries.",
      "\u201cThis administration is forcing TPS holders \u2014 and their U.S. citizen children \u2014 to make an impossible choice,\u201d said Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the UCLA Center for Immigration Law & Policy (CILP), another group representing the plaintiffs. \u201cThey cannot safely go back to their country of nationality, leaving their families and communities, and yet they will be stripped of the right to live and work in the U.S.\u201d",
      "While DHS has determined that the countries are environmentally safe to return to, critics say that the terminations could upend lives and put TPS holders in danger. The State Department has designated Nicaragua as a country Americans should reconsider traveling to, citing crime, the arbitrary enforcement of laws, the risk of wrongful detention and the limited availability of health care. Honduras has received the same designation, and the State Department recommends increased caution when traveling in Nepal because of the potential for political violence.",
      "The lawsuit follows several others that have tried to block the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to end TPS. The National TPS Alliance, in addition to seven Venezuelan nationals, sued the administration in February after the government rescinded protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans living in the U.S."

    "published": "Tue, 08 Jul 2025 18:18:57 GMT",
    "summary": "Many Mexicans say they've been priced out of their neighborhoods; and critics blame government policies, including ones to attract digital nomads.",
    "story": [
      "MEXICO CITY \u2014 A fierce protest in Mexico City railing against gentrification and mass tourism was fueled by government failures and active promotion to attract digital nomads, according to experts, who said tension had been mounting for years.",
      "The criticism comes after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum alleged that Friday's protest was marked by xenophobia, reviving a debate over an influx of Americans in the city.",
      "Many Mexicans say they've been priced out of their neighborhoods \u2014 in part because of a move made by Sheinbaum in 2022, when she was the Mexico City mayor and signed an agreement with Airbnb and UNESCO to boost tourism and attract digital nomads despite concern over the impact short-term rentals could have.",
      "'Gringo: Stop stealing our home'",
      "On Friday, that came to a head. A largely peaceful protest of hundreds of demonstrators marched through tourism centers of the city with signs reading \"Gringo: Stop stealing our home\" and \"Housing regulations now!\"",
      "Near the end of the march, a group of protesters turned violent, breaking the windows of storefronts and looting a number of businesses. In one case, a protester slammed a butter knife against the window of a restaurant where people were hiding, and another person painted \"kill a gringo\" on a nearby wall.",
      "\"The xenophobic displays seen at that protest have to be condemned. No one should be able to say 'any nationality get out of our country' even over a legitimate problem like gentrification,\" Sheinbaum said Monday. \"We've always been open, fraternal.\"",
      "The frustrations were built upon years of mass tourism and rising rent prices in large swathes of the city. The influx of foreigners began around 2020, when Americans flooded into the Mexico City to work remotely, dodge coronavirus restrictions and take advantage of cheaper living costs.",
      "In the years since, choice neighborhoods like Roma and Condesa, lush central areas dotted with cafes and markets, have grown increasingly populated by foreign tourists and the remote workers known as digital nomads, and there are more temporary housing units rented through companies like Airbnb that cater to tourists.",
      "As they have, rent and living prices have soared and English has been increasingly common on the streets of those areas. Some groups have described the phenomenon as a sort of \"neo-colonialism.\"",
      "Mounting tensions",
      "The Mexico City Anti-Gentrification Front, one of the organizations behind the protest, it was \"completely against\" any acts of physical violence and denied that the protests were xenophobic. Instead, the organization said the protest was a result of years of failures by the local government to address the root of the problems.",
      "\"Gentrification isn't just foreigners' fault, it's the fault of the government and these companies that prioritize the money foreigners bring,\" the organization said in a statement. Meanwhile \"young people and the working class can't afford to live here.\"",
      "In its list of demands, the organization called for greater rent controls, mandates that locals have a voice in larger development projects in their area, stricter laws making it harder for landlords to throw out residents and prioritizing Mexican renters over foreigners.",
      "Mexico's protest comes on the back of a wave of similar protests across Europe railing against mass tourism. Tensions in Mexico have also been compounded by wider inequalities and the Trump administration targeting Latino communities in the U.S. as it ramps up deportations.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security took a jab at protesters Sunday, writing in a post on the social media platform X: \"If you are in the United States illegally and wish to join the next protest in Mexico City, use the CBP Home app to facilitate your departure.\"",
      "Government failures",
      "Protesters' cries against government failures were echoed by experts, who said that surging gentrification is a product of both shortage of affordable housing in the city and longtime government failures to regulate the housing market.",
      "Antonio Azuela, lawyer and sociologist and others said that they do see the protest as a xenophobic backlash, and around 2020 the core of the problem was the influx of \"digital nomads\" in the city, but it grew out of hand because of lax housing laws.",
      "\"What has made this explode is lack of regulation in the market,\" Azuela said.",
      "Mexico City's government over the course of decades has made a few efforts to control development and create affordable housing.",
      "Legislators estimated there are about 2.7 million houses and apartments in the city, but it needs about 800,000 more. But such affordable housing developments that have popped up often are pushed off to the fringes of the city, said Luis Salinas, a researcher at National Autonomous University of Mexico who has studied gentrification in Mexico City for years.",
      "Taking advantage of 'insufficient' laws",
      "Controls, meanwhile, have been marked by lack of enforcement, which developers travel services companies like Airbnb take advantage of, he said.",
      "Today, more than 26,000 properties in Mexico City are currently listed on Airbnb, according to the Inside Airbnb, an advocacy organization that tracks the company's impact on residential communities through data. That's compared to 36,000 properties in New York City and 19,000 in Barcelona, where protests have also broken out.",
      "\"The government has treated housing like it's merchandise,\" Salinas said. The actions the government is taking \"are completely insufficient. The federal government needs to be intervening far more nowadays.\"",
      "Airbnb said it helped contribute more than a billion dollars in \"economic impact\" to Mexico City last year and that spending by guests has supported 46,000 jobs in the city. \"What's needed is regulation based not on prohibitions, but on respect for rights and transparency of obligations,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Last year, Mexico City's government approved the most ambitious rent control law since the 1940s in an effort to control prices and also set caps on short-term rentals to 180 nights a year, but Salinas said that enforcement of short-term rental legislation has been put on pause until after the 2026 FIFA World Cup.",
      "And even then, the country's government will have to take far greater actions to get the situation under control, said Azuela.",
      "\"This isn't going to end by just reigning in Airbnb,\" he said. \"They're going to have to do a whole lot more.\""

      "\"Already, in states across the country, providers and health center staff have been forced to turn away patients who use Medicaid to get basic sexual and reproductive health care because President Trump and his backers in Congress passed a law to block them from going to Planned Parenthood,\" the statement said. \"There are no other providers who can fill the gap if the \u2018defunding\u2019 of Planned Parenthood is allowed to stand. The fight is just beginning, and we look forward to our day in court.\"",
      "The provision bans state Medicaid funding to health care groups \"primarily engaged\" in family planning services, reproductive health and related medical care, including abortions, for one year.",
      "Federal law prohibits health care providers from using federal Medicaid funds for abortions, unless the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother or is a result of rape or incest.",
      "While the provision of the \u201cbig beautiful bill\" doesn't directly name Planned Parenthood, the group alleged in its lawsuit  Monday that the legislation is \"a naked attempt to leverage the government\u2019s spending power to attack and penalize Planned Parenthood and impermissibly single it out for unfavorable treatment.\"",
      "The group claimed that the law violates its equal protection rights and retaliates against its protected speech.",
      "In its lawsuit, Planned Parenthood said the law would have \"catastrophic\" consequences on the organization and its local affiliates around the country, which also provide nonabortion services, like contraception, and screenings for cancer and sexually transmitted infections.",
      "\"Many Planned Parenthood Members will be required to lay off staff and curtail services, with serious adverse consequences for the many patients served at those centers even if they do not use Medicaid to access services,\" the lawsuit read. \"Worse still, Members may be forced to shutter a substantial number of their health centers nationwide, many of which are in rural or underserved areas without alternative providers.\"",
      "As a result of the one-year funding ban, Planned Parenthood said 200 of its health centers are at risk of closure, and over 1 million patients could lose access to care. More than 90% of the clinics at risk are in states where abortion is still legal, the group said.",
      "The Department of Justice declined to comment on the ruling and has yet to file any court documents in the case.",
      "Katie Daniel, the legal affairs director and policy counsel for SBA Pro-Life America, an anti-abortion advocacy group, lambasted Planned Parenthood's lawsuit.",
      "\u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s desperation is showing as they run to the courts again to fix a crisis of their own making. Life is winning and the nation\u2019s abortion giant won\u2019t be missed as their long decline continues,\u201d Daniel said."

Models \u201ccan basically show there will be areas of intense rainfall, but they very rarely put it in the exact right spot.\u201d",
      "Efforts to close that rift are at risk. Climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme rainfalls, making improvements to models all the more urgent. NOAA is working to improve forecasting tools to better predict rainfall intensity and precise location, but the Trump administration\u2019s most recent budget request for the agency, which proposes to cut the budget by more than $2 billion, would shut down much of the agency\u2019s severe storm research.",

    "story": [
      "The Internal Revenue Service agreed in a court filing that churches can endorse political candidates without fear of losing their tax-exempt status.",
      "The IRS made the statement in a court case challenging the Johnson Amendment, a 1954 U.S. tax code provision that prohibits all 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations \u2014 including churches \u2014 from formally endorsing or opposing political candidates.",
      "In a filing Monday aimed at resolving a lawsuit between the National Religious Broadcasters and others against the IRS, the parties jointly agreed that churches can endorse candidates without fear of losing their tax-exempt status. The agreement likens such endorsements to a \"family discussion concerning candidates.\"",
      "\u201cWhen a house of worship in good faith speaks to its congregation, through its customary channels of communication on matters of faith in connection with religious services, concerning electoral politics viewed through the lens of religious faith, it neither 'participate[s]' nor 'intervene[s]' in a 'political campaign,' within the ordinary meaning of those words,\u201d the parties wrote in the filing in federal court for the Eastern District of Texas, which was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "\u201cThus, communications from a house of worship to its congregation in connection with religious services through its usual channels of communication on matters of faith do not run afoul of the Johnson Amendment as properly interpreted.\u201d",
      "The joint motion for a \u201cconsent judgement\u201d in the case must be approved by a judge before the lawsuit is formally resolved.",
      "A spokesperson for the IRS and a lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The amendment was named after Lyndon B. Johnson, who sponsored it in the Senate. Johnson had pushed for the rule in response to conservative nonprofits that supported a political rival.",
      "The amendment has rarely been enforced when it comes to churches. The Washington Post reported in 2017 that more than 2,000 pastors had publicly defied the Johnson Amendment in organized demonstrations. Only one of the pastors was investigated, and none were punished, the paper reported.",
      "President Donald Trump has been a vocal opponent of the amendment. He vowed to \"get rid of and totally destroy\" it at the National Prayer Breakfast in 2017, adding that doing so would \"allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.\"",
      "While the IRS action doesn't go that far \u2014 getting rid of the amendment would require an act of Congress \u2014 it does target the specific provision Trump complained about.",
      "Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a professor at Notre Dame Law School, said that if approved, the joint motion would technically apply only to the churches that filed suit, but the language in it \"is basically giving the green light for churches to endorse candidates from the pulpit and not have to worry about IRS enforcement while President Donald Trump is in office.\"",
      "He predicted the move will have two major ramifications.",
      "\"The first is that churches that maybe were hesitant to endorse candidates have less of a reason to be hesitant\" and are \"going to feel freer to support candidates from the pulpit,\" Mayer said.",
      "\"The second ramification is even church leaders who don\u2019t want to get involved will feel pressure to do so, from political candidates and members of their congregation,\" potentially putting pastors \"in an awkward position.\"",
      "That pressure could include financial incentives from congregants who could try to sway churches with donations, Mayer said.",
      "The religious groups' suit argued a change was necessary because churches were unfairly targeted by the amendment, and they sought to have the entire amendment declared unconstitutional.",
      "\"The IRS operates in a manner whereby the Plaintiffs are in jeopardy of punishment if they forthrightly say that a candidate\u2019s positions are unbiblical; or that another candidate\u2019s positions are consonant with biblical teaching,\" their suit says. \"The Plaintiffs\u2019 speech is clearly chilled in this regard because they are not free to proclaim their views on the issues of the day and then compare their views with the views of the candidates on these same issues.\"",
      "As part of the joint motion, the religious groups agreed to drop their constitutionality claims against the amendment as a whole, so it would still apply to other 501(c)(3) tax exempt organizations, including charities and universities."

      "While those limits may sound like large amounts, medical school students graduate with an average of more than $264,000 in educational debt and the cost of medical school programs can exceed $300,000 at private universities, according to the Education Data Initiative. \u200b\u200bWithout the ability to take out more federal loans, prospective students say they will have to turn to  private loans, which can have stricter borrowing or repayment options, or potentially put off their medical school plans.",

      "The Grad PLUS loans were initially intended to help more people attend graduate and professional programs. But opponents of the loan program have argued that it has allowed colleges and universities to increase tuition unchecked because students have been able to borrow essentially unlimited amounts of money, leaving borrowers with financially crippling levels of debt.",
      "Medical schools have warned the loan cap could discourage students from going into medicine at a time when the country is already on track to have a shortage of as many as 86,000 physicians by 2036, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. The group said that medical school tuition increases have slowed since the introduction of the loan program.",
      "\u201cThis will intensify challenges for medical students to finance their education due to some of the complexities of private loans, and we believe it will result in an additional financial barrier to attending medical school,\u201d said Kristen Earle, AAMC program leader for student financial aid services. \u201cThis added barrier could deter qualified candidates from pursuing a medical degree altogether, ultimately worsening the existing and expected physician shortage.\u201d",
      "The student loan cap comes as universities are already struggling with wider funding cuts. Trump has sought to cut off various forms of federal funding for institutions that have policies with which he disagrees, and the Department of Government Efficiency has cut or frozen medical and scientific funding schools rely on.",
      "For Lewczak, the loan cap will likely force her to find financial assistance beyond the government. At her top-choice medical school, the average student leaves with $400,000 in debt \u2014 double the loan limit that will be imposed by the bill. With the new loan cap, she\u2019s considering taking out private loans, something she thinks should be an option since she has built up good credit.",
      "\u201cThere seems to be this misconception that federal student loans are just like free handouts, and that is very much false,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are signing an agreement, you are paying it back with the interest rate.\u201d",
      "While private loans will still be an option for some students, those loans aren\u2019t eligible for public service loan forgiveness programs, like those for doctors who work in underserved communities. Private loans can also come with less flexible repayment options or require the borrower to have a co-signer, Earle said.",
      "As a first-generation college student, Lewczak created a TikTok account to help students figure out how to fund graduate school in higher education. She predicts the new law will create a gap in students who want to pursue medicine and students who can actually access that education.",
      "Other current and prospective medical school students have also taken to social media to share their concerns over the loan limit.",
      "Shae-Marie Stafford-Trujillo, 23, who is completing a one-year post-bachelor certificate program at Baylor School of Medicine in Houston, said the bill is already dashing her hopes of studying at some of her top-choice medical schools, like Stanford University, where one year of attendance costs more than $150,000.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine how almost surreal it feels to not even be able to go to an institution and study that,\u201d said Stafford-Trujillo, who hopes to specialize in research around narcolepsy, a condition she has personally struggled with. \u201cIt\u2019s not even across the world, it\u2019s potentially only a couple of 100 miles away, but now I don\u2019t even have the opportunity to go and study at some of these institutions.\u201d",
      "Unless she gets into an MD-Ph.D. program, which could be fully paid for, Stafford-Trujillo likely will only be able to afford an in-state medical school in Texas.",
      "\u201cYou could imagine and empathize with now students are no longer able to apply broadly or to apply to programs, potentially their dream school,\u201d she said.",
      "Lauren Garkow, 25, is halfway through a four-year medical school based in the Caribbean and is interested in pursuing a career in pathology when she graduates. She said her classmates have already struggled to afford even the basic necessities \u2014 a struggle she expects to get even worse if loans are limited.",
      "\u201cI really fear for all the medical students who have to deal with that new bill,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHealth care as a whole will be affected,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is going to have a ripple effect on all of us.\u201d"

      "\"This was kind of a surprise. And yes, I would say we were hoping for a girl, just because we have two beautiful boys. I grew up with brothers and sisters, so I hoped for that for them, but I also think we would've been so excited for a boy,\" Lauren Lane says.",

      "\"I don't really know what to expect, because in the Lane family, where I come from, we never really had a ton of girls around. It was always just a bunch of guys. So I feel like I've got a lot to learn, but obviously Lauren will just naturally know what to do,\" the \"If I Die Before You\" singer says.",
      "Lauren Lane adds, \"You're always learning as a parent. It's a very humbling experience to be a parent.\"",
      "Now that their family is getting larger, the couple have put more thought into the future, including how many kids they want in total.",
      "\"I would like more kids. I would take more children, because children are the biggest blessing, but I don't want to be pregnant again,\" Lauren Lane laughs. \"I'm very thankful for healthy pregnancies, and I think this is it for me.\""

      "Narrator Iain Stirling made the announcement about 15 minutes into the episode.",
      "\"Welcome back to 'Love Island USA,'\" Stirling said after the first commercial break. \"Cierra has left the villa due to a personal situation, leaving Nic officially single.\"",
      "Ortega's removal came after viewers surfaced old social media posts of hers that contained racial slurs. The 25-year-old influencer lost over 100,000 Instagram followers overnight once posts surfaced online.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Peacock for comment. Peacock is owned by NBCUniversal, TODAY\u2019s parent company.",
      "Ortega has not publicly addressed her departure, but her parents issued a statement on her Instagram story addressing the matter.",
      "\"As Cierra's parents, this has been one of the most painful weeks of our lives,\" the post began.",
      "\"We're not here to justify or ignore what's surfaced. We understand people are upset, and we know accountability matters. But what's happening online right now has gone far beyond that.\"",
      "The statement continued with her parents asking for \"compassion,\" \"patience,\" and \"basic human decency,\" concluding with gratitude for those who continued to show love and support.",
      "\"While she'll always be our little girl, she's also a woman, one who will take responsibility in her own time and her own voice,\" the post read.",
      "The post was signed, \"With love, her family.\"",

      "While many are celebrating the Islander's removal from the series, others are expressing concern about the online backlash's intensity and its potential impact on her mental health.",
      "\"Hoping she takes accountability and heals,\" one user commented.",
      "\"Am I the only one concerned about her mental health,\" another user wrote. \"What she said was inexcusable and wrong and she had to leave but people are overdoing it now. Hope whoever is close to her keeps a close watch on her.\"",
      "Ortega is the second Islander to be removed from Season 7 due to similar circumstances. Yulissa Escobar was removed from the villa in Episode 2, also due to resurfaced clips of her using racist language.",
      "Ortega joined \"Love Island USA\" Season 7 as a bombshell during Episode 1, alongside Charlie Georgiou.",
      "Her arrival featured a blindfolded kissing challenge, and she immediately set her sights on Nic Vansteenberghe, who was originally coupled up with Belle-A Walker.",
      "Vansteenberghe chose to re-couple with Ortega at the next re-coupling ceremony, sending Walker home. The pair remained together throughout the season and had recently made their relationship exclusive during a one-on-one date, just days before her removal of the villa.",
      "Walker took to her Instagram story to weigh in on the situation, saying she was glad the show's producers took action. Walker never identifies Ortega by name.",
      "\"As a proud Asian American woman, I'm deeply appreciative of the Love Island USA producers for taking a stand and making it clear that racism of any kind is not tolerated,\" she said.",
      "Walker used the moment to highlight anti-Asian hate, writing, \"Asian hate is oftentimes overlooked and dismissed. But being a first-generation American, I have personally witnessed and experienced how real and hurtful comments like these are,\" she said.",
      "The post concluded with Walker asking her followers to \"think twice before leaving unkind comments\" on anyone's accounts, maintaining that she doesn't \"condone bigotry or racism of any kind.\"",
      "Following Ortega's departure, the boys tried to comfort Vansteenberghe.",
      "\"Right before Cierra had left, my mind was clear,\" Vansteenberghe said in his confessional. \"I knew what the future would look like, and now I'm lost.\"",
      "As the villa prepares for the finale without two of its original contestants, the remaining Islanders face their final week navigating both romance and the reality of how quickly circumstances can change."

      "In a race between Joey Chestnut and Usain Bolt, who could eat a hot dog then run a 100-meter dash faster?",
      "Professional athletes and hot dog-eating contest fans alike are divided as the new hypothetical scenario goes viral on social media.",
      "In a TikTok video posted by the official account for the PGA Tour, professional golfers were asked whether the nationally recognized competitive eater would beat the eight-time Olympic gold medalist sprinter in the proposed race.",
      "Without hesitation, Max Homa responded to the hypothetical, \u201cOh, Joey Chestnut, I think.\u201d",
      "Later in the clip, he explained that he believes Chestnut could likely run 100 meters in less than 20 seconds, adding, \u201cI\u2019m hard pressed that I could eat a hot dog in 20 seconds. Yeah, I\u2019m going Joey Chestnut.\u201d",
      "At first, Jordan Spieth locked in Bolt before asking how quickly Chestnut can eat a hot dog. (In this year's Fourth of July hot dog eating contest, Chestnut was once again crowned winner, consuming 70.5 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes.)",
      "After questioning some of the logistics of the race \u2014 like whether the hot dog would be consumed at the starting line, which could lead to a head start for Chestnut, Spieth decided on the sprinter.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going with who can run faster because I think a hot dog can get wolfed down pretty quick,\u201d he said, before posing an alternative. \u201cNow, if you said, \u201810 hot dogs and then run,\u2019 when does it even out?\u201d",
      "\u201cJoey Chestnut would smoke him at 10 (hot dogs before running),\u201d Spieth added. \u201cI think even two might be close.\u201d",
      "Saheeth Theegala reasoned that \u201ceven if Joey runs a 15-second 100-meter,\u201d the golfer still felt Chestnut would win.",
      "\u201cI think Usain, even if he eats (the hot dog) as fast as he could and swallows it, I don\u2019t see him eating it in under 8, 10 seconds,\u201d he said, adding his final consensus is that Bolt finishing an entire hot dog will take longer than Chestnut\u2019s ability to run 100 meters.",
      "Amid much internal debate and in-depth analysis, the pro golfers landed fairly divided over who would win the competition \u2014 ever so slightly favoring Chestnut. And the comment section under the TikTok video equally entertained the proposition.",
      "\u201cJoey is taking this without a doubt,\u201d one user wrote.",
      "\u201cDo you people have any idea the amount of calories that Usain Bolt has to eat to maintain his performance level? He could put down a single hot (dog) pretty ... quick I imagine,\u201d another argued.",
      "While some found it wild to compare the Olympic medalist widely regarded as \u201cthe fastest man in history\u201d to the 17-time champion of Nathan\u2019s July Fourth competitive eating contest, some still theorized Chestnut would take home the gold this time around.",
      "Other comments simply marveled at the \u201cphenomenal question\u201d itself, with one user writing, \u201cthat\u2019s the greatest hypothetical ever.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhoever came up with this question deserves a raise,\u201d another wrote.",
      "One commented, \u201cYou dont understand how much money I would pay to see the answer to this.\u201d"

      "The comments echoed his remarks from Monday, when he described himself as \u201cnot happy\u201d and \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Putin\u2019s actions. The last known conversation between the two leaders was last Thursday, July 3.",
      "When asked about a reported pause of some weapons shipments to Ukraine, Trump seemed to dismiss the idea, saying he wanted to equip \u201cbrave\u201d Ukrainians with defensive arms. Putin \u201cis not treating human beings right,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s killing too many people, so we\u2019re sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine, and I\u2019ve approved that.\u201d",

      "The Cabinet meeting, Trump\u2019s sixth since taking office in January, covered a broad range of topics, including the recent Texas floods, tariff negotiations, U.S. strikes on Iran, Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop and the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Trump also launched into an extended screed about wind farms and a lengthy discussion about the artwork in the room.",
      "Trump also discussed a meeting at the White House on Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he defended amid his ongoing criminal trial. The two plan to meet again to focus on the Gaza conflict.",

      "The meeting highlighted the absence of Elon Musk, once a key adviser who drove an initiative to streamline government efficiency. Musk, who spent a quarter-billion dollars to help elect Trump in 2024, according to campaign finance reports, has since parted ways with the administration and threatened to launch a third political party, a move that could challenge Republican prospects.",

      "The report unveiled Tuesday, titled \"A Quest for Justice,\" was published by the Dinah Project, a legal research initiative led by Ruth Halperin-Kaddari, women's rights activist and law professor at of Tel Aviv\u2019s Bar-Ilan University; Sharon Zagagi-Pinhas, a lawyer and the former chief military prosecutor at the Israel Defense Forces; and Nava Ben-Or, a former judge and deputy attorney general.",
      "Partly funded by the British government and Jewish nonprofit organizations, the report contains previously unheard accounts from 15 returned hostages from Gaza, along with testimony from a rape survivor from the Nova music festival, one of at least six different locations where Hamas carried out its attacks.",
      "It also includes eyewitness testimony from at least 17 different incidents of sexual assault, as well as accounts from first responders, forensic evidence, and audio and visual documentation.",
      "The issue of sexual assault and rape during the Oct. 7 attacks is highly emotive and charged, with some in Israel accusing United Nations observers of betraying survivors by downplaying the issue. Meanwhile, some international observers, including a United Nations official appointed to investigate, say that while there is evidence of cases of rape and sexual assault, this evidence does not point to those incidents having been systematic or directed by militant leaders.",
      "Hamas has denied that its militants committed sexual crimes on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The report states that clear patterns emerged of sexual violence being perpetrated, including victims who were found \u201cpartially or fully naked with their hands tied, often to structures like trees or poles; evidence of gang rapes followed by execution; genital mutilation; and public humiliation.\u201d The details add to and corroborate past reporting on sexual violence that took place during the attacks.",
      "The sexual violence \"continued in captivity, with many returnees reporting forced nudity, physical and verbal sexual harassment, sexual assaults and threats of forced marriage,\u201d the report adds.",
      "The victims also include two returned male hostages who were released in January and February after being held captive for about 500 days, where they were subjected to \"sexual humiliation, which included forced nudity and physical abuse when naked,\" according to the report.",
      "In light of the testimonies, the report aims to have the sexual violence acknowledged as crimes against humanity and to hold the perpetrators accountable.",
      "Notably, it calls on the U.N. to send a fact-finding mission and blacklist Hamas as a group. \u201cWe hence call upon the U.N. Secretary-General to blacklist Hamas as an organization responsible for the tactical use of sexual violence as a weapon of war,\u201d it states.",
      "Reem Alsalem, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on violence against women and girls, said in a statement that she and fellow rapporteurs and experts emphasized that reports of such violence needed to be independently verified and investigated and perpetrators be held accountable.",
      "She added that the U.N. special commission appointed to investigate \"found patterns indicative of sexual violence against Israeli women at different locations. The Commission was also unable to independently verify specific allegations of sexual and gender-based violence due to Israel\u2019s obstruction of its investigations.\"",
      "\"It is my understanding that neither the Commission nor any other independent human rights mechanism established that sexual or gender-based violence was committed against Israelis on or since the 7th of October as a systematic tool of war or as a tool of genocide,\" Alsalem wrote in the statement.",
      "The Dinah Project report's findings follow previously published reports by the U.N. and the International Criminal Court on sexual violence and gang rape during the attack.",
      "In March 2024, a report compiled by Pramila Patten, the U.N. Special Representative on sexual violence in conflict, stated that it had found \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe some victims of the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7 were raped and sexually assaulted.",
      "There was \u201cclear and convincing\u201d information that some of those taken captive were subjected to sexual violence, the U.N. team of experts said in their report, including rape and sexualized torture \u2014 violence it said \u201cmay be ongoing.\u201d",
      "In December 2023, NBC News published a separate report which reviewed evidence suggesting that dozens of Israeli women were raped, sexually abused or mutilated during the Oct. 7 attack, where more than 1,200 people were killed in Israel.",
      "Since then, Israel\u2019s ongoing military offensive in Gaza has killed more than 56,000 people and seriously injured thousands more, according to health officials in the enclave.",
      "The Dinah Project's report also comes after a U.N.-backed body, the Human Rights Council, released an extensive report in March this year that accused Israel of \u201cthe systematic use of sexual, reproductive and other gender-based violence\u201d in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The report by the Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory found that the widespread destruction of Gaza, the use of heavy explosives in civilian areas, and Israeli attacks on hospitals and health facilities had led to \u201cdisproportionate violence against women and children.\u201d",
      "While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not address the latest report's findings, he called the organization an \u201canti-Israel circus.\u201d"

      "The two leaders complimented each other on their alliance in the conflict, with Netanyahu presenting Trump with a letter he said he sent to the Nobel Prize committee, in which he nominated Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize, a longtime ambition for the president. Israel would be the second country to nominate Trump for the award.",
      "Trump told reporters that Iran wants to talk with the U.S. and that Washington and Tehran have scheduled talks. He declined to reveal the timeline for those talks, telling reporters, \u201cI\u2019d rather not say, but you\u2019ll be, you\u2019ll be reading about it tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Asked whether regime change should take place in Tehran, Netanyahu said that is \u201cup to the people of Iran.\u201d",
      "While a ceasefire between Israel and Iran continues to hold after last month's 12-day conflict, a similar agreement in Gaza is proving harder to achieve, despite the optimistic tone struck by Trump and Netanyahu in recent days.",
      "Trump said Monday night that there was no \"hold-up\" in reaching a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. \"I think things are going along very well,\" he said.",
      "Asked about possibility of a two-state solution, Trump yielded the question to Netanyahu, who said Palestinians should have the powers to govern themselves but \"none of the powers to threaten us.\"",
      "\"That means that certain powers, like overall security will always remain in our hands. Now, that is a fact, and no one in Israel will agree to anything else, because we don\u2019t commit suicide,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Shortly before the White House meeting, Netanyahu met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and separately with Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff. Rubio and Witkoff joined Monday's dinner, along White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee.",
      "Israel and Hamas appear deadlocked on whether a proposed agreement will lead to a permanent end to the fighting, which, barring a six-day pause in November 2023 and a 42-day ceasefire earlier this year, has raged for 21 months."

Shipping through the Red Sea, while still lower than normal, has increased in recent weeks.",
      "The Houthis paused attacks until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. That ended weeks later and the Houthis haven't attacked a vessel, though they have continued occasional missile attacks targeting Israel."

      "It\u2019s unusual for a living Dalai Lama to talk about his successor, the search for whom begins only upon his death because it involves reincarnation. But as the 14th Dalai Lama grows older, there is growing worry that the Chinese government could take advantage of a gap in leadership.",

Yet all the sparkle and sound on the most American day of the year relies almost solely on China, which is mired in a trade war with the United States that could disrupt fireworks displays across the country from big cities to backyard barbecues.",
      "The U.S. imported more than 120,000 tons of fireworks in 2023, with over 97% of them \u2014 including those displayed at Independence Day celebrations \u2014 coming from China, according to the World Bank. American fireworks wholesalers and distributors are warning that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports could limit supply and send prices soaring unless the duties are brought down.",

      "U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, which had reached as high as 145%, are currently at 30% after the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day trade truce that ends in mid-August. The tariff rate for fireworks was previously 5%.",
      "The uncertainty is felt strongly here in Liuyang, a production hub in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that on its own makes nearly 60% of the world\u2019s fireworks. The city of about 1.5 million people is proudly known as the birthplace of fireworks, with a history in the business dating to China\u2019s Tang Dynasty more than 1,000 years ago.",
      "Wendy Tang, owner of Pyroshine Fireworks in Liuyang, said factories went through a \u201creally hard time\u201d when U.S.-China trade tensions escalated in March and April, a peak shipping season for July Fourth fireworks. At times, the U.S. and China were increasing their tariff rates multiple times a day.",
      "\u201cIn the morning, it\u2019s 100%. But in the afternoon, it\u2019s like 200%,\u201d Tang said, making it \u201cvery hard\u201d for her American customers to decide whether to proceed with their orders.",
      "Her U.S. clients eventually chose to go ahead, Tang said, and her company cleared almost all of its stock.",
      "\u201cMy customers said: \u2018OK. No matter what, we need fireworks for the consumers during the Independence Day,\u2019\u201d said Tang, who said she is now trying to confirm as many orders as possible for next year\u2019s July Fourth.",

      "\u201cTariffs will not incentivize U.S. production \u2014 they will only increase costs,\u201d the letter said.",
      "Though fireworks received a tariff exemption during Trump\u2019s first term, there is no word on whether there will be any such reprieve this time around.",
      "In a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said: \u201cReal prosperity and patriotism isn\u2019t celebrating the independence of our country with cheap foreign-made firecrackers and trinkets \u2014 it\u2019s having a country with booming Main Streets, a thriving working class, and robust manufacturing.\u201d",
      "The fireworks industry says it would be impossible for the U.S. to replicate Chinese manufacturing, citing its lack of key raw materials, its high labor costs and the extensive land it requires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no country on the planet that can have this infrastructure and can do mass production that they can do here,\u201d Nicol\u00e1s Souza Linares, international business manager at the Indiana-based North Central Industries, the largest supplier of fireworks in the U.S. Midwest, said in an interview in Liuyang.",
      "At Tang\u2019s factory, there are dozens of workshops scattered across the slopes, serving different purposes in the production process.",
      "Some steps are automated, such as cutting paper and rolling it into shells or stacking tubes to form casings, but others, such as loading powder into the tubes, have to be done by hand because the work is so delicate and risky.",
      "An explosion at a Hunan fireworks factory this month killed nine people and injured 26 others, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "To prevent such accidents, work areas are separated by walls and kept at a distance from each other, with high-risk stages monitored by surveillance cameras overseen by local authorities. The government has strict rules limiting the amount of explosive powder each person can handle and the number of workers allowed in each area at any given time.",
      "Workers wear color-coded uniforms from yellow to orange \u2014 orange being the most dangerous \u2014 to indicate the level of danger linked with their tasks. Those working with the most dangerous materials are required to stop by around noon, before the hottest time of day.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The government of El Salvador has acknowledged to United Nations investigators that the Trump administration maintains control of the Venezuelan men who were deported from the U.S. to a notorious Salvadoran prison, contradicting public statements by officials in both countries.",
      "The revelation was contained in court filings Monday by lawyers for more than 100 migrants who are seeking to challenge their deportations to El Salvador\u2019s mega-prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.",
      "The case is among several challenging President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "\u201cIn this context, the jurisdiction and legal responsibility for these persons lie exclusively with the competent foreign authorities,\u201d Salvadoran officials wrote in response to queries from the unit of the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The U.N. group has been looking into the fate of the men who were sent to El Salvador from the United States in mid-March, even after a U.S. judge had ordered the planes that were carrying them to be turned around.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that it is powerless to return the men, noting that they are beyond the reach of U.S. courts and no longer have access to due process rights or other U.S. constitutional guarantees.",
      "But lawyers for the migrants said the U.N. report shows otherwise.",
      "\u201cEl Salvador has confirmed what we and everyone else understood: it is the United States that controls what happens to the Venezuelans languishing at CECOT. Remarkably the U.S. government didn\u2019t provide this information to us or the court,\u201d American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt said in an email.",

      "A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. White House and Homeland Security Department officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The administration in March agreed to pay $6 million for El Salvador to house 300 migrants. The deal sparked immediate controversy when Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to quickly remove men it has accused of being members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "In a related case, the administration mistakenly sent Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the same prison, despite a judge\u2019s order prohibiting the Maryland man from being sent to El Salvador.",
      "The administration initially resisted court orders to bring him back to the U.S., saying he was no longer in American custody. Eventually, Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S., where he now faces criminal charges of human smuggling while legal battles continue.",
      "Last month, a coalition of immigrant rights groups sued to invalidate the prison deal with El Salvador, arguing that the arrangement to move migrant detainees outside the reach of U.S. courts violates the Constitution."

    "published": "Tue, 08 Jul 2025 18:18:57 GMT",
    "summary": "Many Mexicans say they've been priced out of their neighborhoods; and critics blame government policies, including ones to attract digital nomads.",
    "story": [
      "MEXICO CITY \u2014 A fierce protest in Mexico City railing against gentrification and mass tourism was fueled by government failures and active promotion to attract digital nomads, according to experts, who said tension had been mounting for years.",
      "The criticism comes after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum alleged that Friday's protest was marked by xenophobia, reviving a debate over an influx of Americans in the city.",
      "Many Mexicans say they've been priced out of their neighborhoods \u2014 in part because of a move made by Sheinbaum in 2022, when she was the Mexico City mayor and signed an agreement with Airbnb and UNESCO to boost tourism and attract digital nomads despite concern over the impact short-term rentals could have.",
      "'Gringo: Stop stealing our home'",
      "On Friday, that came to a head. A largely peaceful protest of hundreds of demonstrators marched through tourism centers of the city with signs reading \"Gringo: Stop stealing our home\" and \"Housing regulations now!\"",
      "Near the end of the march, a group of protesters turned violent, breaking the windows of storefronts and looting a number of businesses. In one case, a protester slammed a butter knife against the window of a restaurant where people were hiding, and another person painted \"kill a gringo\" on a nearby wall.",
      "\"The xenophobic displays seen at that protest have to be condemned. No one should be able to say 'any nationality get out of our country' even over a legitimate problem like gentrification,\" Sheinbaum said Monday. \"We've always been open, fraternal.\"",
      "The frustrations were built upon years of mass tourism and rising rent prices in large swathes of the city. The influx of foreigners began around 2020, when Americans flooded into the Mexico City to work remotely, dodge coronavirus restrictions and take advantage of cheaper living costs.",
      "In the years since, choice neighborhoods like Roma and Condesa, lush central areas dotted with cafes and markets, have grown increasingly populated by foreign tourists and the remote workers known as digital nomads, and there are more temporary housing units rented through companies like Airbnb that cater to tourists.",
      "As they have, rent and living prices have soared and English has been increasingly common on the streets of those areas. Some groups have described the phenomenon as a sort of \"neo-colonialism.\"",
      "Mounting tensions",
      "The Mexico City Anti-Gentrification Front, one of the organizations behind the protest, it was \"completely against\" any acts of physical violence and denied that the protests were xenophobic. Instead, the organization said the protest was a result of years of failures by the local government to address the root of the problems.",
      "\"Gentrification isn't just foreigners' fault, it's the fault of the government and these companies that prioritize the money foreigners bring,\" the organization said in a statement. Meanwhile \"young people and the working class can't afford to live here.\"",
      "In its list of demands, the organization called for greater rent controls, mandates that locals have a voice in larger development projects in their area, stricter laws making it harder for landlords to throw out residents and prioritizing Mexican renters over foreigners.",
      "Mexico's protest comes on the back of a wave of similar protests across Europe railing against mass tourism. Tensions in Mexico have also been compounded by wider inequalities and the Trump administration targeting Latino communities in the U.S. as it ramps up deportations.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security took a jab at protesters Sunday, writing in a post on the social media platform X: \"If you are in the United States illegally and wish to join the next protest in Mexico City, use the CBP Home app to facilitate your departure.\"",
      "Government failures",
      "Protesters' cries against government failures were echoed by experts, who said that surging gentrification is a product of both shortage of affordable housing in the city and longtime government failures to regulate the housing market.",
      "Antonio Azuela, lawyer and sociologist and others said that they do see the protest as a xenophobic backlash, and around 2020 the core of the problem was the influx of \"digital nomads\" in the city, but it grew out of hand because of lax housing laws.",
      "\"What has made this explode is lack of regulation in the market,\" Azuela said.",
      "Mexico City's government over the course of decades has made a few efforts to control development and create affordable housing.",
      "Legislators estimated there are about 2.7 million houses and apartments in the city, but it needs about 800,000 more. But such affordable housing developments that have popped up often are pushed off to the fringes of the city, said Luis Salinas, a researcher at National Autonomous University of Mexico who has studied gentrification in Mexico City for years.",
      "Taking advantage of 'insufficient' laws",
      "Controls, meanwhile, have been marked by lack of enforcement, which developers travel services companies like Airbnb take advantage of, he said.",
      "Today, more than 26,000 properties in Mexico City are currently listed on Airbnb, according to the Inside Airbnb, an advocacy organization that tracks the company's impact on residential communities through data. That's compared to 36,000 properties in New York City and 19,000 in Barcelona, where protests have also broken out.",
      "\"The government has treated housing like it's merchandise,\" Salinas said. The actions the government is taking \"are completely insufficient. The federal government needs to be intervening far more nowadays.\"",
      "Airbnb said it helped contribute more than a billion dollars in \"economic impact\" to Mexico City last year and that spending by guests has supported 46,000 jobs in the city. \"What's needed is regulation based not on prohibitions, but on respect for rights and transparency of obligations,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Last year, Mexico City's government approved the most ambitious rent control law since the 1940s in an effort to control prices and also set caps on short-term rentals to 180 nights a year, but Salinas said that enforcement of short-term rental legislation has been put on pause until after the 2026 FIFA World Cup.",
      "And even then, the country's government will have to take far greater actions to get the situation under control, said Azuela.",
      "\"This isn't going to end by just reigning in Airbnb,\" he said. \"They're going to have to do a whole lot more.\""

      "The action, effective Sept. 6, will end Temporary Protected Status for an estimated 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans who have had access to the legal status since 1999, according to a pair of Federal Register notices.",
      "The Republican president has sought to end temporary legal status for hundreds of thousands of migrants in the United States, including some who have lived and worked in the country legally for decades. The Trump administration already had moved to end TPS for 348,000 Venezuelans and 521,000 Haitians, as well as thousands from Afghanistan and Cameroon.",
      "The administration has said deportation protections were overused in the past and that many migrants no longer merit protections. Democrats and advocates for the migrants have said that TPS enrollees could be forced to return to dangerous conditions and that U.S. employers depend on their labor.",
      "TPS provides deportation relief and work permits to people already in the United States if their home countries experience a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. During his first term as president from 2017-2021, Trump sought to end most TPS enrollment, including the designations covering Honduras and Nicaragua, but his attempts were blocked by federal courts as unlawful.",
      "The initial TPS designations for Honduras and Nicaragua were based on destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch, which tore through Central America in 1998 and killed at least 10,000 people, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in the termination notices that the countries had made significant recoveries, citing tourism in both countries, real estate investment in Honduras and the renewable energy sector in Nicaragua.",
      "\u201cTemporary Protected Status was designed to be just that \u2014 temporary,\u201d Noem said in a statement.",
      "Democratic former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration renewed TPS for Honduras and Nicaragua in 2023, saying the effects of Hurricane Mitch still reverberated and that political instability, economic issues and damage from other storms warranted extending the protections.",
      "The State Department currently warns Americans to reconsider travel to Honduras due to crime and to Nicaragua due to the risk of wrongful detention and limited health care, while also raising concerns about crime. The Honduran government issued a state of emergency in 2022 that allows police to suspend constitutional rights in much of the country. The United Nations has accused Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega of repression after new constitutional reforms in effect this year expanded his powers.",
      "Antonio Garcia, the Honduran deputy foreign minister, said the U.S. decision reflected Trump\u2019s broader effort to end TPS and was not targeting Hondurans specifically. \u201cIt has happened to all countries ... and now us,\u201d Garcia said.",
      "While the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in May that the Trump administration could proceed with ending the status for Venezuelans, a federal judge last week blocked the termination for Haitians."

      "\u201cIt birthed so much culture and expression,\u201d said Riva Pr\u00e9cil, a Haitian-American singer who lived in the hotel from age 5 to 15. In a tearful phone interview, Pr\u00e9cil recalled how she learned to swim, dance and sing at the Oloffson.",
      "Longtime hotel manager Richard Morse, who had been overseeing the property remotely from the United States since the hotel\u2019s closure in 2022, told The Associated Press on Monday that for several months, there were persistent rumors that the hotel had burned.",
      "\u201cSo when I heard Sunday morning that it burned, I did what I usually do, which is call someone who has drones and have them go take a look,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time, when they called back, they said something like, \u2018take a seat.\u2019 I knew then that this wasn\u2019t like the other times.\u201d",
      "The attack on the community where the hotel was located began late Saturday, according to James Jean-Louis, who lives in the hills above the Oloffson. He told The Associated Press over the phone on Sunday that he observed the flames as he and other residents were chased out while police and gangs exchanged heavy gunfire.",
      "Journalists are currently unable to visit the site and verify the damage at the hotel because gangs control the area, which remains inaccessible. Patrick Durandis, director of the Institute for Safeguarding National Heritage, also confirmed the fire in a message to the AP.",
      "Among those lamenting the fire was Michael Deibert, author of \u201cNotes From the Last Testament: The Struggle for Haiti,\u201d and \u201cHaiti Will Not Perish: A Recent History.\u201d",
      "He landed in Miami on Sunday only to open his phone and see a flurry of messages from friends in Haiti.",
      "\u201cWhen you went to the Oloffson, you really felt you were being connected with Haiti\u2019s political and cultural history,\u201d he said. \u201cYou went to Haiti and were never the same. And the Oloffson really captured that.\u201d",
      "The hotel attracted artists, intellectuals and politicians from Haiti and beyond, including Jacqueline Onassis and Tennessee Williams. It also survived coups, dictatorships and the devastating 2010 earthquake.",
      "Isabelle Morse, daughter of Richard Morse, said he loved having writers, photographers and other artists at the Oloffson.",
      "\u201cHis sense of community was very important to him,\u201d she said in a phone interview Monday, describing the hotel as \u201chis whole life.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor him, it represented freedom, where people from all walks of life could come in and share that space,\u201d she said.",
      "Richard Morse said he was reluctant to talk about what happened to the hotel given that in Haiti \u201cso many people are dying and being raped and losing everything that I don\u2019t want the focus to be on the hotel.\u201d",
      "Morse spent nearly 30 years at the Oloffson. It\u2019s where he met his wife, had his children and started his band, RAM.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no life without hope, so we have to consider bringing Haiti back and bringing the hotel back and bringing the art and the culture back,\u201d he said.",
      "Isabelle Morse said her parents had hoped to reopen the Oloffson.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not only a business, it\u2019s our home. We were raised there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was more about moving back home rather than reopening the business.\u201d",
      "The Oloffson served as a presidential summer palace in the early 1900s and then became a U.S. Marine Corps Hospital before a Swedish sea captain converted it into a hotel in the 1930s.",
      "It also served as inspiration for the fictional Hotel Trianon in Graham Greene\u2019s 1966 novel \u201cThe Comedians,\u201d set in Haiti under the brutal dictatorship of Francois Duvalier, best known as \u201cPapa Doc.\u201d",
      "In real life, tourism dwindled under the Duvaliers, and the hotel became a respite for aid workers and foreign correspondents.",
      "In the late 1980s, Richard Morse became the hotel\u2019s manager. His band, RAM, played Haitian roots music on Thursday nights that became legendary, as were the Day of the Dead celebrations known as F\u00e8t Gede that drew in Vodou practitioners.",
      "\u201cIt was a vessel for so many people to gather and freely express themselves,\u201d Pr\u00e9cil recalled. \u201cRAM really created that culture and that environment, made it a space that welcomed people from all types of denominations and sexual preferences.\u201d",
      "The Oloffson was nestled in the upscale community of Pacot in the southeast corner of the country\u2019s capital. It was surrounded by lush gardens and often described as a mythical place, renowned for its intricate latticework, turrets and spires and creaking parquet floors that characterize Haiti\u2019s endangered gingerbread homes.",
      "A 1940s advertisement by Haiti\u2019s tourism department said that the hotel was situated \u201cin the coolest section of the town\u201d and noted that English, French, German and Spanish were spoken there.",
      "The hotel closed in recent years as gangs began raiding and seizing control of once peaceful communities.",
      "\u201cA lot of Haiti\u2019s architectural heritage is going up in flames right now with so-called leaders stand by with their hands in their pockets,\u201d Deibert said. \u201cThe destruction of the Oloffson is symbolic of the destruction of Haiti\u2019s history and culture that we\u2019ve been watching over the last several years.\u201d"

      "NAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 Police in Kenya clashed with demonstrators Monday during the latest anti-government protests, killing 10 people, according to the state-funded human rights commission. Authorities blocked major roads leading into the capital, Nairobi, and most businesses closed amid the strictest measures yet to contain the unrest.",
      "Protesters lit bonfires and threw stones at police. Police fired and hurled tear gas canisters, injuring demonstrators. Young men carried another man, his shirt drenched in blood, saying he had been shot. The protests were reported in 17 of 47 counties.",
      "Kenyan youth and others for weeks have been protesting police brutality and poor governance while demanding President William Ruto\u2019s resignation over alleged corruption and the high cost of living.",
      "July 7, known as Saba Saba, is a significant date in Kenya\u2019s history, marking the first major protests 35 years ago that called on then-President Daniel arap Moi \u2014 Ruto\u2019s mentor \u2014 for a transition from a one-party state to a multiparty democracy, which was realized in the 1992 elections. Saba Saba is Swahili for Seven Seven.",
      "Police officers on Monday stopped private and public vehicles from accessing Nairobi\u2019s city center. They also blocked most pedestrians from entering the capital, only allowing those deemed to have essential duties. Roads leading to parliament \u2014 stormed in a protest last year \u2014 and the president\u2019s office were barricaded using razor wire.",
      "\u201cThere is no reversing the Gen Z Saba Saba-like spirit,\u201d said Macharia Munene, professor of history and international relations at United States International University Africa in Nairobi. \u201cAttempt to criminalize protests is reactive and will not work. It instead makes the government appear retrogressive and desperate enough to subvert the constitution.\u201d",
      "Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen said on Sunday that the government would not tolerate violent protests and police would be deployed to ensure public safety. Last month, Murkomen told police to \u201cshoot on sight\u201d anyone who approaches police stations during protests after several had been burned.",
      "Public Service Minister Geoffrey Ruku had urged all government employees to report to work on Monday, insisting that the demonstrations would not disrupt public services.",
      "In Kitengela town in Nairobi\u2019s outskirts, police fired tear gas to disperse protesters who had lit bonfires on the road that connects to neighboring Tanzania.",
      "\u201cThey have blocked the roads, blocking us from our work. I am a roadside vendor and I am supposed to get to town and buy merchandise to sell along the road,\u201d said protester Caleb Okoth. \u201cWhat do they want us to eat? People are being beaten like dogs for protesting for their rights.\u201d",
      "Kenya\u2019s latest wave of violent demonstrations was sparked by calls for police accountability following the death of a blogger in police custody last month. During protests on June 17, a police officer shot a civilian at close range, further angering the public.",
      "On June 25, at least 19 people were killed and more than 400 injured during protests against police brutality that were timed to coincide with the one-year anniversary of anti-tax protests where parliament was stormed and over 60 people lost their lives."

      "LONDON \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron arrives in Britain on Tuesday for a state visit mixing royal pageantry with thorny political talks about stopping migrants from crossing the English Channel in small boats.",
      "Macron and Prime Minister Keir Starmer will also try to advance plans for a post-ceasefire security force for Ukraine, despite apparent U.S. indifference to the idea and Russia\u2019s refusal to halt the onslaught on its neighbor.",
      "Macron\u2019s three-day visit, at the invitation of King Charles III, is the first state visit to the U.K. by a European Union head of state since Brexit, and a symbol of the British government\u2019s desire to reset relations with the bloc that the U.K. acrimoniously left in 2020.",
      "The president and his wife, Brigitte Macron, will be driven to Windsor Castle by horse-drawn carriage, greeted by a military honor guard and treated to a state banquet hosted by the king and Queen Camilla. The British royals made a state visit to France in September 2023.",
      "Macron also will address both houses of Britain\u2019s Parliament in the building\u2019s fabulously ornate Royal Gallery before sitting down for talks with Starmer on migration, defense and investment.",
      "At a U.K.-France summit on Thursday, senior government officials from the two countries will discuss small-boat crossings, a thorny issue for successive governments on both sides of the channel.",
      "Britain receives fewer asylum-seekers than Mediterranean European countries, but thousands of migrants each year use northern France as a launching point to reach the U.K., either by stowing away in trucks or \u2014 after a clampdown on that route \u2014 in small boats across one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes.",
      "The U.K. has struck a series of deals with France over the years to increase patrols of beaches and share intelligence in an attempt to disrupt the smuggling gangs.",
      "It has all had only a limited impact. About 37,000 people were detected crossing the English Channel in small boats in 2024, the second-highest annual figure after 46,000 in 2022. More than 20,000 people made the crossing in the first six months of 2025, up by about 50% from the same period last year. Dozens of people have died attempting the crossing.",
      "Starmer, whose center-left government was elected a year ago, has pledged to \u201c smash the gangs \u201d behind organized people-smuggling. His plan rests on closer cooperation with France and with countries further up the migrants\u2019 route from Africa and the Middle East. The U.K. also aims to strike deals with individual nations to take back failed asylum seekers.",
      "British officials have been pushing for French police to intervene more forcefully to stop the boats, and welcomed the sight of officers slashing rubber dinghies with knives in recent days.",
      "U.K. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the French are \u201cbringing in important new tactics to stop boats that are in the water.\u201d",
      "Britain also is pushing France to let officers intervene against boats in deeper waters, a change the government in Paris is considering. Campaigners for migrants\u2019 rights and a police union warn that doing so could endanger both migrants and officers.",
      "Starmer spokesperson Tom Wells said some of the tactics being discussed are \u201coperationally and legally complex, but we\u2019re working closely with the French.\u201d",
      "The two leaders have worked closely together to rally support for Ukraine, though they have taken contrasting approaches to U.S. President Donald Trump, with Macron more willing to challenge the American president than the emollient Starmer.",
      "Britain and France have led efforts to form an international peacekeeping force for Ukraine to reinforce a future ceasefire with European troops and equipment and U.S. security guarantees.",
      "Trump has shown little enthusiasm for the idea, however, and a ceasefire remains elusive. British officials say the \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d idea is alive and well, with Macron and Starmer due to join an international videoconference on Thursday to discuss planning for the force.",

      "SARWORLOR, Liberia \u2014 Five months ago, Roseline Phay, a 32-year-old farmer from the West African nation of Liberia, set off on a quest to find contraceptives.",
      "Phay and her partner have two daughters, and they barely make ends meet. Determined not to have more children, she went to a health worker in her village, but contraception pills, implants and condoms had run out. Phay trekked for hours on red clay roads to the nearest clinic, but they had no contraceptives either.",
      "She did not know it, but her mission was doomed from the beginning. Just weeks before, U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly suspended most foreign aid through the U.S. Agency for International Development, which paid for medications in Liberia\u2019s public clinics.",
      "Tenacious and outspoken, Phay repeated the trip four times. Then she got pregnant.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m suffering,\u201d she said, with daughter Pauline crying in her arms. \u201cI have this little child on my back, and the other child in my stomach is suffering.\u201d She must continue farming throughout her pregnancy, she said, or \u201cI will not eat.\u201d",
      "After she got pregnant she had to wean Pauline off breastfeeding, she said, and the girl became so badly malnourished that she almost died. The U.S. cuts left no therapeutic food to give her, and she is still ill.",
      "Phay is among millions across Africa who have seen their lives upended after the U.S. aid cuts. In Liberia, the American support made up almost 2.6% of the gross national income, the highest percentage anywhere in the world, according to the Center for Global Development.",
      "\u201cThe impact of USAID in Liberia cannot be overstated,\u201d said Richlue O. Burphy, who worked for USAID projects for over a decade and manages the National Lottery, a government body. \u201cEverywhere you go, you see the USAID (signs). And almost all the government institutions ... had some kind of USAID partnership.\u201d",
      "The sense of betrayal runs deep in Liberia, established in the early 1800s with the aim of relocating freed slaves and free-born Black people from the United States. The political system is modeled on that of the U.S., along with its flag. Liberians often refer to the U.S. as their \u201cbig brother.\u201d",
      "Liberia was one of the first countries to receive USAID support, starting in 1961. Its officials thought they would be spared from Trump\u2019s cuts because of the countries\u2019 close relationship.",
      "Following civil wars and an Ebola epidemic, Liberia\u2019s survival has depended largely on foreign aid, mainly from the U.S. and the World Bank. Despite abundant natural wealth, six out of 10 Liberians live in poverty, according to the World Bank, and Liberia is among the world\u2019s 10 poorest nations.",
      "The aid cuts pose \u201ca serious challenge,\u201d especially for the healthcare system, Deputy Finance Minister Dehpue Y. Zuo, responsible for drafting the development budget, told The Associated Press. To make sure the system stays afloat, he said, \u201cwe have to take a dramatic switch to see where we will be cutting funding for other areas.\u201d",
      "Liberia received an average of $527.6 million in aid annually between 2014 and 2023, according to the finance ministry. This year, Liberia was supposed to receive $443 million, but the total estimated impact of the cuts is $290 million \u2014 essentially what hadn\u2019t been disbursed yet.",
      "USAID funding built schools and health clinics, provided training for teachers and doctors and gave scholarships for study in the U.S. It supported small-scale farmers and paid for school meals.",
      "But most of the U.S. funding went to Liberia\u2019s health system, making up 48% of its budget. It funded malaria control, maternal health programs, HIV/AIDS treatment and community health programs. It financed hundreds of health projects run by aid groups.",
      "Now in Bong county, where Phay lives, medicine shelves in health clinics are almost empty. The USAID-funded ambulance cannot function because there is no money for fuel. Hospitals are running out of hand sanitizer and gloves. Training for medical staff has stopped, and community health workers have not been paid in months.",
      "Moses K. Banyan, head of the nearby CB Dunbar Hospital, described the U.S. cuts as \u201cbeyond a shock.\u201d He worried about the future, especially now that Bong county has begun to see a handful of mpox cases spread from neighboring Sierra Leone.",
      "Warning of the cuts could have helped in finding options, he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like you were sleeping, you woke up and you were told: \u2018Hey, leave this house.\u2019\u201d",
      "The withdrawal of U.S. support is an opportunity for others, especially China, experts and officials said. Chinese companies have been operating Liberia\u2019s gold mines, building roads and training aid workers. Chinese beer is sold alongside local brands. Many Liberians who would have sent children to universities in the U.S. are now choosing China.",
      "Last month, China opened a cardiology wing in the capital\u2019s main hospital, which is named after John F. Kennedy but was commonly referred to as \u201cJust For Killing\u201d because of its scarce resources, even before the U.S. cuts.",
      "\u201cThere are gaps to be filled, and that cannot be covered by the government of Liberia,\u201d said Zuo, the deputy finance minister. \u201cWe are open door to the rest of the world, including the United States.\u201d",
      "In Phay\u2019s village of Sarworlor, community health worker Alice Togbah still wears her USAID vest though she hasn\u2019t been paid in months. She has no more malaria medication for children. She is running out of cough medicine and diarrhea treatment.",
      "A 4-year-old resident, Promise, got malaria a few days ago. Her mother, Grace Morris, obtained only a limited number of malaria tablets at the nearest clinic because of the U.S. cuts. Now they are finished, and the child still feels ill.",
      "\u201cChildren die from malaria here,\u201d she said. Last year, her neighbor\u2019s son died because he did not get medication on time.",
      "Morris and other women also seek contraceptives. Liberia in recent years made strides in bringing down teenage pregnancy rates and maternal mortality rates.",
      "For women in traditional, conservative communities, access to contraceptives meant reclaiming some control over their lives.",
      "\u201cIf ... my man touches me, I cannot say no because I need to satisfy him,\u201d Phay said. \u201cBut if I have no medicine, I will get pregnant.\u201d",
      "Her 9-year-old daughter, also named Promise, is living in the capital, Monrovia, with her aunt. Phay wants her to finish school and have a different life from hers.",
      "\u201cI am begging, if you people have the medicine, you people need to help us,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to suffer like me.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration is revoking the terrorism designation of a group led by Syria\u2019s new president as part of a broader U.S. engagement with the transitional government since the ouster of former leader Bashar Assad late last year.",
      "In a statement released Monday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the move, which will take effect Tuesday, \u201crecognizes the positive actions taken by the new Syrian government\u201d under President Ahmad al-Sharaa.",
      "Earlier Monday, the Federal Register published an advance notice, which said Rubio made the decision on June 23 in consultation with the attorney general and treasury secretary.",
      "The decision had not been previously announced, although it was made as the Trump administration has been moving to ease or end many U.S. sanctions that had been imposed during Assad\u2019s rule.",
      "The step looks to further end Syria\u2019s isolation since a lightning rebel offensive ousted the Assad family from decades of rule and give the new government a boost as it tries to rebuild a country shattered by 13 years of civil war.",
      "President Donald Trump, before having dinner Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, repeated that he previously had been told that Syria\u2019s new leader \u201ccomes from a very tough background.\u201d",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Well, you know, I\u2019m not that surprised. It\u2019s a tough part of the world,\u2019\u201d said Trump, who met with al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia in May. \u201cBut I was very impressed by him. But we took the sanctions off because we want to give them a chance.\u201d",
      "The brief notice offered no details about the revocation of the foreign terrorist organization designation for the al-Nusrah Front, also known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.",
      "Al-Nusrah was originally designated a foreign terrorist organization for its previous affiliation with al-Qaida. In 2017, it split and changed its name to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which the first Trump administration added to the initial designation.",
      "Syria has been improving relations with the United States and other Western countries following the fall of Assad in December in an offensive led by al-Sharaa \u2019s group.",
      "On June 30, seven days after Rubio signed the revocation, Trump inked an executive order ending many U.S. economic sanctions on Syria, following through on a promise he made to al-Sharaa when they met.",
      "\u201cThis FTO revocation is an important step in fulfilling President Trump\u2019s vision of a stable, unified, and peaceful Syria,\u201d Rubio said in his statement.",
      "Netanyahu, speaking across the table Monday from Trump and Rubio, agreed that the change of leadership in Syria \u201cpresents opportunities for stability, for security and eventually for peace.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to lose by going back to conflict,\u201d the Israeli leader said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot to gain by moving towards peace.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s executive order did not rescind sanctions imposed on Assad, his top aides, family members and officials who had been determined to have committed human rights abuses or been involved in drug trafficking or part of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program.",
      "It also leaves intact a major set of sanctions passed by Congress targeting anyone doing business with or offering support to Syria\u2019s military, intelligence or other suspect institutions.",
      "While the Trump administration has passed temporary waivers on those sanctions, known as the Caesar Act, they can only be permanently repealed by law."
