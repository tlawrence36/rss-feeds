      "Disney's live action version of \u201cLilo & Stich\u201d earned a staggering $145.5 million in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday, the second biggest domestic opening of the year after \u201cA Minecraft Movie.\u201d",
      "The movie is a faithful remake of the 2002 original's story of a six-legged alien and a Hawaiian girl that has created a big cult following in the decades since.",
      "Paramount Pictures' \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning,\u201d the eighth and (probably) last appearance of Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt in a nearly three-decade run, was a distant second domestically, but still brought in a franchise record $63 million through Sunday, out-earning \u201cMission Impossible: Fallout,\u201d which opened domestically to $61 million in 2018.",
      "And the spy thriller with Christopher McQuarrie directing for the first time in the franchise was the top global earner with $127 million,\" with \u201cLilo & Stich\u201d bringing in $111 million.",
      "The previous film, 2023\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d launched with a franchise-best $80 million over five days in a July opening, though it came in shy of industry expectations with a $56.2 million haul over a three-day weekend.",

      "Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi\u2019s revenge thriller \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d has won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday",
      "Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday for his revenge thriller \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\" handing the festival's top prize to a director who had been banned from leaving Iran for more than 15 years.",
      "Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who three years ago was imprisoned in Iran before going on a hunger strike. For a decade and a half, he has made films clandestinely in his native country, including one film (\"This Is Not a Film\") made in his living room, and another (\"Taxi\") set in a car.",
      "The crowd rose in a thunderous standing ovation for the filmmaker, who immediately threw up his arms and leaned back in his seat in disbelief before applauding his collaborators and the audience around him. On stage, Panahi was cheered by Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche, who in 2010 in Cannes held up Panahi's name to honor the director when he was under house arrest.",
      "On stage, Panahi said what mattered most was freedom in his country.",
      "\u201cLet us join forces,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cNo one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do or what we should not do. The cinema is a society. Nobody is entitled to tell what we should or refrain from doing.\u201d",
      "The win for \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d extended an unprecedented streak: The indie distributor Neon has now backed the last six Palme d'Or winners. The latest triumph for Neon, which acquired \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d for North American distribution after its premiere in Cannes, follows its Palmes for \u201cParasite,\u201d \u201cTitane,\u201d \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d \u201cAnatomy of a Fall\u201d and \u201cAnora.\u201d",
      "All those films were Oscar contenders and two, \u201cParasite\u201d and \u201cAnora,\u201d won best picture.",
      "Last year, filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran to attend the premiere of his film in Cannes and resettle in Germany. Panahi, though, has said that unlike his friend Rasoulof, life in exile isn't for him. He planned to fly home to Tehran on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d was inspired by Panahi's experience in prison. In the film, a group of former prisoners encounter the man who terrorized them in jail, and weigh whether or not to kill him.",
      "Panahi was jailed in Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison after going there to inquire about the then-jailed Rasoulof. Panahi was released in 2023 after going on a hunger strike.",
      "In 2009, he was banned from traveling out of Iran after attending the funeral of a student killed in the Green Movement protests. Through those years, Panahi continued to make films illegally in Iran, without a permit, and had his films smuggled to festivals on USB drives. His travel ban was lifted after his release in 2023.",
      "\u201cThe film springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today,\u201d Binoche told reporters after the ceremony. \u201cArt will always win. What is human will always win.\u201d",
      "The Cannes closing ceremony followed a major power outage that struck southeastern France on Saturday in what police suspected was arson. Only a few hours before stars began streaming down the red carpet, power was restored in Cannes.",
      "\u201cA day without electricity,\" sighed John C. Reilly, who sang an English-language \u201cLa Vie En Rose\u201d at the ceremony. The festival's films, he said, supplied \u201call the needed electricity.\"",
      "The Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier\u2019s Norwegian family drama \u201cSentimental Value,\u201d his lauded follow-up to \u201cThe Worst Person in the World.\u201d Some had expected \u201cSentimental Value\u201d to win the Palme, but Trier \u2014 whose film reunites him with actor Renate Reinsve \u2014 still took a major prize.",
      "\u201cWe live in a time of tremendous excess and saturation of images. Moving images are being thrown at us all the time,\" said Trier. \"And I want to give homage to the Cannes Film Festival for being a place where the big cinematic image, which is the foundation of the moving image, the free image, the image that we take time to look at, the image where we can identify with each other in contemplation and empathy, to be cherished in this place in such a way is very important in this moment.\u201d",
      "Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho\u2019s Brazilian political thriller \u201cThe Secret Agent\" won two big awards: best director for Filho and best actor for Wagner Moura. Though Cannes juries are generally urged to spread awards around, the two for \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d showed the jury's strong feelings for it. Asked about the two prizes, juror Jeremy Strong explained, simply, \u201cThat was our wish.\u201d",
      "The wins, which followed the international film Oscar victory for Walter Salles' \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d in March, gave Brazil more to celebrate. On X, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said the awards \u201cshow that our country\u2019s cinema is second to none.\u201d",
      "The jury prize was split between two films: \u00d3liver Laxe\u2019s desert road trip \u201cSir\u00e2t \" and Mascha Schilinski's German, generation-spanning drama \u201cSound of Falling.\u201d Best actress went to Nadia Melliti for \u201cThe Little Sister,\u201d Hafsia Herzi's French coming-of-age drama.",
      "The Belgian brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, who are two-time Palme d'Or winners, won best screenplay for their latest drama, \u201cYoung Mothers.\u201d Its their ninth prize in Cannes. The festival's award for best first film, the Camera d'Or, went to Hasan Hadi for \u201cThe President's Cake,\u201d making it the first Iraqi film to win an award at the festival.",
      "Saturday's ceremony brought to a close a 78th Cannes Film Festival where geopolitics cast a long shadow, both on screen and off. Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world's largest movie market, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.",
      "Most filmmakers responded with a shrug, calling the plan illogical. \u201cCan you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn\u2019t ship that way,\u201d said Wes Anderson, who premiered his latest, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d at the festival. At the opening ceremony, honorary Palme d'Or recipient Robert De Niro called Trump \u201cAmerica's philistine president.\u201d",
      "Other top American films in Cannes included Spike Lee's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d (which pulled Lee away from his New York Knicks but not out of their blue and orange color), the Christopher McQuarrie-Tom Cruise actioner \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Final Reckoning,\" and Ari Aster's \u201cEddington,\u201d which found a divisive reaction.",
      "Panahi's win put him in rare company. He's now won Cannes' Palme d'Or, Venice's Golden Lion (for \u201cThe Circle\u201d) and Berlin's Golden Bear (for \u201cTaxi\u201d). Only three other filmmakers have done that: Henri-Georges Clouzot, Michelangelo Antonioni and Robert Altman.",
      "Addressing reporters after his win, Panahi spoke about filmmakers and artists always being able to find a way, \u201ceven in complicated situations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey must realize that no powers that be can halt such people in their tracks,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cYou have this power.\u201d",

      "Filmmaker Matt Wolf learned that Paul Reubens had died along with the rest of the world",
      "Paul Reubens did not tell his director that he was dying.",
      "On July 31, 2023, the news of Reubens' death came as a shock to documentary filmmaker Matt Wolf, who had spent a year trying to convince him to make the ambitious two-part documentary \u201cPee-wee as Himself,\u201d now streaming on HBO Max, and over 40 hours interviewing him on camera.",
      "But in 2023, the project was in danger of falling apart: The two had been at an impasse for a while over the issue of creative control and they\u2019d finally found a way forward. He had one last interview scheduled, set for the first week of August. Then the texts started coming in. Wolf sat there shaking.",
      "They\u2019d spoken about everything \u2014 Reubens' childhood, his complicated relationship with fame, his ambitions, his commitment to his alter-ego Pee-wee Herman, his sexuality, his arrest \u2014 except the fact that he\u2019d been battling cancer for the past six years. But after the initial shock, a renewed purpose set in.",
      "\u201cI went to work the day after Paul died. I started to read the 1,500-page transcript of our interview through the night and was struck by the significance and meaning that came by understanding that he was privately contemplating mortality,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI was aware that this was an extraordinary situation that was part of the story of the film and that the stakes were the highest I had ever experienced.\u201d",
      "For the next year, Wolf would wake up and say to himself, \u201cYou cannot drop the ball. Rise to the occasion.\u201d It was, he said, \u201cthe most challenging and involved and emotional process of filmmaking that I\u2019ve ever gone through and maybe that I\u2019ll ever go through again.\u201d",
      "Reubens wanted to direct his own documentary. He\u2019d always prized creative control and couldn\u2019t fathom why he would cede it in telling his own story for the first time. But everyone around him seemed to think that was a bad idea. It would take over a year of getting to know Wolf, whose film credits include documentaries about cellist Arthur Russell and news archivist Marion Stokes, to consider letting go.",
      "Even after Reubens had agreed to let Wolf direct the project, he continued to push back and resist at times. Early on, they decided to record their phone conversations as well, recognizing that their dynamic illuminated something true about Reubens.",
      "\u201cRight away, Paul was sort of rebelling against the process, blowing off steam, procrastinating, teasing me, sometimes being adversarial, but in a funny wink-wink way,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI was frustrated. I thought, how am I ever going to get through this? This is the most resistant interview subject I\u2019ve ever encountered. Then I realized this is actually a pretty significant form of portraiture. This is showing Paul\u2019s discomfort and uncertainty about really showing and sharing himself.\u201d",
      "The result is a collaboration, Wolf said, but one in which he also had editorial control. It wasn\u2019t going to be a hit piece, but it wasn\u2019t going to be a puff piece either.",
      "Wolf, 43, was part of the generation of kids who grew up with the children\u2019s television series \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse.\u201d It was, he said, the first time he\u2019d felt viscerally moved by a work of art.",
      "Still, he wasn\u2019t approaching the project as a fan. He was coming as a filmmaker who makes documentaries about gay artists and unconventional visionaries who \u201cbeg for reappraisal.\u201d Unlike most of his subjects, however, Reubens was an icon and a cult figure.",
      "\u201cI was determined not to make a film that fell into the traps of the celebrity biopic with platitudes from other famous people and manufactured self-reflection,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI wanted to make portrait of an artist.\u201d",
      "Much of the film focuses on the prehistory of Pee-wee, showing how his childhood, his artistic awakening, his early improv days and his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d rejection would converge into the commitment to this alter ego. Part of that involved engaging with Reubens\u2019 sexuality in a direct way. In the film, Reubens speaks about living openly as a gay man, and then going back in the closet.",
      "\u201cHe had always intended to come out but was very ambivalent about that,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cAnd I saw myself as a younger gay person who could help somebody achieve that and also to give a sense of nuance and depth to his artistry that one could appreciate, and to understand the personal sacrifices that were required for him to do that.\u201d",
      "Reubens\u2019 career was derailed when he was arrested for indecent exposure in an adult movie theater in 1991. He was handed a small fine but the damage was incalculable. In 2001, he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession of child pornography, which was reduced to an obscenity charge with probation. These are covered in the documentary\u2019s second part.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to set the record straight, particularly about the unfortunate footnotes of his arrest, which to some extent have overshadowed his artistic accomplishments,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThat to me felt like the easy part and also the least interesting part of the film.\u201d",
      "\u201cPee-wee as Himself\u201d premiered earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival, where Wolf got to see emotional responses from audiences, no matter if they came to it as fans or out of some curiosity around the controversies. That emotional intensity was what he hoped they\u2019d feel.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make a film with a big range of emotions, from joy and delight to tragedy and sorrow,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cPaul contains that big spectrum of feelings. And I wanted the viewer to feel it, to have a lasting connection to him. When a film can affect you emotionally it becomes unforgettable.\u201d",

      "Their films are very different but the fulfillment of longtime dreams of being behind the camera. All three movies are part of Cannes' Un Certain Regard section, which has helped launch the careers of directors like Yorgos Lanthimos, Lynne Ramsay and Molly Manning Walker.",
      "At 28, Dickinson is an up-and-coming actor, known for \u201cBabygirl,\u201d \u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing\u201d and the Palme d'Or-winning \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d who worked for years to develop his film, \u201cUrchin.\u201d",
      "Johansson, a two-time Oscar acting nominee who's been a star since her teens and played Black Widow in multiple Marvel films, brought \u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d a film about a nonagenarian who coopts her late friend's Holocaust story, to Cannes this week.",
      "Stewart, also an acting Oscar nominee, debuted \u201cThe Chronology of Water,\u201d an adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch\u2019s 2011 memoir, last week.",
      "Awards for the Un Certain Regard section will be announced Friday, a day before the Cannes Film Festival closes.",
      "Here's what the actors-turned-directors had to say about their first forays into creating a film from behind the camera.",
      "\u201cI wanted to direct from a very young age. I wanted to make films,\u201d says Dickinson, who got his start as many young creators do now: on YouTube. He even had a web sketch series. \u201cThat was my first love, just making things.\u201d",
      "Dickinson's profile as an actor has exploded in recent years, but his desire to direct was so strong, he started saying no to roles.",
      "\u201c'Urchin' was all I could think about. It was pouring out of me. It was all that was on my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say no when you\u2019ve got something to take you away from that, you know? Nothing that came in would make me question my own film, which is a sign that I had to make it at this time.\u201d",
      "The film stars Frank Dillane as a homeless Londoner suffering from drug addiction.",
      "Johansson is now one of the world's most recognizable stars. She's also one of its most respected, earning two Oscar nominations in 2020, for \u201cMarriage Story\u201d and \u201cJojo Rabbit.\u201d",
      "Her success as an actor helped her take on new roles on films, including producing, and, now, directing.",
      "\u201cAt some point, I worked enough that I stopped worrying about not working, or not being relevant \u2014 which is very liberating,\u201d Johansson says. \u201cI think it\u2019s something all actors feel for a long time until they don\u2019t. I would not have had the confidence to direct this film 10 years ago.\u201d",
      "She says that throughout her career, imagining how to make movies has been part of her process: \u201cWhether it was reading something and thinking, \u2018I can envision this in my mind,\u2019 or even being on a production and thinking, \u2018I am directing some elements of this out of necessity.\u2019\u201d",
      "The New York-set \u201cEleanor the Great\u201d stars June Squibb as a 94-year-old who, out of grief and loneliness, takes over her friend's story of Holocaust survival as her own.",
      "\u201cIt was eight years in the making and then a really accelerated push. It\u2019s an obvious comparison but it was childbirth,\u201d says Stewart of the film. \u201cI was pregnant for a really long time and then I was screaming bloody murder.\u201d",
      "Stewart in interviews has talked about challenging the myth that men are better suited to directing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really not fair for people to think it\u2019s hard to make a movie insofar as you need to know things before going into it. There are technical directors, but, Jesus Christ, you hire a crew. You just have a perspective and trust it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy inexperience made this movie.\u201d",

      "\u201cAs a photographer who traveled the globe continuously, he contracted a particular form of malaria in 2010 in Indonesia while working on his Genesis project. Fifteen years later, complications from this illness developed into severe leukemia, which ultimately took his life,\u201d the family added.",
      "Earlier, Instituto Terra, which was founded by Salgado and his wife L\u00e9lia Wanick Salgado, and the French Academy of Fine Arts, of which he was a member, announced his death, but did not provide details on the circumstances or where he died.",
      "\u201cSebasti\u00e3o was more than one of the best photographers of our time,\u201d Instituto Terra said in a statement. \u201cHis lens revealed the world and its contradictions; his life, (brought) the power of transformative action.\u201d",
      "Composer Laurent Petitgirard, secretary of the French Academy of Fine Arts, said in a statement that Salgado, one of his colleagues, was \u201cremarkable for his moral integrity, his charisma, and his commitment to serving art.\u201d",
      "\"He leaves behind a monumental body of work,\u201d Petitgirard said about a photographer who received many awards, and was elected an honorary member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences in the United States in 1992 and to the French Academy of Fine Arts in 2016.",
      "Salgado\u2019s main works include the recent \u201cAmazonia\u201d series, \u201cWorkers,\u201d which shows manual labor around the world, and \u201cExodus\u201d (also known as \u201cMigrations\u201d or \u201cSahel\u201d), which documents people in transit, including refugees and slum residents.",
      "Salgado had his life and work portrayed in the documentary \u201cThe Salt of the Earth\u201d (2014), co-directed by Wim Wenders and his son, Juliano Ribeiro Salgado. The film was was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2015.",
      "One of Brazil\u2019s most famous artists, though, always insisted he was \u201cjust a photographer.\u201d",
      "Salgado moved to France in 1969 as Brazil endured a military dictatorship. He said in different interviews he was then a leftist militant against the regime.",
      "It was in Paris in 1973 that he started to fully dedicate his time to photography and develop his black-and-white style, years after his economics degree.",
      "His first professional works were for the agency Sygma in 1974. The following year, he documented the lives of peasants and Indigenous peoples in Latin America for the Gamma agency. Five years later, he joined Magnum, a top brand for photographers, of which he later became president.",
      "Salgado left it in 1994 to found Amazonia Images with his wife, an agency that exclusively handles his work.",
      "Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who received Salgado\u2019s support throughout his political career, requested a minute of silence during a ceremony in the capital city of Brasilia to honor \u201cone of the greatest, if not the greatest, photographer the world has ever produced.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis nonconformity with the fact that the world is so unequal and his stubborn talent in portraying the reality of the oppressed always served as a wake-up call for the conscience of all humanity,\u201d Lula said. \u201cSalgado did not only use his eyes and his camera to portray people: he also used the fullness of his soul and his heart.\u201d",
      "France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron posted a picture of Salgado\u2019s in Alaska in his Instagram profile as a tribute to the photographer, who also had French citizenship.",
      "Salgado and his wife, whom he married in 1967, raised their two sons, Juliano and Rodrigo, in France. His friends said every morning that he could he would breathe the air near the Canal Saint-Martin in Paris. His death also caused commotion in the country he adopted.",
      "Fran\u00e7ois-Bernard M\u00e2che, a major French composer who worked with Salgado for his exhibition \u201cAqua Mater\u201d in Paris, said the Brazilian was an \u201cauthentic and warm man\u201d.",
      "\u201cHis gaze transformed landscapes, and beyond the spectacular, he reached a kind of inner truth (\u2026). With him, photography fulfilled one of its highest ambitions by going far beyond mere appearances,\u201d M\u00e2che told The Associated Press.",
      "Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said Salgado was passionate about their city.",
      "\u201cTonight I cry for a very close friend, a rare soul; a loyal, discreet and sensible man. His death moves us profoundly. He already leaves us an immense void,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cParis, the city that loved him, will give him the honors he deserves.\u201d",
      "An exhibition of about 400 of Salgado\u2019s works is currently on display in the city of Deauville, in northern France.",
      "Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo, which published several of Salgado\u2019s works over the last decades, said he recently canceled a meeting with journalists in the French city of Reims due to health problems. He was scheduled to attend an exhibition with works by his son Rodrigo for a church in the same city on Saturday, the daily reported.",
      "Salgado and his wife had been working since the 1990s to restore part of the Atlantic Forest in Minas Gerais. In 1998, they turned a plot of land they owned into a nature reserve, according to Salgado\u2019s biography on the French Academy of Fine Arts\u2019 website. That same year, they created Instituto Terra, which promotes reforestation and environmental education.",
      "So far, Instituto Terra has planted more than 3 million trees in the city of Aimores, which lies in what was once a somewhat deserted region in the countryside of the Minas Gerais state. The photographer was born there in 1944.",
      "In an undated interview with Forbes Brasil published on Thursday, Salgado said that attending the exhibition of his works in Deuville felt like a stroll through his life.",
      "\u201cHow many times in my life have I put my camera to the side and sat down to cry? Sometimes it was too dramatic, and I was alone. That's the power of the photographer; to be able to be there,\u201d Salgado said.",
      "\u201cIf a photographer is not there, there's no image. We need to be there. We expose ourselves a lot. And that is why it is such an immense privilege.\u201d",

      "The Florida Panthers have signed Canadian singer Michael Buble \u2014 for a good cause",
      "SUNRISE, Fla. -- The Florida Panthers have signed Canadian singer Michael Buble \u2014 for a good cause.",
      "Buble, a five-time Grammy-winning pop icon, has signed on to be part of the team's fundraising efforts for the American Cancer Society. The \u201cPanthers on the Prowl\u201d initiative combines art and philanthropy to support cancer research and patient services, and donors get the chance to sponsor life-sized panther sculptures that will be placed around South Florida.",
      "The program is the brainchild of Panthers hockey operations president and general manager Bill Zito and his wife Julie Zito.",
      "\u201c'Panthers on the Prowl' is a creative and really cool and uplifting way to demonstrate and show our support for those people that are suffering, so we can generate the much-needed funding to keep this fight going,\" Buble said. \"Cancer touches all of us, my family, friends, yours, neighbors, everyone. I joined my buddy Bill Zito and the Florida Panthers and all of our NHL hockey community because I want to be part of the solution.\u201d",
      "The program formally launched in March and has been backed by famed artist Romero Britto along with NFL players \u2014 and South Florida natives \u2014 Nick Bosa and Joey Bosa, among others.",
      "Julie Zito is a cancer survivor, Bill Zito lost his mother and sister to cancer, and the Zito family recently lost a close friend to cancer as well. The couple got the inspiration for the artwork element of the initiative from the Cows on Parade public art project in Chicago; donors to the Panthers' project can decorate their panther statuette in any way they'd like.",
      "The team is hoping to raise at least $1 million.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in all of our families and all of our friendships,\" said Zito, who joined the Panthers in 2020. \"It makes me more determined not to achieve a goal for the goal\u2019s sake, but to achieve a goal to bring people together.\u201d",

      "King Charles III is coming to Canada to deliver a message: Canada is a sovereign nation distinct from the United States",
      "TORONTO -- King Charles III is coming to Canada to deliver a message: Canada is a sovereign nation distinct from the United States.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor prompted new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne on Tuesday where he will lay out the Canadian government\u2019s agenda when Parliament reopens.",
      "The monarch is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "\u201cCanada has a steadfast defender in our sovereign,\" Carney said when he announced the visit earlier this month.",
      "It is extraordinarily rare for the monarch to deliver what\u2019s called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, only did it twice in her 70-year reign. The last time was in 1977.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the U.S. and he said that the king\u2019s visit clearly underscores the sovereignty of Canada.",
      "The Americans had a revolution to gain independence from Britain. Canada remained a colony until 1867 and continued thereafter as a constitutional monarchy with a British-style parliamentary system.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re different,\u201d former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said. \u201cWe are not the United States. It sounds simple, but that\u2019s what the visit says.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the same institutions. We don\u2019t have the same history,\u201d Charest said. \"We are a different country with a different choice in terms of how how we built ourselves, and King Charles tells that story.\u201d",
      "This will be Charles' first visit as monarch. He visited Canada 19 times as prince. The king has been showing his support for Canada in recent months, including displaying Canadian military medals on his chest during a visit to a Royal Navy aircraft carrier.",
      "Historian Robert Bothwell said that the king\u2019s speech in Parliament \u201cis a gesture of solidarity and identity that can be construed to be a gesture of support.\u201d",
      "But new U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra said sending messages isn't necessary.",
      "\u201cWe're thrilled that the king will be here. If there's a message in there, you know, there's easier ways to send messages. Just give me a call. Carney can call the president at any time,\u201d Hoekstra told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cBut I know what the implication is. It's, oh about ... the 51st state, it's over. And, you know, move on.\u201d",
      "The speech sets the legislative agenda for a new session of Parliament. It's not written by the king or his advisers in the U.K., as the king serves as a nonpartisan head of state.",
      "The king will read what is put before him by Canada's prime minister and his team. The speech is usually read by Canada's governor general, the monarch's representative in Canada. The governor general holds a constitutional but mostly ceremonial and symbolic position.",
      "\u201cKing Charles is unlikely to comment directly on the 51st state issue. Yet, his introductory remarks could feature broad statements about Canada\u2019s integrity and sovereignty. At least this is what many Canadians would like him to do,\" said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.",
      "Former Canadian prime ministers and governor generals will attend the speech. The king will then pay his respects at the National War Memorial before a Royal Canadian Air Force flyby.",
      "B\u00e9land said the monarchy has long been unpopular among Quebec\u2019s French-speaking majority, and some nationalist voices in the province have been critical of the Carney government\u2019s decision to invite the king to deliver the throne speech.",
      "\"Whether the separatists work themselves into a lather over this frankly, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t think Quebecers will care a lot,\u201d said Charest, the former premier of Quebec. \u201cThe may not like the monarchy or whatever they\u2019d like to read into it, but British institutions have served us very well.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration's move, announced Thursday, was a hot topic on Chinese social media. State broadcaster CCTV questioned whether the U.S. would remain a top destination for foreign students, noting Harvard was already suing the U.S. government in court.",
      "\u201cBut with the long litigation period, thousands of international students may have trouble waiting,\u201d the CCTV commentary said.",

      "It's been nearly a decade since robbers stormed Kim Kardashian\u2019s luxury residence and tied her up at gunpoint",
      "PARIS -- The Paris robbery of Kim Kardashian lasted only minutes \u2014 but its impact reverberated for nearly a decade.",
      "On Friday, a court in the French capital will decide the verdict in one of the most audacious celebrity heists in modern French history \u2014 the night masked men stormed the star\u2019s luxury apartment, tied her up at gunpoint and vanished into the dark with $6 million in jewels.",
      "Nine men and a woman stand accused of carrying out or aiding the crime during the Paris Fashion Week in 2016, when the robbers, dressed as police, forced their way into the glamorous H\u00f4tel de Pourtal\u00e8s, bound her with zip ties and escaped with her jewelry \u2014 a theft that would force celebrities to rethink how they live and protect themselves.",
      "After delivering final statements in court, the defendants were dismissed Friday morning, with a verdict expected later in the day.",
      "Among them was 69-year-old Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, the alleged ringleader, who arrived at court walking with a stick, his face hidden from cameras. Prosecutors have asked for a 10-year sentence. His DNA, found on the bands used to bind Kardashian, was a key breakthrough that helped crack open the case. Wiretaps captured him giving orders, recruiting accomplices and arranging to sell the diamonds in Belgium. A diamond-encrusted cross, dropped during the escape, was the only piece of jewelry ever recovered.",
      "Khedache says he was only a foot soldier. He blamed a mysterious \u201cX\u201d or \u201cBen\u201d \u2014 someone prosecutors say never existed.",
      "His lawyer pleaded for clemency, pointing to one of the trial\u2019s most visceral moments \u2014 Kardashian\u2019s earlier courtroom encounter with the man accused of orchestrating her ordeal. Though she wasn't present Friday, her words \u2014 and the memory of that moment \u2014 still echoed.",
      "\u201cShe looked at him when she came, she listened to the letter he had written to her, and then she forgave him,\u201d lawyer Franck Berton told The Associated Press.",
      "Kardashian, typically shielded by security and spectacle, had locked eyes with Khedache as the letter was read aloud.",
      "\u201cI do appreciate the letter, I forgive you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t change the feelings and the trauma and the fact that my life was forever changed.\u201d A tabloid crime had become something raw and human.",
      "Khedache on Friday asked for \u201ca thousand pardons,\u201d communicated via a written note in court. Other defendants also used their final words to express remorse.",
      "The accused became known in France as \u201cles papys braqueurs\u201d \u2014 the grandpa robbers. Some arrived in court in orthopedic shoes and one leaned on a cane. Some read the proceedings from a screen, hard of hearing and nearly mute. But prosecutors warned observers not to be seduced by soft appearances.",
      "The trial is being heard by a panel of three judges and six jurors, who will need a majority vote to reach a decision.",
      "The defendants face charges including armed robbery, kidnapping and gang association. If convicted, some of them could face life in prison.",
      "Kardashian\u2019s testimony earlier this month was the emotional high point. In a packed courtroom, she recounted how she was thrown onto a bed, zip-tied, and had a gun pressed to her on the night of Oct. 2, 2016.",
      "\u201cI absolutely did think I was going to die,\u201d she said. \u201cI have babies. I have to make it home. They can take everything. I just have to make it home.\u201d",
      "She was dragged into a marble bathroom and told to stay silent. When the robbers fled, she freed herself by scraping the tape on her wrists off against the sink, then hid with her friend, shaking and barefoot.",
      "She said that Paris had once been her sanctuary \u2014 a city she would wander at 3 a.m., window shopping, stopping for hot chocolate. That illusion was shattered.",
      "The robbery echoed far beyond the City of Light. It forced a recalibration of celebrity behavior in the age of Instagram. For years, Kardashian had curated her life like a showroom: geo-tagged, diamond-lit, public by design. But this was the moment the showroom turned into a crime scene. In her words, \u201cPeople were watching \u2026 They knew where I was.\u201d",
      "Afterward, she stopped posting her location in real time. She stripped her social media feed of lavish gifts and vanished from Paris for years. Other stars followed suit. Privacy became luxury.",
      "Defense attorneys have asked the court for leniency, citing the defendants\u2019 age and health. But prosecutors insist that criminal experience, not frailty, defined the gang.",
      "Even by the standards of France\u2019s famously deliberate legal system, the case took years to reach trial.",
      "Kardashian, who once said that the experience \u201creally changed everything,\u201d now waits for a verdict \u2014 and perhaps, a final measure of closure.",

      "\"We are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Shapiro cofounded Sound Talent Group in 2018 with Tim Borror and Matt Andersen.

Clients have included Hanson, Pierce The Veil, Parkway Drive, Sum 41 and Vanessa Carlton.",

      "Shapiro grew up in upstate New York in the \u201cstraightedge hard-core\u201d scene, a subculture that promotes not using drugs and alcohol in reaction to mainstream punk.",
      "In high school, he started a band with his friends and got signed with Victory Records right when they graduated. They toured for a few years, during which he made connections in the music industry that would help his foray into the business side.",
      "Shapiro said he became instantly hooked on aviation after taking his first intro flight at age 22. He seemed to love music and flying with equal passion, at one point opening an office of his talent agency at a hangar in San Diego.",
      "Flying \u201chelps me focus and helps me not be distracted by all the nonsense in the world, and whatever\u2019s going on outside the plane kind of doesn\u2019t matter in those moments,\u201d Shapiro said in a 2020 podcast interview.",
      "Shapiro owned a flight school called Velocity Aviation and a record label, Velocity Records.",
      "He offered flights in both San Diego and Homer, Alaska, where he and his wife, Julia Pawlik Shapiro, owned a home, according to his online posts.",
      "Shapiro married his wife in 2016 in the small town of Talkeetna, Alaska. They picked up their wedding licenses, got on a plane and flew to a glacier inside Denali National Park, landing with skis strapped to the plane\u2019s wheels.",
      "\u201cWhen I met Dave, we became instantly bonded over the unconventional lifestyles we lead and our constant need for adventure,\u201d she wrote in a blog post.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through the front gate of her home has been found mentally incompetent to stand trial, but he demanded a second opinion at a Thursday court hearing.",
      "Jimmy Wayne Carwyle a 48-year-old from Mississippi, appeared while in custody behind glass at a Hollywood courthouse that specializes in mental health cases. He had a long, gray beard and wore a thick, blue smock that jails use for suicide prevention.",
      "A county-appointed psychiatrist who evaluated Carwyle found the defendant incompetent, Deputy Public Defender Robert Krauss told the judge as he stood near his client with glass separating them. But Krauss said Carwyle, as is his right, would like an evaluation from a different psychiatrist.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Maria Cavaluzzi ordered the reevaluation and set another hearing for May 29.",
      "Krauss declined comment outside court, as did the prosecutor handling the case and an attorney observing the hearing on behalf of Aniston.",
      "Prosecutors allege Carwyle had been harassing the \u201cFriends\u201d star with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 5, causing major damage.",
      "He pleaded not guilty to felony stalking and vandalism at his first court appearance, where a judge paused the criminal proceedings so he could undergo the psychological evaluation.",
      "Carwyle remains jailed, but he is under a judge's order not to contact or get near Aniston.",
      "Authorities said Aniston was home at the time of the gate crash, but he did not come into contact with her. A security guard stopped him in her driveway until police arrived. No one was injured.",
      "Carwyle also faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm. If convicted, he could get up to three years in prison. If Carwyle is found incompetent again, the judge could order him to be sent to a state mental hospital for treatment and ongoing evaluation.",
      "Other than asking for the protective order for Aniston, prosecutors have not given their position on Carwyle's competency status, and did not speak at Thursday's hearing.",
      "Aniston became one of the biggest stars in television in her 10 years on NBC's \u201cFriends.\u201d She won an Emmy Award for best lead actress in a comedy for the role, and she has been nominated for nine more. She currently stars in \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Apple TV+.",

    "story": [
      "Before this week, the dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi hasn\u2019t attended the premiere of one of his films in more than 15 years",
      "CANNES, France -- Before this week, the dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi hadn\u2019t attended the premiere of one of his films in more than 15 years.",
      "Panahi, one of the leading international directors, was banned from traveling out of Iran in 2009 for attending the funeral of a student killed in the Green Movement protests, a judgment later extended to two decades. But even when placed under house arrest, Panahi kept making movies, many of which are among the most lauded of the century. He made 2011\u2019s \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d on an iPhone in his living room. \u201cTaxi\u201d (2015) was clandestinely shot almost entirely within a car.",
      "These and other films of Panahi\u2019s premiered to considerable acclaim at international film festivals where the director\u2019s conspicuous absence was sometimes noted by an empty chair. When his last film, 2022\u2019s \u201cNo Bears,\u201d debuted, he was in jail. Only after his hunger strike made worldwide news was Panahi \u2014 who had gone to Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison to inquire about his friend, the then-jailed filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof \u2014 released, in early 2023.",
      "Two years later, with his travel ban finally lifted, Panahi arrived at the Cannes Film Festival with a film, \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d riven with the fury and pain of incarceration by the Islamic Republic.",
      "\u201cBeing here does matter, of course. But what\u2019s even more important is that the film is here,\u201d Panahi said in an interview on a Palais terrace. \u201cEven when I went to jail, I was happy that the film was done. I didn\u2019t mind being in prison because my job was done.\u201d",
      "Yet Panahi\u2019s appearance in Cannes, where the film premiered Tuesday, carries tremendous meaning \u2014 and risk \u2014 for a filmmaker who has played such a massive role in international cinema in absentia. But for a director who has previously had his films smuggled out of Iran on USB drives, risk is a constant for Panahi.",
      "\u201cYes, this is an ongoing risk,\u201d he says, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cNow it will probably be higher. But the Iran situation is unpredictable. It changes everyday. New politics everyday. So we have to see what happens the day we go back.\u201d",
      "Last year, in order to reach Cannes, Panahi\u2019s countryman Rasoulof crossed the Iranian border on foot before resettling in Germany. (His film, \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig,\u201d was ultimately nominated for best international film at the Oscars.) Panahi says they speak every other day. After the premiere of \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d Rasoulof texted Panahi to congratulate him on the moment.",
      "Unlike Rasoulof, though, Panahi \u2014 whose \u201cNo Bears\u201d captured him emotionally gazing across, but not crossing, the border \u2014 has no plans to flee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m flying back to Tehran on Sunday,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I\u2019m unable to live here,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cI have no ability to adapt to a new country, a new culture. Some people have this ability, this strength. I don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "What Panahi does have, as his latest film shows once again, is the ability to deftly lace complicated feelings of resistance, sorrow and hope into gripping movies of elegant, if heartbreaking, composition.",
      "In \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which is in competition for the Palme d\u2019Or in Cannes, a man named Vahid (played by Vahid Mobasser) believes he sees his former captor and torturer. Though blindfolded while imprisoned, Vahid recognizes the sound of the man's prosthetic leg. He abducts him, takes him to the desert and begins to bury him in the ground.",
      "But to satisfy pangs of doubt, Vahid decides to confirm his suspicion by bringing the man, locked in his van, to other former prisoners for identification. In this strange odyssey, they are all forced to confront revenge or forgiveness for the man who ruined their lives. Panahi drew from his own imprisonment but also from the stories of detainees jailed alongside him.",
      "\u201cIt was the experience of all these people I met in prison, mixed with my own perception and experience,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cFor instance, the fact of never seeing the face of your interrogator is everyone\u2019s experience. But then the people who have spent over a decade in prison have more experience than myself, so I\u2019ve been very sensitive to their narratives.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d may be Panahi\u2019s most politically direct film yet. It\u2019s certainly his most anguished. That\u2019s a product of not just his personal experience in prison but of the protests in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini.",
      "\u201cI think ultimately violence will be inevitable. And it\u2019s exactly what the regime wants, because it gives a justification to the repression,\u201d says Panahi. \u201cThe longer they remain and the more pressure they put on the people, the more the people will feel that they have no other solution. And that\u2019s when it will get dangerous.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean Panahi is without hope.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians\u2019 struggle and fight for freedom is extremely precious,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat people are doing is so impressive. The regime is just trying to divide us. That\u2019s all they focus on now, to create division between the people.\u201d",
      "In Iran, film productions need to receive script approval from the government to shoot in public. Panahi refuses to do that, knowing they won't allow him to make the films he wants to. So committed is he to making film, he notes that the downside to being able to travel is that he might have to spend a year promoting his film, instead of making the next one. On Thursday, Neon acquired the North American distribution rights.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I can do. Maybe if I had other abilities, I would have changed to something else,\u201d Panahi says. \u201cWhen you know that\u2019s the only thing you can do, you find ways. Now, I\u2019ve gotten used to it. It was harder at the beginning. There were less people doing underground films. We started this fashion, in a way, so there are ways we have learned and practiced, many of us.\u201d",
      "More than perhaps any filmmaker on earth, you can expect Panahi to find a way to keep making movies, no matter the circumstances.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he nods, \u201cat least.\u201d",

      "The music agency Sound Talent Group says three of its employees died on the private plane that crashed into a San Diego neighborhood on Thursday",
      "SAN DIEGO -- A private jet carrying a music talent agent and five others hit a power line in foggy weather early Thursday and crashed into a San Diego neighborhood, slamming into a home and killing multiple people on the flight.",
      "With the home engulfed in flames and jet fuel rolling down the streets, half a dozen vehicles ignited while residents in the neighborhood of U.S. Navy-owned housing were shaken awake just before 4 a.m. by the thunderous crash and subsequent explosions. Out their windows, they saw a wall of fire.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t quite put words to describe what the scene looks like, but with the jet fuel going down the street, and everything on fire all at once, it was pretty horrific to see,\u201d San Diego Police Chief Scott Wahl said.",
      "No one in the neighborhood died, but eight were taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation and injuries that were not life-threatening, including a person who was hurt climbing out a window, police officer Anthony Carrasco said.",
      "Dave Shapiro, co-founder of Sound Talent Group, and two employees were among those killed, the music agency said in a statement. Sound Talent Group has represented artists including American pop band Hanson, American singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton and the Canadian rock group Sum 41. Hanson is perhaps best known for its earworm 1990s pop hit, \u201cMMMBop.\u201d Shapiro also owned Velocity Records.",
      "\u201cWe are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends. Our hearts go out to their families and to everyone impacted by today\u2019s tragedy,\u201d the agency said.",
      "Six people were on board the plane, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Authorities were still combing the scene and recovering the bodies before releasing an official number and identifying the dead, though there were not believed to be any survivors aboard the flight.",
      "Daniel Williams, former drummer for metal band The Devil Wears Prada, posted on his Instagram on Wednesday afternoon that he was boarding the plane with Shapiro. The band posted a tribute to Williams on their Instagram page.",
      "\u201cNo words. We owe you everything. Love you forever,\u201d the band wrote.",
      "A representative for the band referred to their social post when asked about Williams\u2019 death.",
      "Parts of Shapiro\u2019s 1985 Cessna 550 Citation littered a large area, including fragments under the power lines and a section of wing on a road behind the homes, said Elliot Simpson of the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "The home that was struck was destroyed, with its front heavily burned and its roof partially collapsed, and about 10 others were damaged in Murphy Canyon, the largest neighborhood of Navy-owned housing in the country, officials said.",
      "Ben McCarty and his wife, who live in the home that was hit, said they felt heat all around them.",
      "\u201cMy wife was screaming, and she\u2019s like, 'There's a fire,'\u201d McCarty, who has served in the Navy for 13 years, told local ABC affiliate KGTV.",
      "When he walked toward the front of the house, he saw that the roof had fallen off and flames blocked their exit. They grabbed their children and dogs and ran to the back, where their neighbors helped them climb over the fence to escape.",
      "The plane also hit both of the couple's vehicles, which burned.",
      "\u201cIt put my truck into our living room,\u201d McCarty said.",
      "Other vehicles along the block were melted and scorched into burned shells. One stubborn car fire sent smoke billowing up for hours.",
      "Ariya Waterworth said she woke up to a \u201cwhooshing sound\u201d and then saw a giant fireball outside. She screamed for help as firefighters arrived and helped her get out with her two children and their family dog.",
      "One of the family\u2019s cars was \u201ccompletely disintegrated,\u201d and the other had extensive damage. Her yard was littered with plane parts, broken glass and debris.",
      "\u201cI definitely do feel blessed, because we\u2019ve been spared,\u201d she said.",
      "At least 100 residents were evacuated. Hours after the crash, jet fuel rolled down Salmon Street. The smell of fumes lingered throughout the day, and officials said it was unclear when it would be safe for people to return.",
      "\u201cWe have jet fuel all over the place,\u201d Assistant San Diego Fire Department Chief Dan Eddy said.",
      "Eddy added that the fog was so thick in the morning that \u201cyou could barely see in front of you.\u201d",
      "The flight took off from Teterboro, New Jersey, near Manhattan, at about 11:15 p.m. Wednesday and made a fuel stop in Wichita, Kansas, before continuing on to San Diego, according to Simpson.",
      "Based on the flight path, it was bound for Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport when it struck power lines about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) southeast of the airfield, Simpson said.",
      "Audio recorded by www.liveATC.net includes a brief transmission from the pilot saying he was on final approach to the airport and was about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) out at 3:45 a.m.",
      "NTSB investigators planned to spend Thursday and Friday at the scene gathering evidence, Simpson said. He welcomed video or other details from any witnesses.",
      "At that hour and in foggy weather, the plane was likely operating on an instrument flight rules plan, which is typically used during reduced visibility, said Barry Newman, a board-certified aviation attorney.",
      "However, for that airport, once an aircraft reaches 673 feet (205 meters), the pilot also has to rely on sight.",
      "\u201cIf a pilot descends to that level and he can\u2019t see the runway, he has to call for a missed approach or divert to another airport,\u201d Newman said.",
      "In October 2021 a twin-engine plane plowed into a San Diego suburb, killing the pilot and a UPS delivery driver on the ground and burning homes. It was preparing to land at the airport.",
      "And in December 2008, a Marine Corps fighter jet slammed into a house in San Diego\u2019s University City neighborhood, causing an explosion that killed four people inside. The Marine Corps blamed the crash on mechanical failure and human error.",

      "The moment that changed queer history occurred on a sweltering day in early 1952 in Algiers",
      "PARIS -- Decades before transgender became a household word and \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d became a worldwide hit \u2014 before visibility brought rights and recognition \u2014 there was Bambi, the Parisian icon who danced for Hollywood.",
      "The moment that changed queer history occurred on a sweltering summer day in early 1950s Algeria. An effeminate teenage boy named Jean-Pierre Pruvot stood mesmerized as traffic halted and crowds swarmed around a scandalous spectacle unfolding in the conservative Algiers streets.",
      "All had stopped to look at Coccinelle, the flamboyant \u201ctransvestite\u201d star of Paris\u2019 legendary cabaret, the Carrousel de Paris, who strutted defiantly down the boulevard, impeccably dressed as a woman, sparking awe and outrage and literally stopping traffic.",
      "What Pruvot \u2014 who would become famous under the female stage name \u201cBambi\u201d and Coccinelle\u2019s best friend \u2014 witnessed was more than mere performance. It was an act of resistance from the ashes of the Nazi persecution of the LGBTQ+ community in World War II.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even know that (identity) existed,\u201d Bambi told The Associated Press in a rare interview. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018I\u2019m going to do the same.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Carrousel troupe in the late 1940s emerged as a glamorous, audacious resistance. Bambi soon joined Coccinelle, April Ashley, and Capucine in Paris to revive queer visibility in Europe for the first time since the Nazis had violently destroyed Berlin\u2019s thriving queer scene of the 1930s.",
      "The Nazis branded gay men with pink triangles, deported and murdered thousands, erasing queer culture overnight. Just a few years after the war, Carrousel performers strode onto the global stage, a glittering frontline against lingering prejudice.",
      "Remarkably, audiences at the Carrousel knew exactly who these performers were \u2014 women who, as Bambi puts it, \u201cwould bare all.\u201d",
      "Elvis Presley, Ava Gardner, \u00c9dith Piaf, Maria Callas and Marlene Dietrich all flocked to the cabaret, drawn to the allure of performers labeled \u201ctravestis.\u201d The stars sought out the Carrousel to flirt with postwar Paris\u2019s wild side. It was an intoxicating contradiction: cross-dressing was criminalized, yet the venue was packed with celebrities.",
      "The history of queer liberation shifted in this cabaret, one sequin at a time. The contrast was chilling: as Bambi arrived in Paris and found fame dancing naked for film stars, across the English Channel in early 1950s Britain the code-breaking genius Alan Turing was chemically castrated for being gay, leading to his suicide.",
      "Today, Marie-Pierre Pruvot \u2014 as she is also known \u2014 lives alone in an unassuming apartment in northeastern Paris. Her bookshelves spill over with volumes of literature and philosophy. A black feather boa, a lone whisper from her glamorous past, hangs loosely over a chair.",
      "At nearly 90, Bambi is the last of a dying generation. She outlived all her Carrousel sisters \u2014 April Ashley, Capucine, and Coccinelle.",
      "And though the spotlight faded, the legacy still shimmers.",
      "In her heyday, Bambi wasn\u2019t just part of the show; she was the show \u2014 with expressive almond-shaped eyes, pear-shaped face, and beauty indistinguishable from any desired Parisienne. Yet one key difference set her apart \u2014 a difference criminalized by French law.",
      "The depth of her history only becomes apparent as she points to striking and glamorous photographs and recounts evenings spent with legends.",
      "Such was their then-fame that the name of Bambi\u2019s housemate, Coccinelle, became slang for \"trans\" in Israel \u2014 often cruelly.",
      "Once Dietrich, the starry queer icon, arrived at the tiny Madame Arthur cabaret alongside Jean Marais, the actor and Jean Cocteau 's gay lover. \u201cIt was packed,\u201d Bambi recalled. \u201cJean Marais instantly said, \u2018Sit (me and Marlene) on stage' And so they were seated onstage, legs crossed, champagne by their side, watching us perform.\u201d",
      "Another day, Dietrich swept in to a hair salon.",
      "\u201cMarlene always had this distant, untouchable air \u2014 except when late for the hairdresser,\u201d Bambi says, smiling. \u201cShe rushed in, kissed the hairdresser, settled beneath the dryer, stretched her long legs imperiously onto a stool, and lit a cigarette. Her gaunt pout as she smoked \u2014 I\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d she says, her impression exaggerated as she sucked in her cheeks. Perhaps Dietrich wasn\u2019t her favorite star.",
      "Then there was Piaf, who, one evening, teasingly joked about her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the French singing legend Charles Aznavour, performing nearby. \u201cShe asked, \u2018What time does Aznavour start?\u2019\u201d Bambi recalled. \u201cSomeone said, \u2018Midnight.\u2019 So she joked, \u2018Then it\u2019ll be finished by five past midnight.\u2019\"",
      "Behind the glamour lay constant danger. Living openly as a woman was illegal. \u201cThere was a police decree,\u201d Bambi recalls. \u201cIt was a criminal offense for a man to dress as a woman. But if you wore pants and flat shoes, you weren\u2019t considered dressed as a woman.\u201d",
      "The injustice was global. Homosexuality remained criminalized for decades: in Britain until 1967, in parts of the U.S. until 2003. Progress came slowly.",
      "In 1950s Paris, though, Bambi bought hormones casually over-the-counter, \u201clike salt and pepper at the grocery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was much freer then,\u201d but stakes were high, she said.",
      "Sisters were jailed, raped, driven into sex work. One comrade died after botched gender reassignment surgery in Casablanca.",
      "\u201cThere was only Casablanca,\u201d she emphasized, with one doctor performing the high-risk surgeries. Bambi waited cautiously until her best friends, Coccinelle and April Ashley, had safely undergone procedures from the late 50s before doing the same herself.",
      "Each night required extraordinary courage. Post-war Paris was scarred, haunted. The Carrousel wasn\u2019t mere entertainment \u2014 but a one-fingered salute to the past in heels and eyeliner.",
      "\u201cThere was this after-the-war feeling \u2014 people wanted to have fun,\u201d Bambi recalled. With no television, the cabarets were packed every night. \u201cYou could feel it \u2014 people demanded to laugh, to enjoy themselves, to be happy. They wanted to live again \u2026 to forget the miseries of the war.\u201d",
      "In 1974, sensing a shift, Bambi quietly stepped away from celebrity, unwilling to become \u201can aging showgirl.\u201d Swiftly obtaining legal female identity in Algeria, she became a respected teacher and Sorbonne scholar, hiding her dazzling past beneath Marcel Proust and careful anonymity for decades.",
      "Despite what she\u2019s witnessed, or perhaps because of it, she\u2019s remarkably skeptical about recent controversies around gender. This transgender pioneer feels wokeism has moved too quickly, fueling a backlash.",
      "She sees U.S. President Donald Trump as part of \u201ca global reaction against wokeism\u2026 families aren\u2019t ready\u2026 we need to pause and breathe a little before moving forward again.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Kid Cudi is the latest celebrity being called to testify at Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u2032 sex trafficking trial in New York.",
      "The popular melodic rapper is expected to take the stand Thursday and tell the jury about his brief relationship 14 years ago with Combs\u2019 ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie.",
      "According to court filings and testimony, the Cassie-Cudi relationship, which grew out of the two working on music together, sent Combs into rages in which he beat her. Prosecutors contend that Combs was so upset he arranged to have Cudi\u2019s convertible firebombed.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he leveraged his status as a power broker to abuse women.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about the 41-year-old Cudi, whose legal name is Scott Mescudi.",
      "The Cleveland born-and-raised, skinny-jean wearing, Grammy Award-winning rapper has long been celebrated for his alternative hip-hop, emotional music that effortlessly weaves genres together in surprising ways.",
      "Music blogs and other tastemakers quickly caught on to Cudi's 2007 single, \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite,\u201d with its unique singsong style that later appeared on his blockbuster 2009 debut, \u201cMan on the Moon: The End of the Day\u201d as \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite (Nightmare).\" The album's hits included \u201cPursuit of Happiness (Nightmare)\u201d and is easily one of the most influential rap records of the last two decades. In September, \u201cDay \u2018n\u2019 Nite\u201d was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America.",
      "Cudi began as something of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Kanye West, when the then-uncontroversial rapper signed Cudi to his G.O.O.D. Music label in 2008. Cudi left in 2013.",
      "He is featured on Jay-Z's \u201cThe Blueprint 3\u201d and West's landmark \u201c808s & Heartbreak.\u201d Cudi has always had an eye and ear toward innovation. In 2022, his album \u201cEntergalactic\u201d was released alongside a Netflix adult-animated romantic comedy of the same name, which he told The Associated Press allowed him to \u201cexplore the abstract.\u201d",
      "Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, has been the trial\u2019s central witness with her accounts of years of violence and sexual abuse.",
      "She testified that Combs arranged for her to meet Cudi in 2011 to work on music. The two began dating soon after, and she said she got a burner phone to communicate with Cudi in secret.",
      "Cassie said she and Combs had broken up at the time, although they still engaged in sex parties that Combs orchestrated. It was during one of these that Combs looked at her phone and learned of the Cudi relationship, Cassie testified.",
      "In response, she said he lunged at her with a corkscrew and kicked her in the back.",
      "When Cassie and Combs were out of the country in 2012, Combs told her that Cudi\u2019s car would be blown up and Combs wanted Cudi\u2019s friends there to see it, Cassie testified.",
      "On Tuesday, Cassie\u2019s mother, Regina Ventura, testified that Cassie told her Combs was so angry about her relationship with Cudi that he planned to release sexually explicit videos of her and send someone to hurt Cassie and Cudi.",
      "Cassie testified that Cudi came to visit her at her mother\u2019s Connecticut home around Christmas in 2011 and she broke up with him, fearing for both of their safety.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has.",
      "His latest album, \u201cInsano,\u201d arrived last year. Soon after its release, \u201cInsano (Nitro Mega),\u201d a partner record that featured Wiz Khalifa, Pusha T, Steve Aoki and more, arrived.",
      "On May 9, Cudi released his latest single, \u201cNeverland.\u201d A short film of the same name, directed by Ti West and produced by Monkeypaw Productions, will premiere at Tribeca Film Festival this June.",
      "Also in May, Cudi officially launched his new apparel label, WZRD.",
      "Daring fashion has been a longtime passion for Cudi; the rapper has partnered with brands such as BAPE and Adidas. He collaborated with the late designer Virgil Abloh, and in 2021 channeled Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain by wearing an Abloh-designed Off-White floral dress on stage at \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d",
      "Last week, he announced his engagement to menswear designer Lola Abecassis Sartore.",
      "Cudi is also a celebrated actor, having appeared in a number of feature films and television programs. They include 2020s \u201cBill & Ted Face the Music,\u201d the 2021 Netflix original \u201cDon't Look Up,\u201d the HBO series \u201cHow to Make It in America\u201d and the glossy \u201cHouse Party\u201d remake in 2023, in which he played it straight as an anti-social lurker who doesn\u2019t like parties (\u201ctoo much laughing\u201d) and only wanted to go to give his pal LeBron a poem, as The Associated Press' Lindsey Bahr wrote in her review.",

      "The spirit of Indiana Jones is baked into the essence of the new movie \u201cFountain of Youth.\u201d",
      "This lighthearted, globe-trotting heist from Guy Ritchie, debuting on AppleTV+ on Friday, stars Natalie Portman and John Krasinski as estranged siblings attempting to piece together historical facts in hopes of finding the mythical spring. The quest takes them to far-flung places from Vienna to the pyramids, as they try to evade capture by the authorities and a shadowy operation intent on stopping the search.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been looking to watch this movie for years,\u201d Krasinski said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThis is the movie I pretended to be in when I was a kid. This is what got me into the business.\u201d",
      "The film also stars Domnhall Gleeson as the wealthy businessman funding the operation and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez as one of the protectors of the Fountain of Youth.",
      "\u201c Guy Ritchie gets to work with some of the best cast in the world,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez, who has now worked with him three times. \u201cThe biggest gift Guy has given me, besides the privilege of working with him, is working with them.\u201d",
      "Gleeson, a newcomer to the world of Ritchie, was pretty sure that it was going to be as enjoyable as it looked. And he got a vote of confidence from his director.",
      "\u201cGuy basically said, if you\u2019re not having fun, then this is not going to work and so the idea is to turn up and have fun,\u201d Gleeson said.",
      "There were a lot of things about \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d that piqued Portman\u2019s interest. The chance to work with Ritchie, Krasinski, and the rest of the cast, as well as the travel, but it also felt like something she could share with her own son and daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so rare to get to make a movie that has this scale and this scope of adventure that you can watch with your kids,\u201d Portman said. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for something that I can enjoy with my children.\u201d",
      "Her character, Charlotte, is an art historian who had an adventuresome childhood with her explorer father and brother Luke (Krasinski) but has since settled for a more stable life. We meet her amid a contentious divorce and custody battle over her 12-year-old son, and she\u2019s not exactly pleased when Luke steals a piece of art from her gallery and attempts to recruit her for the bigger mission. But soon, she\u2019s in scuba gear hunting down a lost Rembrandt in the wreckage of the RMS Lusitania.",
      "\u201cI think that something we search for as adults is how to regain that youthful spirit, how to hold onto that youthful energy and freedom and wildness, even when having to move into some adult responsibilities,\u201d said Portman, who, like her character is recently divorced. \u201cMaybe that can make you a better parent to have a little bit of that glint in your eye.\u201d",
      "She and Krasinski, working together for the first time, fell into the sibling dynamics easily.",
      "\u201cThese movies sort of live and die with the relationships,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cThe sibling thing really only works if you\u2019re having genuine fun with the person and it can come off screen. And I laughed with her every single day. She\u2019s so funny.\u201d",
      "Globe-trotting films aren\u2019t just travelogues for the audience, but their own sort of adventure for the cast and crew. This production earned their miles, skipping between the streets of Bangkok and Liverpool, the Austrian National Library in Vienna and Cairo to film at the great pyramids \u2014 where \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d became the first film of this scale to be granted the privilege to shoot action sequences there.",
      "\u201cIt was really a pinch me kind of moment to be like, oh, those are the pyramids and we\u2019re just hanging out here and walking into them and filming in them,\u201d Portman said.",
      "The big first was landing a Boeing Chinook CH47 helicopter in front of the Giza Plateau, and blowing up a jeep, all while the site remained open to tourists.",
      "\u201cWith any luck, we didn\u2019t blow it for Hollywood going back there for somebody else,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cBut if we did, at least we got to do it.\u201d",
      "Most of the big action moments \u201cinside\u201d the pyramids were saved for the safety of sets constructed at London\u2019s Leavesden Studio, where they also built the wreckage of the Lusitania in a water tank so big that it took two weeks to fill.",
      "\u201cFountain of Youth\u201d might seem like the type of movie that would be a natural fit for the big screen: A big budget, global adventure with major stars and sweeping vistas. While Krasinski champions movie theaters \u2014 at the time of the interview, he had a ticket to see \u201cSinners\u201d on IMAX the next day \u2014 he\u2019s also not feeling bittersweet that this one won\u2019t be playing at the multiplex. They all came into \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d knowing that it was a streaming-first endeavor.",
      "\u201cThis was always going to be a streaming movie, so I didn\u2019t really think about it in terms of ... Would people want to see it in theaters because it was just one of those things,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the new reality. There are definitely movies that are being made for streaming, and there are movies being made for theatrical.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIt all depends on what the filmmaker\u2019s intent was, what the studio\u2019s intent and I think as long as those rules are laid out clearly in the beginning, I\u2019m down for either one.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Haitians with HIV are defying stigma as they publicly denounce USAID cuts implemented by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump that has led to a dwindling of life-saving medication",
      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- A video showing dozens of people marching toward the office of Haiti\u2019s prime minister elicited gasps from some viewers as it circulated recently on social media. The protesters, who were HIV positive, did not conceal their faces \u2014 a rare occurrence in a country where the virus is still heavily stigmatized.",
      "\u201cCall the minister of health! We are dying!\u201d the group chanted.",
      "The protesters risked being shunned by society to warn that Haiti is running out of HIV medication just months after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump slashed more than 90% of USAID\u2019s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall aid across the globe.",
      "At a hospital near the northern city of Cap-Haitien, Dr. Eugene Maklin said he struggles to share that reality with his more than 550 HIV patients.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain to them, to tell them that they\u2019re not going to find medication,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a suicide.\u201d",
      "More than 150,000 people in Haiti have HIV or AIDS, according to official estimates, although nonprofits believe the number is much higher.",
      "David Jeune, a 46-year-old hospital community worker, is among them. He became infected 19 years ago after having unprotected sex. \u201cI was scared to let people know because they would point their finger at you, saying you are infecting others with AIDS,\u201d he said.",
      "His fear was so great that he didn\u2019t tell anyone, not even his mother. But that fear dissipated with the support Jeune said he received from nonprofits. His confidence grew to the point where he participated in Monday\u2019s protest.",
      "\u201cI hope Trump will change his mind,\u201d he said, noting that his medication will run out in November. \u201cLet the poor people get the medication they need.\u201d",
      "Patrick Jean No\u00ebl, a representative of Haiti\u2019s Federation of Associations of HIV, said that at least five clinics, including one that served 2,500 patients, were forced to close after the USAID funding cuts.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t stay silent,\u201d he said. \u201cMore people need to come out.\u201d",
      "But most people with HIV in Haiti are reluctant to do so, said Dr. Sabine Lustin, executive director of the Haiti-based nonprofit Promoters of Zero AIDS Goal.",
      "The stigma is so strong that many patients are reluctant to pick up their medication in person. Instead, it is sent via packages wrapped as gifts to not arouse suspicion, Lustin said.",
      "Lustin\u2019s organization, which helps some 2,000 people across Haiti, receives funding from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While their funding hasn\u2019t been cut, she said that shortly after Trump was sworn in, the agency banned prevention activities because they targeted a group that is not a priority. By that, Lustin said she understood they were referring to gay men.",
      "That means the organization can no longer distribute up to 200,000 free condoms a year or educate people about the disease.",
      "\u201cYou risk an increase in infections,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a young population who is sexually active who can\u2019t receive the prevention message and don\u2019t have access to condoms.\u201d",
      "On a recent sunny morning, a chorus of voices drowned out the din of traffic in Haiti\u2019s capital, growing louder as protesters with HIV marched defiantly toward the office of Haiti\u2019s prime minister.",
      "\u201cWe are here to tell the government that we exist, and we are people like any other person,\u201d one woman told reporters.",
      "Another marching alongside her said, \u201cWithout medication, we are dying. This needs to change.\u201d",
      "Three days after Monday's protest, the leader of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council, Louis G\u00e9rald Gilles, announced that he had met with activists and would try to secure funding.",
      "Meanwhile, nonprofit organizations across Haiti are fretting.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d said Marie Denis-Luque, founder and executive director of CHOAIDS, a nonprofit that cares for Haitian orphans with HIV/AIDS. \u201cWe only have medication until July.\u201d",
      "Her voice broke as she described her frantic search for donations for the orphans, who are cared for by HIV-positive women in Cap-Haitien after gang violence forced them to leave Port-au-Prince.",
      "Denis-Luque said she has long advocated for the orphans\u2019 visibility.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t keep hiding these children. They are part of society,\u201d she said, adding that she smiled when she saw the video of Monday\u2019s protest. \u201cI was like, whoa, things have changed tremendously. The stigma is real, but I think what I saw \u2026 was very encouraging to me. They can\u2019t be silenced.\u201d",
      "Experts say Haiti could see a rise in HIV infections because medications are dwindling at a time that gang violence and poverty are surging.",
      "Dr. Alain Casseus, infectious disease division chief at Zamni Lasante, the largest non-governmental healthcare provider in Haiti, said they expected to see a surge in patients given the funding cuts, but that hasn\u2019t happened because traveling by land in Haiti is dangerous since violent gangs control main roads and randomly open fire on vehicles.",
      "He warned that abruptly stopping medication is dangerous, especially because many Haitians do not have access or cannot afford nutritious food to strengthen their immune system.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take long, especially given the situation in Haiti, to enter a very bad phase,\u201d he said of HIV infections. And even if some funding becomes available, a lapse in medication could cause resistance to it, he said.",
      "Casseus said gang violence also could accelerate the rates of infection via rapes or physical violence as medication runs out.",
      "At the New Hope Hospital run by Maklin in Haiti\u2019s northern region, shelves are running empty. He used to receive more than $165,000 a year to help HIV/AIDS patients. But that funding has dried up.",
      "\u201cThose people are going to die,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how or where we\u2019re going to get more medication.\u201d",
      "The medication controls the infection and allows many to have an average life expectancy. Without it, the virus attacks a person\u2019s immune system, and they develop AIDS, the late stage of an HIV infection.",
      "Reaction is swift when Dr. Maklin tells his patients that in two months, the hospital won\u2019t have any HIV medication left.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018No, no, no, no!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to keep living.\u201d",

      "Winning titles is fun, too.",
      "The 34-year-old blind tennis champion is on a mission to not only raise awareness but also elevate the sport into the Paralympics.",
      "\"That would be the dream, and I\u2019d love to be the first Paralympic champion if I can,\u201d Rizvi said.",

      "Also an avid runner, Rizvi has completed two marathons and although jogging with a guide is great, tennis offers more.",
      "\u201cOn a tennis court, I have absolute freedom because I know where the boundaries are, no one needs to tell me which way to turn, I don\u2019t need to have a cane or anything of this sort,\" he told The Associated Press during a practice session at the National Tennis Center in southwest London.",
      "\"It\u2019s just the absolute sense of freedom to know that I can run comfortably, make my own decisions, and then be able to play points or rallies. It\u2019s just incredible.\u201d",
      "The rules are basically the same as mainstream tennis just with smaller dimensions and slightly lower net. Tactile lines are taped onto the court so players like Rizvi can feel the boundaries. Depending on the level of visual impairment, you are allowed up to three bounces of the ball. The foam ball contains a bell so players can audibly track it.",
      "\u201cWhat I find interesting about blind tennis is it\u2019s incredibly technical,\u201d said Rizvi, who also possesses a big serve.",
      "The problem-solving aspect of the sport is something Rizvi enjoys \u2014 no surprise given that he studied engineering at University College London.",
      "\u201cYou really need to anticipate after you\u2019ve heard the first bounce where the second and third will be,\u201d he said. \"You obviously can\u2019t see how your opponent has hit the ball, so it\u2019s a lot of anticipation and a lot of practice and getting used to different trajectories that the ball can take.",

      "\u201cI can almost assure you that if you did a survey of blind and partially sighted people,\" he said, \"the majority of them wouldn\u2019t have any idea because it\u2019s not televised, it\u2019s not in any other mainstream events, so how are people supposed to find out?\u201d",
      "The Lawn Tennis Association supports a visually impaired program that includes practice sessions at the governing body's National Tennis Center. That's where Jack Draper, the world No. 5 player, tried out the different levels. The LTA also runs tournaments each year and sends \u201cTeam GB\u201d to an international competition.",
      "Rizvi noted that there's not much financial backing in the sport. There's no prize money at tournaments and players often fund their own travel.",
      "\u201cUnless you obviously have the visibility and the money behind it, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d he said. \u201cGoverning bodies need to take a more active role and try and give parity to all forms of disability tennis not just the ones that have made it big like wheelchair tennis, for example.\u201d",
      "Rizvi, who is married and works in finance, originally represented his native Pakistan but for the past year has been part of England's program since gaining British citizenship. He discussed his childhood \u2014 his father is Pakistani and his mother is Indian \u2014 in a TEDx Talk he gave as a student at UCL.",

      "PHOENIX -- Reproductive rights advocates sued Arizona on Thursday to unravel several laws regulating abortion in the state.",
      "The lawsuit was filed by two providers in the state and the Arizona Medical Association. It comes more than six months after voters enshrined in the state constitution access to abortions up to fetal viability, which is the point at which a fetus can survive outside of the uterus.",
      "The advocates are seeking to undo laws including those that bar abortions sought based on genetic abnormalities, require informed consent in-person at least 24 hours before the procedure and offer an opportunity to view the ultrasound, and prohibit abortion medication delivered by mail and the use of tele-health for abortion care.",
      "\u201cThese stigmatizing and medically unnecessary abortion restrictions violate the right to reproductive freedom established by Arizona voters last November, and it\u2019s time for them to go,\u201d Rebecca Chan, staff attorney for the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement. \u201cArizonans are perfectly capable of making decisions about their own reproductive futures.\"",
      "The state attorney general's office is reviewing the complaint, and an agency spokesperson noted that state law should be in line with the amendment approved by voters last November. Arizona was one of a handful of states that passed ballot measures in the 2024 general election enshrining the right to abortion to their state constitutions.",
      "Earlier this year, an Arizona judge blocked the state's 15-week abortion ban.",
      "Peter Gentala, president of Center for Arizona Policy, a socially conservative nonprofit, said it is too early to determine if the organization will intervene in the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cWomen\u2019s health is important and this lawsuit reflects an agenda to maximize abortion in Arizona and that comes at a cost to women\u2019s health,\u201d he said.",

      "Work requirements for Medicaid recipients, hospitals checking citizenship status, food assistance cuts and other measures in the budget passed by the U.S. House would rearrange the U.S. social safety net",
      "The U.S. social safety net would be jolted if the budget bill backed by President Donald Trump and passed Thursday by the House of Representatives becomes law.",
      "It would require many low-income adults to work to receive Medicaid health insurance coverage and more to work to get food assistance, require hospitals to verify the citizenship status of patients, and cut funding for services like birth control to the nation's biggest abortion provider.",
      "Supporters of the bill say the moves will save money, root out waste and encourage personal responsibility.",
      "A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.",
      "The measure, which also includes tax cuts, passed the House by one vote and could have provisions reworked again as it heads to the Senate.",
      "Here's a look at the potential impact.",
      "Starting next year, many able-bodied Medicaid enrollees will be required to show that they work in exchange for the health insurance coverage.",
      "While about 92% of people enrolled now meet the requirement, roughly 5 million would likely lose their coverage, according to previous estimates of an earlier version of the bill provided by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Increased eligibility checks and red tape related to work requirements may result in some people wrongly getting booted off, said Eduardo Conrado, the president of Ascension, a health care system that operates hospitals across 10 states.",
      "That could spell trouble for rural hospitals, in particular, who will see their small pool of patients go from paying for their emergency care with Medicaid coverage to not paying anything at all. Hospitals could have to eat their costs.",
      "\u201cAdding work requirements is not just a policy change, it\u2019s a shift away from the purpose of the program,\u201d Conrado said of the rule.",
      "Only Arkansas has had a work requirement that kicks people off for noncompliance. More than 18,000 lost coverage after it kicked in in 2018, and the programs was later blocked by federal courts.",
      "Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families, said work requirements do not result in more people having jobs \u2014 but in fewer people having health insurance.",
      "\u201cIf you lose your job going forward, good luck to you,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a good chance you\u2019re going to be uninsured because of this bill.\u201d",
      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, already requires work for some of its roughly 42 million recipients. Adults ages 18-54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents must work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month, or else be limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation passed by the House would raise the work requirement to age 65 and also extend it to parents without children younger than age 7. The bill also would limit the ability to waive work requirements in areas with unemployment rates significantly above the national average.",
      "The combination of those changes could put 6 million adults at risk of losing SNAP benefits, according to the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Like work requirements for Medicaid, those for SNAP tend to cause a decrease in participation without increasing employment, according to an April report by the Brookings Institution\u2019s Hamilton Project.",
      "Under the bill, the federal government would punish states that use their own state dollars to provide Medicaid-covered services to immigrants lacking legal status or to provide subsidies to help them buy health insurance.",
      "Some states that provide that sort of coverage extend it only to children.",
      "Those states would see federal funding for the Medicaid expansion population \u2014 typically low-income adults \u2014 drop from 90% to 80%.",
      "That could mean states pull back that Medicaid coverage to avoid the federal penalty.",
      "\u201cIf that penalty of 10% is imposed, we would expect that states will have to drop that coverage,\u201d said Georgetown's Alker.",
      "KFF said the provision could affect 14 states and Washington, D.C., that cover children regardless of their immigration status.",
      "This month the Democratic governor of one of them \u2014 California's Gavin Newsom \u2014 announced a plan to freeze new enrollments in state-funded health care for immigrants who do not have legal status as a budget-balancing measure.",
      "Planned Parenthood says a provision barring it from receiving Medicaid funds could lead to about one-third of its health centers closing.",
      "The group said about 200 centers are at risk \u2014 most of them in states where abortion is legal. In those states, the number of Planned Parenthood centers could be cut in half.",
      "Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, also offers other health services, including birth control and cancer screening.",
      "Federal money was already barred from paying for abortion, but state Medicaid funds in some states now cover it.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a fight for survival \u2014 not just for Planned Parenthood, but for the ability of everyone to get high-quality, non-judgmental health care,\u201d Planned Parenthood President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement.",
      "Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America celebrated the provision, saying \u201cCongress took a big step toward stopping taxpayer funding of the Big Abortion industry.\u201d",
      "Medicaid would stop covering gender-affirming care for people of all ages in 2027 under a provision added in the hours before the bill passed.",
      "Further, coverage of the treatments could not be required on insurance plans sold through the exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "Trump has targeted transgender people, who make up around 1% of the U.S. population, since returning to office, including declaring that the U.S. won\u2019t spend taxpayer money on gender-affirming medical care for transgender people under 19. The care includes puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries.",
      "The bill would expand that to all ages, at least when it comes to Medicaid.",
      "States now have a mix of policies on the issue with some blocking the coverage and others requiring it.",
      "An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll this month found that about half of U.S. adults oppose government funding for the care for those 19 and over.",
      "Olivia Hunt, director of federal policy for Advocates for Trans Equality called gender-affirming care \u201cone of the most cost-effective public health strategies we've ever found.\u201d",

      "Government vaccine advisers are meeting to decide if the recipe for COVID-19 vaccines needs updating for this fall and winter",
      "WASHINGTON -- Government advisers are meeting Thursday to decide if COVID-19 vaccines need updating to improve protection this fall and winter \u2014 even as a new Trump administration policy has thrown into question who may be eligible for shots.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s outside experts have met regularly since the launch of the first COVID-19 vaccines to discuss tweaking their recipes to stay ahead of the virus. Thursday\u2019s meeting is the group's first since President Donald Trump took office.",
      "But it comes just two days after FDA leaders upended the prior U.S. policy of recommending annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.",
      "Instead, the FDA said routine approval of COVID-19 boosters will be limited to seniors and to younger people who are at high risk of severe infection. Manufacturers will need to do new studies to show whether seasonal shots still benefit healthy people younger than 65.",
      "That has big implications for the fall vaccination campaign, with uncertainty over whether healthy people still could get a vaccine even if it's not recommended for them \u2014 or whether insurers will keep paying for the shots for everyone. Nor is it clear what the policy means for babies who have never been vaccinated.",
      "\u201cThis is a mess,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease expert. \u201cThe one thing we don't want to do is put a barrier in place that prevents parents from getting their children vaccinated if they want to.\u201d",
      "The FDA deflected questions about the new policy at Thursday's meeting to decide whether the virus has mutated enough to warrant strain updates for shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax. The committee\u2019s recommendation is nonbinding guidance ahead of an agency decision.",
      "Last fall\u2019s recipe was tailored to omicron descendants on the JN.1 branch of the virus family tree. Novavax brewed shots targeting the parent JN.1 variant while Pfizer and Moderna opted for a subtype called KP.2.",
      "With JN.1 descendants still dominating worldwide, Pfizer and Moderna representatives told panelists Thursday that their current vaccines remain effective, although switching to a newer subtype, LP.8.1, could provide even more protection. Novavax said sticking with the parent strain JN.1 \u2014 the company\u2019s current vaccine formula \u2014 might be best.",
      "The challenge for regulators is there's no way to predict how the virus will evolve by the time fall vaccinations begin.",
      "The World Health Organization recently issued guidance that last year's version remained OK but that vaccine-makers could also choose an update. A representative for the organization told FDA panelists that current data on the COVID-19's continuing evolution might not yet warrant switching to a newer subtype. In contrast, the European Medicines Agency recently recommended targeting the newest subtype.",
      "While demand for vaccinations has dropped, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 30,000 to 50,000 adults have died from COVID-19 since October. The virus continues to cause \u201cenormous burden\u201d on the health care system, CDC\u2019s Dr. Fiona Havers told panelists. Older adults count for most hospitalizations and deaths but COVID-19 also is \u201ca major cause of pediatric hospitalization,\u201d especially in children under 2 -- many of whom had no underlying medical problems before their infections.",
      "The strain decision normally isn't the final word on recommendations about who should be vaccinated.",
      "The CDC's own advisory panel meets in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are keeping universal access or recommending vaccination for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice in getting a shot.",
      "CDC staffers presented real-world data Thursday showing that getting a booster last fall offered added protection even in people who had been infected and previously vaccinated. Company studies reached the same conclusion \u2014 including one by Moderna that compared medical records of about 900,000 people.",

      "A much-anticipated White House report about childhood diseases has provoked a tug-of-war that\u2019s pitted farmers and some prominent Republican lawmakers against health secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- A highly-anticipated White House report about childhood diseases has provoked a tug-of-war pitting farmers and some prominent Republican lawmakers against health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement ahead of its release.",
      "President Donald Trump promised a review within 100 days that would analyze the ramifications that U.S. lifestyle \u2014 from the medications prescribed for children to the food served on their school lunch trays \u2014 has on childhood diseases like obesity, depression or attention deficit disorder. The report, led by a so-called \u201cMAHA Commission,\u201d is expected to be released on Thursday.",
      "Farmers and Republicans are nervous about what the report might say about glyphosate, the ingredient commonly used in pesticides sprayed on crops. Kennedy has denied the report will be unfavorable to farmers.",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley warned that farmers have reached out to him, upset they have not been able to provide input on the MAHA report ahead of its release.",
      "\u201cI hope there is nothing in the MAHA report that jeopardizes the food supply or the livelihood of farmers,\u201d Grassley said.",
      "Last month, a group of 79 Republicans \u2014 including several senators who represent farming states \u2014 echoed similar concerns about the report saying in a letter to Kennedy that without the products agricultural \u201cyields and quantity are negatively impacted.\u201d",
      "Glyphosate has been available for about 50 years and some farmers say it remains essential for controlling weeds without excessive tilling, helping to conserve both soil and fuel.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why we still use: It works,\u201d said Blake Hurst, a Missouri farmer who is past president of the Missouri Farm Bureau.",
      "Kennedy, though, has built a sizable following over many decades, in part, because of the lawsuits he's waged against corporations, including the company that produced weedkiller Roundup. The World Health Organization has labeled that product's key ingredient, glyphosate, as a probable carcinogen for humans.",
      "On Wednesday a large group of his supporters sent Kennedy a letter calling on the commission to \u201chold the chemical industry\u201d accountable in the report, noting that pressure is mounting.",
      "\u201cEvidence is piling up and the risks from pesticide exposure are undeniable,\u201d the letter, signed by 360 self-proclaimed MAHA supporters that include farmers, former Kennedy campaign staffers and those who worked with him at his anti-vaccine nonprofit.",
      "Dave Murphy, a fundraiser for Kennedy's failed presidential bid, said that he submitted studies and comments on pesticides to Trump administration officials for inclusion in the MAHA report but said that there's \u201ca lot of pressure within Washington\u201d over what the final report says on the issue.",
      "During a senate hearing on Wednesday, Kennedy rebutted concerns from Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith that the report would \u201cunfairly\u201d target farmers.",
      "\u201cThere's not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer,\u201d Kennedy said of his report. \u201cWe are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\u201d",
      "Kennedy was appearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee to discuss the White House's proposed budget, which would give a $500 million boost for Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative. That same proposal also makes deep cuts, including to infectious disease prevention, maternal health and medical research programs.",
      "In February, Trump signed an executive order establishing a Make America Healthy Again Commission tasked with examining the \u201cthreat\u201d that prescription drugs, chemicals and certain food ingredients pose to children.",
      "That review was supposed to be led by several members of the president's cabinet, including Kennedy, Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Kennedy, who has pledged \u201cradical transparency\u201d since taking over the nation's health department, never convened a public meeting of the commission. The White House only released brief, edited clips from a single, closed-door meeting of the commission held in March.",
      "A White House spokesman called the report, which has not been released, a \u201chistoric step,\u201d without sharing further details.",

      "A person attended a Shakira concert at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey while infectious with measles",
      "New Jersey health officials are asking people who went to last week's Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium to monitor for measles symptoms because a person went to see the singer while infectious.",
      "There is no confirmed outbreak in New Jersey, but the U.S. and North America are seeing high measles activity this year \u2014 including hundreds sickened by the highly infectious airborne virus in West Texas \u2014 and declining rates of people getting the vaccine, which is 97% effective after two doses.",
      "Schools and daycares are among the most common places for measles exposures, like one that happened in three western North Dakota public schools in early May that led to all unvaccinated students being held at home for 21 days under state law.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the measles and how to protect yourself.",
      "Most U.S. children get vaccinated against measles before entering public school, but increasing numbers of people skipping shots for religious or personal reasons have fueled outbreaks in the U.S. and abroad this year.",
      "Overall, the U.S. has seen more than 1,000 measles cases across 30 states since the beginning of the year, and 11 states with outbreaks \u2014 defined as three or more related cases. The largest outbreak in the U.S. has been in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. There are also large outbreaks in Mexico and Canada.",
      "It's a respiratory disease caused by one of the world\u2019s most contagious viruses. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It most commonly affects kids.",
      "\u201cOn average, one infected person may infect about 15 other people,\u201d said Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. \u201cThere\u2019s only a few viruses that even come close to that.\u201d",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",
      "People who have had measles once can\u2019t get it again, health officials say.",
      "It usually doesn\u2019t kill people, but it can.",
      "Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven\u2019t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.",
      "Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis \u2014 which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.",
      "\u201cChildren develop the most severe illness,\" said Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. \"The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.\u201d",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "\u201cBefore a vaccine was developed in the 1960s, everybody got\u201d measles, Weaver said. There is \u201cgreat data\u201d on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, he said, because it's been around for decades.",
      "\u201cAny of these outbreaks we\u2019re seeing can easily be prevented by increasing the rate of vaccination in the community,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can maintain 95% of people vaccinated, we\u2019re not going to see this happening in the future. And we\u2019ve slipped well below that level in many parts of the country.\u201d",
      "Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "Not usually. People who are vaccinated are considered protected against measles for their lifetime.",
      "Health care providers can test for antibodies and give boosters if needed.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\u201d",
      "Weaver said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.",

      "Emotional well-being",
      "NEW YORK -- Marian Rivman is pushing 80. Harriet Luria is a proud 83. In this trio, Carol Leister is the baby at 62. Together, they have decades of experience with yoga. Only now, it involves a chair.",
      "Chair yoga adapts traditional yoga poses for older people and others with physical challenges, but the three devotees said after a recent class that doesn't mean it's not a quality workout. As older adults have become more active, chair yoga has grown in popularity.",
      "\u201cYou're stretching your whole body,\u201d Rivman offered. \u201cWhat you can do in the chair is a little bit more forgiving on the knees and on the hips. So as you age, it allows you to get into positions that you were doing before without hurting yourself.\u201d",
      "Sitting down to exercise, or standing while holding onto a chair to perform some poses, may not sound like a workout, but Rivman, Luria, Leister and practitioners everywhere see a world of benefits.",
      "\u201cI took it up because I have osteoporosis and the chair yoga is much easier,\u201d Luria said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry as much about falling and breaking anything. It's not as difficult as I thought it would be, but it\u2019s not easy. And you really do use your muscles. It\u2019s an excellent workout.\u201d",
      "Chair yoga is clearly marketed to older women, who made up the class where the three yoga friends got together at the Marlene Meyerson JCC on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. But the practice also has a lot to offer others, said their instructor, Whitney Chapman.",
      "Desk workers can squeeze in 15 minutes of chair yoga, for instance. Many companies offer it as a way to cut down on stress and improve overall health. And people recovering from surgery or injuries may not be ready to get down on a yoga mat, but they can stretch in a chair.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known these ladies probably 18 to 20 years. And the very first time in a yoga class that I brought in the chair, all of my students said I don\u2019t want geriatric yoga. I\u2019m not an old person,\u201d Chapman said.",
      "\u201cAnd then they saw that having a chair is just as good as a yoga strap, a yoga block. It\u2019s another prop that\u2019s going to help you do what you want to do. So it\u2019s not necessarily because you\u2019re older, but that it can be helpful. And it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re geriatric just because you\u2019re sitting in a chair.\u201d",
      "The benefits are many, Chapman said: improved flexibility, strength, balance. And there's the overall emotional well-being that yoga practitioners in general report. It's particularly useful for people with mobility issues or chronic ailments like arthritis or back pain. Chapman also teaches yoga to cancer and Parkinson's disease patients.",
      "In addition to restorative and other benefits, the practice of chair yoga can help improve posture for people of all ages and abilities, and help older people prevent falls.",
      "Leister recently retired.",
      "\u201cI've been looking for all different kinds of exercises to do and this is one of them,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the one that I could see doing for the rest of my life, where some that are a little more strenuous I may not be able to do in the future.\u201d",
      "Traditional yoga originated more than 5,000 years ago in India. Many of the poses used today are also that old. It can be as much spiritual as physical, and that also goes for its chair descendant. The precise movements are tied to deliberate, cleansing breathwork.",
      "Rivman has been doing yoga for about 50 years.",
      "\u201cOnce you start and you get what it does for your body, you don\u2019t want to give it up. And if there\u2019s a way that you can keep doing it and keep doing it safely, that\u2019s a choice you\u2019re going to make,\u201d she said.",
      "The practice of yoga, including chair yoga, has been on the rise in the U.S. over the last 20 years. In 2022, the percentage of adults age 18 and older who practiced yoga in the past 12 months was 16.9%, with percentages highest among women ages 18\u201344, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Women are more than twice as likely as men to practice yoga, the data showed. The percentage of adults who practiced yoga to treat or manage pain decreased with increasing family income.",

      "Some studies have shown that children with autism are more at risk of drowning",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- In an airy indoor pool with fish cutouts on the walls, a group of small children bobbed, floated and tentatively flutter-kicked.",
      "It was what it looked like, a starter swimming class. But here, instructors worked one-on-one or even two to a child. Some held cards to help kids communicate with teachers by pointing instead of speaking. No one blew whistles.",
      "All the students in the class at the Small Fish Big Fish swim school had autism, a developmental disorder linked to a higher-than-average danger of drowning.",
      "It has long worried autism experts and parents, but recent data make the stakes starkly clear. In Florida, a state where water abounds from beaches to backyards, over 100 children who had autism or were being evaluated for it have drowned since the start of 2021, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County.",
      "The numbers highlight an oft-overlooked dilemma: Autism makes swimming instruction all the more necessary but, often, all the more difficult to get.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s life-changing for kids with autism,\u201d said Lovely Chrisostome, who was terrified this winter when her 6-year-old son slipped out of the family\u2019s home and wandered through their lake-dotted neighborhood. She\u2019d once tried enrolling him in swim classes at a public pool, but he had refused to go in.",
      "But her son was in the pool at the autism-specific class at Small Fish Big Fish. An instructor helped him float on his back. When he started showing discomfort \u2013 he doesn\u2019t like to get his head wet \u2013 she eased him onto his side, where he seemed content.",
      "Autism affects an estimated 1 in 31 U.S. children. Their water safety has gotten occasional public attention after tragedies such as the death of Avonte Oquendo, an autistic teen who was found in a New York river in 2014 after disappearing from his school.",
      "While academic research on the issue is limited, a pair of 2017 studies documented a substantially heightened risk of drowning among people with autism spectrum disorder. The risk stems in large part from their propensity to wander off and to underappreciate perils, according to co-author Dr. Guohua Li and other experts.",
      "One Florida 5-year-old apparently wriggled out a doggy door and got into his grandmother\u2019s pool. Another died in a canal after slipping through a fence hole at a playground specifically intended for autistic kids. A 6-year-old drowned in a lake after she evidently climbed a bookshelf positioned to block an apartment door, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County. It\u2019s now building a national database.",
      "\u201cSwimming lessons should be a first-line treatment for autism,\u201d said Li, a Columbia University epidemiology professor who isn't involved in the council's research. Li himself has a son with the condition.",
      "Some autistic people excel at swimming, such as the New Jersey teens featured in the 2017 documentary \u201cSwim Team.\" Many others are adept in water. Even some profoundly autistic children can master survival basics with as little as eight hours of aquatic occupational therapy, said Michele Alaniz, a practitioner who published research based on her work at Casa Colina Hospital and Centers for Healthcare in Pomona, California.",
      "But some families don't sign up for classes, fearing they'll overwhelm children who might have symptoms ranging from not speaking to repeatedly banging their heads to becoming distressed by noise. Other youngsters get kicked out of programs that can\u2019t handle them. Private sessions can be helpful, but pricey.",
      "\u201cHaving somebody that understands a child on the spectrum \u2014 what the special needs are, how to communicate with a child, how to also mitigate a meltdown, particularly in a pool \u2014 is so vital,\u201d says Lindsey Corey. She said her 5-year-old son didn't absorb much from a general swim class or from private lessons at home in Lake Worth, Florida, but made progress in a program with instructors trained by the Autism Society.",
      "As drowning risks have come into focus, advocates are trying to make swimming lessons more accessible. An Australian charity called Autism Swim says 1,400 swim teachers, physical therapists and others worldwide have taken its online training since 2016.",
      "In Florida, the Children's Services Council's of Palm Beach County provided $17,000 last year for the Autism Society of America to train dozens of instructors, said Jon Burstein, who did the council's research on autism and drowning. The organization paid another $13,500 for the classes at Small Fish Big Fish.",
      "The dozen students, ranging from about 4 to 8, attend a nearby autism-specific charter school. They initially were reluctant to get in the bus, let alone in the water, organizers said. But on an early April afternoon, they readily headed for the shallow pool.",
      "One girl floated on a foam board with her face in the water, an exercise in breath control. Another girl grinned as she propelled herself on a foam noodle.",
      "\u201cShe's fearless to the point it's scary because she'll just jump into a pool, whether she can swim or not,\u201d her mother, Jana D'Agostino, said later. \u201cSo this is really important. It's saving their lives.\u201d",
      "Across the pool, a boy reluctantly eased himself from the steps into the water, where Small Fish founder Melissa Taylor waited for him. \u201cMy turn!\u201d she said, and dunked her head in the water.",
      "He did likewise, then retreated to the steps. Taylor continued working with him, but he soon backed out of the pool and began making hand movements. Realizing he'd had enough, instructors let him towel off.",
      "\u201cIt's taking a lot to get him to trust us,\u201d explained Taylor. But she also recognizes when repetitive splashing and movement signal excitement, not alarm.",
      "The session continued for the other children, including Chrisostome's son, who emerged with a smile.",
      "He has learned a lot in the lessons, but what struck her most?",
      "\u201cThe happiness that he has.\"",

      "Federal health officials will no longer routinely approve annual COVID-19 shots for younger adults and children who are healthy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Annual COVID-19 shots for healthy younger adults and children will no longer be routinely approved under a major new policy shift unveiled Tuesday by the Trump administration.",
      "Top officials for the Food and Drug Administration laid out new requirements for access to yearly COVID shots, saying they'd continue to use a streamlined approach that would continue offering them to adults 65 and older as well as children and younger adults with at least one health problem that puts them at higher risk.",
      "But the FDA framework urges companies to conduct large, lengthy studies before tweaked vaccines can be approved for healthier people. In a framework published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, agency officials said the approach still could keep annual vaccinations available for between 100 million and 200 million people.",
      "The upcoming changes raise questions for people who may still want a fall COVID-19 shot but don't clearly fit into one of the categories.",
      "\u201cIs the pharmacist going to determine if you're in a high-risk group?\u201d asked Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cThe only thing that can come of this will make vaccines less insurable and less available.\u201d",
      "The framework is the culmination of a series of recent stepsscrutinizing the use of COVID shots and raising major questions about the broader availability of vaccines under President Donald Trump. It was released two days ahead of the first meeting of FDA\u2019s outside vaccine experts under the Trump administration.",
      "Last week the FDA granted full approval of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine but with major restrictions on who can get it \u2014 and Tuesday's guidance mirrors those restrictions. The approval came after Trump appointees overruled FDA scientists' earlier plans to approve the shot without restrictions.",
      "Pfizer and Moderna, which make the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines, didn't immediately comment.",
      "For years, federal health officials have told most Americans to expect annual updates to COVID-19 vaccines, similar to the annual flu shot. Just like with flu vaccines, until now the FDA has approved updated COVID shots when manufacturers provide evidence that they spark just as much immune protection as the previous year's version.",
      "But FDA's new guidance appears to be the end of that approach under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has filled the FDA and other health agencies with outspoken critics of the government\u2019s handling of COVID shots, particularly their recommendation for young, healthy adults and children. Under federal procedures, the FDA releases new guidance in draft form and allows the public to comment before finalizing its plans. The publication of Tuesday's policy in a medical journal is highly unusual and could run afoul of federal procedures, according to FDA experts.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s update, written by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and FDA vaccine chief Vinay Prasad, criticized the U.S.\u2019s \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach and states that the U.S. has been \u201cthe most aggressive\u201d in recommending COVID boosters, when compared with European countries.",
      "\u201cWe simply don\u2019t know whether a healthy 52-year-old woman with a normal BMI who has had Covid-19 three times and has received six previous doses of a Covid-19 vaccine will benefit from the seventh dose,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Makary and Prasad recommended that companies study people not deemed at high risk for six months, randomly assigning them to get a vaccine or a placebo and tracking outcomes with special attention to severe disease, hospitalization or death.",
      "Experts say there are legitimate questions about how much everyone still benefits from yearly COVID vaccination or whether they should be recommended for people at increased risk.",
      "An influential panel of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to debate which vaccines should be recommended to which groups.",
      "The FDA's announcement appears to usurp that advisory panel's job, Offit said. He added that CDC studies have made clear that booster doses do offer protection against mild to moderate illness for four to six months after the shot even in healthy people.",

      "TAN TAN, Morocco -- The U.S. military is backing off its usual talk of good governance and countering insurgencies' underlying causes, instead leaning into a message that its fragile allies in Africa must be ready to stand more on their own.",
      "At African Lion, its largest joint training exercise on the continent, that shift was clear: \u201cWe need to be able to get our partners to the level of independent operations,\u201d Gen. Michael Langley said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThere needs to be some burden sharing,\" Langley, the U.S. military\u2019s top official in Africa, said on Friday, the final day of the exercise.",
      "For four weeks, troops from more than 40 countries rehearsed how to confront threats by air, land, and sea. They flew drones, simulated close-quarters combat and launched satellite-guided rockets in the desert.",
      "Maneuvers mirrored previous editions of African Lion, now in its 21st year. But mostly gone now is language that emphasizes ideas the U.S. once argued set it apart from Russia and China.",
      "Messaging about the interwoven work of defense, diplomacy and development once formed the core of Washington\u2019s security pitch. In their place now are calls for helping allies build capacity to manage their own security, which Langley said was a priority for President Donald Trump\u2019s Defense Department.",
      "\u201cWe have our set priorities now \u2014 protecting the homeland. And we\u2019re also looking for other countries to contribute to some of these global instability areas,\u201d he said, referencing U.S. support for Sudan.",
      "The shift comes as the U.S. military makes moves to \"build a leaner, more lethal force,\u201d including potentially cutting military leadership positions in places like Africa, where America's rivals continue to deepen their influence.",
      "China has launched its own expansive training program for African militaries. Russian mercenaries are recalibrating and cementing their role as security partner of choice throughout North, West and Central Africa.",
      "In an interview a year ago, Langley emphasized what U.S. military officials have long called a \u201cwhole of government approach\" to countering insurgency. Even amid setbacks, he defended the U.S. approach and said force alone couldn't stabilize weak states and protect U.S. interests against the risk of violence spilling out.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always professed that AFRICOM is not just a military organization,\u201d Langley said last year. He called good governance an \u201cenduring solution to a number of layered threats \u2014 whether it be desertification, whether it be crop failure from changing environments, or whether it be from violent extremist organizations.\u201d",
      "The \u201cwhole of government approach\" no longer occupies the same place at the center of U.S. messaging, though Langley said holistic efforts have worked in places like Ivory Coast, where development coupled with defense had reduced attacks by jihadi groups near its volatile northern border.",
      "But such successes aren't a pattern.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen progression and I\u2019ve seen regression,\u201d said Langley, who is scheduled to exit his post later this year.",
      "The U.S. military's new posture comes even though many African armies remain ill-equipped and insurgent groups expand.",
      "\u201cWe see Africa as the epicenter for both al-Qaida and Islamic State,\u201d a senior U.S. defense official said earlier this month, noting both groups had growing regional affiliates and the Islamic State group had shifted command and control to Africa. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss the issue publicly.",
      "Africa has rarely ranked high on the Pentagon's list of priorities, but the U.S. has still spent hundreds of millions of dollars on security assistance and has roughly 6,500 Africa Command personnel on the continent. In some regions, the U.S. faces direct competition from Russia and China. In others, regional affiliates of al-Qaida and the IS still require direct military action, Langley said.",
      "The messaging shift from \u201cwhole of government\u201d to more burden-sharing comes as fears grow that rising violence could spread beyond hotspots where insurgents have expanded influence and found vacuums in which they can consolidate power.",
      "Parts of of both East and West Africa have emerged as epicenters of violence. In 2024, more than half of the world\u2019s terrorism victims were killed across West Africa's Sahel, a vast desert territory ruled by military juntas, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace. The group, which compiles yearly terrorism statistics, also found Somalia accounted for 6% of all terrorism-related deaths, making it the deadliest for terrorism in Africa outside the Sahel.",
      "Since Trump took office, the U.S. military has escalated airstrikes in Somalia, targeting IS and al-Shabab operatives. But despite air support, Somalia's army remains far from being able to maintain security on the ground, Langley acknowledged.",
      "\u201cThe Somali National Army is trying to find their way,\u201d Langley said, adding that they had regained some footing after years of setbacks. \u201cThere are some things they still need on the battlefield to be very effective.\u201d",
      "Similarly in West Africa, the notion that states could soon have the capacity to counter such threats is a distant prospect, said Beverly Ochieng, an analyst at Control Risks, a security consulting firm. Even before Western influence began to wane in the Sahel, needed military support was limited, threats remained active, and local militaries were left without the tools to confront them.",
      "Western powers with a presence in the Sahel have gradually scaled back their engagement, either by choice or after being pushed out by increasingly hostile governments.",
      "\u201cMany of them do not have very strong air forces and are not able to monitor the movement of militants, especially in areas where roads are very difficult to traverse, the infrastructure is extremely poor,\u201d Ochieng, who specializes in the Sahel and Great Power competition in Africa, said.",

      "Pope Leo XIV is praying for China\u2019s Catholics to be in communion with the Holy See",
      "ROME -- Pope Leo XIV asked Sunday for prayers for China\u2019s Catholics to be in communion with the Holy See, as he made his first public remarks about one of the thorniest foreign policy issues facing his new pontificate.",
      "History\u2019s first American pope recalled that on Saturday the Catholic Church marked a special feast day to pray for the church in China. Pope Benedict XVI had initiated the feast day as part of his efforts to unify China\u2019s estimated 12 million Catholics who were divided between an official, state-controlled church that didn\u2019t recognize papal authority, and an underground church that remained loyal to Rome through decades of persecution.",
      "Leo noted that on the feast day \u201cin the churches and shrines in China and throughout the world, prayers have been raised to God as a sign of the solicitude and affection for Chinese Catholics and their communion with the universal church.\u201d",
      "Speaking from his studio window during his noontime blessing, Leo prayed that Catholics in China and elsewhere \u201cobtain the grace to be strong and joyful witnesses of the Gospel, even in the midst of trials, to always promote peace and harmony.\u201d",
      "Pope Francis took Benedict\u2019s unifying efforts further by approving a controversial deal in 2018 over bishop nominations. The details of the deal were never released, but it affords the state-controlled church a say in its church leaders, though Francis insisted he retained veto power over the ultimate choice.",
      "The deal has been criticized by some, especially on the Catholic right, for having caved to Beijing\u2019s demands and sold out the underground faithful in China. The Vatican has said it was the best deal it could get and it has been renewed periodically since then.",
      "Leo will have to decide whether to continue renewing the accord. There have been some apparent violations on the Beijing side with some unilateral appointments that occurred without papal consent. The issue came to a head just before the conclave that elected Leo pope, when the Chinese church proceeded with the preliminary election of two bishops, a step that comes before official consecration.",
      "Leo told the archbishop of Hong Kong, Cardinal Stephen Chow, that he had \u201cvisited China several times and got to know the Chinese culture and reality,\u201d according to the Fides missionary news agency, citing comments Chow made in his diocesan weekly newsletter after the conclave.",
      "Chow added that he expected Leo would follow Francis\u2019 direction for the church in China. He said he had given Leo a small statue of Our Lady of Sheshan, a statue of the Madonna that is particularly venerated by Chinese faithful and is celebrated on the feast day, May 24.",
      "Chow, a Jesuit, said he had implored Leo \u201cto not forget the church in China and the Chinese people,\u201d according to the newsletter. \u201cHe nodded his head to indicate that he will not forget,\u201d according to Fides.",
      "The Vatican has been working for years to try to improve relations with China that were officially severed over seven decades ago when the Communists came to power. Relations had long been stymied over China\u2019s insistence on its exclusive right to name bishops as a matter of national sovereignty, while the Vatican insisted on the pope\u2019s exclusive right to name the successors of the original Apostles.",
      "The 2018 deal was aimed at uniting the flock, regularizing the status of seven bishops who weren\u2019t recognized by Rome and thawing decades of estrangement between China and the Vatican.",

      "Poles have traveled from across the country to join dueling patriotic marches in Warsaw",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Poles traveled from across the country to join dueling patriotic marches in Warsaw on Sunday, led by the two men vying for the presidency in a June 1 runoff election expected to be both close and consequential for the nation\u2019s future.",
      "At the head of one march is Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, a liberal urbanite who supports abortion rights and LGBTQ+ inclusion. A close political ally of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, he is backed by Tusk\u2019s pro-European Civic Coalition, which has led a centrist coalition government since late 2023.",
      "Trzaskowski previously ran for president in 2020, narrowly losing to incumbent Andrzej Duda, whose second and final five-year term ends this summer.",
      "Opposite him is Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by the national conservative Law and Justice party, which governed Poland from 2015 to 2023. He heads the state-backed Institute of National Remembrance, which under Law and Justice became a vehicle for nationalist historical narratives.",
      "Earlier this month, the White House released photos of Nawrocki and U.S. President Donald Trump meeting in the Oval Office \u2014 a tacit but unmistakable show of Trump\u2019s support.",
      "Recently, allegations surfaced that Nawrocki swindled an elderly man out of an apartment \u2014 but his supporters in Warsaw on Sunday said they didn't believe the allegations.",
      "Many of those who joined Sunday\u2019s marches had traveled from across Poland, a country of nearly 38 million, not just to support a candidate but to rally behind sharply divergent visions for the nation\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s high time for honesty to win. It\u2019s high time for integrity to win. It\u2019s high time for justice to win,\u201d Trzaskowski told his supporters at the start of his march. \u201cThis is what these elections are about. We have literally the last few days ahead of us. We need full determination, every vote is needed.\u201d",
      "The runoff follows a first-round vote on May 18 that narrowed the initial field of 13 candidates to Trzaskowski and Nawrocki. Recent polls show them running neck-and-neck, within the margin of error, making the outcome impossible to predict.",
      "Both men are now courting voters who backed the hard-right libertarian S\u0142awomir Mentzen, who won nearly 15% in the first round. Known for his nationalist rhetoric and pro-market views, Mentzen had a strong presence on TikTok and received 35% of the vote among 18- to 29-year-olds, according to an Ipsos exit poll.",
      "Nawrocki supporters told The Associated Press ahead of the march that they saw him as the embodiment of the conservative, patriotic values they grew up with. They voiced opposition to abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, and said Nawrocki \u2014 like Trump \u2014 would restore what many called \u201cnormality.\u201d",
      "Trzaskowski supporters countered that their candidate would better protect the country\u2019s interests by strengthening ties with European partners such as France and Germany. In their view, those alliances are vital to Poland\u2019s security, especially in the face of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and fears that a victorious Russia could seek to reassert control over parts of Central and Eastern Europe.",
      "During its eight years in power, Law and Justice was accused by the European Union of undermining democratic norms, particularly judicial independence and press freedom. Trzaskowski has pledged to support Tusk\u2019s efforts to restore the independence of Poland\u2019s judiciary \u2014 something that the conservative President Duda has stymied.",
      "Romanian President-elect Nicusor Dan, a pro-EU centrist who pulled off an upset in Romania\u2019s presidential election to beat out a hard-right nationalist, traveled to Warsaw, meeting with Tusk and joining the march.",
      "While Law and Justice turned state-funded media into instruments of political propaganda, critics say Tusk\u2019s government has also politicized public broadcasting \u2014 albeit in a less overt and aggressive fashion.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- A massive Russian drone-and-missile attack targeted the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and other regions in the country for a second consecutive night, killing at least 12 people and injuring dozens, officials said early Sunday.",
      "The scale of the onslaught was stunning \u2014 Russia hit Ukraine with 367 drones and missiles, making this the largest single aerial attack of the more than three-years-long war, according to Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force.",
      "In all, Russia used 69 missiles of various types and 298 drones, including Iranian-designed Shahed drones, he told The Associated Press.",
      "It was \u201cthe most massive strike in terms of the number of air attack weapons on the territory of Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022,\u201d Ihnat said.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Moscow.",
      "For Kyiv, the day was particularly somber as the city observes Kyiv Day, a national holiday that falls on the last Sunday of May commemorating its founding in the 5th century,",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russian missiles and drones hit more than 30 cities and villages across Ukraine and urged Western partners to ramp up sanctions on Russia.",
      "That has been a long-standing demand of the Ukrainian leader but one that \u2014 despite warnings to Moscow by the United States and Europe \u2014 have not materialized in ways to deter Russia.",
      "Zelenskyy wrote on X that Sunday's targets included Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Chernihiv, Sumy, Odesa, Poltava, Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Cherkasy regions.",
      "\u201cThese were deliberate strikes on ordinary cities. Ordinary residential buildings were destroyed and damaged,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWithout truly strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped. Sanctions will certainly help,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cDetermination matters now \u2014 the determination of the United States, of European countries, and of all those around the world who seek peace.\u201d",
      "The attack came on the third day of a planned prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine, the only tangible outcome from peace talks in Istanbul earlier this month that have so far failed to produce a ceasefire. The exchange amounted to a rare moment of cooperation between the warring sides.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 110 Ukrainian drones overnight.",
      "Sounds of explosions boomed throughout the night in Kyiv and the surrounding area as Ukrainian air defense forces persisted for hours in efforts to shoot down enemy drones and missiles. At least four people were killed and 16 were injured in the capital itself, according to Ukraine's security service.",
      "\u201cA difficult Sunday morning in Ukraine after a sleepless night. The most massive Russian air attack in many weeks lasted all night,\u201d Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on X.",
      "Fires broke out in homes and businesses, set off by falling drone debris.",
      "In the region of Zhytomyr, west of Kyiv, three children were killed, aged 8, 12 and 17, according to the emergency service. Twelve were injured in the attacks, the service said. At least four people were killed in the Khmelnytskyi region, in western Ukraine. One man was killed in Mykolaiv region, in southern Ukraine.",
      "Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a student dormitory in Holosiivskyi district was hit by a drone and one of the building\u2019s walls was on fire. In Dniprovskyi district, a private house was destroyed and in Shevchenkivskyi district, windows in a residential building were smashed.",
      "The scale of Russia's use of aerial weapons aside, the attacks over the past 48 hours have been among the most intense strikes on Ukraine since the February 2022 full-scale war. The last in a three-day prisoner swap was expected to take place later on Sunday.",
      "In the village of Markhalivka, just outside Kyiv, where several homes were burned down in the overnight strikes, the Fedorenkos watched their ruined home in tears.",
      "\u201cThe street looks like Bakhmut, like Mariupol, it\u2019s just terrible,\u201d says 76-year-old Liubov Fedorenko, comparing their village to some of Ukraine's most devastated cities in the war. She told the AP how grateful she was her daughter had not joined them for the weekend with her family.",
      "\u201cI was trying to persuade my daughter to come to us,\" Fedorenko said, adding she told her daughter, \u201cAfter all, you live on the eighth floor in Kyiv, and here it\u2019s the ground floor.'\u201d",
      "\"She said, \u2018No, mum, I\u2019m not coming.\u2019 And thank God she didn\u2019t come, because the rocket hit (the house) on the side where the children\u2019s rooms were,\u201d Fedorenko said.",

      "Zelenskyy and Russia\u2019s defense ministry said each side brought home 307 more soldiers the previous day, on Saturday, a day after each side released a total of 390 combatants and civilians. Once completed, the swap will amount to the largest exchange of prisoners in more than three years of war.",
      "\u201cWe expect more to come tomorrow,\u201d Zelenskyy said on his official Telegram channel on Saturday. Russia\u2019s defense ministry also said it expected the exchange to be continued, though it did not give details.",
      "The previous night, explosions and anti-aircraft fire were heard throughout Kyiv as many sought shelter in subway stations as Russian drones and missiles targeted the Ukrainian capital.",
      "The ongoing POW exchange, the latest of dozens of swaps since the war began and the biggest involving Ukrainian civilians so far did not bring a halt in the fighting.",
      "Battles have continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed, and neither country has relented in its deep strikes.",

      "Venezuelan voters have the chance to choose lawmakers, governors and other elected officials against a backdrop of heightened government repression",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuelan voters have been summoned to choose lawmakers, governors and other elected officials Sunday against a backdrop of heightened government repression. But many are weighing whether to heed opposition pleas to skip the polls and the ruling party\u2019s calls to participate.",
      "The election will be the first to allow broad voter participation since last year\u2019s presidential contest, which President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed to have won despite credible evidence to the contrary. It will take place two days after his government detained dozens of people, including a prominent opposition leader, and linked them to an alleged plot to hinder the vote.",
      "Participation, in the eyes of the opposition, legitimizes Maduro\u2019s claim to power and his government\u2019s repressive apparatus, which after the July presidential election detained more than 2,000 people including protesters, poll workers, political activists and minors, to quash dissent. Meanwhile, the ruling party is already touting overwhelming victory across the country, just as it has done in previous regional elections regardless of opposition participation.",
      "A nationwide poll conducted between April 29 and May 4 by the Venezuela-based research firm Delphos showed that only 15.9% of voters expressed a high probability of voting Sunday. Of those, 74.2% said they would vote for the candidates of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela and its allies, while 13.8% said they would vote for contenders associated with two opposition leaders who are not boycotting the elections.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely despicable,\u201d opposition operative Humberto Villalobos said Saturday referring to the election participation of some opposition members. \u201cWe\u2019re facing the most brutal repression in recent years in the country. (The vote) is a comedy, a parody.\u201d",
      "Villalobos was elections division chief for opposition leader Maria Corina Machado when he and five other government opponents sought refuge in March 2024 at a diplomatic compound in Venezuela\u2019s capital to avoid arrest. He spent more than a year there and on Saturday, along with four of the others, spoke publicly for the first time since they left the compound and arrived in the United States earlier this month.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who met with the group Friday, has described their departure from the compound as an international rescue operation. That assertion has been challenged by Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, who has said it was the result of a negotiation with the government.",
      "The ruling party-loyal National Electoral Council will oversee Sunday\u2019s election for state legislators, 285 members of the unicameral National Assembly and all 24 governors, including the newly created governorship purportedly established to administer Essequibo, a region long under dispute between Venezuela and neighboring Guyana.",
      "In Maduro\u2019s Venezuela, Sunday\u2019s results will have little impact on people\u2019s lives because his highly centralized government controls practically everything from the capital, Caracas. The government also represses the opposition by, for instance, disqualifying a candidate after the election or appointing a ruling-party loyalist to oversee the elected offices held by opponents, rendering them powerless.",
      "Further, after the opposition won control of the National Assembly in 2015, Maduro created an election for members of a Constituent Assembly in 2017. That body, controlled by the ruling party, decreed itself superior to all other branches of government until it ceased to exist in 2020.",

      "The Roman basilica of the Augustinians \u2014 Pope Leo XIV\u2019s religious order \u2014 preserves an iconic painting of the Virgin Mary by Caravaggio",
      "ROME -- The Roman basilica of the Augustinians \u2014 Pope Leo XIV\u2019s religious order \u2014 preserves an iconic painting of the Virgin Mary by Caravaggio, the blockbuster artist who revolutionized the use of light and darkness in Western art.",
      "A new exhibit of works by the Baroque painter is now on view in Rome until July 6, allowing for an updated look at his connection with spirituality.",
      "From the Pilgrims\u2019 Madonna at the Basilica of St. Augustine to the Martyrdom of St. Ursula that closes the \u201cCaravaggio 2025\u201d exhibit, art historians and clergy are highlighting the connections between religious belief and Caravaggio\u2019s \u201cchiaroscuro.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the light that directs us toward what for him are the key points of the story,\u201d exhibit curator Francesca Cappelletti said about the artist\u2019s spotlight on the main characters that emerge from encroaching darkness. \u201cOur life experience makes sense only if invested by a spiritual light.\u201d",
      "In the Augustinian Madonna, dating from the early 1600s, what hits the viewer at eye level are the dirty soles of a ragged pilgrim couple's feet as they kneel by the apparition of the Virgin Mary. She leans casually against a door frame as she holds a toddler-size Jesus.",
      "It\u2019s a far cry from the usual otherworldly, genteel depictions of most Madonnas. That makes it even more poignant within Augustinian spirituality, because it illustrates the encounter between man\u2019s nature and God\u2019s mercy, said the Rev. Pasquale Cormio, the basilica\u2019s rector.",
      "\u201cWe see God\u2019s wish to show himself to humankind as someone who walks alongside the poor,\u201d Cormio said. \u201cIt\u2019s certain that this Virgin Mary is close to a perhaps tired, perhaps wounded, certainly dirty humanity that is burdened by daily life.\u201d",
      "The name of the Pilgrims\u2019 Madonna references not only the two figures before Mary, but also the fact that on this spot, the Augustinians have welcomed pilgrims en route to the nearby Vatican since the end of the 13th century.",
      "It was to commemorate a pilgrimage to Loreto \u2014 a shrine in central Italy where tradition says Mary\u2019s house was miraculously airlifted \u2014 that the painting\u2019s well-connected patrons commissioned it, said Alessandro Zuccari. A member of Italy\u2019s prestigious Accademia dei Lincei, he wrote the chapter on spirituality in the Caravaggio exhibit catalog.",
      "In fact, despite his adventurous life and bluntly realistic art, Caravaggio worked for prestigious, pious patrons, including a cardinal, and is documented to have participated in Catholic rites including Eucharistic adoration, Zuccari added.",
      "That hardly fits the reputation for a transgressive \u201caccursed artist\u201d that Caravaggio \u2014 whose full name was Michelangelo Merisi \u2014 accrued over the centuries.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what Caravaggio thought, because he left no writings,\u201d Zuccari said. \u201cI\u2019m convinced, as are other experts, that Caravaggio has his own spirituality.\u201d",
      "Out of about 70 paintings by Caravaggio, more than 50 represent saints or Biblical scenes \u2014 even those destined for private collections, not churches, he added.",
      "Some of the best-known are among the two dozen paintings on view at Palazzo Barberini, covering the time from Caravaggio\u2019s arrival in Rome around 1595 to his death in 1610. They include works on loan from Dublin to Kansas City.",
      "There\u2019s Caravaggio\u2019s first religious painting, St. Francis of Assisi, who\u2019s depicted in an angel\u2019s arms while one of his early companions, Brother Leo, is barely visible in the surrounding darkness.",
      "It\u2019s an early example of those \u201coscuri gagliardi\u201d \u2014 a bold darkness, as a 17th century art critic quoted in an exhibit panel put it. \u201cGagliardo\u201d is a slang word Romans still use today to mean everything from panini to people with a special flair and power.",
      "Two other religious paintings with the same innovative use of light and darkness take a gruesome turn. In Judith Beheading Holofernes, the Jewish hero frowns in seeming disgust at the blood spurting from his neck. In David with the Head of Goliath, the dripping severed head is a self-portrait.",
      "In what\u2019s probably the artist\u2019s last painting before dying at age 39, and the last exhibited in the new show, Caravaggio also portrayed himself. He\u2019s the man peeking, stunned and openmouthed, from the darkness at the soldier who\u2019s just shot an arrow into St. Ursula\u2019s chest.",
      "More of Caravaggio\u2019s religious paintings are in chapels downtown Rome. The Conversion of Saul, an early version of which is in the exhibit, and the Crucifixion of Peter are in Santa Maria del Popolo, also an Augustinian community. Three paintings about St. Matthew are in San Luigi dei Francesi church.",
      "Two blocks away, back at St. Augustine\u2019s, pilgrims and tourists continue to flock to see Caravaggio and other artwork. For Cormio, welcoming them is a chance to encourage Augustinian spirituality.",
      "\u201cAugustine also left us this teaching \u2014 that through the beauty of creation and the beauty of human works, too, we can capture something of the beauty of God,\u201d he said.",

      "Netflix already renewed the show for a second season, with filming scheduled to start next year.",
      "But \u201cThe Eternaut\u201d has touched on something deeper in Argentina, where legendary comic-strip writer H\u00e9ctor Germ\u00e1n Oesterheld penned the original graphic novel in 1957 \u2014 two decades before he was \u201cdisappeared\u201d by Argentina\u2019s military dictatorship, along with all four of his daughters.",
      "Abroad, publishers are scrambling to keep pace with renewed interest in the source material. The Seattle-based Fantagraphics Books said it would reissue an out-of-print English translation due to the surge in U.S. demand.",
      "At home, the TV adaptation has reopened historical wounds and found unexpected resonance at a moment of heightened anxiety about the state of Argentine society under far-right President Javier Milei.",
      "\u201cThe boom of \u2018The Eternaut' has created a cultural and social event beyond the series,\u201d said Mart\u00edn Oesterheld, the writer\u2019s grandson and a creative consultant and executive producer on the show. \u201cIt fills our hearts. It brings us pride.\u201d",
      "For years, the surviving Oesterhelds resisted offers from Hollywood to adapt the cult classic, wary of the industry's seemingly irresistible urge to destroy New York City and other Western centers in apocalyptic dramas.",
      "To honor his grandfather's creation, Mart\u00edn Oesterheld said the show had to be filmed in Spanish, with an Argentine cast and set in Buenos Aires.",
      "\u201cWhat he did was to do away with the representations of science fiction that we know in Europe and the United States,\u201d Mart\u00edn Oesterheld said of his grandfather. \u201cHe told it on our own terms, through things that we recognize.\u201d",
      "Netflix, pushing to expand beyond its saturated U.S. market into previously untapped regions like Latin America, was a natural fit, he said. The streaming giant wouldn\u2019t disclose its budget, but said the special effect-laden show took four years of pre- and post-production, involved 2,900 people and pumped $34 million into Argentina\u2019s economy.",
      "In the show, aliens wreak predictable mayhem on an unpredictable cityscape \u2014 wide boulevards, neoclassical buildings, antique pizza halls and grimy suburbs \u2014 lending the show a shiver of curious power for Argentines who had never seen their city eviscerated on screen.",
      "The protagonists don't play poker but truco, a popular Argentine trick card game. They sip from gourds of mate, the signature Argentine drink made from yerba leaves. The snowfall is uncanny, and not just because it kills on contact. Buenos Aires has only seen snow twice in the last century.",
      "\u201cFrom truco in scene one, which couldn't be more Argentine, we see that \u2018The Eternaut\u2019 is playing with these contrasts \u2014 life and death, light and darkness, the familiar versus the alien,\u201d said Mart\u00edn Hadis, an Argentine researcher specializing in science fiction. \u201cIt's not just a sci-fi story. It's a modern myth. That\u2019s what makes it so universal.\u201d",
      "In updating the story to present-day Argentina, the show brings the nation\u2019s disastrous 1982 war with Britain over Las Malvinas, or the Falkland Islands, into the backstory of its hero, Juan Salvo, played by renowned actor Ricardo Dar\u00edn.",
      "Salvo, a protective father and courageous ex-soldier who emerges to lead the group of survivors, is haunted by the rout of his comrades sent by Argentina's dictatorship to retake the South Atlantic islands. The defeat killed 649 Argentine soldiers, many of them untrained conscripts.",
      "\u201cThe conflict in Las Malvinas is not closed, it\u2019s still a bloody wound,\u201d Dar\u00edn told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s bringing the subject back to the table. That has moved a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Faced with catastrophe, the protagonists rely on their own ingenuity, and on each other, to survive.",
      "What comes through, the creators say, is the Argentine saying \u201catado con alambre\u201d \u2014 roughly, \u201cheld together with wire\u201d \u2014 used to describe the inventive nature of those who do much with little in a nation that has suffered through decades of military rule and economic crises.",
      "\u201cIt says a lot about being Argentine \u2014 taking whatever you have at your disposal and pushing your limitations,\u201d said Mart\u00edn Oesterheld. He was referring not only to the plot but also to the production at a time when Milei has waged war on Argentina's bloated state and slashed funding to cultural programs like the National Film Institute.",
      "\u201cAs our culture is being defunded, we\u2019re taking this Argentine product to the world,\u201d Mart\u00edn Oesterheld said.",
      "Against this backdrop, the show's message of solidarity has gained an urgent new meaning, with Argentines outraged over Milei\u2019s libertarian ideology transforming the series' motto, \u201cNo one gets through it alone,\u201d into a rallying cry.",
      "The slogan was scrawled on signs at protests by retirees demonstrating against the government\u2019s sharp cuts to their pensions this month. To protect against police tear gas, some traded bandannas for the gas masks used in the show to shield against toxic snowfall.",
      "\u201cThere is a general policy these days that the state shouldn't take care of its citizens, which relates to individual freedom,\u201d Dar\u00edn said. But there are many cases where if the state disappears completely, people are left to drift, as if they were shipwrecked.\u201d",
      "As the Netflix series exploded out of the gate, missing-persons flyers for H\u00e9ctor Oesterheld, his daughters and potential grandchildren popped up on billboards for \u201cThe Eternaut\u201d all over Buenos Aires, a reminder of the real-life horror story behind the pulp adventure.",
      "By the time the military junta came to power in 1976, Oesterheld, 58, had become known as a committed leftist, his four daughters, ranging in age from 19 to 25, had joined a far-left guerilla group and the whole family had turned into a target of Latin America\u2019s deadliest dictatorship.",
      "Two of Oesterheld's daughters were pregnant at the time of their kidnapping. To this day, no one knows what happened to their unborn children, but they are believed to be among the estimated 500 newborns snatched from their parents and handed over to childless military officers, their true identities erased.",
      "The three surviving members of the Oesterheld family have never stopped searching. Mart\u00edn Oesterheld's grandmother, Elsa, who raised him after his mother was killed, banded together with other women dedicated to finding their missing grandchildren. They became known as the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo.",
      "Seizing on national interest in the TV series, the Grandmothers this month issued public appeals for help finding the disappeared grandchildren.",
      "The response was overwhelming.",
      "\u201cIt was incredible, it went viral,\u201d said Esteban Herrera, who works with the Grandmothers and is still searching for his own missing sibling. \u201cSince it\u2019s a science-fiction series on a platform like Netflix, we\u2019re reaching homes that the Grandmothers perhaps hadn\u2019t before.\u201d",
      "The outpouring of emails and calls raised more questions than answers. Reaching out were hundreds of Argentine viewers newly determined to find their own disappeared relatives or suddenly skeptical about the legality of their own adoptions.",
      "\u201cThe Eternaut\u2019 is a living memory, a classic story that's passed down from generation to generation,\u201d said Mart\u00edn Oesterheld. \u201cFor it to be embraced by so many people in this way ... there is no greater social commentary.\u201d",

      "ASEAN countries, many of which rely on exports to the U.S., are reeling from tariffs imposed by the Trump administration ranging from 10% to 49%. Six of the association's 10 member nations were among the worst-hit with tarrifs ranging from 32% to 49%.",

      "Noboa, 37, who wore a presidential sash over his chest, was sworn in alongside his Vice President Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Pinto and their terms will run until May 2029.",
      "The young president, who has become known for his fight against a surge of armed group violence in the South American country, pledged in his inauguration speech to continue to tackle corruption, drug trafficking and violent crime. He also swore to implement reforms and said he would lay \u201ca solid foundation for job creation and investment\" by working with Ecuador's private sector.",
      "\u201cWe are at the doorstep of four years of progress,\u201d he said.",

      "Noboa was re-elected on April 13 in a run-off against left-wing candidate Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez, who has made repeated allegations of electoral fraud.

      "Maintaining that majority will be crucial for Noboa in pushing through his agenda, including a crime-fighting bill marked as \u201curgent\u201d for its economic implications. The proposal has already drawn criticism from the opposition.",
      "Juan Francisco Camino, a professor at the Equinoctial Technological University, said Noboa's tight majority could easily shift the balance.",
      "\u201cJust one lost vote from his allies could paralyze his plans,\" Camino said in an interview.",
      "Asked whether Noboa might change his governing approach in this new term, Camino predicted continuity, especially with the government\u2019s focus on using state power to fight crime, which he said \u201csells legitimacy.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV's record handling sex abuse cases while he was an Augustinian superior and bishop in Peru has come under renewed scrutiny since his election May 8",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV made plenty of enemies helping dismantle a powerful Catholic movement whose leaders physically, sexually, spiritually and psychologically abused members. As Leo's past record of handling clergy sexual abuse cases comes under scrutiny, his biggest defenders are the victims of the group, known as the Sodalitium Christiane Vitae.",
      "These survivors say that starting in 2018, when the pope was a bishop in Peru, Robert Prevost met with them. He took their claims seriously when few others did, got the Vatican involved and worked concretely to provide financial reparations for the harm they had endured. They credit him with helping arrange the key 2022 meeting with Pope Francis that triggered a Vatican investigation into the group that resulted in its suppression earlier this year.",
      "\u201cWhat can I say about him? That he listened to me,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Rey de Castro, a teacher who spent 18 years in the Sodalitium as the personal cook for its leader, Luis Fernando Figari. \u201cIt seems obvious for a priest. But that\u2019s not the case, because the Sodalitium was very powerful.\u201d",
      "Figari, a Peruvian layman, founded the Sodalitium in Peru in 1971 as a lay community to recruit \u201csoldiers for God.\u201d It was one of several Catholic societies born as a conservative reaction to the left-leaning liberation theology movement that swept through Latin America starting in the 1960s. At its height, the group counted about 1,000 core members and several times that in three other branches across South America and the United States. It was enormously influential in Peru and has its U.S. base in Denver.",
      "Starting in 2000, stories about Figari\u2019s twisted practices began to filter out in Peru when a former member wrote a series of articles in the magazine Gente. A formal accusation was lodged with the Lima archdiocese in 2011 but neither the local church nor the Holy See took concrete action until former member Pedro Salinas and journalist Paola Ugaz exposed the practices of Sodalitium in their 2015 book \u201cHalf Monks, Half Soldiers.\u201d",
      "In 2017, a report commissioned by the group\u2019 s new leadership determined that the charismatic Figari was \u201cnarcissistic, paranoid, demeaning, vulgar, vindictive, manipulative, racist, sexist, elitist and obsessed with sexual issues and the sexual orientation of SCV members.\u201d The report found that Figari sodomized his recruits and forced them to fondle him and one another, that he liked to watch them \u201cexperience pain, discomfort and fear,\u201d and humiliated them in front of others to enhance his control over them.",
      "Yet when members found the courage to escape and denounce the abuses they suffered, they say they often met a wall of silence and inaction from the Peruvian Catholic hierarchy and the Holy See. Both were slow to act against a movement that had been formally approved by St. John Paul II's Vatican, which had looked fondly on conservative, wealthy movements in Latin America, like the similarly-disgraced Mexican-based Legion of Christ.",
      "But not Prevost, whom Francis made bishop of Chiclayo, Peru in 2014 and later was elected vice president of the Peruvian bishops conference. He headed the bishops\u2019 commission created to listen to victims of abuse, and became a critical \u201cbridge\u201d between victims and Sodalitium, the victims say.",
      "Rey de Castro, the former Figari cook who got out in 2014 and now teaches public policy to Peruvian police, turned to Prevost in 2021. He had been critical of a 2016 Sodalitium reparations program that, according to the group, provided some $6.5 million in academic, therapeutic and financial support to nearly 100 Sodalitium victims over the years.",
      "He and Prevost met in the offices of the Peruvian bishops conference and stayed in touch via text message up until Prevost's election as pope.",
      "From the start, Rey de Castro said, \u201cPrevost was very clear in saying \u2018For me, Sodalitium doesn\u2019t have a charism,\u2019\u201d the church term for the fundamental inspiration and reason for a religious movement to exist. After their 2021 meeting, Prevost helped arrange a confidential settlement with Sodalitium, he said.",
      "\u201cFor Prevost to get the Sodalitium to do something just was exceptional, which was more or less what happened,\u201d he said in an interview in Lima.",
      "Salinas and Ugaz, for their part, say Prevost also stepped in when the Sodalitium started retaliating against them with legal action for their continued investigative reporting on the group. After the Sodalitium\u2019s archbishop of Piura, Jos\u00e9 Eguren, sued Salinas in 2018 for defamation, Prevost and the Vatican\u2019s ambassador to Peru helped craft a statement from the Peruvian bishops conference backing the journalists.",
      "\u201cIt was the first time that anyone had done anything against the Sodalitium publicly,\u201d Ugaz said. \u201cAnd not only did they make this declaration, but they communicated with Francis, told him what was happening and Francis got mad.\u201d",
      "Ugaz and Salinas provided years of emails, text messages and anecdotes dating back to 2018 to demonstrate how committed Prevost was to their cause. While not all his initiatives succeeded, Prevost stepped in at critical junctions.",
      "\u201cI assure you I share your concern and we are looking for the best way to get the letter directly to the pope,\u201d Prevost wrote one victim Dec. 11, 2018, about getting a letter from Sodalitium victims to Francis.",
      "\u201cI will continue working so that there is justice for all those who suffered at the hands of Sodalitium,\u201d Prevost wrote another victim on Dec. 23, 2018. \u201cI ask forgiveness for the errors of the church.\u201d",
      "After the Sodalitium criticism accelerated against Ugaz and Salinas, Prevost helped arrange for Ugaz to meet with Francis at the Vatican on Nov. 10, 2022, during which she laid out her findings and convinced Francis to send his top sex crimes investigators to Peru.",
      "Their 2023 investigation uncovered physical abuses \u201cincluding with sadism and violence, \u201d sect-like abuses of conscience, spiritual abuse, abuses of authority including the hacking of Ugaz\u2019s communications and economic abuses in administering church money. The probe also identified a publicity campaign some Sodalitium members had mounted against critics.",
      "The investigation resulted in Francis taking a series of initiatives, starting with the April 2024 resignation of Eguren which Prevost handled. It continued with the expulsion of Figari, Eguren and nine others, and finally the formal dissolution of the Sodalitium in April this year, just before Francis died.",
      "The Sodalitium has accepted its dissolution, asked forgiveness for \u201cthe mistreatment and abuse committed within our community\u201d and for the pain caused the entire church.",
      "\u201cWith sorrow and obedience, we accept this decision, specifically approved by Pope Francis, which brings our society to an end,\u201d the group said in an April statement after the decree of dissolution was signed.",
      "There was no reply to an email sent to the group with specific questions about Prevost's role.",
      "Leo\u2019s record of handling sex abuse cases while he was an Augustinian superior and bishop in Peru has come under renewed scrutiny since his election May 8. And overall, one of the biggest challenges facing history\u2019s first American pope will be how he addresses the clergy abuse scandal, which has traumatized thousands of people around the world and devastated the Catholic hierarchy\u2019s credibility.",
      "The idea Prevost might have enemies was crystalized in a recent podcast hosted by Salinas on Peru\u2019s La Mula streaming platform. While Salinas dedicated most of the hourlong episode to reading aloud seven years of glowing correspondence between Sodalitium victims and Prevost, he also said Prevost had become the target of a defamation campaign questioning his handling of past abuse cases. Salinas blamed the campaign on Sodalitium's supporters trying to discredit him.",
      "One of the cases in question is Prevost\u2019s handling of abuse allegations made in 2022 by three sisters against one of his priests in Chiclayo. The diocese and Vatican say Prevost did everything he was supposed to do, including removing the priest from ministry, sending a preliminary investigation to the Vatican\u2019s sex crimes office, offering psychological help to the victims and suggesting they go to Peruvian authorities, who archived the case because it happened too long ago.",
      "Nine days after Peruvian authorities closed the case, Prevost was named to head the Vatican's office for bishops and left the diocese.",
      "The Vatican archived the case for lack of evidence, but it was reopened in 2023 after it gained traction in the media. Victims\u2019 groups are demanding an accounting from Leo.",
      "Salinas, Ugaz and even some in the Vatican believe Sodalitium supporters fueled publicity about the case and its reopening to discredit Prevost. They note that the victims\u2019 lawyer is a former Augustinian antagonist of Prevost who has since been defrocked and barred from presenting himself as a canon lawyer in Peru.",
      "Anne Barrett-Doyle, of the online abuse database BishopAccountability.org, said even if the Chiclayo case is being exploited by Sodalitium supporters, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean that he handled the case correctly.\u201d",
      "\u201cBoth things could be true: that then-Bishop Prevost acted valiantly on behalf of the victims of the Sodalitium and that he didn\u2019t do nearly enough to investigate the allegations in Chiclayo,\u201d she said.",
      "Signing off his podcast, Salinas read aloud a WhatsApp message he had exchanged with Prevost on Oct. 16, 2024, when he warned him to beware of retaliation from the group.",
      "\u201cI have it very much on my mind,\u201d Prevost wrote.",

      "Only about 900 people in the world speak Cypriot Maronite Arabic",
      "KORMAKITIS, Cyprus -- Ash dangled precariously from Iosif Skordis' cigarette as he reminisced with fellow villagers in a language on the edge of extinction, one that partly traces its roots to the language Jesus Christ once spoke.",
      "The 97-year-old Skordis is one of only 900 people in the world who speak Cypriot Maronite Arabic, or Sanna. Today, his village of Kormakitis is the last bastion of a language once spoken by tens of thousands of people across dozens of villages.",
      "The tongue, an offshoot of Syrian Arabic that has absorbed some Greek, has been passed from generation to generation in this windswept community in Cyprus. Until less than two decades ago, there was no written script, or even an alphabet, since parents transmitted it to children in conversation. Only a handful of people are trained to teach it.",
      "Sanna is at risk of disappearing, according to the Council of Europe\u2019s minority language experts. One Indigenous language dies every two weeks, the United Nations estimates, diminishing the tapestry of human knowledge one strand at a time.",
      "But the 7,500-strong Maronite community in Cyprus is pushing back. With help from the Cypriot government and the European Union, it has built schools, created a Sanna alphabet to publish textbooks and begun classes to keep the language alive and thriving.",
      "\u201cSanna \u2026 is undoubtedly one of the most distinguishing features of our cultural identity,\u201d said Yiannakis Moussas, the Maronite community\u2019s representative in the Cypriot legislature. He spoke in the Kormakitis coffeehouse adorned with soccer trophies and banners emblazoned with a Lebanese cedar.",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s striking evidence of our heritage. The fact that we speak a kind of Arabic over so many centuries makes it clear that we descend from areas of Syria and Lebanon.\u201d",
      "The language was brought to Cyprus by waves of Arab Christians fleeing persecution by invading Arab Muslim fighters in what is now Syria, Lebanon and Israel, starting as early as the 8th century.",
      "Sanna at its root is a semitic language that, unlike other Arabic dialects, contains traces of the Aramaic that was spoken by populations prior to the Arab invasion of the Levant, according to University of Cyprus linguistics professor Marilena Kariolemou, who leads the team responsible for the language\u2019s revitalization.",
      "That\u2019s because the Maronite community in Cyprus was isolated from other Arabic-speaking populations.",
      "But as Maronites increasingly interacted with the island\u2019s majority Greek-speaking population and became bilingual, Sanna evolved to incorporate several Greek words, adding to its uniqueness among the many Arabic dialects.",
      "According to Kariolemou, Sanna contains five vowels similar to Greek and another three similar to Aramaic, while consonants whose sounds are formed in the back of the throat have diminished, likely because of the Greek influence. Sanna also adopted Greek syntax, she said.",
      "Until the mid-1970s, the Maronite community was largely centered around four villages: Asomatos, Ayia Marina, Karpasia and Kormakitis as the cultural center.",
      "But the 1974 Turkish invasion that split Cyprus into a breakaway Turkish Cypriot north and a Greek Cypriot south, where the internationally recognized government is seated, saw most Maronites dispersed throughout the south.",
      "Asomatos and Ayia Marina are empty of Maronite inhabitants and are now Turkish army camps.",
      "Moussas, the community representative, said the consequences of 1974 were \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the Maronites as they gravitated toward the island\u2019s major cities, putting their culture and language at risk as children attended Greek-speaking schools and intermarriage with Greek Cypriots increased.",
      "It\u2019s said that currently, only one in five Maronite marriages are between members of the community.",
      "That left Kormakitis as the linguistic \u201chive\u201d for Cypriot Maronite Arabic, only spoken by residents over 50, according to retired teacher Ilias Zonias. Born in Kormakitis, Zonias is the only native Sanna speaker qualified to teach the language.",
      "Kormakitis was a closed society in which residents spoke Sanna, while their kids went to school not knowing Greek. That\u2019s how the language was preserved, Zonias said.",
      "Still, speakers after 1974 began to dwindle until around the turn of the millennium, when the Maronite community with the help of the Cypriot government increased efforts to save the language.",
      "Cyprus\u2019 2004 membership in the EU was a milestone for Sanna as the bloc poured resources into safeguarding Indigenous minority languages, a designation that Cypriot authorities had bestowed.",
      "Kariolemou said her team in 2013 set up a recorded archive of spoken Sanna, some 280 hours long, for further study.",
      "A 27-letter alphabet was created in mostly Latin characters, thanks mainly to the work of linguist Alexander Borg. Grammar was formulated and refined, enabling the publication of books for teaching Sanna.",
      "Language courses are in their early stages, Skordis said, with about 100 children and adults in classes in Kormakitis and the Saint Maronas primary school in the Nicosia suburb of Lakatamia. A summer language camp for children and adults in Kormakitis has also been created.",
      "An initiative is underway for native-born speakers \u2014 primarily Kormakitis residents \u2014 to learn how to teach Sanna.",
      "At Ayios Maronas primary school, 20 kindergarten-age children are learning the language with books containing QR codes that can be scanned so students can follow an audio adaptation on school-provided tablets.",
      "But for Sanna to have a real future, there is no substitute for young families returning in large numbers to Kormakitis, where the language can be taught in the newly built, EU-funded school, Moussas said.",
      "Community leaders, however, aren\u2019t pleased with the low number of people expressing interest. Moussas said community leaders and the Cypriot government are looking into offering incentives, primarily to make it easier to find housing.",
      "For Zonias, keeping the language alive for the ages would be the crowning achievement of his career.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the last teacher of Sanna,\u201d he said.",

      "Younger politicians, including the governors of Nairobi and Mombasa, have begun speaking publicly about weight loss. Obesity contributes to non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, which have become Kenya's leading cause of death. The health ministry says they are responsible for 39% of fatalities annually.",
      "In a country where the government has said almost a third of the population is still unable to fulfill food needs, 13% adults are obese, according to the 2025 World Obesity Atlas. The contrast highlights the country's growing inequality and the popularity of fast and processed foods by those with rising incomes.",
      "Perceptions about obesity can affect financial and other decisions. In neighboring Uganda, microfinance institutions vetted loan applicants based on their weight, and those overweight were considered more able to repay loans, according to a study published by the American Economic Review in 2023.",
      "\u201cMost people feel like when I start making money, I have to look like the money itself by being fat or obese,\u201d said Kenyan nutritionist Felix Okoth. \u201cThey however don\u2019t realize that they are predisposing themselves to these lifestyle conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.\u201d",

      "Some are trying to change the conversation around weight. A former senator in Kenya, Cleophas Malala, has described how a 15-hour flight to the U.S. left him in pain and how doctors advised him to reduce.",
      "From a starting weight of 138 kilograms (304 pounds), he embarked on a non-solid diet for 90 days. Though he didn\u2019t disclose his current weight, before-and-after photos show him noticeably slimmer.",

      "\u201cThese discussions are held in parliament where most MPs have big bellies, and so admitting that it concerns them, too, would be a good place to start,\u201d he said,",
      "Kenyan President William Ruto has spoken publicly about the need to be fit for work. He had to reassure Kenyans in 2023 that he was okay after online speculation about his health following weight loss.",
      "\u201cI decided to cut it down because the task ahead was not easy,\u201d he told journalists.",
      "Increasing incomes, proliferation of fast-food outlets in urban areas, sedentary lifestyles and lack of infrastructure that promotes physical activity have been named as probable causes of rising obesity in developing countries.",
      "\u201cWe need to make sure that when we move away from lack of food, we are not going to the wrong food groups,\u201d said a Kampala-based doctor, Miriam Laker Oketta.",

      "Gyms, weight loss drugs and surgeries are being increasingly advertised in Kenya.",
      "But approaches such as the Ozempic weight-loss drug have left some users like Caroline Havi dissatisfied. She said she turned to a one-meal-a-day diet instead and hopes to eventually reduce her weight from 105 kilograms to 70 \u201cwithout spending so much.\"",
      "In South Africa, obesity-related deaths due to non-communicable diseases have surpassed HIV-related deaths, according to the WHO. The 2025 World Obesity Atlas said 32% of South Africa's adults are obese.",

      "\u201cThe instrumental use of criminal law by the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office appears to amount to a systematic pattern of intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights, targeted at specific groups,\u201d Satterthwaite wrote in her preliminary report. \u201cThis persecution appears to be intensifying, as those who have sought to end impunity and corruption, defend human rights, or speak out against abuses of power increasingly face digital harassment, threats, and criminal charges.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Friday that U.S. Steel will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh as part of what he called a \u201cplanned partnership\u201d between the iconic American steelmaker and Japan-based Nippon Steel, which has sought to buy it.",
      "Nippon Steel's nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden and, after Trump became president, subject to another national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.",
      "Trump said in a statement that \u201cafter much consideration and negotiation, US Steel will REMAIN in America, and keep its Headquarters in the Great City of Pittsburgh.\u201d",
      "What Trump called a \u201cplanned partnership\u201d will create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy, he said, although it wasn't clear what the terms of the deal would be or who would own U.S. Steel under the arrangement.",

The victims in this crash included a family from Spain who was celebrating the ninth birthday of one of their children.",

      "\u2014 Two small planes collided midair near an Arizona airport in mid-February, killing two people who were on one of the aircraft. Following the collision, one plane landed uneventfully, but the other hit the ground near a runway and caught fire. The crash happened at Marana Regional Airport near Tucson.",
      "\u2014 A small commuter plane crashed in western Alaska in early February, killing all 10 people on board. The crash was one of the deadliest in the state in 25 years. Radar data indicated that the plane rapidly lost elevation and speed. The U.S. Coast Guard was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft.",
      "\u2014 A medical transport plane that had just taken off plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood in late January, killing all six people on board and two people on the ground. About two dozen people were also hurt. The National Transportation Safety Board said its cockpit voice recorder likely hadn't been functioning for years. The crew made no distress calls to air traffic control.",

All but two of the 181 people aboard were killed in one of that country\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "\u2014 The American Airlines plane that caught fire at Denver International Airport in March had been diverted there because the crew reported engine vibrations.

      "\u2014 A Delta Air Lines jet flipped over while landing at Toronto\u2019s Pearson Airport in February. All 80 people on board survived, but some people received minor injuries.

Investigators said when trying to determine the cause, they would consider the weather conditions and the possibility of human error.",

There were no reported injuries. Multiple members of Congress were aboard one of the flights.",

      "The supermarket chain Publix has recalled fruit and vegetable baby food sold in eight states because product testing found elevated levels of lead, according to federal health officials.",
      "Publix recalled 4-ounce Greenwise Pear, Kiwi, Spinach & Pea Baby Food pouches sold at more than 1,400 stores.",
      "The pouches were produced by Bowman Andros, a French company with a manufacturing plant in Mount Jackson, Virginia, according to the company's website. Publix issued the voluntary recall on May 9, but it wasn't added to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recall list until late Thursday.",
      "The potential contamination was flagged by officials in North Carolina, the state that first identified a 2023 lead poisoning outbreak linked to tainted applesauce pouches that sickened more than 500 U.S. children.",
      "Routine sampling of the baby food pouches found lead levels at 13.4 parts per billion, according to North Carolina agriculture officials. That exceeds the FDA's recommended limit of 10 parts per billion for such products intended for babies and young children.",
      "Publix said all the potentially contaminated products have been removed from store shelves. No illnesses have been reported, the company said. Customers can return the pouches to local stores for full refund.",
      "This is the second baby food pouch recall because of potential lead contamination in two months. In March, Target recalled more than 25,000 packages of its store brand Good & Gather Baby Pea, Zucchini, Kale & Thyme Vegetable Puree because of elevated lead levels.",
      "North Carolina collaborates with the FDA to conduct routine testing of food products, officials said.",
      "In 2023, state health officials investigated reports of lead poisoning in four children who consumed WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree. Those findings led to the detection of a nationwide outbreak linked to the pouches, which were widely sold in Dollar Tree and other stores. Tests showed they contained lead at levels 2,000 times higher than the FDA's maximum recommended level, as well as chromium.",
      "Federal health officials eventually identified 566 cases of confirmed, probable or suspected cases of lead poisoning tied to the pouches in 44 states.",

      "House Republicans are jubilant about muscling through President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d tax and immigration package by a single vote",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans were jubilant after muscling through President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d tax and immigration package by a single vote. But across the Capitol, senators were more cautious.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune can afford to lose three Republican senators and still pass the bill, and there are more than that, right now, who have problems with it. Like the House, he will have to balance the concerns from moderate and conservative members of his conference.",
      "Republicans\u2019 aspirational deadline is July 4, ahead of a potential debt default. Thune said groups of senators had already been meeting to discuss the legislation and that they would want to take some time to review it. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll put our stamp on it,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see how it goes,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWhat does it take to get to 51?\u201d",
      "A look at a few of the potential sticking points in the Senate:",
      "Several Republican senators have said the House\u2019s multi-trillion-dollar tax package doesn't have enough savings. Thune said many in his GOP conference favor the tax breaks in the bill but \u201cwhen it comes to the spending side of the equation, this is a unique moment in time, in history, where we have the House and the Senate and the White House, and an opportunity to do something meaningful about how to control government spending.\u201d",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., a sharp critic of the House bill, wants the United States to go back to pre-pandemic spending levels. He has indicated he would be a no on the bill as it stands now, and he says he has at least three other senators aligned with him.",
      "Senate Republicans are generally on board with stricter work requirements for older Medicaid recipients that make up much of the bill\u2019s $700 billion savings from the program. But Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Susan Collins of Maine, among others, have voiced concerns about other changes in the bill that could potentially cut funding to rural hospitals or increase copays and other health care costs for recipients.",
      "The senators could have a powerful ally in Trump, who has frequently said he doesn\u2019t want cuts to Medicaid, even as he\u2019s endorsed the House bill. Hawley said he talked to Trump this week on the phone and \u201chis exact words were, \u2018Don\u2019t touch it, Josh.\u2019\u201d",
      "Others have been wary of the House bill\u2019s effort to shift some costs of the food stamp program to states, potentially a major issue for some red states that have high numbers of food aid recipients. The House bill saves $290 billion from the food aid, and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman said the Senate savings will be \u201cprobably be a little bit lower.\u201d",
      "Thune said this week that \u201cone of the principal differences\u201d between the House and Senate is that Republican senators want to make many of the tax cuts permanent while the House bill has shorter time frames for many of its cuts \u2014 including no taxes on tips, overtime pay, car-loan interest and others.",
      "Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo said Thursday that trying to make some of the cuts permanent is \u201can objective right now.\"",
      "One of the biggest questions for the Senate: whether the tax breaks really need to be offset by cuts elsewhere.",
      "To offset the costs of lost tax revenue, House Republicans have proposed more than $1 trillion in spending reductions across Medicaid, food stamps and green energy program rollbacks. However, Republicans in the Senate do not believe there is a cost associated with permanently extending the existing taxes, setting up a political and procedural showdown ahead.",
      "The House bill includes a $4 trillion increase in the debt limit. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the United States is on track to run out of money to pay its bills as early as August without congressional action.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he won\u2019t support the bill if the debt ceiling increase is included. He said he\u2019s willing to consider it if it\u2019s taken out.",
      "But most Republican senators want it to avoid a separate fight that would require 60 votes in the Senate. Texas Sen. John Cornyn said that if they deal with the debt ceiling outside of the legislation then they would have to \u201cpay a king\u2019s ransom\u201d to Democrats to get enough votes.",
      "Several Republican senators have said they are concerned about House provisions that repeal or phase out clean energy tax credits passed in 2022 that have spurred investment in many states.",
      "Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Moran wrote Thune a letter last month arguing that removing the credits could \"create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.\u201d",
      "The House bill would ban states and localities from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade, giving the federal government more control over the policy. It\u2019s an approach that has been favored by the AI industry but has drawn concern from members on both sides of the aisle.",
      "And even if it has enough support, the provision may not pass muster from the Senate parliamentarian because it\u2019s unlikely to have impact on the federal budget.",
      "With a narrow margin for victory and only 53 Republicans in the Senate, every senator\u2019s top priority takes on outsize importance. South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds said he supports the House bill but that the way that it deals with spectrum auctions \u2014 selling off telecommunications signal rights \u2014 is a \u201cdealbreaker\u201d for him. He said he\u2019s in talks with other senators on the issue.",
      "Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said one of his main goals is that they include money for certain farm safety net programs and set up passage for a broader farm bill later this year.",
      "\u201cIn the end, we have to have 50 plus one supporting it,\u201d Hoeven said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got some work to do.\"",

    "story": [
      "News that air traffic controllers directing planes into New Jersey\u2019s busiest airport twice lost both their radar and radios is alarming",
      "It was alarming news when air traffic controllers directing planes coming and going around one of the nation's busiest airports repeatedly lost their radar and radio communications, but pilots, independent air safety experts and the Federal Aviation Administration say other redundant systems kept planes from colliding.",
      "\u201cI think the risk of a collision or an incident was increased, but not significantly because of the redundancy in the aviation system,\u201d said Jeff Guzzetti, a former accident investigator for the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "Crashes like January's deadly collision between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter usually have different causes \u2014 a combination of many things that go wrong, he says.",
      "Here's a look at what happened in Newark \u2014 and how key pieces of the safety net protected planeloads of people.",
      "The radar and communications systems that a terminal control team in Philadelphia relies on to direct planes in and out of Newark International Airport simultaneously failed twice in the past month for brief periods. The main line that carries the radar signal from another FAA facility in New York failed, and the backup line didn\u2019t work immediately. The system relies in part on aging copper wires and even when there are fiber optic lines, the signal has to be slowed down when it reaches the facility because the FAA computers are so old they can't handle all the data at full speed.",
      "As a result, the controllers were suddenly unable to see or communicate with planes coming from or going to Newark for as long as 90 seconds on April 28 and May 9. Their radar screens showing each flights in motion suddenly went black. Their radio connections went silent.",
      "The main line failed a third time May 11, but the backup system worked and the radar stayed online. The FAA said a fourth outage Monday knocked out radio communications for two seconds, but the radar stayed online.",
      "After the initial outage, the already shorthanded control center in Philadelphia lost five to seven controllers to trauma leave. Newark's terminal control team could no longer manage a full schedule of handoffs with the airport's control tower, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations and delays that rippled across the nation's airlines. The FAA then imposed safety limits, allowing no more than 28 arrivals and 28 departures every hour. Before, 38 or 39 flights typically took off and landed hourly.",
      "When air traffic controllers lose the ability to see or speak to airborne planes, they can try text messaging the pilots via data link systems or try high-powered portable radios. An emergency radio frequency might also be an alternative if main communications are down. Tower controllers have high-powered light guns to send a green or red signal to pilots to let them know if they are clear to land even if they can't talk to them over the radio.",
      "And the entire air traffic control system is built on an overlapping network of radar sites. So if a terminal control team like the one in Philadelphia loses its communications, a controller in a radar center that normally directs planes at higher altitudes might step in. If some other controller in the area hears a pilot broadcasting on an emergency frequency, they too can relay a message.",
      "During these Philadelphia outages, voice communications came back online first while the radar took another minute to reboot, and controllers were able to hand off planes without having to resort to some of those other options.",
      "In a May 9 recording captured by www.liveATC.net, a controller can be heard saying \u201cFedEx 1989. I'm going to hand you off here. Our scopes just went black again. If you care about this, contact your airline and try to get some pressure for them to fix this stuff.\u201d The pilot acknowledged that and wished the controllers \u201cgood luck guys\u201d before switching frequencies.",
      "Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau has tried to reassure the public that all these backups and limits on the number of flights keep flying safe, despite these problems that have exposed how fragile and outdated some air traffic control systems have become.",
      "\u201cWhen disruptions occur at any airport because of equipment issues or staffing, the FAA will always ensure safety by slowing down airport arrivals and departures and reducing congestion,\u201d Rocheleau posted on X. \u201cWe keep the flying public safe because there are redundancies built throughout the entire system used by pilots, technicians and air traffic controllers.\u201d",
      "Every pilot is trained on what to do if they can't talk to the air traffic controllers, and modern passenger jets have their own backup systems. Airline pilots all regularly get refresher training emphasizing safety.",
      "Capt. Miles Morgan oversees all training for 17,000 United Airlines pilots at a facility in Denver filled with simulators and classrooms. He said losing communications is rare, but it's something pilots prepare for, as most training focuses on what to do if something goes wrong.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been flying for 30 years. I\u2019ve got almost 18,000 hours in United airplanes -- jets, and I\u2019ve lost communication one time,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt really ended up not being that big of a deal. I just went to the emergency frequency, got a different channel, and contacted a different facility to get back into communication.\u201d",
      "In addition to multiple communications systems, planes are equipped with collision avoidance technology that shows pilots where all the other planes are moving around them. These systems alert pilots to an approaching aircraft's trajectory and can recommend evasive action to prevent a collision if planes get too close, Morgan said.",
      "Allied Pilots Association union spokesman Capt. Dennis Tajer said that when pilots lose contact with controllers, their first action is to continue on their last-directed path. If the outage continues, they'll broadcast their position to every other plane in the area \u2014 much like pilots do at small airports that don\u2019t have a control tower \u2014 as they follow their flight plans.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not to downplay the seriousness of communication failure or radar outages, but it\u2019s to recognize that we have procedures, we trained to those procedures, and we have additional equipment that can only enhance the safety margin while we deal with that scenario,\u201d Tajer said.",

    "story": [
      "A coalition of Louisiana environmental groups is suing the state over a law they say violates their free speech rights by restricting them from sharing information about air quality",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- On days of heavy pollution in Sulphur, a southwest Louisiana town surrounded by more than 16 industrial plants, Cynthia \u201cCindy\u201d Robertson once flew a red flag outside her home so her community knew they faced health hazards from high levels of soot and other pollutants.",
      "But she stopped flying the flag after Louisiana passed a law last May that threatened fines of up to $1 million for sharing information about air quality that did not meet strict standards.",
      "On Thursday, Robertson's group Micah 6:8 Mission and other Louisiana environmental organizations sued the state in federal court over the law they say restricts their free speech and undermines their ability to promote public health in heavily industrialized communities.",
      "When neighbors asked where the flags went, \"I\u2019d tell them, \u2019The state of Louisiana says we can\u2019t tell y\u2019all that stuff,' \u201d Robertson said.",
      "While the state has argued the law ensures that accurate data is shared with the public, environmental groups like Micah 6:8 Mission believed it was intended to censor them with \u201conerous restrictions\u201d and violates their free speech rights, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Despite having received Environmental Protection Agency funding to monitor Sulphur's pollution using high quality air monitors for several years, Michah 6:8 Mission stopped posting data on the group's social media after the law was signed last May, Robertson said.",
      "While federal law requires publicly disclosed monitoring of major pollutants, fence-line communities in Louisiana have long sought data on their exposure to hazardous and likely carcinogenic chemicals like chloroprene and ethylene oxide, which were not subject to these same regulations.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the EPA tightened regulations for these pollutants, though the Trump administration has committed to rolling them back.",
      "The Biden administration's EPA also injected funding to support community-based air monitoring, especially in neighborhoods on the \u201cfence-line\u201d with industrial plants that emitted pollutants that they were not required to publicly monitor under federal law. Some groups say they lack confidence in the data the state does provide and embraced the chance to monitor the air themselves with federal funding.",
      "\u201cThese programs help detect pollution levels in areas of the country not well served by traditional and costly air monitoring systems,\u201d the lawsuit stated.",
      "In response to the influx of grassroots air monitoring, Louisiana's Legislature passed the Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act, or CAMRA, which requires that community groups that monitor pollutants \u201cfor the purpose of alleging violations or noncompliance\u201d of federal law must follow EPA standards, including approved equipment that can costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.",
      "\u201cYou can't talk about air quality unless you're using the equipment that they want you to use,\u201d said David Bookbinder, director of law and policy at the Environmental Integrity Project, which represents the plaintiffs. He added there was no need for community groups to purchase such expensive equipment when cheaper technology could provide \u201cperfectly adequate results ... to be able to tell your community, your family, whether or not the air they're breathing is safe.\u201d",
      "Community groups sharing information based on cheaper air monitoring equipment that did not meet these requirements could face penalties of $32,500 a day and up to $1 million for intentional violations, according to analysis from the Environmental Integrity Project.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a small nonprofit, we couldn\u2019t afford to pay one day's worth of that,\u201d Robertson said. \"And the way the law is written, it\u2019s so ambiguous, you don\u2019t really know what you can and can\u2019t do.\"",
      "There is no known instance in which the state has pursued these penalties, but community groups say the law has a chilling effect on their work.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this was very clear: to silence the science, preventing people from doing anything with it, sharing it in any form,\u201d said Caitlion Hunter, director of research and policy for Rise St. James, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure how regulating community air monitoring programs \u2018violates their constitutional rights\u2019,\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill countered in a written statement.",
      "Industry groups are excluded from the law's requirements, the lawsuit notes.",
      "The law presumes \u201cthat air monitoring information lacks accuracy if disseminated by community air monitoring groups, but not by industry participants or the state,\u201d the complaint states.",

      "Brazil-based meat giant JBS hopes an upcoming shareholder vote will put it one step closer to a listing on the New York Stock Exchange",
      "Making meat is a messy business. But for Brazilian meat giant JBS, getting approval to trade its shares on the New York Stock Exchange has been even messier.",
      "Environmentalists, animal rights groups, U.S. lawmakers and even some of its own investors have tried to stop a U.S. listing for JBS, noting the company\u2019s long record of corruption, monopolistic behavior and environmental destruction.",
      "But JBS has persevered, saying dual listings in Sao Paulo and New York would attract new investors and better reflect its global portfolio. Late last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission granted the company\u2019s request to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "JBS is one of the world\u2019s largest food companies, with more than 250 production facilities in 17 countries. Half of its annual revenue comes from the U.S., where it has more than 72,000 employees. It\u2019s America\u2019s top beef producer and it\u2019s second-largest producer of poultry and pork.",
      "On Friday, JBS\u2019 minority shareholders \u2013 who hold 30% of its shares \u2013 are scheduled to vote on the dual-listing plan. If they approve it, the company could list its shares in New York as early as next month.",
      "Early vote totals, which JBS released Thursday in a filing in Brazil, showed that 52% of shareholders opposed the plan. But there were many more votes to be counted, so the outcome was far from clear.",
      "Last fall, 20 environmental organizations \u2014 including Mighty Earth, Greenpeace and Rainforest Action Network \u2014 signed an open letter to JBS investors opposing the listing, saying it would put the climate at greater risk.",
      "Glass Lewis, an influential independent investor advisory firm, was also among those recommending that shareholders reject the plan.",
      "In its report, Glass Lewis said the recent return of brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista to the JBS board should concern investors. The brothers, who are the sons of JBS\u2019 founder, were briefly jailed in Brazil in 2017 on bribery and corruption charges.",
      "\u201cIn our view, the involvement of the company and of Joesley and Wesley Batista in multiple high-profile scandals has tarnished the company\u2019s reputation, undermining stakeholder trust and posing a significant risk to its competitive position,\u201d Glass Lewis said.",
      "Glass Lewis also objected to the company\u2019s plan for dual share classes, which would give the Batistas and other controlling shareholders more voting power.",
      "In its response to Glass Lewis' report, JBS said it has established more stringent controls and anti-corruption training at the company in recent years. It also said a U.S. listing would ensure more oversight from U.S. authorities.",
      "\u201cWe believe this transaction will increase our visibility in global markets, attract new investors and further strengthen our position as a global food industry leader,\u201d JBS Global CEO Gilberto Tomazoni said in a statement last month when the company announced Friday\u2019s vote.",
      "But many U.S. lawmakers also aren't convinced JBS belongs on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "In a letter sent last week to JBS, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, noted that Pilgrim\u2019s Pride \u2014 a U.S. company owned by JBS \u2014 was the largest single donor to President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, with a $5 million gift. The SEC\u2019s approval came just weeks after that donation, Warren said.",
      "\u201cI am concerned Pilgrim\u2019s Pride may have made its contribution to the inaugural fund to curry favor with the Trump administration,\u201d Warren wrote in the letter, which asked the company why the donation was made.",
      "In a statement, JBS said it has a \u201clong bipartisan history of participating in the civic process.\u201d",
      "Warren was also among a bipartisan group of 15 U.S. senators who sent a letter to the SEC in January 2024 urging the agency to reject a U.S. listing for JBS. The senators, a diverse group that rarely agrees on policy, included Republicans Marco Rubio of Florida and Josh Hawley of Missouri, Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey and Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont.",
      "The letter noted that in 2020, J&F Investments, a controlling shareholder of JBS that is owned by the Batista family, pleaded guilty to bribery charges in U.S. federal court and agreed to pay fines of $256 million.",
      "It also said Pilgrim\u2019s Pride pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges in 2021. And it said U.S. Senate investigations found that JBS is \u201cturning a blind eye\u201d to rainforest destruction in the Amazon by its suppliers.",
      "\u201cApproval of JBS\u2019 proposed listing would subject U.S. investors to risk from a company with a history of blatant, systemic corruption, and further entrench its monopoly power and embolden its monopoly practices,\u201d the letter said.",

      "The lawsuit, filed in January, alleged that PepsiCo was giving unfair price advantages to Walmart at the expense of other vendors and consumers. The lawsuit had relied on the rarely enforced 1936 Robinson-Patman Act, which it said prohibits companies from using promotional incentive payments to favor large customers over smaller ones.",
      "When the lawsuit was filed, Democrat Lina Khan was the FTC\u2019s chairwoman, and she was joined in support of the lawsuit by Democratic Commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. At the time, Republican Commissioners Andrew Ferguson and Melissa Holyoak dissented.",

      "Ferguson, who is now the chairman of the FTC, said Thursday that the PepsiCo lawsuit was a \u201cdubious partisan stunt\u201d and FTC staff had more important work to do.",
      "\u201cThe Biden-Harris FTC rushed to authorize this case just three days before President Trump\u2019s inauguration in a nakedly political effort to commit this administration to pursuing little more than a hunch that Pepsi had violated the law,\u201d Ferguson said in a statement.",
      "A message seeking comment was left Thursday with PepsiCo. At the time of the lawsuit, the Purchase, New York-based company said it didn't offer discounts or promotional support to some customers but not others.",

    "story": [
      "Argentina\u2019s government has unveiled an ambitious scheme to bring billions of undeclared U.S. dollars tucked under mattresses or stashed in foreign bank accounts back into the crisis-prone country",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentina's government on Thursday unveiled an ambitious scheme to bring billions of undeclared U.S. dollars tucked under mattresses or stashed in foreign bank accounts back into the crisis-prone country, as libertarian President Javier Milei seeks to boost Argentina's low international currency reserves and stimulate the limping economy.",
      "By eliminating tax reporting requirements, the plan invites savers \u2014 who long have swapped their depreciating pesos for American currency in the country's underground market \u2014 to spend unreported dollars on everyday transactions at home. The government won\u2019t ask questions regarding the source of the repatriated funds, officials promised.",
      "\u201cYour dollars, your decision. What\u2019s yours is yours, not the state\u2019s,\u201d Milei\u2019s presidential spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said in a press conference announcing the policies. \u201cYou can use them however you want, without having to prove where you got them from.\u201d",
      "Milei \u2014 who ran on a controversial campaign pledge to \u201cdollarize\u201d Argentina's troubled economy \u2014 wants a new gush of greenbacks to boost the volume of U.S. dollars in circulation.",
      "Although Argentina's depleted currency reserves sent Milei backpedaling from his initial campaign trail-fervor for \u201cburning down\u201d the central bank and adopting the U.S. dollar as the national currency, these latest measures seek to hasten the country\u2019s transition to a new currency system that would see dollars gradually replacing pesos.",
      "Milei's \u201cendogenous dollarization\u201d scheme would involve fixing the supply of the local currency even as Argentines could use dollars or pesos. He hopes this would encourage Argentines to use their dollar-denominated savings to buy houses and cars as the economy grows and more cash is needed in circulation.",
      "To lay the groundwork, Milei\u2019s government last year imposed a generous tax amnesty for Argentines willing to repatriate capital. In April, it lifted most currency controls as part of a $20 billion bail-out deal with the International Monetary Fund, which conditions its support on the government boosting its scarce foreign reserves.",
      "\u201cYou can spend those dollars without anyone bothering you. So, you go, you want to buy, I don\u2019t know, a house for $200,000, no one has to ask you anything,\u201d Milei told the TV channel of Argentine newspaper La Nacion in an interview Monday.",
      "Over decades of financial turmoil, Argentines have come to depend on U.S. dollars to evade a byzantine system of currency controls, hedge against hyperinflation and protect their nest eggs from government freezes, as has happened several times in the country's recent history, such as during the catastrophic 2001 foreign-debt default.",
      "\u201cThis is how we reached a catastrophic outcome in which 50% of our economy ended up being informal, and the state, like Big Brother, controlled all of its citizens\u2019 transactions, as if they were criminals deserving of punishment,\u201d Adorni said.",
      "Argentina\u2019s official statistics agency estimates that, as of late 2024, Argentine households and firms held more than $270 billion outside their financial system, largely denominated in U.S. currency. While most of the billions are in foreign bank accounts, a significant amount of cash is also stuffed under mattresses and floorboards and in rented safety deposit boxes in underground vaults across the country.",
      "\u201cThose who do this are not criminals,\u201d Economy Minister Luis Caputo said Thursday. \u201cThey are the vast majority of Argentines who have been abused by excessive taxes and controls.",
      "To encourage Argentines to spend their repatriated funds, the new measures scrap strict requirements for businesses and credit card providers to report citizens' purchases to ARCA, Argentina's equivalent of the IRS. They relax strict tax evasion rules so property buyers and public notaries won't need to report transactions. Banks won't be able to request access to clients' tax records.",
      "\u201cIt sounds like an invitation not to pay taxes,\u201d said Ignacio Labaqui, a Buenos Aires-based senior analyst at advisory firm Medley Global Advisors.",
      "That raises concerns about an injection of potentially dirty funds, some of which could be the product of illegal activity. Asked about the danger created by the new fiscal incentives, the IMF sounded a cautious note.",
      "\u201cThe authorities have committed to strengthening financial transparency,\u201d said Julie Kozack, an IMF spokesperson. \u201cAny new measures, including those that may be aimed at encouraging the use of undeclared assets, should be, of course, consistent with these important commitments.\u201d",

      "Excess body weight can raise the risk of certain cancers, leading researchers to wonder whether blockbuster drugs like Wegovy, Ozempic and Zepbound could play a role in cancer prevention.",
      "Now, a study of 170,000 patient records suggests there's a slightly lower risk of obesity-related cancers in U.S. adults with diabetes who took these popular medications compared to those who took another class of diabetes drug not associated with weight loss.",
      "This type of study can't prove cause and effect, but the findings hint at a connection worth exploring. More than a dozen cancers are associated with obesity.",
      "\u201cThis is a call to scientists and clinical investigators to do more work in this area to really prove or disprove this,\u201d said Dr. Ernest Hawk of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The findings were released Thursday by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and will be discussed at its annual meeting in Chicago. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, was led by Lucas Mavromatis, a medical student at New York University\u2019s Grossman School of Medicine.",
      "\u201cChronic disease and chronic disease prevention are some of my passions,\u201d said Mavromatis, a former research fellow with an NIH training program.",
      "GLP-1 receptor agonists are injections used to treat diabetes, and some are also approved to treat obesity. They work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. They don't work for everyone and can produce side effects that include nausea and stomach pain.",
      "In the study, researchers analyzed data from 43 U.S. health systems to compare two groups: people with obesity and diabetes who took GLP-1 drugs and other people with the same conditions who took diabetes drugs like sitagliptin. The two groups were equal in size and matched for other characteristics.",
      "After four years, those who took GLP-1 drugs had a 7% lower risk of developing an obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause compared to those who took the other type of diabetes drug. There were 2,501 new cases of obesity-related cancer in the GLP-1 group compared to 2,671 cases in the other group.",
      "The effect was evident in women, but not statistically significant in men. The study couldn't explain that difference, but Mavromatis noted that differences in blood drug concentration, weight loss, metabolism or hormones could be at play.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed by House Republicans early Thursday would gut clean energy tax credits that Democrats approved three years ago while supporting increased mining, drilling and other traditional energy production.",
      "A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.",
      "The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden's term. Biden\u2019s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law's incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.",
      "\u201cIn a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,\" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "\u201cThese credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy -- creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,'' Goldfuss said.",
      "President Donald Trump celebrated the bill\u2019s passage, calling it \u201carguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.\u201d Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.",
      "The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by the Fourth of July holiday. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.",
      "Full-scale repeal of current credits \"could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,'' the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota.",
      "\"A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,\u201d the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.",
      "In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.",
      "The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.",
      "Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.",
      "House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China \u2014 an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.",
      "The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don\u2019t start construction within 60 days of the bill\u2019s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.",
      "\u201cThis bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it\u2019s proving to be not only economically beneficial \u2014 lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies \u2014 but also essential to America\u2019s energy future,\" said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.",
      "At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.",
      "The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump\u2019s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.",
      "\u201cOnce the land is sold, we will never get it back,\u201d Zinke said after the provision\u2019s removal. \u201dPublic access, sportsmanship, grazing tourism \u2014 our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands.\u201d",
      "The land sales had been inserted in an early version of the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that land sales were off the table.",
      "Supporters said the sales would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada and St. George, Utah.

      "At least three people were killed when a private jet crashed into a San Diego neighborhood Thursday morning, adding to the long list of aviation disasters this year.",
      "About 100 people had to be evacuated after the plane struck at least one home and jet fuel caught fire throughout the neighborhood. The Federal Aviation Administration said six people were aboard the plane. It wasn't clear how many died, although music agency Sound Talent Group said its co-founder and two other employees died in the crash.",
      "Many people are concerned about aviation safety after all the aircraft collisions and near-misses.",
      "Disasters have ranged from the midair collision that killed 67 people near Washington, D.C., in January to an airliner clipping another in February while taxiing at the Seattle airport. In March, an American Airlines plane caught fire after landing in Denver, sending 12 people to the hospital. A sightseeing helicopter broke apart and crashed into the Hudson River between New York City and New Jersey last month, killing six people.",
      "Federal officials have tried to reassure travelers that flying is the safest mode of transportation, and statistics support that. But the cascade of headlines about all the things that have gone wrong is drawing increasing attention.",
      "Here is a look at some of the recent tragedies and mishaps:",
      "\u2014 The New York helicopter that crashed on April 10 departed a downtown heliport. The flight lasted less than 18 minutes. Radar data shows the helicopter flew north along the Manhattan skyline, then south toward the Statue of Liberty. The victims in this crash included a family from Spain who was celebrating the ninth birthday of one of their children.",
      "\u2014 Three people were killed and one was injured when a small plane crashed Friday morning in Boca Raton, Florida, near a major interstate highway and pushed a car onto railroad tracks.",
      "\u2014 Two small planes collided midair near an Arizona airport in mid-February, killing two people who were on one of the aircraft. Following the collision, one plane landed uneventfully, but the other hit the ground near a runway and caught fire. The crash happened at Marana Regional Airport near Tucson.",
      "\u2014 A small commuter plane crashed in western Alaska in early February, killing all 10 people on board. The crash was one of the deadliest in the state in 25 years. Radar data indicated that the plane rapidly lost elevation and speed. The U.S. Coast Guard was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft.",
      "\u2014 A medical transport plane that had just taken off plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood in late January, killing all six people on board and one person on the ground. The National Transportation Safety Board said its cockpit voice recorder likely hadn't been functioning for years. The crew made no distress calls to air traffic control.",
      "\u2014 The collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and a U.S. Army helicopter above the nation's capital killed everyone aboard both aircraft in late January. It was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground.",
      "\u2014 A jetliner operated by Jeju Air skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames in late December in South Korea after its landing gear apparently failed to deploy. All but two of the 181 people aboard were killed in one of that country\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "\u2014 The American Airlines plane that caught fire at Denver International Airport in March had been diverted there because the crew reported engine vibrations. While taxiing to the gate, an engine caught fire, prompting slides to be deployed so passengers could evacuate quickly. The people taken to hospitals had minor injuries.",
      "\u2014 A single-engine plane carrying five people crashed and burst into flames that same month in the parking lot of a retirement community near a small airport near Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Everyone on board survived. Three people were taken to an area burn center.",
      "\u2014 A Delta Air Lines jet flipped over while landing at Toronto\u2019s Pearson Airport in February. All 80 people on board survived, but some people received minor injuries. Witnesses and video from the scene showed the plane landing so hard that its right wing was sheared off. Investigators said when trying to determine the cause, they would consider the weather conditions and the possibility of human error.",
      "\u2014 Earlier this month, two commercial planes had to abort their landings at Reagan National Airport near Washington because of an Army Black Hawk helicopter flying near the Pentagon. The Army suspended all its helicopter flights in the area after this incident. It was a Black Hawk priority air transport from the same unit known as the PAT25 that collided with the passenger jet in midair in January.",
      "\u2014 In April, on the same day as the fatal New York helicopter crash, a wing tip of an American Airlines plane struck another plane from the same airline on a taxiway of the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia. There were no reported injuries. Multiple members of Congress were aboard one of the flights.",
      "\u2014 A FedEx cargo plane made an emergency landing at a busy New Jersey airport in March after a bird strike caused an engine fire that could be seen in the morning sky. The plane landed at Newark Liberty International Airport. There were no reported injuries.",
      "\u2014 Pilots on a Southwest Airlines flight about to land at Chicago\u2019s Midway Airport were forced to climb back into the sky to avoid another aircraft crossing the runway in late February. Video showed the plane approaching the runway before it abruptly pulled up as a business jet taxied onto the runway without authorization, federal officials said.",
      "\u2014 In early February, a Japan Airlines plane was taxiing on the tarmac of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when it apparently clipped the tail of a parked Delta plane. There were no injuries reported.",
      "\u2014 In early January, passengers panicked when a man aboard a JetBlue plane taxiing for takeoff from Boston's Logan International Airport opened an exit door over a wing, triggering an emergency slide to inflate. Other passengers quickly restrained the man and the plane didn't take off.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. climbed this week to its highest level since mid-February, a setback for home shoppers that threatens to slow sales further this spring homebuying season.",
      "The rate increased to 6.86% from 6.81% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.94%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also rose. The average rate ticked up to 6.01% from 5.92% last week. It\u2019s down from 6.24% a year ago, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including global demand for U.S. Treasurys, the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions and bond market investors\u2019 expectations about the economy and inflation.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, which it set in mid-January. The average rate\u2019s low point so far was five weeks ago, when it briefly dropped to 6.62%. It\u2019s now at its highest level since Feb. 13, when it averaged 6.87%.",
      "The elevated mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, have discouraged home shoppers, leading to a lackluster start to the spring homebuying season, even as the inventory of homes on the market is up sharply from last year. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last month to the slowest pace for the month of April going back to 2009.",
      "The recent rise in mortgage rates reflects moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which had mostly fallen after climbing to around 4.8% in mid-January, began rising March amid investor anxiety over the Trump administration's trade war. It rose again last week after the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day truce in their trade dispute, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve won\u2019t have to cut interest rates  as deeply as expected this year in order to shield the economy from the damage of tariffs.",
      "This week, long-term bond yields surged again after Moody\u2019s lowered its credit rating for the U.S. over concerns about swelling federal government debt.",
      "The 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.56% in midday trading Thursday after the House of Representatives approved a bill that would cut taxes and could add trillions of dollars to the U.S. debt.",
      "\u201cSince mortgage rates closely track the 10-year yield, this upward pressure has translated into increased borrowing costs for homebuyers, which means higher mortgage rates,\u201d said Jiayi Xu, an economist at Realtor.com.",
      "The increase in mortgage rates is discouraging some would-be homebuyers during what\u2019s traditionally the busiest period of the year for home sales. Last week, mortgage applications fell 5.1% from a week earlier as home loan borrowing costs increased, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
      "Applications for a loan to buy a home were still up 13% from a year earlier.",
      "Economists expect mortgage rates to remain volatile in coming months, with forecasts calling for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain between 6% and 7% this year.",

      "The Spanish powerhouse announced the hiring of Alonso on Sunday to replace Carlo Ancelotti, who is leaving to take over the Brazil job. Alonso will take over on June 1 and will be given a contract through June 2028, the club said.",
      "The 65-year-old Ancelotti is departing after four mostly successful seasons with Madrid. He bid a tearful farewell on Saturday in the team\u2019s final match of the Spanish league season. Ancelotti\u2019s contract was to end at the end of next season, but the club confirmed his departure on Friday after he had already been announced as the next Brazil coach.",
      "Madrid began the season by winning the UEFA Super Cup title but mostly struggled since then, failing to lift another trophy and losing all four \u201cclasico\u201d matches against rival Barcelona, which clinched a league and cup double.",
      "The 43-year-old Alonso is returning to a familiar environment.",
      "\u201cAlonso is one of the biggest legends of Real Madrid and world football. He defended our shirt in 236 official games between 2009 and 2014. He won six titles during this time: the 10th European Cup in Lisbon, one European Super Cup, one league title, two Spanish Cups and one Spanish Super Cup,\u201d the club said.",
      "As coach, Alonso led Bayer Leverkusen to an unprecedented German league and cup double last year in his first full season after taking over the team when it was in the Bundesliga\u2019s relegation zone the season before.",
      "His team remains the only one to complete a whole Bundesliga campaign unbeaten. Leverkusen\u2019s only defeat in 2023-24 was to Atalanta in the Europa League final, and it bounced back three days later by winning the 2024 German Cup.",
      "Leverkusen\u2019s 35-game unbeaten run in the Bundesliga ended in August 2024 with a 3-2 loss at home to Leipzig, against whom Alonso\u2019s team uncharacteristically squandered a two-goal lead.",
      "\u201cYou didn\u2019t just train us \u2013 you inspired us,\u201d Leverkusen captain Granit Xhaka wrote on Instagram after Alonso confirmed his departure. \u201cWe\u2019ll carry your lessons far beyond the field.\u201d",
      "As a player for Spain and Madrid, Alonso displayed an understanding of the game and technical skills that created time and space for himself, and opportunities for others. Real Sociedad and Liverpool previously benefited from his intelligence in midfield. He helped the latter to the Champions League title in 2005.",
      "Alonso starred as a player as Madrid won a Spanish league title in 2012 and the 2014 Champions League before leaving for three Bundesliga titles with Bayern Munich.",
      "There was always a feeling in Madrid he would return. The club takes pride in bringing former greats back for coaching or management roles, like Zinedine Zidane or Jorge Valdano, and Alonso seemed predestined for coaching after a playing career spent managing teammates.",
      "Alonso began his coaching career with Madrid\u2019s youth teams before returning to Real Sociedad, another former club, to take over its reserve team. He led it to promotion.",
      "Now he will face different demands at Madrid, where he will be tasked with responding to a buoyant Barcelona team spearheaded by the outstanding Lamine Yamal and Brazil forward Raphinha supported by a cast of home-grown young stars such as Pedri and Gavi.",
      "He will have to put the team\u2019s top stars \u2013 Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Jude Bellingham and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior \u2013 back on track after they failed to help the team succeed toward the end of the season.",
      "Despite his success in leading Madrid to three Champions League titles, Ancelotti was considered a coach who largely let the players have their way, giving their individual brilliance full reign.",
      "Alonso is likely to be more structured with a clear idea of how he wants each player to fit into his team. One priority will be strengthening the defense after serious injuries there last season undermined Ancelotti\u2019s hopes of defending the Spanish league and Champions League titles.",
      "Madrid has already strengthened its defense with the signing of Spain defender Dean Huijsen from Bournemouth and more are likely to arrive.",
      "Whichever players come or go, Alonso will face the same demands \u2014 to get Madrid back on top in Spain and challenging for a record-extending 16th European crown.",
      "It\u2019s just his second job in senior management.",

      "The Minnesota Timberwolves made quite an entrance in the Western Conference finals even if their 143-101 victory in Game 3 was a late arrival",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Julius Randle lowered his head to drive into the lane with a determination that was missing in the last game, muscling his 6-foot-9, 255-pound frame against slender Oklahoma City star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander before pulling up and draining a 10-footer.",
      "With Minnesota's lead at 34 points late in the third quarter, the Target Center crowd was roaring with an intensity sustained from start to finish on Saturday night.",
      "After the Thunder called timeout, Randle strutted to midcourt, raised his arms and shouted repeatedly at the frenzied fans: \u201cWe home now!\u201d",
      "The Timberwolves made quite an entrance in the Western Conference finals, even if their 143-101 victory in Game 3 was a late arrival.",
      "Randle's performance was the epitome of the response.",
      "\u201cThe home energy had me going today,\u201d said Randle, who had 24 points on 9-for-15 shooting with four rebounds, three assists \u2014 and no turnovers. \u201cIt gave me a lot of juice. I just wanted to feed off of that energy. I know our team feeds off of it. I was just having fun out there.\u201d",
      "After averaging 24 points on 52% shooting over the 11 games of these NBA playoffs for Minnesota, Randle disappeared in Game 2 with six points on 2-for-11 shooting with four turnovers. With Oklahoma City in full control, coach Chris Finch kept him on the bench for the entire fourth quarter.",
      "Randle was disappointed by the decision, to be sure, but he's got too strong of a relationship with Finch \u2014 dating to the 2018-19 season with New Orleans when Finch was an assistant \u2014 and too much of a grasp of the bigger picture to let any negative emotion cloud his demeanor.",
      "\u201cObviously as a competitor I want to play, but it\u2019s all about the team and I wanted to make sure that I came in the same if it\u2019s a good day or if it\u2019s a bad day,\u201d Randle said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for my teammates to see it. As hard as it is at times, you\u2019ve got to check your ego at the door.\u201d",
      "Finch and Randle spoke at the morning shootaround, but there wasn't any tension to clear.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Hey, man, you had one subpar game in the playoffs so far. Just happened to be the other night. We\u2019re moving on,'\" Finch said.",
      "Good advice from the head coach, of course, but the star player actually beat him to it.",
      "Anthony Edwards, who sparked the Wolves with 30 points in 30 minutes before sitting for the fourth quarter with the game well in hand, was the first one to approach Randle in Oklahoma City on Thursday night with an encouraging word.",
      "\u201cHe was like, \u2018Bro, just shake that. Like, you good. Don\u2019t worry about it,'\" Randle said. \"And as the flight went on, I was able to start smiling and laughing again while we\u2019re playing cards and all that stuff. So he\u2019s very mature and very in-tune with the team, and as a leader of the team you need that.\u201d",
      "Randle rediscovered his aggression in Game 3 \u2014 and his fadeaway. He knocked down a 16-footer and an 11-footer early, part of a revival of the success the Wolves had in the paint in the first two rounds of the NBA playoffs before slamming into the Thunder's league-best defense in the first two games of this series.",
      "\u201cWe just had to keep finding a better game within ourselves,\u201d Finch said. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t really played our best basketball, all credit to them at times, for affecting that. I think we just were able to put it all together, and we've got to do it again.\u201d",

      "Rafael Nadal is scheduled to be celebrated in the main stadium of the French Open on Day 1 of the tournament",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Rafael Nadal's first French Open match in the tournament's main stadium came on May 25, 2005 \u2014 a straight-set victory in the second round against Xavier Malisse. That made Nadal's career record in the tournament 2-0, and he was just getting started on the way to what would end up as a 112-4 mark and 14 championships at Paris.",
      "On Sunday, 20 years to the day after that win, Nadal was scheduled to be back at Court Philippe-Chatrier, only instead of competing, he was going to be feted by the French tennis federation for all that he accomplished on the red clay.",
      "\u201cCelebrating the King,\u201d was the way the event was described on social media by the official Roland-Garros feed. There was no exact time for the start of the ceremony, only word that it would begin after the three day-session matches in Chatrier would finish \u2014 so perhaps somewhere around 5 or 6 p.m. local time (11 a.m or noon ET).",
      "There were plenty of active players on the program for Day 1 of the year's second Grand Slam tennis tournament, of course, from No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka to two-time major runnerup Jasmine Paolini, from U.S. Open semifinalist Ben Shelton to Paris Olympics medalists Zheng Qinwen and Lorenzo Musetti.",
      "None, though, was likely to draw as much attention and adulation as the 38-year-old former player with 22 total Grand Slam titles and known to all as \u201cRafa,\u201d who played his final competitive match in the Davis Cup in November. Some folks did not think the tribute to him after a loss in his last appearance there lived up to what it should have been, and event director Feliciano Lopez had to defend it.",
      "Other tournaments put off holding celebrations for Nadal this season, including Monte Carlo, Barcelona and Rome.",
      "It just seemed fitting to all that the next big show should come at the site of so many of those lefty uppercut forehands, so many sprints to reach seemingly unreachable shots by opponents, so many triumphs.",
      "This is the way Nadal described the fans in Paris: \u201cThey give me the love and the support every single second I have been on court.\u201d",
      "They were expected to pack the house on Sunday andit sounded as if some players planned to take in the scene, too, although at least one, four-time French Open champion Iga Swiatek, was going to need to make sure it wouldn't interrupt her preparation for competition.",
      "\u201cI need to be aware that, for sure, I\u2019m going to cry,\u201d Swiatek said. \u201cI would love to be there, because we should all kind of get together and celebrate Rafa and what he did for our sport and what kind of inspiration he was and still is.\u201d",
      "Stefanos Tsitsipas \u2014 twice a Slam finalist, including at the 2021 French Open \u2014 joked that Nadal won the trophy 29 times in Paris.",
      "\u201cIt will be tough,\u201d Tsitsipas said, \u201cto see him go away.\u201d",

      "As the Trump administration cut billions of dollars in federal funding to scientific research, thousands of scientists in the U.S. lost their jobs or grants \u2014 and governments and universities around the world spotted an opportunity.",
      "The \u201cCanada Leads\u201d program, launched in April, hopes to foster the next generation of innovators by bringing early-career biomedical researchers north of the border.",
      "Aix-Marseille University in France started the \u201cSafe Place for Science\u201d program in March \u2014 pledging to \u201cwelcome\u201d U.S.-based scientists who \u201cmay feel threatened or hindered in their research.\u201d",
      "Australia\u2019s \u201cGlobal Talent Attraction Program,\u201d announced in April, promises competitive salaries and relocation packages.",
      "\u201cIn response to what is happening in the U.S.,\u201d said Anna-Maria Arabia, head of the Australian Academy of Sciences, \u201cwe see an unparalleled opportunity to attract some of the smartest minds here.\u201d",
      "Since World War II, the U.S. has invested huge amounts of money in scientific research conducted at independent universities and federal agencies. That funding helped the U.S. to become the world\u2019s leading scientific power \u2014 and has led to the invention of cell phones and the internet as well as new ways to treat cancer, heart disease and strokes, noted Holden Thorp, editor-in-chief of the journal Science.",
      "But today that system is being shaken.",
      "Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has pointed to what it calls waste and inefficiency in federal science spending and made major cuts to staff levels and grant funding at the National Science Foundation,the National Institutes of Health, NASA and other agencies, as well as slashing research dollars that flow to some private universities.",
      "The White House budget proposal for next year calls to cut the NIH budget by roughly 40% and the National Science Foundation\u2019s by 55%.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is spending its first few months reviewing the previous administration\u2019s projects, identifying waste, and realigning our research spending to match the American people\u2019s priorities and continue our innovative dominance,\" said White House spokesperson Kush Desai.",
      "Already, several universities have announced hiring freezes, laid off staff or stopped admitting new graduate students. On Thursday, the Trump administration revoked Harvard University\u2019s ability to enroll international students, though a judge put that on hold.",
      "Research institutions abroad are watching with concern for collaborations that depend on colleagues in the U.S. \u2014 but they also see opportunities to potentially poach talent.",
      "\u201cThere are threats to science ... south of the border,\u201d said Brad Wouters, of University Health Network, Canada\u2019s leading hospital and medical research center, which launched the \u201cCanada Leads\u201d recruitment drive. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole pool of talent, a whole cohort that is being affected by this moment.\u201d",
      "Universities worldwide are always trying to recruit from one another, just as tech companies and businesses in other fields do. What's unusual about the current moment is that many global recruiters are targeting researchers by promising something that seems newly threatened: academic freedom.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this month that the European Union intends \u201cto enshrine freedom of scientific research into law.\u201d She spoke at the launch of the bloc's \u201cChoose Europe for Science\u201d \u2014 which was in the works before the Trump administration cuts but has sought to capitalize on the moment.",
      "Eric Berton, president of Aix-Marseille University, expressed a similar sentiment after launching the institution\u2019s \u201cSafe Place for Science\u201d program.",
      "\u201cOur American research colleagues are not particularly interested by money,\" he said of applicants. \"What they want above all is to be able to continue their research and that their academic freedom be preserved.\"",
      "It\u2019s too early to say how many scientists will choose to leave the U.S. It will take months for universities to review applications and dole out funding, and longer for researchers to uproot their lives.",
      "Plus, the American lead in funding research and development is enormous \u2014 and even significant cuts may leave crucial programs standing. The U.S. has been the world\u2019s leading funder of R&D \u2014 including government, university and private investment \u2014 for decades. In 2023, the country funded 29% of the world\u2019s R&D, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
      "But some institutions abroad are reporting significant early interest from researchers in the U.S. Nearly half of the applications to \u201cSafe Place for Science\u201d \u2014 139 out of 300 total \u2014 came from U.S.-based scientists, including AI researchers and astrophysicists.",
      "U.S.-based applicants in this year\u2019s recruitment round for France\u2019s Institute of Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology roughly doubled over last year.",
      "At the Max Planck Society in Germany, the Lise Meitner Excellence Program \u2014 aimed at young female researchers \u2014 drew triple the number of applications from U.S.-based scientists this year as last year.",
      "Recruiters who work with companies and nonprofits say they see a similar trend.",
      "Natalie Derry, a U.K.-based managing partner of the Global Emerging Sciences Practice at recruiter WittKieffer, said her team has seen a 25% to 35% increase in applicants from the U.S. cold-calling about open positions. When they reach out to scientists currently based in the U.S., \u201cwe are getting a much higher hit rate of people showing interest.\u201d",
      "Still, there are practical hurdles to overcome for would-be continent-hoppers, she said. That can include language hurdles, arranging childcare or eldercare, and significant differences in national pension or retirement programs.",
      "Brandon Coventry never thought he would consider a scientific career outside the United States. But federal funding cuts and questions over whether new grants will materialize have left him unsure. While reluctant to leave his family and friends, he\u2019s applied to faculty positions in Canada and France.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to necessarily leave the United States, but this is a serious contender for me,\u201d said Coventry, who is a postdoctoral fellow studying neural implants at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",
      "But it\u2019s not easy to pick up and move a scientific career \u2014 let alone a life.",
      "Marianna Zhang was studying how children develop race and gender stereotypes as a postdoctoral fellow at New York University when her National Science Foundation grant was canceled. She said it felt like \u201cAmerica as a country was no longer interested in studying questions like mine.\u201d",
      "Still, she wasn\u2019t sure of her next move. \u201cIt\u2019s no easy solution, just fleeing and escaping to another country,\u201d she said.",
      "The recruitment programs range in ambition, from those trying to attract a dozen researchers to a single university to the continent-wide \u201cChoose Europe\u201d initiative.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if the total amount of funding and new positions offered could match what's being shed in the U.S.",
      "Even as universities and institutes think about recruiting talent from the U.S., there\u2019s more apprehension than glee at the funding cuts.",
      "\u201cScience is a global endeavor,\u201d said Patrick Cramer, head of the Max Planck Society, noting that datasets and discoveries are often shared among international collaborators.",
      "One aim of recruitment drives is to \u201cto help prevent the loss of talent to the global scientific community,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cThe U.S. was always an example, in both science and education,\u201d said Patrick Schultz, president of France's Institute of Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology.

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration escalated its standoff with Harvard University on Thursday, revoking the school\u2019s ability to enroll international students",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's administration escalated its standoff with Harvard University on Thursday, revoking the school's ability to enroll international students.",
      "The government told Harvard's thousands of current foreign students that they must transfer to other schools or they will lose their legal permission to be in the U.S.",
      "The move could significantly affect the university, which enrolls nearly 6,800 international students, most of them in graduate programs. Those students may now have to scramble to figure out their next steps.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security took this latest step because Harvard refused to comply with requests to produce records about its foreign students, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a letter. Noem accused Harvard of \u201cperpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies and employs racist \u2018diversity, equity and inclusion\u2019 policies.\u2019\u201d Harvard said the action is unlawful and undermines the school\u2019s research mission.",
      "Here's what to know about how this decision affects international students and what legal authority Noem has to take the step.",
      "The U.S. government has authority over who comes into the country. The Department of Homeland Security oversees which colleges are part of the Student Exchange and Visitor Program, and on Thursday it said it would remove Harvard. The program gives colleges the ability to issue documentation to foreign students admitted to the schools. Then, the students apply to obtain visas to study in the United States.",
      "Students who completed their degrees this semester will be allowed to graduate. Noem's letter said the changes would take effect for the 2025-2026 school year. Harvard's Class of 2025 is expected to graduate next week.",
      "However, students who have yet to complete their degree need to transfer to another university, Noem said, or they'll lose their legal permission to remain in the U.S.",
      "No, not unless the government changes its decision or a court steps in. For now, Noem said Harvard could restore its status as a host institution for foreign students if it complied with a list of demands within 72 hours. Those demands include requests for a range of records, such as disciplinary records for international students, plus audio and video recordings of protest activity.",
      "Harvard previously declined to provide those records. The university said Thursday it was working to provide guidance to affected students.",
      "Harvard's battle with the Trump administration dates to early April. The storied institution became the first elite college to refuse to comply with the government's demands to limit pro-Palestinian protests and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion policies. That kicked off a series of escalating actions against Harvard. Various federal agencies, including DHS and the National Institutes of Health, have cut their grant funding to Harvard, significantly impacting research projects conducted by faculty. Harvard has sued the administration, seeking to end the grant freeze.",
      "The administration first threatened to revoke Harvard's ability to host international students back in April. Trump also has said Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status. Doing so would strike at the school's ability to fundraise, as wealthy donors often give to tax-exempt institutions to lower their own tax burdens.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Hackers working for Russian military intelligence targeted Western technology and logistics companies involved in shipping assistance to Ukraine, the U.S. National Security Agency said.",
      "The hackers were trying to obtain details about the type of assistance entering Ukraine and, as part of the effort, sought access to the feeds of internet-connected cameras near Ukrainian border crossings, according to the NSA's report on the cyberattack, which was issued late Wednesday.",
      "The cyber campaign sought to penetrate defense, transportation and logistics companies in several Western countries, including the U.S., as well as ports, airports and rail systems. The report didn\u2019t specify which types of aid Russia was surveilling, but Ukraine\u2019s allies have contributed significant amounts of military and humanitarian assistance since the war began.",
      "More than 10,000 internet-connected cameras were targeted, including private devices and public traffic cameras near critical transportation points, such as ports, rail hubs or border crossings. Most were in Ukraine, though some were in Romania, Poland and other eastern or central European countries.",
      "Officials did not disclose details about the hackers' success or how long they remained unnoticed. The activity detailed in the report began in 2022, the same year that Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "Russia is expected to continue its efforts to spy on aid shipments, and companies involved in aid logistics or shipments should be on guard, according to the report, which was issued jointly by the NSA, the FBI and security agencies in several allied nations.",
      "\u201cTo defend against and mitigate these threats, at-risk entities should anticipate targeting,\u201d the NSA said.",

      "The Russian team also exploited security vulnerabilities in computer devices used at small and in-home offices, networks that often lack the security measures found in larger systems.",
      "The hackers didn't use particularly innovative techniques, according to Grant Geyer, chief strategy officer at the cybersecurity company Claroty. Nevertheless, the sprawling yet carefully orchestrated effort gives the Russians a \u201cgranular understanding\u201d of the aid sent to Ukraine, he said.",
      "\u201cThey have done detailed targeting across the entire supply chain to understand what equipment is moving, when and how \u2014 whether it\u2019s by aircraft, ship or rail,\u201d Geyer said.",
      "Russia could use the information it obtained to hone its war planning, Geyer said, or to plot further cyber or physical attacks on the supply chain to Ukraine.",
      "Last fall, U.S. intelligence officials issued a public bulletin directing American defense companies and suppliers to increase security precautions following several acts of sabotage in Europe that officials have blamed on Russia.",

      "The 10,000 bitcoin that software developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid for two Papa John\u2019s pizzas delivered to his Florida home on May 22, 2010, were worth about $41 at the time. Today they\u2019re worth $1.1 billion, as bitcoin hits record high prices.",
      "Several cryptocurrency companies are announcing promotions and other celebrations to mark Bitcoin Pizza Day. Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it\u2019s giving away pizzas to more than 2,000 people at gatherings held around the world.",
      "Here\u2019s the backstory of Bitcoin Pizza Day:",
      "The first bitcoin was created in early 2009 by the digital currency\u2019s still unknown creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It started as a passion project for libertarian-minded computer nerds who wanted to create a digital payment system that didn\u2019t rely on a third party \u2013 like a government or financial institution \u2013 for transactions.",
      "Hanyecz was an early enthusiast and became active on an early bitcoin internet message board, offering technical advice on how to \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin more effectively.",
      "Central to bitcoin\u2019s technology is the process through which transactions are verified and then recorded on what\u2019s known as the blockchain. Computers connected to the bitcoin network race to solve complex mathematical calculations that verify the transactions, with the winner earning newly minted bitcoins as a reward in a process known as mining.",
      "In the early days, enthusiasts could mine bitcoin through their home computers and Hanyecz accumulated thousands of the new digital asset. Nowadays, mining bitcoin has become a highly competitive field with multi-billion-dollar companies using specialized computers in entire data centers to acquire new bitcoins.",
      "In the early days, no one quite knew what to do with the bitcoin they were mining. On May 18, 2010, Hanyecz tried an experiment and posted a message offering 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.",
      "\u201cI like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that,\u201d Hanyecz wrote.",
      "Three days later, Hanyecz wondered if he needed to up the price.",
      "\u201cSo nobody wants to buy me pizza? Is the bitcoin amount I\u2019m offering too low?\u201d he wrote.",
      "But the next day, Hanyecz said he\u2019d successfully traded his bitcoin for pizza. Another bitcoin enthusiast from California had paid for the Papa John\u2019s pizza in exchange for the cryptocurrency, according to a book about bitcoin's early history, \u201cDigital Gold.\u201d",
      "\u201cA great milestone reached,\u201d said another early bitcoin enthusiast on the message board congratulating Hanyecz.",
      "It did not take long for bitcoin to take off after the first pizza deal. Bitcoin started getting more publicity and grew, thanks in part to the popularity of an online black-market site, Silk Road, which only accepted bitcoin.",
      "By February 2014, with bitcoin trading at around $600, Hanyecz marveled at what the digital currency had become.",
      "\u201cI mean people can say I\u2019m stupid, but it was a great deal at the time,\u201d Hanyecz wrote on the bitcoin message board. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could have known it would take off like this.\u201d",
      "Five years later, when bitcoin was trading as high as $11,000, Hanyecz reflected on what buying that first pizza meant for bitcoin.",
      "\u201cIt made it real for some people, I mean it certainly did for me,\u201d Hanyecz said on the television show \u201c60 minutes.\u201d",
      "Hanyecz has largely stayed out of the public spotlight in recent years and efforts to contact him by The Associated Press were unsuccessful.",
      "After many years of fits and starts, bitcoin now appears firmly entrenched in the mainstream financial system. While it hasn\u2019t taken off as a way to pay for everyday items like pizza, bitcoin has found popularity as a kind of \u201cdigital gold,\u201d or a way to store value.",
      "Retirement accounts can buy bitcoin ETFs, more and more companies buy bitcoin as corporate treasuries, and President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a government reserve of bitcoin.",
      "Bitcoin was trading at about $111,000 on Thursday morning \u2014 a new record. That price gives it a market cap of more than $2 trillion, or about the same as Amazon.",

      "SEATTLE -- Microsoft has fired an employee who interrupted a speech by CEO Satya Nadella to protest the company's work supplying the Israeli military with technology used for the war in Gaza.",
      "Software engineer Joe Lopez could be heard shouting at Nadella in the opening minutes Monday of the tech giant's annual Build developer conference in Seattle before getting escorted out of the room. Lopez later sent a mass email to colleagues disputing the company's claims about how its Azure cloud computing platform is used in Gaza.",
      "Lopez's outburst was the first of several pro-Palestinian disruptions at the event that drew thousands of software developers to the Seattle Convention Center. At least three talks by executives were disrupted, the company even briefly cut the audio of one livestreamed event. Protesters also gathered outside the venue.",
      "Microsoft has previously fired employees who protested company events over its work in Israel, including at its 50th anniversary party in April.",
      "Microsoft acknowledged last week that it provided AI services to the Israeli military for the war in Gaza but said it had found no evidence to date that its Azure platform and AI technologies were used to target or harm people in Gaza.",
      "The advocacy group No Azure for Apartheid, led by employees and ex-employees, says Lopez received a termination letter after his Monday protest but couldn't open it. The group also says the company has blocked internal emails that mention words including \u201cPalestine\u201d and \u201cGaza.\u201d",
      "Microsoft hasn't returned emailed requests for comment about its response to this week's protests. The four-day conference ends Thursday.",

      "New research finds clownfish shrink their bodies to survive warming oceans",
      "NEW YORK -- To survive warming oceans, clownfish cope by shrinking in size.",
      "Scientists observed that some of the orange-striped fish shrank their bodies during a heat wave off the coast of Papa New Guinea. Fish that slimmed were more likely to survive.",
      "Heat waves are becoming more common and intense underwater due to climate change. Warmer water temperatures can bleach sea anemones that clownfish call home, forcing them to adapt to stay alive.",
      "Scientists monitored and measured 134 colorful clownfish in Kimbe Bay during an intense heat wave in 2023 that's still bleaching corals worldwide. They found that 101 clownfish decreased in length on one or more occasions from heat stress.",
      "\u201cWe were really shocked at first when we saw that they were shrinking at all,\u201d said study author Morgan Bennett-Smith with Boston University. The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "Though scientists don\u2019t yet know how clownfish shrink, one idea is that they could be reabsorbing their own bone matter. It\u2019s possible the smaller stature may help the clownfish save energy during a stressful scorch since smaller fish need less food.",
      "Certain clownfish breeding pairs also synced their shrink to boost their survival odds. The females adjusted their size to stay bigger than their partners, keeping the female-dominated social hierarchy intact, researchers said.",
      "Other animals also decrease in size to beat the heat. Marine iguanas get smaller during El Ni\u00f1o events that usher warm waters into the Galapagos. But this coping strategy hadn't yet been spotted in coral reef fish until now.",
      "\u201cThis is another tool in the toolbox that fish are going to use to deal with a changing world,\u201d said Simon Thorrold, an ocean ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved with the new study.",
      "The tactic helps clownfish weather heat waves in the short-term, but it's not yet clear how the fish will fare if they have to keep it up in the years to come, Thorrold said.",
      "Researchers found the shrinking was temporary. Clownfish possessed the ability to \u201ccatch up\u201d and grow back when their environment got less stressful, showing how living things are staying flexible to keep up with a warming world, said study author Melissa Versteeg with Newcastle University.",
      "\u201cThese natural systems really are under stress, but there's a capacity for incredible resilience,\u201d Versteeg said.",

      "Half of U.S. states now have laws banning or regulating cellphones in schools, with more likely to follow",
      "ATLANTA -- Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023.",
      "Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place, with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly\u2019s Education Committee, on May 13 called phones \u201ca cancer on our kids\u201d that are \u201cdriving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\u201d",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\u201cThis is a not just an academic bill,\u201d Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \u201cThis is a mental health bill. It\u2019s a public safety bill.\u201d",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \u201ca huge win.\"",
      "\u201cTeachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group\u2019s political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\u201d Hoffman said.",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\u201cIt was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\u201cIt is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\u201d Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",
      "\u201cProviding some specific money for this would kind of ease some of those implementation challenges,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201dThat said, most states have not.\"",

      "Google on Tuesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence technology to accelerate a year-long makeover of its search engine that is changing the way people get information and curtailing the flow of internet traffic to websites.",
      "The next phase outlined at Google's annual developers conference includes releasing a new \u201cAI mode\u201d option in the United States. The feature makes interacting with Google's search engine more like having a conversation with an expert capable of answering questions on just about any topic imaginable.",
      "AI mode is being offered to all comers in the U.S. just two-and-half-months after the company began testing with a limited Labs division audience.",
      "Google is also feeding its latest AI model Gemini 2.5, into its search algorithms and will soon begin testing other AI features, such as the ability to automatically buy tickets to concerts and conduct searches through live video feeds.",
      "The expansion builds upon a transformation that began a year ago with the introduction of conversational summaries called \u201cAI overviews\u201d that have been increasingly appearing at the top of its results page and eclipsing its traditional rankings of web links.",
      "About 1.5 billion people now regularly engage with \u201cAI overviews,\u201d according to Google, and most users are now entering longer and more complex queries.",
      "\u201cWhat all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people all over the world,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said before a packed crowd in an amphitheater near the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters.",
      "Although Pichai and other Google executives predicted AI overviews would trigger more searches and ultimately more clicks to other sites, it hasn't worked out that way so far, according to the findings of search optimization firm BrightEdge.",
      "Clickthrough rates from Google's search results have declined by nearly 30% during the past year, according to BrightEdge's recently released study, which attributed the decrease to people becoming increasingly satisfied with AI overviews.",
      "The decision to make AI mode broadly available after a relatively short test period reflects Google's confidence that the technology won't habitually spew misinformation that tarnishes its brand's reputation, and acknowledges the growing competition from other AI-powered search options from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity.",
      "The rapid rise of AI alternatives emerged as a recurring theme in legal proceedings that could force Google to dismantle parts of its internet empire after a federal judge last year declared its search engine to be an illegal monopoly.",
      "In testimony during a trial earlier this month, longtime Apple executive Eddy Cue said Google searches done through the iPhone maker's Safari browser have been declining because more people are leaning on AI-powered alternatives.",
      "And Google has cited the upheaval being caused by AI's rise as one of the main reasons that it should only be required to make relatively minor changes to the way it operates its search engine because technology already is changing the competitive landscape.",
      "But Google's reliance on more AI so far appears to be enabling its search engine to maintain its mantle as the internet's main gateway \u2014 a position that's main reason its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., boasts a market value of $2 trillion.",
      "During the year ending in March, Google received 136 billion monthly visits, nearly 29 times more than ChatGPT, according to data compiled by onelittleweb.com.",
      "Even Google's own AI mode acknowledged that the company's search engine seems unlikely to be significantly hurt by the shift to AI technology when a reporter from The Associated Press asked whether its introduction would make the company even more powerful.",
      "\u201cYes, it is highly highly that Google's AI mode will make Google more powerful, particularly in the realm of information access and online influence,\u201d the AI mode responded. The feature also warns web publishers should be concerned about AI mode reducing the traffic that they get from search results.",
      "Google's upcoming tests in its Labs division foreshadow the next wave of AI technology likely to be made available to the masses.",
      "Besides using its Project Mariner technology to test the ability of an AI agent to buy tickets and book restaurant reservations, Google will also experiment with searches done through live video and an opt-in option to give its AI technology access to people's Gmail so it can learn more about a user's tastes and interests. Other features on this summer's test list include a \u201cDeep Search\u201d option that will use AI to dig even deeper into complex topics and another tool that will produce graphical presentations of sports and finance data.",
      "Google is also introducing its equivalent of VIP access to all its AI technology with an \u201cUltra\u201d subscription package that will cost $250 per month and include 30 terabytes of storage, too. That's a big step beyond Google's previous top-of-the-line AI \u201cpro\u201d package that cost $20 per month and included two terabytes of storage. \u2014\u2014",
      "The Associated Press and Google have a licensing and technology agreement that gives Google\u2019s Gemini AI chatbot access to AP\u2019s news coverage.",

      "HONG KONG -- Shares in CATL, the world\u2019s largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles, jumped more than 16% Tuesday in its Hong Kong trading debut after it raised about $4.6 billion in the world\u2019s largest initial public offering this year.",
      "The solid reception for the Chinese company, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., in Hong Kong suggests there is still an appetite among international investors for leading Chinese manufacturers despite trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.",
      "It sold more than 135 million shares at their maximum offer price, 263 Hong Kong dollars ($33.6) each. Its shares rose after they started trading at 296 Hong Kong dollars ($37.80), 12.5% higher than their offer price. They closed 16.4% higher.",
      "CATL also has shares listed in Shenzhen, a business hub neighboring Hong Kong. They initially fell but then edged 1.2% higher.",
      "A supplier to automakers like Tesla, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Toyota and Honda, CATL held a nearly 38% global market share for EV batteries in 2024, its listing documents showed.",
      "The company has faced pressure from the U.S. In January, the U.S. Defense Department added it to a list of companies it says have ties to China\u2019s military, an accusation that CATL denied. It called the inclusion a \u201cmistake.\u201d",
      "In April, John Moolenaar, chairperson of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, wrote to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America to demand that the two American banks withdraw from their work on CATL's IPO. But the two banks stayed on.",
      "In the U.S., Ford Motor Co. is licensing technology from CATL to build batteries, but the plan faces resistance from some Republican lawmakers, who have expressed concern that the Chinese company could benefit from U.S. tax dollars.",
      "Because the U.S. has listed CATL as having ties to the U.S. military, the share offering excluded onshore U.S. investors. However, many large U.S. institutional investors have offshore accounts that allowed them to participate.",
      "The company said it plans to use most of the net proceeds from its IPO to build its factory in Hungary, meant to bring it closer to the manufacturing facilities of its main European customers.",
      "Government officials, including Hong Kong\u2019s Financial Secretary Paul Chan, attended its gong-striking ceremony in the city\u2019s vibrant business district, Central, on Tuesday. The company's chairman Robin Zeng said his business is committed to becoming a zero-carbon technology company.",
      "\u201cListing in Hong Kong means we are more broadly integrated into the global capital markets, and it\u2019s also a new starting point for us to promote the global zero-carbon economy,\u201d Zeng said.",
      "Zeng, who trained as a physicist, helped found Amperex Technology Ltd. in 1999. It mainly was engaged in research and development and manufacturing of consumer lithium batteries. The company was sold to Tokyo-listed TDK Corporation in 2005, but Zeng continued to oversee the firm's management until 2017, its listing documents say.",
      "In 2011, a team led by Zeng founded CATL, headquartered in the businessman's hometown of Ningde in Fujian province in southeast China. The literal meaning of the company's Chinese name is \u201cNingde Era.\"",
      "CATL says it has the broadest coverage of EV battery users globally, with its batteries installed in over 17 million EVs, or one in every three EVs worldwide, as of the end of 2024.",
      "Terence Chong, executive director of the Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said Hong Kong hasn\u2019t seen an IPO of this size in a while and the listing may boost such activity in the city.",
      "The exclusion of U.S. investors had little impact since there was sufficient demand for CATL's offering, he said.",
      "The amount of funds raised through IPOs in Hong Kong rose 89% year-on-year in 2024 following a double-digit decrease in 2023, according to Yujia Li, an analyst at the Hong Kong Financial Research Institute of the Bank of China.",
      "CATL recorded a profit of 55.3 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) in 2024, up 16.8% from 2023. Its listing surpassed JX Advanced Metals\u2019 $2.9 billion IPO in Japan in March, which was previously the largest this year, according to Renaissance Capital, a provider of pre-IPO research and IPO-focused ETFs.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure.",
      "Monday\u2019s 66-32 procedural vote keeps one of President Donald Trump\u2019s top legislative priorities on track for passage and highlights the growing political strength of the cryptocurrency industry, which spent heavily in last year\u2019s election and has amassed a large war chest for next year\u2019s midterms. Several Democrats reversed and voted to move forward with the legislation after negotiations with Republicans in recent days.",
      "The fate of the legislation, which would regulate how stablecoin issuers operate in the U.S., had been uncertain in recent weeks despite early bipartisan support. Senate Democrats blocked it earlier this month in part over concerns about how Trump and his family were benefiting from private crypto endeavors, including a newly launched stablecoin.",
      "Republicans won support from Democrats after strengthening regulations on foreign issuers, beefing up enforcement and barring large tech companies like Meta and Google from issuing their own stablecoins. The Senate will now consider the bill and could vote on final passage as soon as this week, depending on the number of amendments offered by Democrats and Republicans.",
      "Still, Democrats were divided on the legislation. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others have said the bill could help Trump enrich himself and needs stronger protections.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the final bill does nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 to rein in the President\u2019s crypto corruption,\u201d Warren said ahead of the bill\u2019s passage. She said the legislation would \u201caccelerate Trump\u2019s corruption by supercharging the size of the stablecoin market\u201d and make Trump \u201cthe regulator of his own financial product.\u201d",
      "Negotiators added tougher ethics rules for members of Congress and the executive branch, including preventing members of Congress from issuing stablecoins. But Warren and several other Democrats said it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cThis Congress should be a check on the president,\u201d Warren said.",
      "The bill would aim to create a federal framework to regulate the stablecoin industry, which is currently governed by a patchwork of existing federal and state laws.",
      "Stablecoins are a fast-growing corner of the cryptocurrency industry that have produced enormous profits for some of the major players involved. They offer a buffer from cryptocurrency\u2019s notorious volatility because they are pegged to real-world assets, like U.S. dollars or gold. Typically, that means a single stablecoin is worth $1, making them a much more reliable digital asset for commercial transactions than other forms of crypto.",
      "The move to regulate the industry has been bipartisan, but Trump\u2019s involvement in the crypto industry complicated the legislation\u2019s path. Trump launched a meme coin earlier this year that has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. And he is set to attend a dinner May 22 that\u2019s open to almost anyone who buys enough of the coins.",
      "Another Trump-family linked crypto venture called World Liberty Financial recently announced that it was issuing its own stablecoin, called USD1. The stablecoin got a huge boost when World Liberty Financial announced last week that an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.",
      "A former skeptic turned zealous promoter, Trump has promised to usher in a golden age for the cryptocurrency industry. His administration has already taken many early actions without Congress to boost crypto, including establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and undoing previous enforcement actions. But Trump needs Congress to get some of his and the deep-pocketed industry\u2019s top priorities passed, including enacting the stablecoin legislation.",
      "Democratic supporters of the legislation argued that Congress can\u2019t step aside just because of Trump\u2019s involvement in the market.",
      "\u201cThe stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can\u2019t afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\u201d said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, one of the lead Democratic negotiators on the legislation. \u201cWe need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson are hopeful for minimal modifications in the Senate to the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill\" passed by the House last week, but one Republican senator said there's enough resistance to halt the bill unless there are significant changes.",
      "\"The first goal of our budget reconciliation process should be to reduce the deficit. This actually increases,\" Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, urging deeper spending cuts than those in the bill to reset to a \"reasonable, pre-pandemic level of spending.\"",
      "\"I think we have enough to stop the process until the president gets serious about spending reduction and reducing the deficit,\" Johnson said.",
      "Republicans are using a budgeting tactic called reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority to pass, to get the package through both chambers and to Trump's desk. But any changes in the Senate would require the bill to go back to the House, where it was passed by only one vote among a divided Republican conference last week.",
      "Speaker Johnson made the rounds on the Sunday talk shows this week to defend the bill and to encourage the Senate to pass it without too many changes.",
      "\"I encourage them, you know, to do their work, of course, as we all anticipate. But to make as few modifications to this package as possible, because remembering that we've got to pass it one more time to ratify their changes in the House,\" Johnson told \"State of the Union.\" \"And I have a very delicate balance here, very delicate equilibrium that we've reached over a long period of time. And it's best not to meddle with it too much.\"",
      "The speaker emphasized the need to expedite the bill's passage and expressed hope that the president could sign it by Independence Day.",
      "\"Why is that so important? Because we've got to get relief to the American people, and that we also need to, for political purposes, show give a lot of time, enough time for everyone to see that this package actually is what we say. It's going to help the country, it's going to help the economy,\" he said.",
      "But Sen. Johnson criticized the rushed process, saying, \"You have to do the work, which takes time. That's part of the problem. The problem here is we've rushed this process. We haven't taken the time. We've done the same old way, exempted most programs.\"",
      "Another issue with the bill in the Senate is that it raises the debt ceiling, which some GOP senators said they wanted to deal with separately rather than add it to the package that cuts spending and makes Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul told \"Fox News Sunday\" that he won't vote for the legislation unless the debt ceiling increase is stripped because he said it would \"explode deficits.\"",
      "He called the bill's spending cuts \"wimpy and anemic.\"",
      "\"The problem is the math doesn't add up,\" he said.",
      "Asked about Paul's criticism during an interview with CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Speaker Johnson was asked whether he believes the legislation is an \"economic gamble.''",

      "\"No, it's not an economic gamble. It's a big investment\" Johnson said. \"What this bill is going to do is be jet fuel to the U.S. economy, foster a pro-growth economy. What do we mean by that? We reduce taxes, reduce regulations. We will increase and incentivize American manufacturing. The effect it will have on the economy is that entrepreneurs and risk takers and job creators will have an easier time in doing that. They will allow for more jobs and more opportunity for people ad wages will increase.\"",
      "Johnson said criticism about rising debt is \"dramatically overstated.\"",
      "\"Those same groups can objectively see and acknowledge that this is the largest cut in spending in at least 30 years, and arguably of all time, we're cutting over $1.5 trillion in federal spending while we check all the boxes and bring about a pro-growth economy,\" he said.",
      "And while the Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would raise the deficit by $3.8 trillion, Speaker Johnson said because the CBO doesn't do dynamic scoring, \"they don't account for the growth that will be fostered by all the policies that are in this, this, this big piece of legislation.\"",
      "In addition to extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts , the bill boosts spending for the military and border security and makes some cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and other assistance programs.",
      "The CBO's preliminary analysis of the bill, requested by House Democrats and completed before it was passed by the House, estimated the lowest-income Americans will see their resources decrease while the country's highest earners would see an increase.",
      "The bill would implement new work requirements for Medicaid -- targeting able-bodied adults and immigrants, among other beneficiaries \u2013 and incentivize states to not expand Medicaid. The CBO estimated it would result in $698 billion less in federal subsidies because of changes to the Medicaid program.",
      "The early CBO estimates put the number of people who could lose coverage at more than 8 million -- but that number continues to fluctuate and the CBO has not yet released its final score of the GOP bill as it continues to be negotiated.",
      "Johnson and Trump have maintained that the bill does not cut Medicaid but does root out \"waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "\"We are not cutting Medicaid in this package,\" Johnson told CNN's Jake Tapper. \"There's a lot of misinformation out there about this, Jake. The numbers of Americans who are affected are those that are entwined in our work to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "\"You're talking about 4.8 million able bodied workers, young men, for example, who are on Medicaid and not working. They are choosing not to work when they can. That is called fraud. They are cheating the system. When you root out those kinds of abuses, you save the resources that are so desperately needed by the people who deserve it and need it most. That's what we're doing, and that's why this is a morality of what we're doing here is precisely right,\" he said.",

      "Despite repeated claims from the White House that President Donald Trump's Thursday night gala for the top holders of his cryptocurrency meme coin had nothing to do with his official duties, several of those investors visited the White House Friday afternoon for what they described as a special VIP event, the attendees told ABC News.",
      "Sangrok Oh, a Korean crypto investor and entrepreneur, told ABC News on Friday that he and other top investors had been invited to tour the White House Friday afternoon, though it was not clear to him whether Trump himself would meet them.",
      "\"So, we're going to visit and tour the White House [and] at the same time talk about crypto industries and the future of crypto,\" Oh said.",
      "Thursday night's black tie event, held at Trump's Washington-area golf club, was attended by around 200 cryptocurrency traders, including many from overseas, who gained admission through a contest that awarded invitations to the top investors in Trump's meme coin -- with at least some of the funds flowing directly into the Trump family's coffers.",
      "Critics have blasted the gala as a \"pay for play\" event in which investors who poured millions into Trump's crypto coin got special access to the president.",
      "News that top $TRUMP coin investors visited the White House appeared to contradict White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's assertion Thursday that the president was attending the crypto gala in a personal capacity, and that since the dinner did not take place at the White House, it was separate from his official duties.",
      "\"The president is attending [the dinner] in his personal time,\" Leavitt said Thursday. \"It is not a White House dinner. It's not taking place here at the White House.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond on Friday to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "Cherry Hsu, an executive at MemeCore, a Singapore-based blockchain startup, said the firm's founder, known publicly as \"Ice,\" had also been invited to the White House on Friday afternoon. MemeCore, according to the contest leaderboard, finished second in the competition with $TRUMP coin holdings in excess of $1 million.",
      "And late Friday, Justin Sun, a Chinese crupto mogul and the top investor in Trump's meme coin, posted a highly produced video of his White House tour, writing on X, \"Was an honor to be invited to tour the @WhiteHouse. Such a privilege to see it in person.\"",
      "In addition to his multimillion-dollar investment in the $TRUMP coin, Sun has also invested $75 million in World Liberty Financial, another Trump-backed crypto venture. One month after that investment, SEC lawyers under the Trump administration moved to halt an alleged fraud case against Sun.",
      "The Trump meme coin's website at one point earlier this month advertised a \"Special VIP White House tour\" for the top 25 meme coin holders as part of the contest -- but as of last week, the site said only that a \"Special VIP tour\" would be arranged, without mentioning the White House.",
      "The site also included a disclaimer saying the tour was being arranged by the Fight Fight Fight LLC, and that the president himself would be appearing as a \"guest.\"",

      "\"As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies, you have lost this privilege,\" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the university.",

      "\"The government has claimed that its destructive action is based on Harvard's failure to comply with requests for information from the US Department of Homeland Security. In fact, Harvard did respond to the Department's requests as required by law,\" Gerber said.",
      "In its complaint, Harvard said there is \"no lawful justification\" for canceling the status.",
      "The school accused the administration of waging an \"unprecedented and retaliatory attack\" because the university supports policies the administration doesn't like.",
      "\"The government has casually discarded core First Amendment protections, the protections of procedural due process, and DHS's own regulations to immediate and devastating effect for Harvard and its community. Harvard's more than 7,000 F-1 and J-1 visa holders -- and their dependents -- have become pawns in the government's escalating campaign of retaliation,\" the complaint reads.",
      "The dispute over international students is the latest development in the administration's standoff with one of the country's most prestigious universities.",
      "Trump has threatened the school's tax-exempt status and is withholding billions in federal funding after the school's refusal to comply with the administration's demands regarding campus policies and governance, including actions on antisemitism and the use of DEI on campus.",
      "The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post found most Americans (66%) took Harvard's side in the conflict. Thirty-two percent of respondents sided with the Trump administration. The poll was conducted before the administration's move to block Harvard from admitting international students.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Noem wrote to Harvard in April requesting a tranche of information be given to DHS in order for the school to retain its SEVP status.",
      "According to the letter, she asked Harvard to give information over on student visa holder's \"known\" illegally activity; violent activity; threats to students or faculty; disciplinary actions taken as a result of being involved in a protest; information on whether the student obstructed the school's learning environment; and the coursework that the student is taking to maintain the visa status.",
      "Noem said the school did not provide adequate information in response, and that it is a \"privilege, not a right\" for students to study at American universities.",

      "Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs may be able to survive a legal challenge, thanks in part to a Japanese zipper company that sued the Nixon administration 50 years ago.",
      "Earlier this week, a federal judge in Florida nominated by Donald Trump suggested the president has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs -- basing his ruling on the precedent from a 1970s court case -- but stopped short of issuing an order affirming the president's right to impose sweeping tariffs.",
      "In a largely technical ruling issued on Tuesday, U.S. Judge T. Kent Wetherell II transferred one of the first lawsuits challenging Trump's tariffs to a different federal court while also weighing in on the legality of the controversial tariffs. Florida-based planner company Emily Ley Paper sued over the tariffs in April, asking Wetherell to invalidate them because Trump lacks the power to impose tariffs himself.",
      "According to the judge, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 gives Trump the authority to set tariffs for reasons other than raising revenue. Wetherell wrote that Trump's justification for the tariffs -- both stemming the flow of illicit drugs into the country and resolving a trade imbalance -- is sufficient to satisfy the terms set by Congress.",
      "\"This is a civil action commenced against the United States and it 'arises out of' a federal law\u2014IEEPA\u2014so the dispositive question framed by the parties' filings is whether IEEPA 'provid[es] for \u2026 tariffs,'\" he wrote. \"Defendants contend that it does; Plaintiffs contend that it doesn't. The Court agrees with Defendants ...\"",
      "The decision is at best a symbolic victory for the Trump administration, which is fending off a half dozen lawsuits challenging the legality of the recent \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",
      "Judge Wetherell ultimately decided to transfer the case from a federal court in Florida to the Court of International Trade in New York, meaning that, despite his favorable view of the tariffs, he won't be the one deciding the case.",
      "But the decision marks the first time a federal judge has suggested Trump's imposition of tariffs falls within his authority as president, offering a positive sign that the Trump administration may find a receptive audience at the Court of International Trade. During two hearings over the last week, judges at the Court of International Trade have wrestled with the same question about Trump's authority.",
      "The question comes down to the interpretation of the 1970s law that Trump used to impose his tariffs. The IEEPA gives the president the right to \"regulate\" imports but does not explicitly mention tariffs. Lawyers challenging the tariffs have argued that Trump's interpretation of the law oversteps his authority by treading into an issue controlled by Congress, but the Trump administration has pointed judges to a court decision related to the IEEPA's legal predecessor -- the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 -- to guide the way.",
      "Back when President Richard Nixon confronted the country's 1971 economic crisis with steep tariffs on Japanese goods, a zipper company based in Japan called Yoshida sued Nixon over the tariffs.",
      "The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, the predecessor to the Court of International Trade, sided with the government and held that the TWAE gives the president the power to impose tariffs.",
      "According to Wetherell, the same reasoning would apply 50 years later to the IEEPA, meaning Trump has the power to impose tariffs without the help of Congress. \"The reasoning in Yoshida is persuasive, and the Court sees no reason why it would not apply to IEEPA because the operative language of IEEPA is identical to the operative language in TWEA,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Despite losing its legal battle, Yoshida remains in business today. Now operating under the name YKK, it produces more zippers than any other company in the world.",

      "\"I have long ago informed [CEO] Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone\u2019s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" Trump said in a social media post.",
      "But a U.S.-bound relocation of Apple's supply chain is highly unlikely, industry analysts told ABC News prior to Trump's latest remarks, pointing to the time and expense necessary to overhaul production -- as well as the ongoing cost of higher wages commanded by workers in the U.S.",
      "In theory, the U.S. could host final assembly of Apple products like the iPhone, but even that would take several years and result in higher prices for shoppers, who may then turn to cheaper alternatives, some analysts said.",
      "\"Anything is possible, provided you have a long enough timeframe and don't care about profitability,\" Avi Greengart, lead analyst at research firm Techsponential, told ABC News.",
      "\"It's an incredibly global supply chain. If you want to move it to the U.S., you're talking about many years, possibly decades,\" Greengart added.",
      "Trump last month exempted phones, computers and chips from so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" imposed on China-made goods, which at that time amounted to a 125% levy. The move also excluded such products from a 10% across-the-board tariff imposed on nearly all imports.",
      "The policy change provided major cost savings for Apple, which produces about 90% of its smartphones in China.",
      "\"I speak to Tim Cook. I helped Tim Cook, recently, and that whole business,\" Trump told reporters at the Oval Office days after the exemption took effect.",
      "Last week, Trump temporarily slashed the reciprocal tariffs on China from 125% to 10% as the U.S. and China hold trade negotiations. China still faces 20% tariffs over its role in the fentanyl trade, bringing total levies on Chinese goods to 30%.",
      "On an earnings call earlier this month, Cook said the company had shifted production of iPhones sold in the U.S. to India as a means of avoiding high tariffs.",
      "\"The majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin,\" Cook said.",
      "However, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said this month in an interview with Fox News that Trump's vision for ushering in a \"golden age\" for America involved enticing manufacturers to open factories and build in the United States. And, he explained, tariffs play into that strategy.",
      "He said that the idea is \"to reshore manufacturing, to build here, to have those people who build here not pay any tariffs.\"",
      "\"We're going to have huge jobs in manufacturing. You've heard the president talk about trillions and trillions of factories being built in America,\" he said in the interview on May 11. \"Those are construction jobs, starting now, and then those products will not have tariffs on them.\"",
      "Cook noted the company already manufactures some components stateside.",
      "\"During calendar year 2025, we expect to source more than 19 billion chips from a dozen states, including tens of millions of advanced chips being made in Arizona this year. We also source glass used in iPhone from an American company,\" Cook said. \"All told, we have more than 9,000 suppliers in the US across all 50 states.\"",
      "Still, U.S.-based manufacturing makes up a small share of the company's supply chain \u2013 and any major expansion would take years and carry significant costs, analysts said.",
      "Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at the investment firm Wedbush who tracks the tech industry, said last month that it would take three years and cost $30 billion for Apple to shift 10% of its supply chain to the U.S. The price of a U.S.-made iPhone could rise as high as $3,500, Ives said.",
      "\"Price points would move up so dramatically it's hard to comprehend,\" Ives added, describing the notion of a U.S.-made iPhone as a \"nonstarter.\"",
      "The price of an iPhone 16 Pro would jump 25% alone, due to added U.S. labor expenses, Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan told clients last month in a note shared with ABC News. Such a price hike, which excludes for instance the added cost of factory construction, would bring a $999 smartphone to about $1,250.",
      "A small share of consumers would buy a U.S.-made iPhone even after a significant price hike, but the \"vast majority\" would opt for cheaper alternatives, Ben Bajarin, analyst at research firm Creative Strategies, told ABC News.",
      "The upward pressure on prices as a result of high U.S. labor costs would render domestic manufacturing nearly impossible, presenting Apple with a dilemma, Bajarin said.",
      "\"Production will never happen in the U.S. -- unless we have absolute, fully automated assembly, which completely defeats the purpose because humans won't be doing the jobs,\" Bajarin added.",

      "\"A hotbed of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators.\u201d",
      "Columbia University was cited for violating federal civil rights law by allegedly \"acting with deliberate indifference towards student-on-student harassment of Jewish students\u201d since the Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights said.",
      "This is the Trump administration's latest action taken against prominent universities. On Thursday, the Trump administration barred Harvard University from allowing international students to enroll at the university -- a move the university said is not legal -- because they have \"turned their once-great institution into a hotbed of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.",
      "HHS alleged that Columbia violated Title VI, which prohibits those receiving federal financial assistance from discriminating in its programs and activities on the basis of race, color, or national origin -- including discrimination against individuals based on their actual or perceived Israeli or Jewish identity or ancestry.",
      "The notice, both from HHS and the Department of Education, \"articulates extensive factual findings that span a period of over 19 months in which the University continually failed to protect Jewish students,\u201d the government said in its announcement. \u201cThe findings are based on information and documents obtained during the investigation, including witness interviews; examination of written policies and procedures; reliable media reports that contemporaneously capture anti-Semitic incidents and events at Columbia University; and reports from Columbia University\u2019s own Task Force on Antisemitism.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe findings carefully document the hostile environment Jewish students at Columbia University have had to endure for over 19 months, disrupting their education, safety, and well-being,\u201d said Anthony Archeval, Acting Director of the Office for Civil Rights at HHS. \u201cWe encourage Columbia University to work with us to come to an agreement that reflects meaningful changes that will truly protect Jewish students.",
      "The government said that Columbia University failed to take several actions, including failing to establish effective reporting mechanisms for antisemitism until the summer of 2024, failure to abide by its own policies and procedures when responding to Jewish students\u2019 complaints as well as governing misconduct against Jewish students and not investigating or punishing vandalism in its classrooms.",
      "\u201cWe understand this finding is part of our ongoing discussions with the government. Columbia is deeply committed to combatting antisemitism and all forms of harassment and discrimination on our campus,\" Columbia University said in a statement of Friday morning. \"We take these issues seriously and will work with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education to address them.\u201d",
      "In March, the university agreed to a list of demands from the Trump administration after it canceled $400 million worth of grants and contracts to the institution due to \"continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students,\" according to a statement from the Trump administration that month.",
      "\"Among them were exerting tighter controls over the university's Middle East Studies department and examining campus activities since the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel.",
      "In a statement from March 19, interim president Katrina Armstrong said: \"Antisemitism, harassment, and discrimination of any kind are unacceptable and imperil both our sense of community as well as our very academic mission.\"",

      "Experts say the election could be a bellwether ahead of 2026's midterms.",
      "New Jersey is set to hold its gubernatorial elections this year, with hotly contested primaries set for next month -- and many experts are saying the high-stakes race could be a harbinger for the mood of the country ahead of 2026's critical midterm elections.",
      "\"This is going to be the first real test for the potential Democratic backlash against the Trump administration. We've seen a little bit from special elections that Democratic voters are motivated to turn out. Does that continue going forward in the fall in New Jersey?\" Daniel Bowen, a political science professor at The College of New Jersey, told ABC News.",
      "Brigid Callahan Harrison, the chair of the Political Science and Law Department at Montclair State University, told ABC News that the race might not only be a \"bellwether\" for how voters feel about President Donald Trump and the upcoming midterms, but that it could indicate both how partisan allegiances are shifting in New Jersey and the strength of Trump's endorsement of Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli.",
      "Harrison points to Kamala Harris' small margin of victory in New Jersey, too. Harris won New Jersey by around 6 percentage points in 2024; then-Vice President Joe Biden won the state by about 16 percentage points in 2020.",
      "At stake in the race are also issues in New Jersey such as immigration enforcement and sanctuary cities, and the cost of housing and general affordability -- issues that have divided and animated Americans around the country and that are set to take center stage in the midterms as well.",
      "Democrats contend with a crowded field",
      "The Democratic primary features six figures hoping to succeed incumbent and term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and to keep the governorship blue.",
      "Polling shows that U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who represents the state's 11th Congressional District, is leading the pack. Sherrill's experience as a former U.S. Navy helicopter pilot and network of political supporters from a previous run for Congress work in her favor, Harrison said.",
      "Another Democratic candidate, Josh Gottheimer, has represented New Jersey's 5th Congressional District since 2017. The former political operative is widely seen as a moderate. Similar to other candidates, Gottheimer is positioning himself as ready to take on Trump. He has also framed himself as being the best one to tackle affordability in the state.",
      "Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was an educator in Newark Public Schools and a member of the city council before being elected mayor for the first time in 2014. He was arrested earlier this month while joining members of Congress at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Newark. Trespassing charges against Baraka have since been dismissed.",
      "Steven Fulop was first elected mayor of Jersey City in 2013. The ex-Goldman Sachs investment banker and former Marine has overseen population growth, increased development and municipal reforms.",
      "Steve Sweeney, a former ironworker who served as New Jersey's state Senate president for more than a decade, spent two decades as a lawmaker in that chamber before losing to a Republican in 2021. He has touted his strong support from unions and experience as a legislator.",
      "Sean Spiller, the president of the New Jersey Education Association -- the state's largest teacher's union -- has pointed to his experience as the former mayor of the city of Montclair as evidence that he is able to take on issues such as affordable housing and investing in childcare.",
      "As the June 10 primary gets closer, experts say they're all facing some of the same headwinds. After New Jersey eliminated its old primary ballot design, which used to allow most county parties to give preferential placement to their endorsed candidates, candidates now must focus more on their own get-out-the-vote operations, Harrison said.",

      "A recent New Jersey Republican Party fundraising email encouraged voters to \"finish the job\" and \"flip New Jersey red, for good.\"",
      "Experts said the presidential results might not necessarily indicate how competitive the gubernatorial race will be. Bowen said that New Jersey's off-cycle gubernatorial elections often show voters largely voting against the incumbent party in power in the White House, although he added that Republicans also see the race as intertwined with Democratic incumbent Murphy finishing up his time in office.",
      "Still, most of the Republican candidates have been eager to align themselves with Trump.",
      "Trump has endorsed the Republican front-runner Ciattarelli in the race that the president wrote is being \"closely watched by the entire World.\"",
      "Ciattarelli has been involved in local politics for decades, serving various roles including councilman and state assemblyman. He has had his sights on governor since 2017, where he ran for the first time but lost the primary. Ciattarelli succeeded in clinching the Republican nomination in 2021, but ultimately lost to Murphy.",
      "Ciattarelli, who says his top priority is making the state more affordable, has shifted his stance on Trump over the years. In 2015, he issued a statement calling Trump \"out of step with American values\" and \"not fit\" to be president. But he now supports the president, and endorsed Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Trump, recently wrote on his social media platform that Ciattarelli, \"after getting to know and understand MAGA, has gone ALL IN, and is now 100% (PLUS!)\"",
      "After the endorsement, Ciattarelli told Fox News that he will support the president's agenda. He has acknowledged his previous comments about Trump, too, but compared himself to Vice President JD Vance -- who at one point also did not support the president but is now vice president under Trump.",
      "Ashley Koning, the director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University, told ABC News that Trump's endorsement could help encourage undecided Republican voters to favor Ciattarelli. She said the center's polling showed that with Republican voters who were split, about half said an endorsement from Trump would make them more likely to vote for that candidate.",
      "Conservative talk show host Bill Spadea previously ran unsuccessful campaigns for the U.S. House and the state assembly, and has said he isn't afraid to call out both parties. He has expressed a desire to end taxpayer subsidies for Planned Parenthood and replicate the Department of Government Efficiency in New Jersey, in addition to promising to combat illegal immigration and increase affordability. Still, he said he has disagreed with Trump on \"multiple occasions.\"",
      "Jon Bramnick, a former state senator, appears to be less supportive of Trump. Last April, he made it clear that he would not vote for Trump in the 2024 presidential race, though he also said he probably wouldn't vote for the Democratic candidate either.",
      "Still, some of Bramnick's positions reflect stances similar to Trump's. In addition to branding himself as the \"toughest candidate on immigration,\" Bramnick also seeks to end sanctuary state policies in New Jersey, and introduced the \"New Jersey Laken Riley Act,\" which intends to align the state's law with Trump's legislation.",
      "Mario Kranjac, the former mayor of the town of Englewood Cliffs, is running a pro-Trump campaign, branding himself as a \"political outsider.\" Justin Barbera, a contractor, is also running a pro-Trump campaign, telling the New Jersey Monitor he is guided by his military and Christian background.",
      "Even with Ciatterelli standing out as the front-runner, Bowen said that nothing is certain until the primary wraps.",
      "\"It certainly looks like the race is Ciatterelli's to lose at this point -- although, of course, in a primary, anything can happen,\" Bowen said.",

      "She was a prominent feminist and author of the 1960s and \u201970s.",
      "NEW YORK -- Susan Brownmiller, a prominent feminist and author of the 1960s and '70s whose \"Against Our Will\" was a landmark and intensely debated best-seller about sexual assault, has died. She was 90.",
      "Brownmiller, who had been ill, died Saturday at a New York hospital, according to Emily Jane Goodman, a retired New York State Supreme Court justice and practicing attorney who serves as the executor of Brownmiller's will.",
      "A journalist, anti-war protester and civil rights activist before joining the \u201csecond wave\u201d feminist movement in its formative years, Brownmiller was among many women who were radicalized in the \u201960s and \u201970s and part of the smaller circle that included Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan and Kate Millett who radicalized others.",
      "While activists of the early 20th century focused on voting rights, second wave feminism transformed conversations about sex, marriage reproductive rights, workplace harassment and domestic violence. Brownmiller, as much as anyone, opened up the discussion of rape. \"Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape,\" published in 1975 and widely read and taught for decades after, documented the roots, prevalence and politics of rape \u2014 in war and in prison, against children and spouses. She denounced the glorification of rape in popular culture, contended that rape was an act of violence, not lust, and traced rape to the very foundations of human history.",
      "\"Man's structural capacity to rape and woman's corresponding structural vulnerability are as basic to the physiology of both our sexes as the primal act of sex itself,\" she wrote.",
      "In her 1999 memoir \"In Our Time,\" Brownmiller likened the writing of \"Against Our Will\" to \"shooting an arrow into a bulls-eye in very slow motion.\" Brownmiller started the book in the early 1970s after hearing stories from friends that made her shriek \u201cwith dismay.\u201d It was chosen as a main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club and considered newsworthy enough for Brownmiller to be interviewed on the \"Today\" show by Barbara Walters. In 1976, Time magazine placed her picture on its cover, along with Billie Jean King, Betty Ford and nine others as \"Women of the Year.\"",
      "Brownmiller's book inspired survivors to tell their stories, women to organize rape crisis centers and helped lead to the passage of marital rape laws. It was also received with fear, confusion and anger. Brownmiller remembered a newspaper reporter shouting at her, \"You have no right to disturb my mind like this!\"",
      "Brownmiller was also faulted for writing that rape was an assertion of power that helped all men and was strongly criticized for a chapter titled \"A Question of Race,\" in which she revisited the 1955 murder in Mississippi of Black teen Emmett Till. Brownmiller condemned his gruesome death at the hands of a white mob but also blamed Till for the alleged incident that led to his death: whistling at Bryant's wife, Carolyn Bryant.",
      "The chapter reflected ongoing tensions between feminists and civil rights leaders, with activist Angela Davis writing that Brownmiller's views were \"pervaded with racist ideas.\" In 2017, New Yorker editor David Remnick would call her writing about Till's murder \u201cmorally oblivious.\u201d Asked by Time magazine in 2015 about the passages on Till, she replied that she stood by \u201cevery word.\u201d",
      "Steinem would criticize Brownmiller for comments she made during a 2015 interview with New York magazine, when Brownmiller said that one way for women to avoid being assaulted was not to get drunk, suggesting that women themselves were to blame.",
      "Brownmiller's other books included \"Femininity,\" \"Seeing Vietnam\" and the novel \"Waverly Place,\" based on the highly publicized trial of lawyer Joel Steinberg, convicted in 1987 of manslaughter for the death of his 6-year-old daughter, Lisa. In recent years, Brownmiller taught at Pace University.",
      "\u201cShe was an active feminist, she was not one to just agree with the popular issue of the day,\" said Goodman, whose friendship with Brownmiller spanned decades.",
      "She recalled remarkable gatherings, including poker nights, at Brownmiller's longtime Greenwich Village apartment, which was the subject of her 2017 book, \u201cMy City Highrise Garden.\u201d",
      "Another longtime close friend, 92-year-old Alix Kates Shulman, a fellow writer and feminist, lived within walking distance.",
      "\u201cWe were womens\u2019 liberation comrades,\u201d she said.",
      "Brownmiller was born in New York City in 1935, and would note proudly that her birthday, Feb. 15, was the same as Susan B. Anthony's. Her father was a sales clerk, her mother a secretary and both were so devoted to Franklin Roosevelt and so knowledgeable of current events that Brownmiller \"became very intense about these things too.\" She was a Cornell University scholarship student at and had a brief \"very mistaken ambition\" to be a Broadway star, working as a file clerk and waitress as she hoped for roles that never materialized.",
      "The civil rights movement changed her life.",
      "She joined the Congress of Racial Equality in 1960 and four years later was among the \"Freedom Summer\" volunteers who went to Mississippi to help register Blacks to vote. During the \u201860s, she also wrote for the Village Voice and for ABC television and was a researcher at Newsweek.",
      "In the late 1970s, Brownmiller helped found the New York chapter of \"Women Against Pornography,\" with other members, including Steinem and Adrienne Rich. Organizers agreed that porn degraded and abused women, but differed over how to respond. Brownmiller wrote an influential essay, \"Let's Put Pornography Back in the Closet,\" disputing arguments that pornography was protected by the First Amendment. But she opposed anti-porn leader Catherine MacKinnon's push for legislation, believing that pornography was best confronted through education and protests.",
      "In the 1980s, Brownmiller stepped back from activism and in her memoir noted her despair over the \"slow seepage, symbolic defeats and petty divisions\" that were both causes and symptoms of the movement's decline. But she still remembered her earlier years as a rare and precious chapter.",
      "\"When such a coming-together takes place, when the vision is clear and the sisterhood is powerful, mountains are moved and the human landscape is changed forever,\" Brownmiller wrote. \"Of course it is wildly unrealistic to speak in one voice for half the human race, yet that is what feminism always attempts to do, and must do, and that is what Women's Liberation did do, with astounding success, in our time.\"",

      "As members of the Black and Latino LGBTQ and transgender and other communities come to the nation\u2019s capital for World Pride in the coming days, many are under siege from multiple directions thanks to their multiple identities. They will hold individualized programs and celebrations that blend into World Pride.",
      "Their mutual jeopardy will be a unifying theme. The celebrations, music, food, parades, plays and parties will unfold against a backdrop of human rights and political strategizing and, in some cases, discussions about how to survive in a climate that contains many people who do not want them around.",
      "\u201cI always tell folks that DC was the perfect place to have World Pride,\" Hutton said. \"We have so many different identity prides here in D.C., from Black Pride to Trans Pride to API Pride, Latinx Pride, Military Pride, Women\u2019s Pride, Silver Pride, we have so many different groups of people that have their own pride celebration.\u201d",
      "Frankie Miranda, the first openly gay president and CEO of the Hispanic Federation, says immigrants and the LGBTQ+ community have been \u201cin triage mode for months\u201d as they defend \u201ca multiapproach attack on many members of our community from different sides.\u201d",
      "Miranda, who is Puerto Rican, said immigrant families are being separated and the LGBTQ community targeted. After years of progress, those efforts are being eroded and \u201cfundamental rights challenged and taken away,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s a reminder of how much work we still have ahead and of how we must work in an intersectional way.\u201c",
      "Miranda urged Pride events to have direct calls to action and take a more political approach this year, including by looking to the 2026 elections.",
      "Susan Appleton, professor of women, gender. and sexuality studies at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said the nation\u2019s culture and society, \u201cincluding law,\u201d have always regulated gender, race and other identities. But, she said, \"I think we\u2019re in a very unusual time when the targets have become very explicit and when for many years we haven\u2019t seen the lack of empathy that we see now.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut I do think it\u2019s encouraging to me to see that there is a vigorous resistance,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t know whether it will accomplish anything, but I think it is important to make sure that all voices are heard.\u201d",
      "That people are facing multiple grievances, she said, now shows \u201cit\u2019s not sufficient to look at race alone or gender alone or sexuality alone but all those factors.\u201d They intersect and \"create unique vectors of oppression.\u201d",
      "People at the intersections between the Latino community and immigrant communities \u201cface attacks from all sides,\u201d said Dee Tum-Monge, a board member for the Latinx History Project, the steering organization for Latinx Pride. World Pride is aiming \u201cto create spaces focused around community care and political organizing while still celebrating our joy,\u201d they say.",
      "The focus, Tum-Monge said, is shifting away from just voting and federal action to work that attendees can do at local levels. Amid mounting threats to immigrants and the LGBTQ+ community, Tum-Monge said organizers are particularly concerned about security and will be watching for international participants who may face obstacles traveling.",
      "Although official events are kicking off now, programs that have begun suggest how diverse activities will be. The scene last week was almost solemn as people walked along the National Mall in sight of the Capitol, reading messages on some of the hundreds of quilts made by transgender people from around the country.",
      "The \u201cFreedom to Be\u201d quilt project was there to raise awareness of the transgender community, which has been under fire from President Donald Trump. The messages ranged from defiance to hopes for acceptance. \u201cI hope there are days when you fall in love with being alive,\" said one. And on another: \u201cTHERE\u2019S A LAND THAT I SEE WHERE THE CHILDREN SHOULD BE FREE.\"",
      "Abdool Corlette, head of brand for the American Civil Liberties Union and a co-creator of the project, said a message needed to be sent.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing across the board an attempt to erase trans folks from all public life,\" Corlette said. \"And we knew that we need to take up space. We needed to memorialize people\u2019s stories and do it in the literal backyard of the Capitol.\u201d",
      "Gillian Branstetter, his co-creator and communications strategist at the ACLU's Women's Project, said actions like the Republican president's executive order that affects military personnel are abstract to some but have real impacts in the transgender community where health care is threatened, along with the loss of jobs and threats of violence.",
      "The scene was anything but solemn 3 miles north of the Mall, inside the student center at Howard University, one of the nation's renowned historically Black universities. It was festive and bright, filled with joy and shouts of encouragement and music as members of various groups \u2014 called houses \u2014 competed in events that included fashion modeling and dance at the Cirque du Slay Ball.",
      "One attendee, John Smith III (stage name IconFatty Prodigy), said the balls are modeled on Cirque du Soleil and are about community and safe spaces. Iran Paylor (stage name Bang Garcon) said the houses are places set up by LGBTQ communities to give safe spaces to others estranged from their families and ostracized within the Black community when they came out.",
      "D.C. Black Pride began in 1975 at the ClubHouse, founded by members of the city's LGBTQ community. Over the years, an event around Memorial Day became a tradition. The ClubHouse closed in 1990, but three members of the community kept the tradition going. The first Black Gay and Lesbian Pride event was held on May 25, 1991.",
      "Hutton is the president and CEO of the Center for Black Equity, founded in 1999 as a way to bring together all of the Black pride movements that were being created around the country following the model in Washington. There are 54 in the United States and 12 internationally, he said.",
      "As a Black gay man, Hutton already had battles on multiple fronts. Now there is an additional category to worry about.",
      "\"I'm also a child of immigrants, just to add that on top of my intersections,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m always paying attention to immigration conversations. It\u2019s very hard navigating the world right now.\u201d",
      "But, he said, his responsibility is to use the access he has developed over the years to create safe spaces. \"So even though it is difficult to navigate and listen to the news every day, I also understand that I\u2019ve been given this task.\u201d",
      "The job has been hard this year. Sponsors have pulled out of the celebrations and he knows some international travelers are not coming due to fear they will have difficulties with law enforcement.",
      "Hutton understands why various groups want individual activities; one version will not accommodate all audiences. But the cornerstone of Black pride is community. \u201cWe have the opportunity to really showcase all of these communities to the world,\u201d he said.",
      "In the end, he said, he wants one message to resound after the gathering of communities: \u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll continue pushing our rights forward, not just for us in America,\u201d Hutton said. \u201cAs someone told me, when America sneezes, the world catches a cold. So we have to make sure that America doesn\u2019t catch a cold.\u201d",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- One program distributes laptops in rural Iowa. Another helped people get back online after Hurricane Helene washed away computers and phones in western North Carolina. Programs in Oregon and rural Alabama teach older people, including some who have never touched a computer, how to navigate in an increasingly digital world.",
      "It all came crashing down this month when President Donald Trump \u2014 on his own digital platform, Truth Social \u2014 announced his intention to end the Digital Equity Act, a federal grant program meant to help bridge the digital divide. He branded it as \u201cRACIST and ILLEGAL\u201d and said it amounts to \u201cwoke handouts based on race.\u201d He said it was an \u201cILLEGAL $2.5 BILLION DOLLAR giveaway,\" though the program was actually funded with $2.75 billion.",
      "The name seemed innocuous enough when the program was approved by Congress in 2021 as part of a $65 billion investment meant to bring internet access to every home and business in the United States. The broadband program itself was a key component of the $1 trillion infrastructure law pushed through by the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "The Digital Equity Act was intended to fill gaps and cover unmet needs that surfaced during the massive broadband rollout. It gave states and tribes flexibility to deliver high-speed internet access to families that could not afford it, computers to kids who did not have them, telehealth access to older adults in rural areas, and training and job skills to veterans.",
      "Whether Trump has the legal authority to end the program remains unknown. But for now the Republican administration can simply stop spending the money.",
      "\u201cI just felt my heart break for what we were finally, finally in this country, going to address, the digital divide,\" said Angela Siefer, executive director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance, a nonprofit that was awarded \u2014 but has not received \u2014 a $25.7 million grant to work with groups across the country to help provide access to technology. \u201cThe digital divide is not just physical access to the internet, it is being able to use that to do what you need to do.\u201d",
      "While the name of the program likely got it targeted \u2014 the Trump administration has been aggressively scrubbing the government of programs that promote diversity, equity or inclusion \u2014 the Digital Equity Act was supposed to be broader in scope.",
      "Though Trump called it racist, the words \u201crace\u201d or \u201cracial\u201d appear just twice in the law\u2019s text: once, alongside \u201ccolor, religion, national origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or disability,\u201d in a passage stating that no groups should be excluded from funding, and later, in a list of covered populations, along with older adults, veterans, people with disabilities, English learners, people with low literacy levels and rural Americans.",
      "\u201cDigital Equity passed with overwhelming bipartisan support,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the act's chief proponent, in a statement. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because my Republican colleagues have heard the same stories as I have \u2014 like kids in rural communities forced to drive to McDonalds parking lots for Wi-Fi to do their homework.",
      "\"It is insane \u2014 absolutely nuts \u2014 that Trump is blocking resources to help make sure kids in rural school districts can get hot spots or laptops, all because he doesn\u2019t like the word equity!\u201d",
      "The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, which administers the program, declined to comment. It\u2019s not entirely clear how much of the $2.75 billion has been awarded, though last March the NTIA announced the allocation of $811 million to states, territories and tribes.",
      "On a recent morning in Portland, Oregon, Brandon Dorn was among those taking a keyboard basics class offered by Free Geek, a nonprofit that provides free courses to help people learn to use computers. The class was offered at a low-income housing building to make it accessible for residents.",
      "Dorn and the others were given laptops and shown the different functions of keys: control, shift and caps lock, how to copy and paste. They played a typing game that taught finger and key placement on a color-coded keyboard.",
      "Dorn, 63, said the classes helped because \u201cin this day and age, everything has to go through the computer.\u201d He said it helped him feel more confident and less dependent on his children or grandchildren to do things such as making appointments online.",
      "\u201cFolks my age, we didn\u2019t get this luxury because we were too busy working, raising the family,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is a great way to help us help ourselves.\u201d",
      "Juan Muro, Free Geek\u2019s executive director, said participants get the tools and skills they need to access things like online banking, job applications, online education programs and telehealth. He said Trump's move to end funding has put nonprofits such as Free Geek in a precarious position, forcing them to make up the difference through their own fundraising and \u201cbeg for money to just provide individuals with essential stuff.\"",
      "Sara Nichols works for the Land of Sky Regional Council, a multicounty planning and development organization in western North Carolina. On the Friday before Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, the organization received notice that it was approved for a grant. But like other groups The Associated Press contacted, it has not seen any money.",
      "Land of Sky had spent a lot of resources helping people recover from last year's storms. The award notice, Nichols said, came as \u201cincredible news.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut between this and the state losing, getting their letters terminated, we feel just like stuck. What are we going to do? How are we going to move forward? How are we going to let our communities continue to fall behind?\u201d",
      "More than one-fifth of Americans do not have broadband internet access at home, according to the Pew Research Center. In rural communities, the number jumps to 27 percent.",
      "Beyond giving people access to technology and fast internet, many programs funded by the Digital Equity Act sought to provide \u201cdigital navigators\u201d \u2014 human helpers to guide people new to the online world.",
      "\u201cIn the United States we do not have a consistent source of funding to help individuals get online, understand how to be safe online and how to use that technology to accomplish all the things that are required now as part of life that are online,\u201d said Siefer of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance.",
      "This includes everything from providing families with internet hot spots so they can get online at home to helping seniors avoid online scams.",
      "\u201cHealth, workforce, education, jobs, everything, right?\u201d Siefer said. \u201cThis law was going to be the start for the U.S. to figure out this issue. It\u2019s a new issue in the big scheme of things, because now technology is no longer a nice-to-have. You have to have the internet and you have to know how to use the technology just to survive, let alone to thrive today.\u201d",
      "Siefer said the word \u201cequity\u201d in the name probably prompted Trump to target the program for elimination.",
      "\u201cBut it means that he didn\u2019t actually look at what this program does,\" she said. \"Because who doesn\u2019t want grandma to be safe online? Who doesn\u2019t want a veteran to be able to talk to their doctor rather than get in a car and drive two hours? Who doesn\u2019t want students to be able to do their homework?\u201d",

      "The U.S. military spent more than $6 billion over the past three years to recruit and retain service members, in what's been a growing campaign to counter enlistment shortfalls",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. military spent more than $6 billion over the past three years to recruit and retain service members, in what has been a growing campaign to counter enlistment shortfalls.",
      "The financial incentives to reenlist in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines increased dramatically from 2022 through last year, with the Navy vastly outspending the others, according to funding totals provided by the services. The overall amount of recruiting bonuses also rose steadily, fueled by significant jumps in spending by the Army and Marine Corps.",
      "The military services have routinely poured money into recruiting and retention bonuses over the years. But the totals spiked as Pentagon leaders tried to reverse falling enlistment numbers, particularly as COVID-19 restrictions locked down public events, fairs and school visits that recruiters relied on to meet with young people.",
      "Coupled with an array of new programs, an increased number of recruiters and adjustments to enlistment requirements, the additional incentives have helped the services bounce back from the shortfalls. All but the Navy met their recruiting targets last year and all are expected to do so this year.",
      "President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth repeatedly point to Trump\u2019s election as a reason for the recruiting rebound. But the enlistment increases began long before last November, and officials have tied them more directly to the widespread overhauls that the services have done, including the increased financial incentives.",
      "The Army, the military's largest service, spent more on recruiting bonuses in 2022 and 2024 than the other services. But it was significantly outspent by the Navy in 2023, when the sea service was struggling to overcome a large enlistment shortfall.",
      "As a result, even though the Navy is a smaller service, it spent more overall in the three years than the Army did.",
      "The Navy also has spent considerably more than the others to entice sailors to reenlist, doling out retention bonuses to roughly 70,000 service members for each of the past three years. That total is more than double the number of troops the Army gave retention bonuses to each year, even though the Army is a much larger service.",
      "\u201cNavy is dedicated to retaining our most capable sailors; retention is a critical component of achieving our end-strength goals,\u201d Adm. James Kilby, the vice chief of naval operations, told a Senate Armed Services subcommittee in March.",
      "He said reenlistment for enlisted sailors \u201cremains healthy\u201d but officers are a challenge in specific jobs, including aviation, explosive ordnance disposal, surface and submarine warfare, health professionals and naval special operations. He added that the Navy has struggled to fill all of its at-sea jobs and is using financial incentives as one way to combat the problem.",
      "The Army has seen the greatest recruiting struggles over the past decade, and by using a range of new programs and policies has had one of the largest comebacks. The Navy has had the most trouble more recently, and took a number of steps to expand those eligible for service and spend more in bonuses.",
      "While the Army spends hundreds of millions each year to recruit troops, it also has relied on an array of new programs and policies to woo young people. A key driver of the Army's rebound has been its decision to create the Future Soldier Prep Course, at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in August 2022.",
      "That program gives lower-performing recruits up to 90 days of academic or fitness instruction to help them meet military standards and move on to basic training. It has resulted in thousands of enlistments.",
      "The Air Force increased its spending on recruiting bonuses in 2023 as it also struggled to overcome shortfalls, but lowered the amount the following year. The payments were for jobs including munitions systems, aircraft maintenance and security forces. The Space Force does not currently authorize enlistment bonuses.",
      "The Marine Corps and the tiny Space Force have consistently hit their recruiting goals, although the Marines had to dig deep into their pool of delayed entry candidates in 2022 to meet their target. The Corps, which is much smaller than the Army and Air Force, spends the least on bonuses and tends to spread the amount among a larger number of service members.",
      "Maj. Jacoby Getty, a Marine spokesman, said the spike in retention bonuses from $126 million in 2023 to $201 million in 2024 was because Marines were allowed to reenlist a year early for the first time. More than 7,000 Marines got bonuses as a result, a jump of nearly 2,200 over the previous year.",
      "When asked about bonuses in 2023, Gen. Eric Smith, the Marine commandant, famously told a naval conference that \u201cyour bonus is you get to call yourself a Marine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s your bonus, right?\" he said. \"There\u2019s no dollar amount that goes with that.\u201d",
      "The services tailor their recruiting and retention money to bolster harder-to-fill jobs, including cyber, intelligence and special operations forces. The Army and Marine Corps also use the money to woo troops to some combat, armor and artillery jobs.",

      "In addition to being the spiritual leader for what the church says is roughly 1.4 billion Catholics worldwide, Leo is also the head of what's recognized as the world's smallest nation.",
      "Vatican City covers just 0.17 square miles (0.44 square kilometers) and has a population of a few hundred people. It became an independent state in 1929 under a treaty between Italy and the Holy See.",

      "The State Department declined to comment on the pope\u2019s status. A spokesperson said the department doesn\u2019t discuss the citizenship of individuals.",
      "The core issue is whether foreign leaders should hold American citizenship when they also enjoy broad immunity from U.S. laws, said Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor and an expert on citizenship law. Such immunity clashes with the constitutional principle that no U.S. citizen should be above the law.",
      "However, the U.S. Supreme Court in a 1980 decision ruled that Americans can't be stripped of their citizenship unless they intentionally renounce it.",
      "\u201cThe State Department never assumes that you intend to lose your citizenship unless you specifically say so through the renunciation process,\u201d Spiro said.",
      "He said it would be hard to argue that Leo, by becoming pope, demonstrated an intent to give up being a U.S. citizen.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s highly unlikely that the U.S. moves to terminate the pope\u2019s citizenship,\u201d Spiro said.",
      "Peruvian law has no conflict with Pope Leo remaining a citizen, said Jorge Puch, deputy director of registry archives at Peru\u2019s National Registry of Identification and Civil Status.",
      "Leo was granted Peruvian citizenship in August 2015, the month before Pope Francis appointed him bishop of Chiclayo in the South American country's northern region. To qualify, he had to live in Peru for at least two years and pass a civics test.",
      "\u201cIt is the most praiseworthy thing our beloved supreme pontiff could have done: Wanting to have Peruvian nationality without having been Peruvian by birth,\u201d Puch said.",
      "All adult Peruvians, including naturalized citizens, are required to vote in elections through age 69. Voting in Peru's presidential election next April won't be mandatory for Leo. He turns 70 in September.",
      "It's not clear what happened to the citizenship status of Leo's predecessors once they became pope. That's not information the Vatican discloses.",

      "Hercules is also the chief ambassador, soaking in affection from passengers inside the terminal while calming some nervously waiting to board a flight at West Virginia International Yeager Airport.",
      "Chris Keyser, the dogs\u2019 handler and the airport\u2019s wildlife specialist, said preventing a bird from hitting a plane \u201ccan make a difference for someone\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "Collisions between wildlife and planes are common at airports nationwide. With that in mind, Yeager management in 2018 bought Hercules at the recommendation of a wildlife biologist.",
      "Hercules spent the first 18 months of his life training to herd geese and sheep around his birthplace at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Flyaway Geese, which teaches border collies to help businesses address nuisance wildlife problems.",
      "When Hercules stepped onto Charleston\u2019s airfield for the first time, \u201cI held my breath,\u201d Flyaway Geese owner Rebecca Gibson said. \u201cBut boy, he took hold of the reins. It was his place.",
      "\"He\u2019s done an amazing job and has just been a great dog for them. We\u2019re very proud of him.\u201d",
      "Along the way, Hercules became a local celebrity. He has his own Instagram and TikTok accounts and regularly hosts groups of schoolchildren.",
      "Now 8, Hercules has some help. Ned was 2 when he was welcomed into the fold last year from another kennel where he trained to herd goats and geese. Ned has shadowed Hercules, following commands from Keyser and learning safety issues such as not venturing onto the runway.",
      "\u201cNed\u2019s ready to go,\u201d Keyser said. \u201cHe\u2019s picked up on all that. He\u2019s doing fantastic, running birds off.\u201d",
      "Inside the airport operations center, Hercules is laid back until he's told it\u2019s time to work, barking at the door in anticipation. Ned, on the other hand, is always moving. When not outside, he\u2019ll bring his blue bouncy ball to anyone willing to play fetch.",
      "Charleston\u2019s airport is on top of a mountain and has a menagerie of wildlife, including Canada geese, hawks, ducks, songbirds and bats. After it rains, worms come to the surface and cause an increase in bird activity, Keyser said.",
      "In addition to taking the dogs on their regular rounds, Keyser is in constant contact with the airport tower, which looks for birds on the field or relays reports from airplanes that see wildlife nearby.",
      "\u201cWe get plenty of exercise,\u201d Keyser said. \u201cYou don\u2019t gain no weight in this job. It\u2019s an all-day job. You\u2019re always got your eyes on the field, you\u2019ve got your ears open listening to the radio.\"",
      "Border collies are among the most energetic dog breeds. They've been used for decades to shoo Canada geese off golf courses. They've also scared away birds at other airports, military bases, and locks and dams.",
      "The dogs' instincts are to herd, not to kill. \u201cBut in the mind of the bird, they\u2019re no different than a coyote or a fox, which is a natural predator for the bird,\u201d Gibson said.",
      "About 19,000 strikes involving planes and wildlife occurred at U.S. airports in 2023, of which 95% involved birds, according to a Federal Aviation Administration database. From 1988 to 2023, wildlife collisions in the U.S. killed 76 people and destroyed 126 aircraft.",
      "Perhaps the most famous bird-plane strike occurred in January 2009 when a flight from New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport almost immediately flew into a flock of Canada geese, knocking out both engines. Pilot Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger guided the powerless jet into the frigid Hudson River. All 155 people on board survived the incident, which was captured in the 2016 movie \u201cSully,\u201d starring Tom Hanks.",
      "At the Charleston airport, wildlife-plane incidents vary each year from a few to a couple dozen.",
      "\u201cAnytime a plane hits a bird, it has to be inspected, and it causes a delay in the flight,\u201d Keyser said. \u201cAnd sometimes you don\u2019t make your connecting flights. So that\u2019s how important it is to keep everything going smooth.\u201d",
      "In 2022 alone, there were five airplane strikes at the airport involving bats. In December 2000, a plane collided with two deer after landing. The tip of the right engine propeller blade separated and punctured the plane\u2019s fuselage, seriously injuring a passenger, according to the FAA.",
      "Inside the terminal, Hercules wags his tail as he moves about greeting passengers. Among them was Janet Spry, a Scott Depot, West Virginia, resident waiting to board a flight to visit her daughter and grandchildren in San Antonio.",
      "Spry needed a bit of cheering up. In addition to having a fear of flying, Spry's 15-year-old cat was euthanized the previous day after being diagnosed with an inoperable condition.",
      "An impromptu visit from Hercules brought a smile \u2014 and more. Hercules placed a paw on Spry\u2019s arm and delivered plenty of wet kisses.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s making my day better,\u201d Spry said.",
      "She also joked whether the airport might want to let Hercules stay with her a while longer.",
      "\u201cI think there was an empty seat on the plane beside me,\u201d Spry said.",

      "Religious services, concerts and vigils are scheduled to mark the fifth anniversary of George Floyd\u2019s murder by a police officer in the cities where Floyd grew up and where he died",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Religious services, concerts and vigils are set to mark Sunday\u2019s fifth anniversary of George Floyd\u2019s murder by a Minneapolis police officer even as police reform and civil rights activists face what they see as a backlash from the Trump administration.",
      "Events in Minneapolis center around George Floyd Square, the intersection where police Officer Derek Chauvin used his knee to pin Floyd's neck to the pavement for 9 1/2 minutes, even as the 46-year-old Black man's cried \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d",
      "The events started Friday with concerts, a street festival and a \u201cself-care fair,\u201d and culminate with a worship service, gospel music concert and candlelight vigil on Sunday.",
      "In Houston, where Floyd grew up, family members planned to gather Sunday at his gravesite for a memorial service led by the Rev. Al Sharpton. In a park about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) away, a memorial service will take place, followed by five hours of music, preaching and poetry readings and a balloon release.",
      "The remembrances come at a fraught moment for activists, who had hoped the worldwide protests that followed Floyd's murder on May 25, 2020, would lead to permanent police reform across the U.S. and a continued focus on racial justice issues.",
      "Even with Minneapolis officials' promises to remake the police department, some activists contend the progress has come at a glacial pace.",
      "\u201cWe understand that change takes time,\u201d Michelle Gross, president of Communities United Against Police Brutality, said in a statement last week. \u201cHowever, the progress being claimed by the city is not being felt in the streets.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration moved Wednesday to cancel settlements with Minneapolis and Louisville that called for an overhaul of their police departments following the Floyd's murder and the killing of Breonna Taylor. Under Democratic President Joe Biden, the U.S. Justice Department had aggressively pushed for aggressive oversight of local police it had accused of widespread abuses.",
      "Trump also declared an end to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives within the federal government and his administration is using federal funds as leverage to force local governments, universities and public school districts to do the same. Republican-led states also have accelerated their efforts to stamp out DEI initiatives.",

      "A massive loggerhead sea turtle that was hit by a boat off Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast arrived at a turtle hospital in need of medical care",
      "JUNO BEACH, Fla. -- A massive loggerhead sea turtle hit by a boat off Florida's Atlantic coast arrived at a turtle hospital needing medical care, but at 302 pounds (137 kilograms), Pennywise was too large to fit their equipment.",
      "So the veterinary team at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach took her to nearby Jupiter Medical Center, hoping she could get a CT scan on a human machine. She was too big for that, as well.",
      "They quickly came up with another plan: taking Pennywise to Palm Beach Equine Clinic in Wellington, where the scan was performed on equipment designed for horses.",
      "\u201cAnd, luckily, the horse-sized machine was big enough to fit this lady through,\" Heather Barron, the chief science officer and veterinarian at Loggerhead, told The Associated Press.",
      "Turns out, they also got a nice surprise: Images showed that Pennywise is carrying eggs.",
      "\u201cWe hope we\u2019ll be able to get her back out there into the wild as soon as possible so that she can lay those eggs,\" Barron said.",
      "Loggerheads, an endangered species, often lay multiple clutches during a season, she said.",
      "Pennywise arrived at the center Monday, after a crew from Inwater Research Group found her floating in the Atlantic with significant blunt force trauma to her shell that had already started to heal.",
      "The staff at the Juno Beach turtle center estimated that Pennywise's injuries were about a month old. Barron said the imaging showed some damage to bones that surround the spinal cord. They have the turtle on high-powered antibiotics.",
      "\"Luckily, right now, her neurologic exam shows that all those nerves are intact. And that is a great sign for her. We\u2019re very excited about that and we\u2019ll just be rechecking to make sure that we have no progression of the disease, and as soon as we feel like that wound is healed well enough, she can go back out into the wild.\u201d",
      "Even so, Barron said, Pennywise's story is a \u201ctextbook case of a turtle returning to the area for mating and nesting season, only to fall victim to an entirely preventable boat-strike injury.\u201d",
      "Because nesting season in Florida runs from March 1 to Oct. 31, officials at the sea turtle center are encouraging boaters to slow down and to be especially mindful in what they refer to as the Sea Turtle Protection Zone, which extends a mile (1.6 kilometers) off the coast.",

      "In the Houston housing project where he grew up, George Floyd was respected as a man who spoke from hard, but hardly extraordinary, experience",
      "HOUSTON -- Years before a bystander\u2019s video of George Floyd\u2019s last moments turned his name into a global cry for justice, Floyd trained a camera on himself.",
      "\u201cI just want to speak to you all real quick,\u201d Floyd says in one video, addressing the young men in his neighborhood who looked up to him. His 6-foot-7 frame crowds the picture.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got my shortcomings and my flaws and I ain\u2019t better than nobody else,\u201d he says. \u201cBut, man, the shootings that\u2019s going on, I don\u2019t care what \u2018hood you\u2019re from, where you\u2019re at, man. I love you and God loves you. Put them guns down.\u201d",
      "___",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: The Associated Press initially published this profile of George Floyd on June 10, 2020. The fifth anniversary of George Floyd's murder is May 25, 2025.",
      "___",
      "At the time, Floyd was respected as a man who spoke from hard, but hardly extraordinary, experience. He had nothing remotely like the stature he has gained in death, embraced as a universal symbol of the need to overhaul policing and held up as a heroic everyman.",
      "But the reality of his 46 years on Earth, including sharp edges and setbacks Floyd himself acknowledged, was both much fuller and more complicated.",
      "Once a star athlete with dreams of turning pro and enough talent to win a partial scholarship, Floyd returned home only to bounce between jobs before serving nearly five years in prison. Intensely proud of his roots in Houston\u2019s Third Ward and admired as a mentor in a public housing project beset by poverty, he decided the only way forward was to leave it behind.",
      "\u201cHe had made some mistakes that cost him some years of his life,\u201d said Ronnie Lillard, a friend and rapper who performs under the name Reconcile. \u201cAnd when he got out of that, I think the Lord greatly impacted his heart.\u201d",
      "___",
      "Floyd was born in North Carolina. But his mother, a single parent, moved the family to Houston when he was 2, to search for work. They settled in the Cuney Homes, a low-slung warren of more than 500 apartments south of downtown nicknamed \u201cThe Bricks.\u201d",
      "The neighborhood, for decades a cornerstone of Houston\u2019s Black community, has gentrified in recent years. Texas Southern University, a historically Black campus directly across the street from the projects, has long held itself out as a launchpad for those willing to strive. But many residents struggle, with incomes about half the city average and unemployment nearly four times higher, even before the recent economic collapse.",
      "Yeura Hall, who grew up next door to Floyd, said even in the Third Ward other kids looked down on those who lived in public housing. To deflect the teasing, he, Floyd and other boys made up a song about themselves: \u201cI don\u2019t want to grow up, I\u2019m a Cuney Homes kid. They got so many rats and roaches I can play with.\u201d",
      "Larcenia Floyd invested her hopes in her son, who as a second-grader wrote that he dreamed of being a U.S. Supreme Court justice.",
      "\u201cShe thought that he would be the one that would bring them out of poverty and struggle,\u201d said Travis Cains, a longtime friend.",
      "Floyd was a star tight end for the football team at Jack Yates High School, playing for the losing side in the 1992 state championship game at Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin.",
      "He was an atypical football player. \u201cWe used to call him \u2018Big Friendly,\u2019\u201d said Cervaanz Williams, a former teammate.",
      "\u201cIf you said something to him, his head would drop,\u201d said Maurice McGowan, his football coach. \u201cHe just wasn\u2019t going to ball up and act like he wanted to fight you.\u201d",
      "On the basketball court, Floyd\u2019s height and strength won attention from George Walker, a former assistant coach at the University of Houston hired for the head job at what is now South Florida State College. The school was a 17-hour drive away, in a small town, but high school administrators and Floyd\u2019s mother urged him to go, Walker said.",
      "\u201cThey wanted George to really get out of the neighborhood, to do something, be something,\u201d Walker said.",
      "In Avon Park, Florida, Floyd and a few other players from Houston stood out for their size, accents and city cool. They lived in the Jacaranda Hotel, a historic lodge used as a dormitory, and were known as the \u201cJac Boys.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was always telling me about the Third Ward of Houston, how rough it was, but how much he loved it,\u201d said Robert Caldwell, a friend and fellow student who frequently traveled with the basketball team. \u201cHe said people know how to grind, as hard as it is, people know how to love.\u201d",
      "After two years in Avon Park, Floyd spent a year at Texas A&M University in Kingsville before returning to Houston and his mother\u2019s apartment to find jobs in construction and security.",
      "Larcenia Floyd, known throughout the neighborhood as Ms. Cissy, welcomed her son\u2019s friends from childhood, offering their apartment as a refuge when their lives grew stressful. When a neighbor went to prison on drug charges, Ms. Cissy took in the woman\u2019s pre-teen son, Cal Wayne, deputizing George to play older brother for the next 2\u00bd years.",
      "\u201cWe would steal his jerseys and put his jerseys on and run around the house, go outside, jerseys all the way down to our ankles because he was so big and we were little,\u201d said Wayne, now a well-known rapper who credits Floyd with encouraging him to pursue music.",
      "George Floyd, he said, \u201cwas like a superhero.\u201d",
      "___",
      "Floyd, too, dabbled in music, occasionally invited to rap with Robert Earl Davis Jr., better known as DJ Screw, whose mixtapes have since been recognized as influential in charting Houston\u2019s place as a hotbed of hip-hop.",
      "But then, the man known throughout Cuney as \u201cBig Floyd\u201d started finding trouble.",
      "Between 1997 and 2005, Floyd was arrested several times on drug and theft charges, spending months in jail. Around that time, Wayne\u2019s mother, Sheila Masters, recalled running into Floyd in the street and learning he was homeless.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s so tall he\u2019d pat me on my head ... and say, \u2018Mama you know it\u2019s going to be all right,\u2019\u201d Masters said.",
      "In August 2007, Floyd was arrested and charged with aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Investigators said he and five other men barged into a woman\u2019s apartment, and Floyd pushed a pistol into her abdomen before searching for items to steal. Floyd pleaded guilty in 2009 and was sentenced to five years in prison. By the time he was paroled, in January 2013, he was nearing 40.",
      "\u201cHe came home with his head on right,\u201d said friend Travis Cains.",
      "At a Christian rap concert in the Third Ward, Floyd met Lillard and pastor Patrick \u201cPT\u201d Ngwolo, whose ministry was looking for ways to reach residents in Cuney Homes. Floyd, who seemed to know everyone in the project, volunteered to be their guide.",
      "Soon Floyd was setting up a washtub on the Cuney basketball courts for baptisms by Ngwolo\u2019s newly formed Resurrection Houston congregation. He joined three-on-three basketball tournaments and barbecues, organized by the ministry. He knocked on doors with Ngwolo, introducing residents as candidates for grocery deliveries or Bible study.",
      "Another pastor, Christopher Johnson, recalled Floyd stopping by his office while Johnson\u2019s mother was visiting. Decades had passed since Johnson\u2019s mother had been a teacher at Floyd\u2019s high school. It didn\u2019t matter. He wrapped her in a bear hug.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he ever thought of himself as being big,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of big dudes here, but he was a gentleman and a diplomat and I\u2019m not putting any sauce on it.\u201d",
      "On the streets of Cuney, Floyd was increasingly embraced as an O.G. \u2014 literally \u201coriginal gangster,\u201d bestowed as a title of respect for a mentor who had learned from life experience.",
      "In Tiffany Cofield\u2019s classroom at a neighborhood charter school, some of her male students \u2014 many of whom had already had brushes with the law \u2014 told her to talk to \u201cBig Floyd\u201d if she wanted to understand.",
      "Floyd would listen patiently as she voiced her frustrations with students\u2019 bad behavior, she said. And he would try to explain the life of a young man in the projects.",
      "After school, Floyd often met up with her students outside a corner store.",
      "\u201cHow\u2019s school going?\u201d he would ask. \u201cAre you being respectful? How\u2019s your mom? How\u2019s your grandma?\u201d",
      "___",
      "In 2014, Floyd began exploring the possibility of leaving the neighborhood.",
      "As the father of five children from several relationships, he had bills to pay. And despite his stature in Cuney, everyday life could be trying. More than once, Floyd ended up in handcuffs when police came through the projects and detained a large number of men, Cofield said.",
      "\u201cHe would show by example: \u2018Yes, officer. No, officer.\u2019 Very respectful. Very calm tone,\u201d she said.",
      "A friend of Floyd\u2019s had already moved to the Twin Cities as part of a church discipleship program that offered men a route to self-sufficiency by changing their environment and helping them find jobs.",
      "\u201cHe was looking to start over fresh, a new beginning,\u201d said Christopher Harris, who preceded Floyd to Minneapolis. Friends provided Floyd with money and clothing to ease the transition.",
      "In Minneapolis, Floyd found a job as a security guard at the Salvation Army\u2019s Harbor Light Center, the city\u2019s largest homeless shelter.",
      "\u201cHe would regularly walk a couple of female co-workers out ... at night and make sure they got to their cars safely and securely,\u201d said Brian Molohon, director of development for the Army\u2019s Minnesota office. \u201cJust a big strong guy, but with a very tender side.\u201d",
      "Floyd left after a little over a year, training to drive trucks while working as a bouncer at a club called Conga Latin Bistro.",
      "\u201cHe would dance badly to make people laugh,\u201d said the owner, Jovanni Thunstrom. \u201cI tried to teach him how to dance because he loved Latin music, but I couldn\u2019t because he was too tall for me.\u201d",
      "Floyd kept his connection to Houston, regularly returning to Cuney.",
      "When Houston hosted the Super Bowl in 2017, Floyd was back in town, hosting a party at the church with music and free AIDS testing. He came back again for his mother\u2019s funeral the next year. And when Cains spoke with him last, a few weeks ago, Floyd was planning another trip for this summer.",
      "By then, Floyd was out of work. Early this spring, Thunstrom cut Floyd\u2019s job when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the club to close.",
      "On the evening of Memorial Day, Floyd was with two others when convenience store employees accused him of paying for cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill, then called the police. Less than an hour later, Floyd breathed his last.",
      "Those who knew him search for meaning in his death.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve come to the belief that he was chosen,\u201d said Cofield, the teacher. \u201cOnly this could have happened to him because of who he was and the amount of love that he had for people, people had for him.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a small comfort, she admits. But, then, in Big Floyd\u2019s neighborhood, people have long made do with less.",

      "NEW YORK -- A cryptocurrency investor has been arrested and charged with kidnapping a man and keeping him locked up for weeks in an upscale Manhattan apartment, where authorities say he was beaten, shocked and led to believe that his family was in danger if he didn't give up his Bitcoin password.",
      "John Woeltz, 37, was arrested Friday night after the victim escaped from the eight-bedroom town house and flagged down a traffic officer on the street for help, according to prosecutors.",
      "Woeltz was arraigned Saturday on charges of kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a firearm, court records show. He was ordered held without bail, a spokesperson for the Manhattan district attorney's office confirmed Saturday.",
      "His lawyer, Wayne Gosnell, said Saturday in an email that he had no comment.",
      "The 28-year-old victim arrived in New York City from Italy in early May, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing investigation and did so on condition of anonymity.",
      "It's not clear how or if the two knew each other, but the district attorney's office said in an email that prosecutor Michael Mattson told a judge Saturday that the victim, whose name has not been released, was abducted on May 6.",
      "Mattson said others were involved in the scheme to empty the victim\u2019s Bitcoin wallet. That includes a person referred to in court records as an \u201cunapprehended male.\u201d",
      "The victim said he was bound by the wrists and tortured for weeks inside the apartment. His captors, according to prosecutors, drugged him, used electric wires to shock him, hit him in the head with a firearm and, at one point, carried him to the top of a flight of stairs where they dangled him over a ledge and threatened to kill him if he didn't share his Bitcoin password.",
      "Believing that he was about to be shot, the victim was able to escape Friday after telling Woeltz that he would give up his password, which was stored on his laptop in another room. When the suspect turned his back, Mattson said, the victim ran out of the apartment.",
      "The victim was taken to a hospital and treated for injuries that Mattson said were consistent with his descriptions of being bound and assaulted.",
      "A search of the town house turned up a trove of evidence, Mattson said, including cocaine, a saw, chicken wire, body armor and night vision goggles, ammunition and polaroid photos of the victim with a gun pointed to his head.",
      "Woeltz was ordered Saturday to surrender his passport. Prosecutors said he has the means to flee, including a private jet and a helicopter. He is due back in Manhattan criminal court next week.",

      "A GOP proposal would make the state the nation's largest with such a mandate.",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas would require all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments under a Republican proposal that cleared a major vote Saturday and would make the state the nation's largest to impose such a mandate.",
      "If passed as expected, the measure is likely to draw a legal challenge from critics who consider it a constitutional violation of the separation of church and state.",
      "The Republican-controlled House gave its preliminary approval with a final vote expected in the next few days. That would send the bill to the desk of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who has indicated he will sign it into law.",
      "\u201cThe focus of this bill is to look at what is historically important to our nation educationally and judicially,\u201d said Republican state representative Candy Noble, a co-sponsor of the bill.",
      "Two other states, Louisiana and Arkansas, have similar laws, but Louisiana's is on hold after a federal judge found that it was \u201c unconstitutional on its face.\u201d",
      "Those measures are among efforts, mainly in conservative-led states, to insert religion into public schools. The vote in Texas came after the U.S. Supreme Court effectively ended a publicly funded Catholic charter school in Oklahoma on Thursday with a 4-4 tie following a string of high court decisions in recent years that have allowed public funds to flow to religious entities.",
      "Texas lawmakers also have passed and sent to Abbott a measure that allows school districts to provide students and staff a daily voluntary period of prayer or time to read a religious text during school hours. Abbott is expected to sign it.",
      "\u201cWe should be encouraging our students to read and study their Bible every day,\u201d Republican state Rep. Brent Money said. \u201cOur kids in our public schools need prayer, need Bible reading, more now than they ever have.\u201d",
      "Supporters of requiring the Ten Commandments in classrooms say they are part of the foundation of the United States' judicial and educational systems and should be displayed.",
      "But critics, including some Christian and other faith leaders, say the Ten Commandments and prayer measures would infringe on the religious freedom of others.",
      "The Ten Commandments bill requires public schools to post in classrooms a 16-by-20-inch (41-by-51-centimeter) poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments, even though translations and interpretations vary across denominations, faiths and languages and may differ in homes and houses of worship.",
      "Democratic lawmakers made several failed attempts Saturday to amend the bill to require schools display other religious texts or provide multiple translations of the commandments.",
      "A letter signed this year by dozens of Christian and Jewish faith leaders opposing the bill noted that Texas has thousands of students of other faiths who might have no connection to the Ten Commandments. Texas has nearly 6 million students in about 9,100 public schools.",
      "In 2005, Abbott, who was state attorney general at the time, successfully argued before the Supreme Court that Texas could keep a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of its Capitol.",

      "A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man deported to Mexico over his fears of being harmed there",
      "A federal judge ordered the Trump administration late Friday to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man it deported to Mexico in spite of his fears of being harmed there.",
      "The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge's order at the time. But the U.S. put him on a bus and sent him to Mexico instead, a removal that U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy found likely \u201clacked any semblance of due process.\u201d",
      "Mexico has since returned him to Guatemala, where he is in hiding, according to court documents. An earlier court proceeding that determined the man, identified by the initials O.C.G., risked persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala, but he also feared returning to Mexico. He presented evidence of being raped and held for ransom there while seeking asylum in the U.S.",
      "\u201cNo one has ever suggested that O.C.G. poses any sort of security threat,\u201d Murphy wrote. \u201cIn general, this case presents no special facts or legal circumstances, only the banal horror of a man being wrongfully loaded onto a bus and sent back to a country where he was allegedly just raped and kidnapped.\u201d",
      "Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said O.C.G. was in the country illegally, was \u201cgranted withholding of removal to Guatemala\u201d and was instead sent to Mexico, which she said was \u201ca safe third option for him, pending his asylum claim.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin called the judge a \u201cfederal activist judge\u201d and said the administration expects to be vindicated by a higher court.",
      "Murphy's order adds to a string of findings by federal courts against recent Trump administration deportations. Those have included other deportations to third countries and the erroneous deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran who had lived in Maryland for roughly 14 years working and raising a family.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. from a notorious Salvadoran prison, rejecting the White House\u2019s claim that it couldn\u2019t retrieve him after mistakenly deporting him. Both the White House and the El Salvadoran president have said they are powerless to return him. The Trump administration has tried to invoke the state secrets privilege, arguing that releasing details in open court \u2014 or even to the judge in private \u2013 about returning Abrego Garcia to the United States would jeopardize national security.",
      "In his Friday ruling, Murphy nodded to the dispute over the verb \u201cfacilitate\u201d in that case and others, saying that returning O.C.G. to the U.S. is not that complicated.",
      "\u201cThe Court notes that \u2018facilitate\u2019 in this context should carry less baggage than in several other notable cases,\u201d he wrote. \u201cO.C.G. is not held by any foreign government. Defendants have declined to make any argument that facilitating his return would be costly, burdensome, or otherwise impede the government\u2019s objectives.\u201d",

      "A new Alabama study of hurricane-affected homes sends a clear message to insurers and homeowners nationwide: climate-resilient construction methods can protect homes, and save a lot of money",
      "A new Alabama study of hurricane-affected homes sends a clear message to insurers and homeowners nationwide: climate-resilient construction methods can protect homes, and save a lot of money.",
      "The first-of-its-kind analysis, released this week, reviews thousands of insurance claims linked to Hurricane Sally, which struck Alabama\u2019s coast in 2020 with wind speeds up to 105 miles per hour. Homes retrofitted or built to Fortified standards, a voluntary construction code created by the nonprofit Insurance Institute for Building and Home Safety (IBHS) for wind and rain mitigation saw significantly fewer and less costly claims.",
      "If every impacted house in Mobile and Baldwin counties had met Fortified standards, insurance companies could have spent 75% less in payouts, saving up to $112 million, and policyholders could have paid up to 65% less in deductibles, saving almost $35 million, according to the study.",
      "The results show \"mitigation works and that we can build things that are resilient to climate change,\u201d said Dr. Lars Powell, director of the Center for Risk and Insurance Research at the University of Alabama\u2019s Culverhouse School of Business, which led the study with the Alabama Department of Insurance.",
      "Across the United States, insurance markets are buckling under the pressure of more frequent and expensive climate events, and federal support is shrinking for resilience projects that could reduce that damage. Officials and researchers involved with the study say it proves Alabama's proactive approach to the challenge \u2014 mandatory, sizable insurance discounts for those who use Fortified and a grant program to help them afford it \u2014 could be a national model for increasing insurability and safety.",
      "IBHS created Fortified to strengthen buildings against storm damage based on decades of research at its facility, where it uses a giant wind tunnel to pummel model houses with rain, hail, and wind up to 130 miles per hour.",
      "\u201cWe are having record breaking year after record breaking year of disasters and insured losses, and we have been searching for meaningful ways to reduce the severity and the frequency of those losses,\u201d said Fred Malik, managing director of the Fortified program.",
      "The three levels of designations \u2014 Fortified Roof, Silver and Gold \u2014 employ methods like improving roof fasteners, using impact-rated doors and windows, and more securely anchoring walls to their foundation. The program requires third-party verification of work.",
      "About 80,000 homes across 32 states now have Fortified designations, with over 53,000 in Alabama.",
      "The state began looking for ways to improve storm outcomes after Hurricane Ivan in 2004 jolted the state\u2019s insurance market. \u201cIvan was absolutely devastating,\u201d said Alabama Insurance Commissioner Mark Fowler. \u201cOur market was going crazy, insurers were leaving.\u201d",
      "It became the only state to implement mandatory minimum insurance discounts for Fortified homes, currently as much as half off the wind portion of homeowners\u2019 premiums. It also launched the Strengthen Alabama Homes incentive program, offering grants of up to $10,000 for homeowners retrofitting their houses to Fortified standards.",
      "The state has doled out $86 million for 8,700 Fortified retrofits since 2015. Fowler credits the initiative with also catalyzing demand for new Fortified construction and incentivizing contractors and inspectors to learn the standards.",
      "\u201cIt worked like gangbusters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the market substantially stabilized.\"",
      "Hurricane Sally offered researchers their first chance to assess the program\u2019s benefits in a real storm. \u201cIt really was a prototypical storm that anybody who lives on the hurricane coast is liable to see in any given year,\u201d said Malik.",
      "They collected insurance data on more than 40,000 houses in the affected area \u2014 a total insured value of $17 billion.",
      "Fortified construction reduced claim frequency by 55% to 74%, depending on the designation level, and loss severity by 14% to 40%. Despite representing almost one-quarter of the policies studied, Fortified homes accounted for only 9% of claims.",
      "They even fared better than houses built to similar codes but without the official designation, likely due to the program\u2019s more stringent verification requirements.",
      "\u201cIt really does start to bring home that there is value for everybody involved,\u201d said Malik. \u201cThere\u2019s value for the insurers, there\u2019s value for the homeowner.\u201d",
      "Fortified doesn't address all types of hurricane losses. Nearly half the claims in the study were from fallen trees, which require separate mitigation strategies.",
      "The enhanced standards do add cost: between 0.5% to 3% more for new construction, and 6% to 16% for retrofits. But the longterm benefits have spurred even disaster recovery nonprofits like Habitat for Humanity, Team Rubicon and SBP to use Fortified, often with the philanthropic support of insurers like Travelers and Allstate.",
      "\u201cHelping disaster-impacted homeowners build back smarter with storm-resilient construction and IBHS Fortified standards helps break the cycle of disaster and loss,\u201d said Thomas Corley, chief operating officer at the New Orleans-based nonprofit SBP, which has built 671 homes to Fortified standards in nine states.",
      "The potential insurance discounts also help recovering families by lowering their monthly expenses and boosting confidence that they can keep affording their homes. \u201cFor low-income families, this could mean the difference between upward mobility or years of financial instability after a disaster,\u201d said Corley.",
      "Alabama is expanding its grant program to three new counties this year. Fowler said he hopes the results encourage more insurance companies to offer wind protection on coastal homes, and that adoption will spread to less hurricane-prone areas still susceptible to severe weather.",
      "The approach has caught the attention of other states seeking resilience solutions. Fowler spoke before a California legislative committee last month in support of the California Safe Homes Act, a proposed bill that would fund grants for fire-safe roofing and defensible space to protect from wildfires.",
      "\u201cNatural disasters like windstorms, earthquakes, or wildfires will come no matter what we do,\u201d he told the committee. \u201cThat means you must find ways to build stronger before the event so you will have less damage after the event. It\u2019s actually a pretty simple concept.\u201d",

      "The alternative music community is in mourning after a private jet hit a power line in foggy weather early Thursday and crashed into a San Diego neighborhood",
      "NEW YORK -- The alternative music community is in mourning after a private jet hit a power line in foggy weather early Thursday and crashed into a San Diego neighborhood, killing multiple people on board.",
      "Among them was the groundbreaking music executive Dave Shapiro, a pillar of his music scene, and Daniel Williams, a former drummer for the popular Ohio metalcore band The Devil Wears Prada. Also killed were two employees of Shapiro's Sound Talent Group agency: Kendall Fortner, 24, and Emma Huke, 25.",
      "Both Williams and Shapiro served as success stories for their respective rock music scenes \u2014 proof that these subcultural sounds had real mainstream appeal.",
      "Williams' band, which had two releases reach the Top 10 of the Billboard 200, was a client of Sound Talent Group. He co-founded the company in 2018 with fellow agents Tim Borror and Matt Andersen, who previously worked at the Agency Group and United Talent Agency.",
      "Sound Talent Group\u2019s roster focused on bands in and across pop-punk, metalcore, post-hardcore and other popular hard rock sub-genres \u2014 such as Sum 41, Pierce the Veil, Parkway Drive, Silverstein, I Prevail \u2014 plus pop acts like the '90s brother-boy band, Hanson, best known for their song \u201cMMMBop,\u201d and \u201cA Thousand Miles (Interlude)\u201d singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton.",
      "The post-hardcore band Thursday called Shapiro, 42, an inspiration \u201cwho despite achieving success never forgot the scenes and the communities they came from.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words how much this man meant to so many of us,\u201d Pierce the Veil, which has been performing for nearly two decades including a sold-out concert this week at New York's Madison Square Garden, said in a tribute on the social platform X.",
      "The World Alive, a band signed on Shapiro's label, said he was among \u201cthe most influential and positive forces in our music scene and beyond. And Dan was one of the most influential and positive forces behind the kit.\u201d",
      "Shortly after punk rock entered the cultural zeitgeist in the late \u201970s, it inspired musical sub-movements fueled by its \u201cdo-it-yourself,\u201d community-minded ethics: hardcore punk begat post-hardcore, metalcore, emo and so on. Across decades, these music genres evolved in sound and scope, moving from underground popularity at concerts held in garages and basements to real mainstream fame, while refusing to abandon its independent ethos.",
      "Thomas Gutches, who manages Beartooth and Archetypes Collide, recalled a time when now-popular bands like The Devil Wears Prada were getting their start playing in \u201cDIY shows\u201d in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio, in which you could see 10 bands perform for $5.",
      "Shapiro was \u201csingle-handedly developing this next wave of bands that are coming in,\u201d Gutches said. \u201cHe was able to take those bands, package them together and put them on a larger scale. ... He took a risk in being like, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m going to go and take them to that next level.'\u201d",
      "These artists reached a kind of apex in the 2000s and 2010s. Once-obscure bands that had found audiences on early online social media platforms like MySpace, at the mall goth haven Hot Topic, or in the pages left-of-center publications like \u201cAlternative Press\u201d became MTV staples, celebrities in their own right.",
      "Although many of these acts played similar-yet-different music \u2014 think of the blast beats of metalcore and the palm-muted power chords of pop-punk associated with the Vans Warped Tour \u2014 they were brought together by a shared punk rock spirit. And for the last few decades, these tight-knit groups have proven to be the dominant force in alternative rock, according to Mike Shea, founder of \u201cAlternative Press,\u201d who used the word \u201ccommunity\u201d to describe the scene.",
      "Shea said Shapiro was \u201cvital\u201d in bringing these punk rock subcultures to the masses.",
      "\u201cIn this music industry, there are just too many people ripping people off and using people,\u201d he said. \u201cDave was not like that. He was a beautiful soul, and beautiful person, a guiding force, just someone who would end up being an inspiration for so many people. And he will continue to be an inspiration.\u201d",

      "The bands Shapiro represented are many of the most popular of their genre and scene, like the Grammy-nominated Sum 41 or the platinum-selling Pierce the Veil.",
      "That also includes The Devil Wears Prada, one of the best-known metalcore bands of the last few decades, celebrated for their ability to marry melodic punk rock with metallic detouring. When Williams \u201cwas in the band, that's when they broke out,\u201d Shea said.",
      "Gutches said Williams captivated audiences at shows with his drumming as much as a band's front man does: \u201cDaniel was putting on a show from his style of playing.\u201d",
      "The tributes will continue for both, Shea said, as more and more artists reveal the impact Williams and Shapiro had on their lives.",
      "Case in point: \u201cThere is no single person more responsible for my identity as a professional adult than Dave Shapiro,\u201d metalcore band Issues bassist Skyler Acord said via Instagram.",
      "His band coined a phrase they would use when things got heated \"to remind us to chill out and try to understand each other,\u201d he wrote.",

      "CLEVELAND -- Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami has never been limited to one medium, creating paintings, sculptures, luxury goods with fashion houses like Louis Vuitton, album covers and an exclusive merchandising collection with Major League Baseball.",
      "Now, he has filled a U.S. museum hall with portraits in every color as part of an exhibit opening Sunday at the Cleveland Museum of Art. \u201cTakashi Murakami: Stepping on the Tail of a Rainbow,\u201d an update of an exhibit first shown in Los Angeles, features more than 100 ranging works.",
      "Murakami, known for his smiling rainbow-colored flower icon, intentionally layered light-hearted themes with historical events linked to trauma, he told The Associated Press.",
      "The art explores the impact of trauma on people and culture, said Ed Schad, curator and publications manager at contemporary art museum The Broad in Los Angeles.",
      "The portraits \"have historical roots and that they could actually tell you a lot about what a society is doing, how healthy a society is, what a society is responding to,\u201d Schad said. \u201cWhat society is responding to most often in this exhibition is the idea of trauma.\u201d",
      "One sculpture depicts Murakami and his dog with half of their bodies in anatomical form, showing their bones and organs, while the other half is their outward appearances. The sculpture, Pom and Me, is described as Murakami\u2019s interpretation of his experience in the West through the lens of his Japanese identity.",
      "Square portraits featuring cartoonish flowers with facial expressions cover one wall of the exhibit, organized by background color to create a rainbow effect. One flower is wiping a tear from its eye, while another appears to be a zombie. One has blood dripping from its mouth. One appears to be in awe watching fireworks.",
      "Though there are no obviously direct visual references to historical events, the museum said the art can be seen through the lens of three events in Japanese history: the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States during World War II, the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, leading to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident, and the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Murakami said it's a bit of a misunderstanding that his work \u201cis very easy and very popular.\"",

      "What someone might admire about his art as a child, Murakami said, would likely not be what is admired by an adult.",
      "Before entering the exhibit on the lower floor of the museum, visitors can walk through a version of the Yumedono, the octagonal-shaped building at Horyuji Temple in Nara, Japan.

      "Former Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo says he wishes he had moved faster to change the culture of his department before the murder of George Floyd, which happened five years ago Sunday",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Former Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo vividly remembers receiving a call around midnight from a community activist. The caller told him to watch a video spreading on social media of a white officer pinning a Black man to the ground, despite his fading pleas of \u201cI can't breathe.\u201d",
      "The dying man was George Floyd. The officer was Derek Chauvin. And Arradondo was the city's first Black police chief.",
      "\u201cIt was absolutely gut-wrenching,\u201d Arradondo, 58, recalled in an interview ahead of the fifth anniversary of Floyd's murder.",
      "What he saw conflicted with what his own people had told him about the deadly encounter, and he knew immediately it would mean changes for his department and city. But he acknowledged he didn't immediately foresee how deeply Floyd's death would reverberate in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "\u201cI served for 32 years,\" he said. \"But there's no doubt May 25th, 2020, is a defining moment for me in my public service career.\u201d",
      "The video shows Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, pinning him to the pavement outside a convenience store where Floyd had tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Chauvin maintained the pressure for 9 1/2 minutes despite pleas from onlookers to stop, even after an off-duty firefighter tried to intervene and another officer said he couldn't find a pulse.",
      "Arradondo sat for the interview in a public library that was heavily damaged in the unrest that followed Floyd's death. It's on Lake Street, a major artery that saw some of the worst destruction, a street that he says still bears \u201cremnants of the pain and anger of what occurred five years ago.\u201d",
      "Just down the block, there's the empty shell of a police station that was torched during the riots. And within sight is a Target store and a Cub Foods supermarket that were looted. Storefronts remain boarded up. While some businesses were rebuilt, empty lots sit where others did not.",
      "Arradondo still stands by his and Mayor Jacob Frey's decision to abandon the Third Precinct and let it burn. Protesters breached the building, and police \u2014 who were spread thin \u2014 didn't have the resources to hold it. So he ordered his officers to evacuate.",
      "\u201cDuring the most significant crisis we\u2019ve ever experienced, arguably in the state, when it\u2019s life or death, I\u2019ve got to go on the side of keeping people alive and safe,\u201d he said.",
      "Arradondo subsequently helped launch an overhaul of policing in the city despite a resistant police culture and a powerful officers union. He testified against Chauvin in his 2021 murder trial, a rare breach of the \u201cblue wall\u201d that traditionally protects officers from being held accountable for wrongdoing.",
      "Five years on, Arradondo, who retired in 2022, said he believes law enforcement agencies nationwide have made progress on police accountability \u2014 albeit incremental progress \u2014 and that police chiefs and sheriffs now move faster to hold officers responsible for egregious misconduct.",
      "Arradondo was promoted to chief in 2017, and his elevation was greeted with hope among local African Americans who affectionately called him \u201cRondo.\u201d But his department had a reputation for being too quick to use force and many were angry about police killing young Black men in Minnesota and beyond.",
      "Arradondo said he wishes he had made more changes to the police department before Floyd was killed.",
      "\u201cI would have pushed harder and sooner at trying to dismantle some of the toxic culture that allowed that indifference to exist that evening, on May 25th, 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly would have invested more time elevating the voices in our community that had been pleading with police departments for decades to listen to us and change.\u201d",
      "Arradondo just published a book, \u201cChief Rondo: Securing Justice for the Murder of George Floyd,\u201d that explores leadership, justice and race, the broader impacts of policing, and the challenges of working within a flawed system. He closes it with a letter dedicated to Floyd's daughter, Gianna.",
      "\u201cI never had an opportunity to meet Gianna, but I wanted her to know that, even though I was not out there that evening, at that intersection when her father was pleading for help, that I heard him, and I was going to do everything I could to bring him justice,\u201d he said.",
      "He wanted to say the words that she has not heard from the four former officers who were convicted for their roles in George Floyd's death:",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry for your father being taken from you.\u201d",

      "On Friday, Vice President JD Vance spoke to the graduating class at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Vance said in his remarks that Trump is working to ensure U.S. soldiers are deployed with clear goals rather than the \u201cundefined missions\u201d and \u201copen-ended conflicts\u201d of the past.",

      "The chain of islands celebrated by singer Jimmy Buffett in his odes to tropical escapism is surrounded by water, jutting out 120 miles southwesterly from Florida's mainland to Key West with the Gulf and Atlantic Ocean on either side.",
      "The archipelago historically has been known for its quirky and libertarian inhabitants who revel in the islands' hedonistic, artistic and outdoorsy lifestyle. In recent years, it also has become a haven for the wealthy.",

The county also relies on surveillance flights from hurricane-hunting aircraft from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for information about how to prepare.",
      "But, the potential for a catastrophic storm like Hurricane Irma in 2017 is always at the back of residents' minds. The Category 4 storm made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds up to 132 mph (209.2 kph), destroying around 1,180 homes and seriously damaging another 3,000.",
      "Weiner recently talked to the Associated Press about the upcoming hurricane season. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "___",
      "Weiner: Our entire island chain is surrounded by water. We have more water than we do land mass. Being uniquely situated between the two large bodies of water makes us very vulnerable. We see storms early, sometimes in their formation \u2014 storms that come across the Atlantic and then storms that develop in the south, in the Caribbean Sea. We tend to be in their path, and so we get a lot of storm practice here in Monroe County.",
      "Weiner: The weather service is a good partner, and the field offices, from what they were telling us and what they\u2019re hearing here, everyone is secure. They are not expecting or anticipating any cuts to the (Florida Keys) field offices. So, of course, going into hurricane season, we're really happy to hear that.",
      "Weiner: The Keys had not had a storm of that magnitude or size since the early 20th century. People tend to get complacent. It\u2019s human nature, right? They\u2019re not as worried. They\u2019re not as prepared. We were very fortunate with Irma in that we had plenty of days\u2019 notice to evacuate. But when we came home and saw the devastation, it was an eye-opener. Being an island chain, we had unique challenges bringing logistics in to help us recover.",
      "Weiner: Usually, they tend to heed that advice. We are constantly reminding people to be prepared and how important it is in our county to evacuate because the Florida Keys, the entirety of the island chain, is a storm surge zone. People here tend to be pretty savvy when it comes to storms, and throughout the entire Keys, the bigger concern is storm surge rather than wind. We say, \u201cHide from the wind and run from the water.\u201d",
      "Weiner: The city of Key West is an incredibly resilient community. There\u2019s a lot of history there. But there is also a lot of older architecture there. There\u2019s a lot of wooden homes, and for them to receive a storm, a direct impact of a major magnitude, that would be devastating for them. That is what keeps me up at night \u2013 a Category 4 or 5 storm hitting Key West.",
      "Weiner: Because it\u2019s beautiful here. It really is an island paradise. Being surrounded by a national marine sanctuary is amazing. I think everyone that lives here, we all live here for that reason. Because we appreciate the environment and the marine life and love the water. And so it\u2019s worth it. You make sure that you\u2019re prepared, and you have a plan if you need to go. And you go somewhere safe, and you come back, and you just put it back together.",

      "A federal judge has denied the Trump administration\u2019s request that she stay her May 19 ruling that returned control of the U.S. Institute of Peace back to its acting president and board",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Friday denied the Trump administration\u2019s request that she stay her May 19 ruling that returned control of the U.S. Institute of Peace back to its acting president and board.",
      "In a seven-page ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Beryl A. Howell said the government did not meet any of the four requirements for a stay, including a \u201cstrong showing\u201d of whether its request could succeed on the merits.",
      "Howell reiterated her finding that the Institute is not part of the executive branch and is therefore beyond President Donald Trump\u2019s authority to fire its board. She added that the firings also did not follow the law for how a board member of the Institute might be removed by the president.",
      "Most of the board was fired in March during a takeover of the Institute by the Department of Government Efficiency. That action touched off the firing of its acting president, former ambassador George Moose, and subsequently most of the staff. The organization's headquarters, funded in part by donors, was turned over to the General Services Administration.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anne-tyler-on-a-writers-selfish-motive-to-explore-other-lives/",
    "published": "Sun, 25 May 2025 10:42:22 -0400",
    "summary": "The Pulitzer Prize-winner's tales of lives shattered and mended by love have broken countless hearts. In her latest, \"Three Days in June,\" Anne Tyler details a weekend in the life of a divorced school administrator, bookended by the loss of her job and her daughter's wedding.",
    "story": [
      "Novelist Anne Tyler was once described as a writer who likes to break America's heart. \"Oh, dear! Well, don't you think life kind of breaks your heart?\" she said.",
      "Stories about life breaking your heart, and how love can sometimes mend it, have made Tyler a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist, and a best-selling author for six decades.",
      "In 1977, she told The New York Times, \"It does matter to me that I be considered a serious writer. \u2026. A serious book is one that removes me to another life as I am reading it. \u2026 It has to be an extremely believable lie.\"",
      "\"I don't remember saying that, but I believe every word of it still!\" she laughed. \"The fact that it's a lie is a very important part of what makes it not real life, don't worry! And the fact that it's a believable lie makes you say, I am actually being another person right now.\"",
      "The people who live in Tyler's two dozen books have touched countless readers: \"Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant,\" \"Breathing Lessons,\" \"A Spool of Blue Thread,\" and \"The Accidental Tourist,\" which became a critically-acclaimed film with William Hurt as a travel writer who hates to travel, and Geena Davis, who won an Oscar for playing the woman who shows him that love is possible for those willing to take a chance.",
      "Tyler said, \"What makes me keep going as a writer is a more selfish motive, which is, I'm just always wanting to know what it's like to be somebody else. \u2026 I feel almost deprived that I have just this one life; I have to be greedy and reach out and see, Well, that guy I just passed in the street, he said that strang thing, what is it like to be him? It's just self-indulgence to sit and write all day and pretend I'm somebody else.\"",
      "\"I love listening to people\"",
      "Tyler grew up in a quiet Quaker community in North Carolina. She would tell herself stories to fall asleep at night: \"I would fold my knees up and that would be my desk, and I would be a doctor seeing patients, and I would whisper these conversations. And it always ended with my brother in the bed across the room shouting out, 'Mama, Anne's whispering again!'\"",
      "Something her readers have long heard about, but never seen: her \"blue box,\" full of hand-written notes to herself. I asked, \"Is it fun for you to page through the blue box and go, 'Oh, I forgot I thought about that'?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she said. \"But we should never page through it too often, because then it won't be surprising.\"",
      "The box is filled with ideas and snippets of conversations overheard in grocery stores or coffee shops that she might slip into a book. \"I love listening to people; I like to hear them nattering on,\" she said. \"That's why the pandemic hit my writing career very hard! Because I love to just be walking down the street and you hear somebody say two words, as I go on, I think, I wonder what that was about? And that's where stories begin.\"",
      "No place is more associated with Tyler than Baltimore, Maryland. It's where she and her late husband, Iranian novelist and psychiatrist Taghi Modarressi, raised their two daughters.",
      "So, why does she keep returning to Baltimore as a setting for her stories? \"Laziness,\" she mused.",
      "\"You seem to have a love for the setting,\" I said.",
      "\"But face the fact that if I wrote about somebody in New York, I'd have to find out a bunch of things about New York,\" Tyler said. \"And here I am! But I don't know why it is that I feel there's sort of more there there in the average Baltimorean than there are in people in other places.\"",
      "\"I'm going to be writing this [next] book forever\"",
      "Tyler's latest book, \"Three Days in June,\" details a long weekend in the life of a school administrator, bookended by the loss of her job and her daughter's wedding. At one point the book's main character, Gail, says, \"I'm not the kind of woman who dreams of doing things.\"",
      "I asked Tyler, \"If you could pretend to be anybody, why choose the assistant headmistress at a school in Baltimore, versus a movie star or a head of state?\"",
      "\"You think that's bad \u2013 the current thing I'm working on, the guy remodels kitchens for a living,\" Tyler replied. \"I don't know! I've often asked myself, if I want to be somebody else, why not somebody heroic and crusading out in the world? But I don't get to choose. I always say novels are like olives in one of those tall, thin bottles. You just get out an olive that's on top. This is the one that comes next.\"",
      "But the lives of her characters, and the jobs they have, are anything but humdrum. \"And there is a beauty in the acceptance that people have over their own lives,\" I said. \"Sometimes people just end up in a place like Baltimore.\"",
      "\"They make a life there!\" she laughed.",
      "Now, at age 83, Anne Tyler says she'll keep doing what she has always done: listen, think, and write about people who might shatter your heart, or stitch it back together.",
      "Asked how many more books we might expect from her, Tyler replied, \"Well, I'm going to be writing this [next] book forever, and when I finish it, if I do finish it before I die, I will rewrite it. And if I'm still not dead, I will rewrite it again, because I'm not going to bring out another book. I'm horrified that I have 25 books in a list in the front of this latest novel.\"",
      "\"Isn't that a joy, Anne? Twenty-five books?\" I asked.",
      "\"No!\" she said. \"My next-door neighbor many years ago said, 'You do churn them out, don't you?'\"",
      "\"That comment clearly lingers in your mind.\"",
      "\"It's engraved there, yes!\" she laughed.",

      "It's hard to resist staring back at paintings by artist Amy Sherald, now on display at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Sherald is best known for her portrait of former first lady Michelle Obama, but the exhibit gives a more complete look at her palette. \"That painting is here in the show, and we're very happy to be able to share it with visitors here,\" said co-curator Rujeko Hockley. \"But we really wanted to show the progression of her work as an artist.",
      "\"Amy often paints the skin tone of her subjects, who are Black people, in what we call grisaille, or gray tone,\" said Hockley. \"It kind of disrupts this immediate identification, perhaps even stereotyping that all of us are, you know, subject to.\"",
      "It's not the only way to spot a Sherald painting. Hockley said one characteristic of the artist's work is her subjects' body language: \"Very kind of solid, confident, not over-confident, but just really certain and still in [themselves].\"",
      "The Sherald exhibition, said Hockley, is \"a show that is really speaking to kind of overwhelmingly positive sense of connection, and kind of shared humanity, and kind of beauty that comes from being around one another, that comes from kind of seeing the humanity in another.\"",

      "The clock gathered itself together with a whirring of gears and struck a series of blurry notes. Nine o'clock, I was thinking; but no, it turned out to be ten. I'd been sitting there in a sort of stupor, evidently. I stood up and hung my purse in the closet, but then outside the window I saw some movement on the other side of the curtain, some dark and ponderous shape laboring up my front walk. I tweaked the curtain aside a half inch. Max, for God's sake. Max with a duffel bag slung over one shoulder, and a bulky square suitcase dangling from his left hand.",
      "I went to the front door and opened it and looked out at him through the screen. \"What on earth?\" I asked him.",
      "\"You're home!\" he said.",
      "\"Yes ...\"",
      "\"Debbie is at something called a Day of Beauty.\"",
      "\"Right,\" I said.",
      "\"But she knew ahead I was coming. I told her I was coming. I get there and no one's home. I call her cell phone and she says she didn't expect me so early.\"",
      "\"Why did you come so early?\" I asked him.",
      "\"I wanted to beat the rush. You know what Fridays are like on the Bay Bridge.\"",
      "All the more reason not to live on the other side of it, I could have pointed out. I opened the screen door for him and reached for his suitcase, but it wasn't a suitcase; it was some kind of animal carrier. Square patch of wire grid on the end and something watchful and alert staring out from behind it gleaming-eyed. Max moved the carrier away from me a bit and said, \"I've got it.\"",
      "\"What is it?\"",
      "\"It's a cat.\"",
      "\"A cat!\"",
      "\"Could I come in, do you think?\"",
      "I retreated and he lumbered in, out of breath, shaking the floorboards. Max was nowhere near fat, but he was weighty, broad shouldered; he always gave the impression of taking up more than his share of room, although he was not much taller than I was. In the years since we'd divorced he had grown the kind of beard that you're not quite sure is deliberate; maybe he'd merely forgotten to shave for a while. A short gray frizzle with a frizzle of gray hair to match, and he seemed to have given up on his clothes; generally he wore stretched-out knit tops and baggy khakis. I hoped he'd brought a suit for the wedding. You never could be sure.",
      "\"Couldn't you have just left your cat at home with food and water?\" I asked, following him through the living room. \"I mean, it's already bad enough that you're staying with Debbie yourself. In the middle of her wedding preparations, for God's sake!\"",
      "\"She said it would be fine if I stayed,\" Max told me. \"She said it wasn't a problem.\"",
      "\"Okay, but then to add a cat to the mix ... Cats do very well on their own. They almost prefer it, in fact.\"",
      "\"Not this one,\" he said. He set the carrier on my kitchen counter. \"This one is too new.\"",
      "\"It's a kitten?\"",
      "\"No, no, it's old.\"",
      "\"You just said\u2014\"",
      "\"It's an elderly female cat who belonged to a very old woman, and now the woman has up and died and the cat is in mourning,\" he told me.",
      "There was a lot I could have asked about this, but it didn't seem worth the effort. I leaned closer to peer at the cat. \"Does Debbie know you're bringing it?\" I asked him.",
      "\"Now she does.\"",
      "I waited.",
      "\"It's complicated,\" he said. He blotted his face on his shoulder. \"I phoned her; I said, 'Where are you?' She says she's at a Day of Beauty. 'Did you leave a key out someplace?' I asked her, and she says no, but she'll be home in a few hours. 'A few hours!' I say. 'I can't wait a few hours! I've got a cat here!' She says, 'A what?' Then she hits the roof. Tells me I can in no way bring a cat to her house, because Kenneth is allergic.\"",
      "\"He is?\" I said.",
      "\"Deathly allergic, is how she put it.\"",
      "\"But ... Kenneth doesn't live there,\" I said.",
      "\"Don't kid yourself,\" Max told me. \"You know he stays over a lot, and besides, he does plan to live there after the wedding.\"",
      "\"Well, sure, after the wedding.\"",
      "\"'Deathly' allergic, Gail. As in, if he walks into a house where a cat has left a smidgen of dander behind, even if the cat is long gone he'll need a respirator.\"",
      "\"A respirator!\"",
      "\"Or whatever you call those things that asthmatics have to carry around with them.\"",
      "\"You mean an atomizer,\" I said.",
      "\"No, not an atomizer; a what's- it. A vaporizer, maybe?\"",
      "I thought it over.",
      "\"At any rate, that's what Debbie claimed. She claimed that even if he's just standing next to her and she has cat dander on her sweater, he will start choking up and he'll need a ...\"",
      "We both stood there, considering.",
      "The cat said, \"Hmm?\"",
      "We looked over at the carrier.",
      "\"Anyhow,\" Max said, and he unfastened the two latches and lifted the lid. Instead of stepping out, the cat hunched lower and stared up at me. A gray-and-black tabby with a chunky face. \"So I couldn't think where to go except here,\" Max said. \"I knew where you hide your key. It didn't occur to me that you would be home on a weekday.\"",
      "\"Yes, well ...,\" I said. And then I told the cat, \"Hey there.\" She squared her eyes at me.",
      "\"What's her name?\" I asked Max.",
      "\"I don't know.\"",
      "\"What? How could you not know?\"",
      "\"I'm just the fosterer,\" he told me. \"I volunteer at this shelter where they need people to foster animals until they can be adopted. Ordinarily it's kittens, batches of feral kittens that need domesticating first, but this one's a senior citizen. I'm thinking of naming her 'Pearl,' at least for as long as I have her around.\"",
      "\"Pearl!\"",
      "\"On account of her color.\"",
      "\"You can't name a cat 'Pearl.'\"",
      "\"Why not?\"",
      "\"Cats are so bad at language,\" I told him. \"They're not the least bit like dogs. Cats just get your general tone, and 'Pearl' has a tone like a growl.\"",
      "\"It does?\"",
      "\"So does 'Ruby.' So does 'Rhinestone.'\"",
      "\"Aha!\" Max said. \"See there? Everything turns out for the best.\"",
      "\"It does?\" I said. \"What are you talking about?\"",
      "\"You can advise me on cat lore,\" he said. \"Plus you might even decide to adopt her; who knows?\"",
      "\"Max,\" I said, \"sometimes I wonder if you understand the least little thing about me.\"",
      "\"But you love cats! You used to have that homely little calico cat. And this one's accustomed to older women.\"",
      "\"Thanks,\" I said.",
      "\"'Older,' I said. Not 'old.'\"",
      "\"I do not want a cat in any way, shape, or form,\" I told him. \"What do you think of 'Mary?'\" he asked. \"Or 'Carol.' How about that?\"",
      "\"Forget it, Max,\" I said. Then I added, \"And you want to steer away from the r sound. An r is a growl, straight out.\"",
      "\"Oh, right. Yes. Thank you.\" He paused. \"How about 'Lucy'?\" he said.",
      "\"Forget it, I told you.\"",
      "He sighed.",
      "\"Maybe you could drop her off at a shelter here in Baltimore,\" I said. \"I mean, surely they wouldn't refuse her.\"",
      "\"We're not allowed to just dump our charges any-old-where,\" he told me. \"No, I'd better keep her here at your house, and then take her back to Cornboro if you really don't want her.\"",
      "\"I most emphatically do not want her,\" I said. Then, \"Nor do I want a houseguest.\"",
      "\"Yes, but, see, there's dander all over my clothes now. I can't possibly go back to Debbie's, even without the cat.\"",
      "\"In fact, I wonder if you should come to the wedding, even,\" I said. \"Just think if Kenneth starts choking during the vows.\"",
      "This was pure mischief, on my part. I seriously doubted that Kenneth would choke; he'd always struck me as a sturdy type of guy.",
      "But Max looked stricken. He said, \"Not attend my own daughter's wedding?\"",
      "\"Well, you could maybe wear a raincoat,\" I said. \"Or one of those hazmat suits.\"",
      "The kitchen phone rang. We both glanced over at it. It rang again, and then a third time. \"Aren't you going to get that?\" Max asked me.",
      "But I was thinking it might be Marilee, and sure enough, after my outgoing message Marilee came on and asked, \"Gail? Are you there?\"",
      "This was why I still had an actual, physical answering machine: there were too many people I might not feel like talking to.",
      "\"Because we really need to discuss this,\" Marilee said. \"Could you pick up, please?\"",
      "Max wrinkled his forehead at me.",
      "\"Ignore that,\" I told him.",
      "\"What's going on?\"",
      "\"Nothing's going on.\"",
      "\"Okay ...\"",
      "The answering machine clicked off, and I turned back to the cat. I briefly closed my eyes at her. Cats take that as reassurance; to them it's like a smile. Then I looked off in another direction. I heard a rustle, and when I slid a glance sideways I saw her unfolding herself from the carrier by degrees and stepping gingerly onto the counter. \"A little weight problem,\" I murmured.",
      "As if to demonstrate, she landed on the floor with a noticeable thud.",
      "\"I think it's from stress,\" Max said. \"Apparently she'd been alone for some time before anyone realized her owner had died.\"",
      "I made a sympathetic tsking sound.",
      "\"What's up with Marilee?\" Max asked. He'd never been very good at minding his own business. I said, \"Nothing's up with Marilee.\"",
      "The cat was heading into the living room now, so I made a big show of following her. She paused to sniff at the fringe on the rug and then padded over to an armchair and sprang into it, more nimbly than you might expect.",
      "\"What does she want to discuss?\" Max asked, trailing after me.",
      "I gave up. I said, \"She's retiring in the fall and she wants the board to hire this other person in her place, this Nashville person. And the Nashville person is asking to bring in her own assistant. So I'm thinking I should just quit before they fire me.\"",
      "\"Excellent,\" Max said.",
      "I turned to look at him.",
      "\"Your great talent is for teaching; you know that,\" Max said. \"Dealing with all the kids who are scared to death of math.\"",
      "\"You're forgetting that teachers make no money, though,\" I told him. \"Why else did I put in all that hell time getting my master's degree?\"",
      "\"So? Now that Debbie's finished law school, you can go back to doing what you're good at.\"",
      "\"It's not that simple,\" I told him.",
      "Still, it was nice of him to say that I was good at something. But then he changed the subject. \"Guess I might as well bring in the cat supplies,\" he said. And he went on outside, leaving the front door open behind him even though the air conditioning was on.",
      "I turned back to the cat. She was a bread-loaf shape in the armchair now with her front paws folded beneath her, and when she saw me looking at her she shut her eyes lazily and then opened them again.",

      "Prologue",
      "In the grand scheme of history, it was nothing. A blip, a breath. The time it took Smith to pocket what might have looked like a matchbook or stick of gum to an unwitting child but was, in fact, 0.7 grams of powdered Colombian cocaine \u2014 flown in from Medell\u00edn, cut with amphetamine in Miami, and offered to him in Southampton by a boy he knew from nights out in the city. 0.7 grams heavier, he loped back through the crush of rhythmless elbows and cloying perfume, which wafted up and dissolved in the damp and sultry night \u2014 the very last of summer.",
      "Looking around, it was really just a restaurant. By the front door, at least fifty people huddled, breathing down each other's necks as they shouted the names they hoped would capture the doorman's attention, while in the backyard, hundreds congregated. Dozens of tables now shook with the weight of dancing, bodies alit with the particular mania reserved for the end of East Coast summers, when one becomes aware of the changing season, the coming cold. But for now, it was silk and linen, the expensive musk of strangers. Every face appeared familiar \u2014 some because he actually knew them while others only bore a sun-tanned resemblance, the pleasing symmetry of the rich. These were the faces which seemed to populate the whole of his young life: colleagues and one-night stands from the clubs called cool downtown. These faces had appeared at bars, brunches, birthdays, holiday soirees where black tie was optional \u2014 and, before New York, in freshman seminars and frat parties and before that, on teen tours or tennis camps with their original forms intact, acne-spotted. And here they'd all come, every one of them, to escape the inhospitable heat of Manhattan and enjoy a seaside breeze.",
      "Picture him, stumbling. 6 feet and 3 inches, he towered like a tree, bark-brown and quietly handsome. Picture him crouched in a corner as he snorts from a key, the metallic taste of his tongue. The night gleamed back into clarity as he steadied himself to return \u2014 when out of the crowd, two men emerged, stern eyed and square jawed, barking orders he could barely discern. Calmly, he followed \u2014 he didn't wish to make a scene \u2014 out through a side exit and onto the street, silent but for the bass of a bop that had reigned the charts all summer.",
      "Here is where the night splits open along its tight-stitched seam. The realization, arriving at a tan vehicle marked Southampton Police, that these men, though not in uniform, were not the club security he'd assumed at first they were. The night bent surreally. Smith watched himself be searched as if from a perch above, watched his limbs grow limp and pliant as they bent behind his back. The rotated view of girls in wedges: their clothes wrong, the stars wrong. Yes, the greater sense was not of shock, but unreality. All of this was staged. A prank, a punk \u2013 the actors in the front seat, too handsome to be cops. The men were swift and practiced as they'd bundled him into the back of the car. After he'd handed over five-hundred dollars cash from an ATM upstairs at the station, they took him down to be printed, ID'd, and photographed. They were done in twenty minutes, after which he was handed a slip and his things in a plastic bag, then sent back out into the wounded night. He called an Uber. On the curb, Smith watched phosphenes blinker in the darkness, a chorus of cameras flashing. He'd worn, in his mugshot, a vintage Marni gingham shirt, loose-fit linen trousers, and a gently startled expression.",

      "ONE",
      "What Happened to Kinnick",
      "A prim girl stood still as a fencepost on Rhys Kinnick's front porch. Next to her, a cowlicked boy shifted his weight from snow boot to snow boot. Both kids wore backpacks. On the stairs below them, a woman held an umbrella against the pattering rain.",
      "It was the little girl who'd knocked. Kinnick cracked the door. He rasped through the dirty screen: \"Magazines or chocolate bars?\"",
      "The girl, who looked to be about ten, squinted. \"What did you say?\" Had he misspoken? How long since Kinnick had talked to anyone?",
      "\"I said, what are you fine young capitalists selling? Magazines or chocolate bars?\"",
      "\"We aren't selling anything,\" said the boy. He appeared to be about six. \"We're your grandchildren.\"",
      "A sound came from Kinnick's throat then\u2014a gasp, he might have written it, back when he wrote for a living. Of course they were his grandchildren. He hadn't really looked at their faces. And this strange woman on the steps had thrown him. But now that he did look, he saw family there, in the pronounced upper lip, and the deep-set, searching eyes. No, clearly this was Leah and Asher. Christ! When had he seen them last? He tried to remember, straining to apply an increasingly muddled concept: time. His daughter had brought them up here for a short visit one afternoon. When was that, three years ago? Four?",
      "Either way, these were not strangers selling candy for their school. These were his grandkids, flesh and blood of Rhys Kinnick's flesh and blood, his only child, Bethany. But older than six and ten. More muddled time work was required to figure out how much.",
      "\"Mr. Kinnick?\" The woman with the umbrella was speaking now.",
      "\"Yes,\" he said. \"I'm Kinnick.\" He addressed the kids again. \"Is ... is everything ... Are you ...\" The thoughts came too quickly for his mouth to form around them. He opened the door wider. \"Where's your mother?\" \"We're not sure,\" Leah said. \"Mom left a couple of days ago. She said she'd be back in a week. Shane left yesterday to find her.\" This was thirteen-year-old Leah. Her father was Bethany's old boyfriend Sluggish Doug, long out of the picture.",
      "The boy, eight, no nine! Nine-year-old Asher was S**thead Shane's kid.",
      "Oh, the riddle of time\u2014and of Bethany's taste in men.",
      "Kinnick looked at the woman behind his grandchildren. She was Black, with big round glasses, in her thirties, if he had to guess, roughly his daughter's age. She climbed the last step onto the porch.",
      "\"I'm Anna Gaines,\" the woman said. \"My husband and I live in the same apartment complex as Bethany and Shane. This morning, Leah came over with this.\" She held out an envelope. On it, written in Sharpie in Bethany's handwriting: \"FOR ANNA.\" Below that: \"in case of emergency.\"",
      "\"Mom left it in the closet,\" Leah said, \"in one of my snow boots.\" Kinnick opened the front screen, came out, and took the envelope. He removed a single sheet of paper, handwritten on both sides in Bethany's neat, backward-leaning script. He patted his shirt pocket for his",
      "readers, then squinted to make out the note:",
      "Dear Anna. If you're reading this, I had to leave in a hurry. I know this is a lot to ask but can you take the kids to my father, Rhys Kinnick. He is a recluse ...",
      "Kinnick looked up. \"I am not a recluse.\" He looked down and began reading again.",
      "Dear Anna. If you're reading this, I had to leave in a hurry. I know this is a lot to ask but can you take the kids to my father, Rhys Kinnick. He is a recluse who cut off contact with our family ...",
      "\"I did not 'cut off contact.' It was\u2014\" Rhys felt his blood rising. \"Complicated.\" But his grandchildren just stared at him, apparently as uninterested in nuance and complexity as everyone else in the world. Kinnick grunted again and went back to reading.",
      "Dear Anna. If you're reading this, I had to leave in a hurry. I know this is a lot to ask but can you take the kids to my father, Rhys Kinnick. He is a recluse who cut off contact with our family and now lives in squalor ...",
      "\"Squalor?\" Kinnick looked around his covered front porch. \"Squalor?\" In one corner, a broken old refrigerator stood next to a stack of used boat and car batteries and a burned-out inverter generator; in the other corner was his old wringer washing machine and a single clothesline, from which hung a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt. \"What is this? In case of emergency, go find my father and make him feel terrible about himself?\"",
      "His grandchildren continued to stare. Kinnick groaned again, then resumed reading, vowing to make it through the whole letter this time.",

      "Written in multiple perspectives, \"A Summer for the Books\" (to be published July 15 by MIRA) tells of two old friends \u2013 Jewel, a bestselling writer, and Shelby, a bookstore owner \u2013 who went their separate ways years ago ... but! When Shelby loses her memory after a bike accident and reaches out to Jewel for help, how can she refuse?",

      "Sitting up in bed with her laptop on her thighs and her husband asleep next to her, Jewel McRae, known to the world as Jewel Stone, closed out the deleted scene of her debut novel, That Was Then, and leaned back onto the headboard. She'd just received word her book was going to be made into a series on a major network, and they wanted her on set as a consultant when they went into production next summer, which was why she was rereading the book. It was a chore, but fortunately, years had passed since its release, and it was all new to her again.",
      "The network planned to create at least two seasons, so she was reading through her very first draft that even her agent and editor had never seen. It included about 17,000 words that were later cut, including the baby storyline. Her editor had never read that juicy subplot, and if Jewel continued to have her way, nobody ever would.",
      "Honestly, though it was tedious work, the book-to-series was quite an accomplishment and a cause for celebration. Her followers were on social media posting memes and making actor suggestions.",
      "But her celebration was bittersweet. The one person she wanted to share this with, her best friend since childhood, was no longer a friend. And the contents of this book were a part of the reason. Especially the deleted contents. Jewel didn't have the courage to share her truth with anyone, especially the man asleep next to her.",
      "Releasing a huge sigh, she placed the laptop on her nightstand and massaged the back of her neck. With a yawn, she settled under the covers, and her final thought before fading out was I miss my friend.",

      "Power was restored hours before the ceremony, around 3 p.m. local time, as music began blasting again from beachfront speakers. The end of the blackout was greeted with loud cheers from locals.",
      "Authorities were investigating the likelihood of arson in a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes that weakened the grid overnight, a spokesperson for the French national gendarmerie said.",
      "The power outage happened hours later, after a high-voltage line fell at another location. Authorities were investigating what caused that line to collapse.",

Neon, which acquired \"It Was Just an Accident\" for North American distribution after its premiere in Cannes, follows its Palmes for \"Parasite,\" \"Titane,\" \"Triangle of Sadness,\" \"Anatomy of a Fall\" and \"Anora.\"",

Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world's largest movie market, U.S. President Trump floated the idea of a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.",

    "published": "Sat, 24 May 2025 08:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "John Mauceri had a complicated health history, but his sudden swelling and fatigue left his team of doctors stumped.",
    "story": [
      "Conductor John Mauceri is no stranger to health struggles. He was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in 2017, then chronic lymphocytic leukemia and interstitial lung disease in 2019. Medication treated the conditions and sent the cancer into remission, but he has remained on the lookout for recurrence.",
      "In December 2023, Mauceri, then 78, contracted COVID-19. He struggled to climb the stairs and developed a \"troublesome\" cough. He went to the emergency room at NYU Langone, where he has previously received medical care. An X-ray found viral pneumonia and severe lung disease. Doctors removed three liters of liquid from his right lung. The only relief, he said, was that there was no trace of cancer. He left the hospital about a week later.",
      "Within weeks, new symptoms quickly emerged. First, his left ankle swelled. Then the swelling continued up his leg. As the weeks passed, the swelling entered his abdomen and inched down his right leg. At one point, Mauceri was gaining a pound every day. He was also dealing with fatigue and shortness of breath. He couldn't conduct.",
      "\"I was wearing somebody else's body, at least from my waist down. I couldn't wear normal clothes,\" Mauceri said. \"Putting shoes on was hard. I couldn't walk through my house.\"",
      "No one on his care team could identify what was causing the symptoms.",
      "\"I had an oncologist, I had a pulmonologist, a rheumatologist. I had a lot of doctors, and they all thought it was somebody else's domain,\" Mauceri said.",
      "Searching for a diagnosis",
      "Dr. Adam Skolnick, a cardiologist at NYU Langone and one of Mauceri's doctors, said the team first looked for more common causes for the swelling. Mauceri underwent MRIs and other tests. An exam found his lymph system was working normally. Cardiac catheterization, where a thin tube is guided through the heart, found no signs of heart disease. There were no signs of blood clots, cancer recurrence or other likely conditions.",
      "Meanwhile, the swelling was beginning to strain Mauceri's body, putting him at risk of multi-organ failure.",
      "While studying the images of Mauceri's heart, Skolnick began to form a theory. But \"the only definitive way to fully diagnose and treat Mr. Mauceri would be through surgery to open the chest,\" the doctor said.",
      "What is pericardial constriction?",
      "Skolnick thought Mauceri might have pericardial constriction, which occurs when the sac around the heart, or the pericardium, is thickened by scarring. That prevents the heart from fully opening. It can create pressure, resulting in swelling in the legs and abdomen.",
      "It's a rare condition that is usually acquired because of a prior illness, Skolnick said, including viral infections like COVID-19.",
      "Since there are no tests that look at the pericardium specifically, Mauceri would have to undergo open-heart surgery to confirm the diagnosis. The condition would also be treated in that same surgery. After Mauceri's care team eliminated all other possible options, they decided it was time to go into the operating room in June 2024.",
      "Mauceri was nervous about the prospect but it seemed like his only option.",
      "\"There was no alternative,\" he said. \"I said, 'Well, let's just do it.'\"",
      "A high-risk surgery",
      "Dr. Eugene Grossi, a cardiothoracic surgeon and leader of NYU Langone Heart's robotic surgery team, performed Mauceri's surgery. When he opened the conductor's chest, he found that Mauceri's \"heart was trapped\" inside a thick shell of scarring. Typically, the pericardium is like a paper bag. Mauceri's was like shoe leather, Grossi said.",
      "\"You don't think about it, but your lungs expand with every breath you take. Your chest wall opens. Your lungs expand. The heart does also, because it has to be able to accept the blood that's coming back from your arteries and veins. And his was just trapped,\" Grossi explained. That entrapment leads to fluid retention, creating swelling, Grossi said.",
      "Under the scarring, Mauceri's heart was functioning well. With the diagnosis made, Grossi and the surgical team had to scrape the pericardium and attached scar tissue carefully off the heart. Removing the pericardium creates no lasting health issues, but the procedure, called a pericardiectomy, is a delicate one.",
      "\"It's almost like the heart is a hard-boiled egg, and we're peeling off the shell,\" Grossi said.",
      "Mauceri's procedure went smoothly, his doctor said. Once the pericardium was removed, Mauceri's urine output bag began to fill, proving to the surgeons that the pressure was off and blood was pumping smoothly.",
      "\"Every day is a miracle\"",
      "After Mauceri was released from the hospital, he quickly began losing weight. He said he feels like he's in the best shape he's been since college.",
      "\"This is extraordinary because not only did I survive it, but I'm stronger than ever as a result of it,\" Mauceri said.",
      "His health struggles didn't end immediately. Shortly after the heart surgery, he was hospitalized again for a blockage of the small intestine. That was quickly treated, again at NYU Langone, but it slowed his recovery. It wasn't until December 2024, more than a year after he was diagnosed with COVID-19, that Mauceri was able to conduct an orchestra again.",
      "Mauceri conducted back-to-back performances in London and Paris, getting used to being onstage again. In May, he traveled to Japan to conduct in Tokyo. The 13-hour flight and long performance days felt like the first test of his endurance after his illnesses, he said. The performance was a raging success.",
      "Mauceri said he has no plans to slow down now that he's back to work. In between spending time with his family in New York City, he plans to travel the country for other concerts, including at the Hollywood Bowl in September, shortly after his 80th birthday.",
      "\"I was conducting as if I wasn't on the cusp of being 80 anymore,\" he said. \"I was allowed to do that because my doctors gave me this added time in my life where I can do that. So every day is a miracle. Every day I'm grateful for what they did.\"",

      "What is normal pressure hydrocephalus?",
      "Normal pressure hydrocephalus, or NPH, is a brain condition that occurs when fluid builds up inside or around the brain, disrupting certain brain-related functions.",
      "Cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions the brain and spinal cord, is the type of fluid that builds up. Typically, your body makes just enough of this fluid each day and absorbs that same amount, according to Johns Hopkins, but sometimes too much fluid can build up, leading to NPH.",
      "\"If that increases abnormally, it can build up in these chambers, called ventricles, in the brain,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook explained. \"And that can cause pressure on normal brain tissue.\"",
      "As a result, he said, people with the condition may experience symptoms including \"trouble thinking, trouble walking and trouble with urinary incontinence,\" though not every patient will have all the same symptoms.",
      "\"Usually, it just comes out of the blue. We really don't know why,\" LaPook said.",
      "An MRI brain scan can detect the issue, and medical experts say it is usually treatable. The treatment typically involves a surgical procedure to implant a shunt in order to drain the fluid. LaPook said he recently had a patient who was treated this way, \"and now he's feeling perfectly fine.\"",
      "The condition is relatively uncommon, but is more likely to occur in older people.",
      "According to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic, NPH affects bout 0.2% of people between the ages 70 and 80, and about 5.9% of those over 80.",

      "In March 2024, Gutierrez-Reed\u00a0was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter\u00a0in connection with Hutchins' death, and sentenced to 18 months in prison the following month. At the time, she was acquitted of a second charge of evidence tampering.",

      "That parole runs through May 23, 2026. \u00a0Her certificate said she is required to follow the conditions set forth by the board, some of which include electric monitoring, following a curfew, and either getting a job or enrolling in school.",
      "Gutierrez-Reed was paroled to Arizona and ordered to report there immediately, according to the certificate.",
      "She received the maximum penalty for her part in the October 2021 tragedy when actor Alec Baldwin discharged live rounds\u00a0from a prop gun on the movie set during a rehearsal, killing Hutchins and wounding the film's director, Joel Souza, a tragedy which shook the Hollywood community. Several experts said the death of Hutchins, who had a young son, was entirely preventable.",

      "Paris \u2014 After a monthlong trial, eight of the 10 people accused of robbing billionaire celebrity Kim Kardashian\u00a0in Paris in 2016 were convicted on Friday.",
      "The ringleader and seven other people involved in the heist were found guilty, but will not return to prison. The court acquitted two defendants who were accused of handing out information about Kardashian's whereabouts.",
      "Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, 69, the ringleader, was handed the heaviest sentence of eight years imprisonment. Five of those years are a suspended sentence. Due to time already served in jail, he will not return to detention.",
      "Three others who were accused of the most serious charges \u2014 Yunis Abbas, Didier Dubreucq and Marc-Alexandre Boyer \u2014 each got seven years, five of them suspended. Like Khedache, they will not return to detention. Dubreucq, 69, was absent from the sentencing as he is undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer.",
      "Prosecutors had called for the four to face 10-year sentences. The chief judge, David De Pas, said the ages of the defendants \u2014 the oldest is 79 and some others are in their 60s and 70s \u2014 weighed on the court's decision not to impose harsher sentences that would have sent them to jail. Boyer, 35, is the only young person involved in the crime.",
      "\"It would have been unjust to take you to prison this evening,\" De Pas said. He said the nine years between the robbery and the trial were also taken into account in the sentencing.",
      "Still, he said that Kardashian had been traumatized by the robbery in her hotel.",
      "\"You caused harm, even if you didn't strike physically and blood was not spilt,\" De Pas said. \"You caused fear.\"",
      "Kardashian was in Paris for Fashion Week in October 2016, staying in a discreet hotel in the center of the city. In emotional four-and-a-half-hour testimony 10 days ago, she told the Paris court she \"absolutely\" believed she was going to be \"raped and killed\" when one of the armed, masked robbers grabbed her leg and pulled her toward him as she lay on her bed wearing just a bathrobe.",
      "She was bound with zip ties and duct tape and locked in the bathroom while the robbers searched her room for the expensive jewelry they said they had seen on social media posts by the woman they recognized only as \"the rapper's wife\" \u2014 a reference to her then-husband Kanye West.",
      "Kardashian, who was not present for the sentencing, said in a statement that she was \"deeply grateful to the French authorities for pursuing justice\" in the case. In court, lawyers for Kardashian said the reality star was \"satisfied\" with the verdict.",
      "\"The crime was the most terrifying experience of my life, leaving a lasting impact on me and my family,\" she said in her statement. \"While I'll never forget what happened, I believe in the power of growth and accountability and pray for healing for all.\"",
      "The 10 accused have been known in France as les papys braqueurs, or the \"Grandpa robbers,\" because of their ages. Some arrived in court in orthopedic shoes and Khedache, now deaf and largely mute, leaned on a cane. Khedache and Abbas, who previously admitted to their parts in the robbery, apologized to Kardashian and the court before their sentencing and conviction.",
      "In a scribbled note to the court, Khedache offered \"a thousand apologies.\" He also apologized to his son, Harminy A\u00eft Khedache, 38, who was a driver for the gang that night. Khedache's DNA, found on the bands used to bind Kardashian, was a key breakthrough that helped crack open the case. Wiretaps captured him giving orders, recruiting accomplices and arranging to sell the diamonds in Belgium. A diamond-encrusted cross, dropped during the escape, was the only piece of jewelry ever recovered.",
      "Abbas, 71, who had already apologized directly to Kardashian for contributing to the trauma she said she lives with daily, told the court: \"All I have to say is to apologize to you again; I'm sorry for what I may have done.\"",
      "He was suspected of being the lookout for the gang, stationed outside the luxury residence known as the No Name hotel.",
      "Khedache's son Harminy, 38, accused of having been a driver for the gang that night, was given a five-year sentence, with four of those years suspended.",
      "The only woman in the dock, Christiane Glotin, 79, former companion of Aomar A\u00eft Khedache, who was accused of being the gang's \"secretary,\" was given a four-year suspended sentence.",
      "Fran\u00e7ois Delaporte, charged with being an accomplice, was handed a three-year suspended sentence. Marc Boyer, father of Marc-Alexandre Boyer, was fined $5,700 on weapons charges.",

      "Over the course of my long career in medical journalism, I had the great privilege of getting to know many of the leading medical researchers in this country. They were typically people of great integrity who had dedicated themselves to the often-frustrating and tedious task of painstaking research to find new cures and preventions for important medical problems. And the bottom line for many of them was that, without government support, they could never have achieved the discoveries that have helped us all.",
      "Which is why I am stunned by a recent report that states the Trump administration's National Institutes of Health has stopped payments on grants totaling more than $1.8 billion for nearly 700 specific medical research projects.",
      "This sledgehammer approach will cause terrible damage to many outstanding research programs, and it will destroy the careers of many young medical scientists just starting their research.

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's airport screening program has detected multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which has been linked to a large surge of the virus in China.",
      "Cases linked to the NB.1.8.1 variant have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area, according to records uploaded by the CDC's airport testing partner Ginkgo Bioworks.",
      "Details about the sequencing results, which were published in recent weeks on the GISAID, or Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, virus database, show the cases stem from travelers from a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Vietnam, China and Taiwan. The travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12, the records show.",
      "Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.",
      "Experts have been closely watching the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a \"significant increase\" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19.",
      "\"CDC is aware of reported cases of COVID-19 NB.1.8.1 in China and is in regular contact with international partners,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson said that, so far, too few U.S. sequences have been reported of NB.1.8.1 to be included in the agency's\u00a0variant estimates\u00a0dashboard.",
      "While authorities in Hong Kong say there is no evidence that the variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage of the virus, is more severe, they have begun urging residents to mask when in public transportation or crowded places as cases have climbed.",
      "Health authorities in Taiwan have also reported a rise in emergency room visits, severe cases and deaths. Local health authorities say they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response to the epidemic wave.",
      "Preliminary data from researchers in China suggest the NB.1.8.1 variant is not better at evading the immune system compared to other strains on the rise, but it does have a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible.",
      "\"A more predictable pattern\"",
      "The strain came up multiple times during a Thursday meeting of the Food and Drug Administration's outside vaccine advisers, as they wrestled with whether and how to recommend updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming fall and winter seasons.",
      "Vaccines from last season targeted a descendant of the JN.1 variant called KP.2. Early data presented to the committee by Pfizer and Moderna suggested switching to a different JN.1 descendant that has been dominant in recent months, called LP.8.1, could boost protection against NB.1.8.1, too.",
      "\"The LP.8.1 vaccine has the highest titers against LP.8.1, which is dominant in the U.S. and many other regions and cross-neutralizes other currently circulating variants, including NB.1.8.1, a dominant JN.1 subvariant in many Asian countries,\" Darin Edwards, lead of Moderna's COVID-19 program, told the panel.",
      "The committee unanimously backed recommending that the coming season's vaccines should target some kind of JN.1 variant, but was split on the details. Some favored allowing vaccine makers to stick with last season's vaccines, while others called for the update to target the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 that Pfizer and Moderna have prototyped.",
      "\"Although one can't predict evolution, and you don't know how this is going to keep diversifying, the overwhelming odds are that what does come and predominate in the next few months, the next six months, next year will come from something that's circulating now. It won't come from something that doesn't exist any longer,\" Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's division of viral products, said.",
      "For now, CDC and FDA officials told the panel that only one strain \u2014 a variant called XFC \u2014 has been significantly growing in the U.S. But they cautioned that the evolution of the virus has been unpredictable, even as the country has settled into a relatively predictable pattern of two surges a year: once in the summer and once over the winter.",
      "This past season only saw an evolutionary \"drift\" in the virus, as opposed to the kind of sweeping replacements driven by highly mutated strains in some earlier years. While COVID-19 trends climbed over the winter, they remained far below previous peaks.",
      "\"Throughout this winter, we didn't see that strain replacement that we have in the past couple of years. But I'm not saying that the virus will not shift again in the immediate future,\" the CDC's Natalie Thornburg told the panel. Thornburg is the acting chief of the laboratory branch in the CDC's division for coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.",
      "Rates of COVID-19 have now fallen back to low levels nationwide, measured through emergency room visits and wastewater testing.",
      "\"I do think after five years now, we are seeing very distinct patterns that [are] falling into a more predictable pattern,\" Thornburg said, citing a \"seasonality analysis\" that the agency has been working on about the virus.",

    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify\u00a0medical exceptions\u00a0under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S., putting the GOP-backed proposal on the brink of reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk.",
      "The changes would not expand abortion access in Texas or list specific medical exceptions under the state's near-total ban, which took effect in 2022 and only allows for an abortion to save the life of the mother. It also would not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "But the proposal is still a pivot for Texas\u00a0Republicans, who for years have defended the law as written in the face of legal challenges and pleas for clarity from medical providers.\u00a0Democrats, meanwhile, have called the bill a positive step but also faced criticism from some abortion-rights allies who raised doubts about what, if any, impact it will have.",
      "The bill would specify that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. It also defines a \"life-threatening\" condition as one capable of causing death.",
      "Senate Bill 31\u00a0passed 129-6 and needs only a final procedural vote before reaching Abbott, who has signaled support for the measure.",
      "North Texas doctor has mixed feelings toward the bill",
      "Three years ago, Dr. Austin Dennard traveled outside Texas for an abortion after her fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition. She later testified in a lawsuit about how the state's near-total ban on abortion put her health at risk.",
      "Dennard's feelings are mixed about the bill, which does not list specific medical conditions or include fatal fetal anomalies as exceptions.",
      "\"What is broadly now known among practicing physicians in Texas is that abortions are illegal,\" said Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas. \"Undoing that broad understanding is going to be difficult.\"",
      "Moves to clarify medical exemptions",
      "Lawmakers in at least nine states with abortion bans have sought to change or clarify medical exceptions that allow doctors to perform an abortion if the mother's life is at risk since Roe v. Wade was overturned\u00a0nearly three years ago, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Supporters of these bills have said they have the potential to save lives. Critics, including some abortion rights groups, have questioned whether they make state abortion laws easier to understand.",
      "In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year vetoed a bill that GOP lawmakers touted as bringing clarity to that state's near-total abortion ban, saying it would not protect pregnant women. Republican lawmakers later overrode his veto.",
      "Last year, South Dakota released a video for physicians that outlined examples of acceptable medical emergencies, which received criticism from abortion rights supporters for not being specific enough.",
      "\"I think these bills are trying to get at the reality that exceptions are really hard to comply with,\" said Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy adviser at the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "Still, Texas Republican Sen. Bryan Hughes, an architect of the state's abortion ban, said the new bill's goal is to avoid confusion among doctors.",
      "\"One of the most important things we want to do is to make sure that doctors and hospitals and the hospital lawyers are trained on what the law is,\" Hughes said.",
      "Navigating exceptions under abortion bans",
      "In 2024, the Texas Supreme Court ruled against Dennard and a group of women who said they were denied abortions after experiencing serious pregnancy complications that threatened their lives and fertility. The court ruled that the state's laws were clear in allowing doctors to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother.",
      "Texas' efforts underscore the challenges abortion opponents have had to navigate regarding medical exceptions, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law and a historian of abortion politics in the U.S.",
      "Judges have put enforcement of Utah's abortion ban on hold in a case over exceptions, for example, and they struck down two Oklahoma bans over medical exceptions \u2013 though most abortions in that state remain illegal.",
      "For abortion opponents, Ziegler said, it's tricky to craft legislation that does two different things.",
      "\"Can you provide clear guidance as to when medical intervention is justified without providing physicians discretion to provide abortions they don't think are emergencies?\" Ziegler said.",
      "Texas may advance other anti-abortion laws",
      "Texas' ban prohibits nearly all abortions, except to save the life of the mother, and doctors can be fined up to $100,000 and face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an abortion illegally.",
      "Attorney General Ken Paxton's office has filed criminal charges against a midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions and is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",
      "Texas Republicans are also advancing efforts to make it a civil offense to mail, deliver or manufacture abortion pills, expanding on a 2021 law that allows private individuals to sue others whom they suspect are helping a woman obtain an abortion.",

      "Orders to expand the warnings were posted Wednesday by the FDA, in letters dated April 17 to Pfizer and BioNTech about their Comirnaty vaccine and Moderna about its Spikevax vaccine.",
      "Both vaccines previously carried warnings about how the risk of the heart side effects \u2014 which doctors call myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) \u2014 looked to be higher in young men, generally within the first week after vaccination. While the earlier labels specified ages 18 to 24 years old for Moderna's vaccine and 12 to 17 years old for Pfizer's, the new warning will apply to males ages 16 to 25 for both vaccines.",
      "\"Following administration of the 2023-2024 Formula of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the highest estimated incidence of myocarditis and/or pericarditis was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" the FDA says in the new blanket warning it will require for both vaccines.",
      "The rate of myocarditis and pericarditis was around 8 cases per million doses for children and adults under 65 years old after use of that season's vaccines, the FDA says.",
      "The new warnings ordered by the FDA add that the \"highest estimated incidence was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" with a rate of 38 cases per million.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has previously described rates of myocarditis and pericarditis as rare after COVID-19 vaccination.",

      "It is unclear whether Pfizer or Moderna disputed the order. They had \"within 30 calendar days of the date of this letter\" to try to rebut the demand. Spokespeople for Moderna and Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"Americans deserve radical transparency around the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines and the FDA is delivering on their promise to do just that. Moderna and Pfizer should take steps to ensure that individuals are aware of COVID vaccine-related adverse events resulting in myocarditis and pericarditis,\" Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the\u00a0Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News in an email. Nixon did not explain why the letters were posted more than a month after they were written.",
      "They appeared on the FDA's website hours ahead of a hearing organized by the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on \"how health officials downplayed and hid myocarditis and other adverse events associated with the COVID-19 vaccines.\"",
      "Aaron Siri, an attorney who worked closely with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the past to call on the FDA to pull COVID-19 and other vaccines and vet nominees during the transition, is among the witnesses.",
      "The FDA says the warnings were spurred by new data from the agency's safety surveillance system and results published in October from scientists following up with people who developed COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis.",
      "Talks about this kind of safety labeling change began before the ouster of the FDA's previous top vaccines official, Dr. Peter Marks, multiple people familiar with the situation said, but had not yet been finalized as officials wrestled with how to accurately present the findings. Marks left the FDA on April 5.",
      "Scientists in that study followed up with people who had faced chest pain and elevated amounts of troponin in their blood, a protein that usually signals some kind of heart damage. They were predominantly young adolescent males.",
      "\"While their clinical course was nearly always mild with a low prevalence and extent of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury was common,\" the scientists wrote in the study, which was co-authored by FDA officials.",
      "Similar to what the study described, the FDA's new warning also says that the heart MRI findings showed \"improvement over time in most people.\"",

The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall.",
      "\"I think we have to admit to ourselves that America is deeply divided on the policy issue of repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses or boosters,\"\u00a0Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA's new top vaccines official, said in a video posted by the agency announcing the change.",
      "Details of the new rules for COVID-19 vaccine approvals were also outlined in\u00a0an article\u00a0published by The New England Journal of Medicine, authored by Prasad and FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct \"randomized, placebo-controlled trials\" before the FDA will approve future applications to give shots to \"all healthy persons\" between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old, they wrote.",
      "Otherwise, companies will only be able to get their routine COVID-19 vaccine updates approved for seniors as well as people with an underlying medical condition, like pregnancy or diabetes, that increases the risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The range of diseases in the CDC definition of high risk of severe disease is vast, including obesity and even mental health conditions such as depression. Estimates suggest that 100 million to 200 million Americans will have access to vaccines in this manner,\" they wrote.",
      "Vaccine makers are being urged to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain. Prasad said they are also encouraging new trials in children under 5.",
      "\"I think we have a really good balance between vulnerable people, that people still at high risk will still have a rapid path to access, but people at average risk and low risk, they need evidence,\" said Prasad.",
      "Makary and Prasad criticized the U.S. for adopting \"a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework\" to grant broad authorization for past COVID-19 vaccine boosters in the past, and cited poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "They also pointed to other developed countries that have already limited annual COVID-19 vaccine boosters to only older adults and those with underlying conditions that increase their risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The U.S. policy has sometimes been justified by arguing that the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations. We reject this view,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News,\u00a0told \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday that these guidelines are essentially taking away the option to get a booster for some.",
      "\"Up until now, people have been opting, do they want to (get a booster), do they not? Now, if you're under 65, you may not be able to get an updated booster,\" she said. \"They are requiring clinical trials that, quite frankly, because of how long it takes, how expensive they are, it's very unlikely that they would happen in time for an updated booster for those younger age groups.\"",
      "While requiring these clinical trials may seem like a more evidence-based approach, Gounder said she's skeptical.",
      "\"There's a little double speak going,\" she said, adding typically, there would be a publicly shared systematic review of all vaccine data ahead of a change like this. \"What you got here was a two and a half page paper, which was really a policy opinion piece, in the New England Journal of Medicine in a town hall meeting. Normally, when you have a big change like this at the FDA, this is done much more transparently.\"",
      "The new \"regulatory framework for COVID-19 vaccination\" laid out by the FDA's new leadership under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. comes ahead of a key meeting of the agency's outside vaccine advisers this Thursday, to decide on how to update the strain used in next season's shots.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has greenlit those updates in a process similar to the annual flu shots, based largely on laboratory data showing the vaccines can trigger antibody levels similar to previously approved shots.",
      "That is a lower bar than requiring brand new randomized trials of the vaccines tested against a placebo to show it prevents symptomatic disease \u2014 a process which is usually only required for new shots when there is no currently approved immunization available.",
      "But Makary and Prasad said COVID-19 shots should be held to a different standard, citing differences in how the virus mutates and the immunity offered by vaccines and previous infection.",
      "\"Ultimately, these studies alone can provide reassurance that the American repeat-boosters-in-perpetuity strategy is evidence-based,\" they wrote.",
      "It is unclear whether and when vaccine makers would be able to conduct these kinds of trials, if they wanted to try again for a broader approval from the FDA. Makary and Prasad floated the possibility of trials as soon as the coming months.",
      "\"Covid-19 has summer transmission that can facilitate the conduct of randomized studies that continue to apply in future time periods,\" they wrote.",
      "Prasad said interim results from some of the studies could be ready \"by next calendar year.\"",
      "Pfizer said it is \"evaluating the details shared today\" and is in ongoing talks with the FDA. The company said its shots had been administered to over a billion people, including kids, showing favorable safety data.",
      "\"We stand by the science behind the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and continue to believe that broad vaccination programs are an essential tool for helping to prevent COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and severe disease, including death,\" Pfizer spokesperson Steven Danehy said in a statement.",
      "Moderna spokesperson Chris Ridley said they \"appreciate the FDA's clear guidance and remain committed to working with the Agency to provide the data they need to ensure access for Americans.\"",
      "A Novavax spokesperson declined to comment. Novavax earned a narrow FDA approval over the weekend for its COVID-19 vaccine, which was limited to seniors as well as adults and adolescents with at least one underlying condition.",
      "While U.S. health care providers are usually allowed to administer vaccines with FDA approval \"off-label\" outside the limits laid out by the agency, a narrower approval can affect access and limit insurance coverage for the vaccinations.",
      "It comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also been weighing narrowed recommendations for the shots.",
      "The CDC's recommendations directly impact which vaccinations health insurers are required to cover under the law.",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to release a report Thursday on how pesticides and other issues may be linked to childhood chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought Tuesday to reassure farmers and one Republican senator about his upcoming report on how pesticides are driving up rates of childhood chronic diseases, acknowledging that chemicals like glyphosate that he has long criticized are widely used for growing crops in the U.S.",
      "\"I have said repeatedly throughout this process, that we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" Kennedy said at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\"",
      "The White House in February tasked Kennedy with leading a \"Make America Healthy Again Commission,\" which is producing a report assessing the threat of a range of issues that might be causing disease in children.",
      "Targets include the \"potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures\" in children. Kennedy said their report was due to be released Thursday.",
      "\"Your information about the report is just simply wrong,\" Kennedy told Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi in response to a question about the report. \"The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.\"",
      "Hyde-Smith had told Kennedy that she was \"deeply concerned\" that the report will \"unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools\" that U.S. farmers use.",
      "\"We all know what confirmation bias is. It's no secret that you were involved with pesticide litigation, prior to becoming secretary,\" Hyde-Smith told Kennedy.",
      "What has RFK Jr. said about pesticides like glyphosate?",
      "Kennedy has criticized the use of several pesticides in the U.S. food supply, including as an environmental attorney during court battles with chemical manufacturer Monsanto over accusations that its widely-used weedkiller Roundup \u2014 made from the chemical glyphosate \u2014 was causing cancer.",
      "\"If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luther. I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value,\" Kennedy wrote in a 2020 Facebook post.",
      "During his longshot independent presidential campaign, Kennedy pledged to get toxins out of the food supply, warning that \"toxic chemicals like glyphosate\" were widely contaminating what Americans were eating.",
      "He continued that criticism in the months ahead of the 2024 election as he stumped in support of President Trump, recalling how his son resolved his \"really agonizing\" eczema by switching to eating pasta made in Europe.",
      "\"As soon as he comes back here and he eats the pasta in this country, he gets eczema,\" he told Donald Trump Jr. on a podcast in September of last year. \"And you know, they don't have the glyphosate like we do, that is sprayed on the wheat at harvest time. So it's going right into the food.\"",
      "What will be in RFK Jr.'s \"MAHA Commission\" report?",
      "One of Kennedy's top HHS advisers, Calley Means \u2014 whose sister Dr. Casey Means was nominated by President Trump earlier this month for the surgeon general post \u2014 said that the report is aimed at outlining \"obvious\" ways that children are \"being poisoned through areas that there's not even that much scientific disagreement on.\"",
      "\"Obviously, it's because of environmental toxins,\" Means said, speaking at a May 15 event hosted by the Kennedy-aligned MAHA Institute. \"We produce and ingest 25% of the world's pesticides. The leading herbicides and pesticides that we use in the United States, many of them are phased out or banned in every other country in the world.\"",
      "Means said that the report was not intended to result in \"a European nanny state system\" to crack down on pesticides, pledging instead to come up with \"pro-innovation policies to solve this issue\" under Kennedy. He blasted lobbyists for opposing the report's release.",
      "Beyond \"environmental toxins\" like pesticides, Means listed a number of other issues he alleges are making American children sick, including ultra-processed foods, added sugars, seed oils, sedentary behavior, lack of sleep, overprescriptions and vaccines.",
      "\"They're saying it's going to scare the American people to get facts out. They're putting so much pressure on President Trump, so much pressure on Secretary Kennedy to not release facts,\" Means said last week.",
      "What power does RFK Jr. have over pesticides?",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services does not directly set the limits on how glyphosate and other pesticides are used. That is left up to the Environmental Protection Agency. However, HHS does oversee the major research that underpins how the EPA regulates chemicals.",
      "Studies into pesticides like glyphosate to inform the EPA's limits often come from the federal health agencies within HHS.",
      "For example, the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program published results in 2023 suggesting that glyphosate is \"unlikely\" to be genotoxic, which had been one of the main ways international experts previously suspected it might cause cancer.",
      "Results from a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in 2022 found that diet was likely a factor in how much glyphosate people were being exposed to, based on urine samples taken in adults and children.",
      "Through the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy also has authority over how glyphosate levels in food are tracked and the EPA's limits are enforced.",
      "The last round of published sampling by the FDA in 2022 found that 54 samples of human food had detectable amounts of glyphosate out of 731 analyzed. Corn and beans were among the most frequent detections.",

      "A Twin Cities woman is suing over an alleged medical mistake that she says cost her a healthy left kidney.",
      "In a lawsuit filed Friday, Wendy Rappaport of Plymouth accuses the surgeon and the Allina hospital system of medical malpractice and battery. Allina says the court filings \"don't accurately reflect the full picture\" and intends to fight the suit in court.",
      "Rappaport was admitted to Abbott Northwestern in March 2022 and was scheduled for a spleen removal surgery, the lawsuit says. After the doctor recommended the surgery, the suit says he reviewed the risk of procedure with her.",
      "The lawsuit says that the doctor performed an open laparotomy procedure, during which Rappaport's \"left kidney was removed instead of her spleen.\" In a post-operative note, the doctor said he removed an intact spleen during the surgery, but a post-operative CT scan showed her left kidney had been removed, and the spleen tissue was still present, the lawsuit says.",
      "Before the surgery, a CT scan showed that Rappaport's kidneys were \"unremarkable. No suspicious masses, stones, or hydronephrosis,\" according to the lawsuit. Rappaport did not consent to the removal of her left kidney, documents state.",
      "She stayed in the hospital until May 25, 2022 due to complications following the removal of the kidney, the suit says. She also now requires continued treatment, including dialysis, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit claims the doctor committed medical malpractice and medical battery. The lawsuit accuses him of breaching his duty of care he owed Rappaport and causing permanent, irreversible injury. The Allina health system also faces similar allegations, as the medical professionals involved in the surgery also owed her a duty of care, documents say.",
      "Rappaport is seeking at least $50,000 in the case.",
      "An affidavit filed by an Iowa City doctor says that the Allina surgeon \"deviated from the applicable standard of medical care owed to Ms. Rappaport.\"",
      "Failing to identify the left kidney during the procedure \"was a medical mistake\" and \"one that does not occur in the absence of negligence,\" he writes.",
      "\"Allina Health is aware of the lawsuit and has had the case reviewed by medical experts. While we will not discuss details of a patient's care due to privacy laws, the court filings don't accurately reflect the full picture of the patient's condition or the life-saving medical care provided. We intend to vigorously defend, in court, the care that was provided,\" Allina Health said in a statement.",
      "In a statement Tuesday afternoon, Rappaport's lawyers said:",
      "The Schmidt and Salita Law Team represents Wendy Rappaport for injuries she suffered as a result of the negligent and unnecessary removal of her left kidney. The Defendants were supposed to remove a \"sick\" spleen but removed the incorrect organ. As a result, Ms. Rappaport suffers not only the loss of her left kidney but also permanent kidney impairment, and she requires specific medical treatment to maintain her ongoing kidney function. This was not the case for Ms. Rappaport prior to the unnecessary kidney removal. On 5/16/2025, we commenced the lawsuit on Ms. Rappaport's behalf seeking fair compensation for her injuries and the future damages she will incur due to the Defendant's medical malpractice and medical battery. The removal of the incorrect organ has and will continue to have a profound and unnecessary impact on her life and health.",

    "published": "Sun, 25 May 2025 09:53:33 -0400",
    "summary": "What began as the world's first aerial crop-dusting operation in the Mississippi Delta in 1925 has survived mergers, recessions and bankruptcy to become a global carrier with 5,000 flights a day.",
    "story": [
      "When you picture a garage sale, you might think of your neighbor's driveway down the street, not an aviation workshop in the shadow of the world's busiest airport, where Delta Air Lines holds their monthly surplus sale.",
      "Delta fans came from as far as Michigan and even Korea to buy the stuff the airline no longer needs, from seats to engine parts. It's a chance, these folks say, to own a piece of airline history. And how would they get the stuff home? \"We actually flew down with empty bags,\" said one man.",
      "Sarah Zeis came in search of a particular piece of Delta history: a well-used beverage cart. \"I actually need a bar cart in my apartment of these exact dimensions,\" she said.",
      "Getting it home will be a journey all its own.",
      "Proceeds from the sale go right across the parking lot, to the Delta Flight Museum, now celebrating the airline's 100th year \u2013 a first for an American carrier.",
      "It's a century of service that started without beverage carts \u2026 or passengers!",
      "According to archives director Marie Force, Delta owes its existence to a tiny pest: the boll weevil. \"It is the most unique beginning of a U.S. airline, I think,\" she said. \"It's the only airline that started as a crop-dusting company\"",
      "Before Delta, there was Huff-Daland Dusters, started in 1925 in Macon, Georgia. Force said, \"After the first growing season, they realized that most of the center of the business was in the Mississippi Delta region. And so, that's where the name Delta comes from.\"",
      "And in 1929, Delta Air Lines' founder C.E. Woolman expanded the company from pest control to people. Its first passenger flight was from Dallas, Texas, to Jackson, Mississippi, with two stops in Louisiana along the way. A ticket cost $90 round trip \u2013 about $1,700 today. Expensive, and not for everyone. Force said, \"At that time, about 80% of Delta's passengers were businessmen\" \u2013 people trying to speed up a trip that took 12 hours by train to a five-hour flight.",
      "Nearly a century after that first flight, Delta now has more than 5,000 flights a day. The airline has survived mergers, recessions, and bankruptcy, growing from that single route to a nationwide carrier, and the global force we know today.",
      "\"Glamour personified\"",
      "If you've flown Delta lately, you've seen flight attendant Susan Slater in the pre-flight safety video. If you've flown Delta in the last 60 years, you may have shared a cabin with either Slater (who started with the airline on March 2, 1964) or Kay Carpenter (who started in January 1966). It was the \"Golden Age\" of air travel, that romanticized era of flights with exceptional service, extravagant meals, and everyone dressed to the nines.",
      "Back then, said Slater, \"You had to be unmarried. Your hair couldn't touch your collar. You had a weight restriction. Back then I think I weighed 103 pounds and I was 5 foot 2-and-a-half. I'm five feet now, barely, and not 103!\"",
      "I asked, \"What was it about the job that you think spoke to you so much?\"",
      "\"All I knew was that this was glamour personified,\" Slater replied.",
      "Atmosphere Research Group's Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst, says there is no need to be so quite so nostalgic: \"We certainly had a so-called Golden Age of flying back in the early 1960s,\" he said. \"But it was less convenient. There were fewer flights. You often had to connect. And it certainly wasn't as reliable and safe as it is today.",
      "\"We're in the new type of Golden Age now, where flying is a lot more accessible,\" he said. \"You can either buy or create a much nice journey for yourself. You can buy an extra leg room seat. You can pay for priority boarding. And by the way, if you don't need or value those things or perhaps can't afford it, you're not being charged for services that you don't want.\"",
      "Ed Bastian, the CEO of Delta Air Lines, said, \"Air travel is one of the great bargains. If you think about the average fare today versus where it was 30, 40 years ago, it's less than half of what you pay in real dollars.\"",
      "While low fares are sought after by some fliers, Delta has built its business around a premium experience, according to Bastian: \"The single biggest reason why people chose an airline was fare; whoever had the lowest cost won. And Delta, well, yes, we have a product to compete on the lower end. [But] the majority of our revenue comes from higher-end tickets.\"",
      "Their 100th summer is about to take flight, amid clouds of uncertainty \u2026 worries about a slowing economy and aviation safety. But Bastian says it could still be their busiest ever, as he looks to the future.",
      "So, what does he see for Delta's next hundred years? \"When you think in the United States, you know, air travel is relatively ubiquitous \u2013 you jump on a plane almost any hour of the day and get to almost anywhere you want, you know, pretty, pretty easily,\" Bastian said. \"However, when you think about the world, and you realize that only one in five people in the world has even been on an airplane, it's pretty remarkable. We need to figure out ways to make it accessible, to make it affordable, to make it sustainable.\"",
      "I said, \"Part of that legacy is just how much the world has shrunk in those 100 years.\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's what we do,\" Bastian said. \"We make the world a more connected place, a smaller place. And that's needed now more than ever.\"",
      "While Delta helped shrink the world in the 20th century, they hope their own growth continues, thanks to folks like Susan Slater and Kay Carpenter.",
      "\"It's been a wonderful adventure,\" Carpenter said. \"I never dreamed that I would be here for this long. When I started, we had just small airplanes. We flew to small cities. And now we fly to six continents. So, I tell all these new hire flight attendants to always remember that one mile on a highway is going to take you exactly one mile. But a mile on a runway will take you anywhere.\"",

      "Publix recalled 4-ounce Greenwise Pear, Kiwi, Spinach & Pea Baby Food pouches sold at more than 1,400 stores.",
      "The pouches were produced by Bowman Andros, a French company with a manufacturing plant in Mount Jackson, Virginia, according to the company's website. Publix issued the voluntary recall on May 9, but it wasn't added to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recall list until late Thursday.",
      "The potential contamination was flagged by officials in North Carolina, the state that first identified a 2023 lead poisoning outbreak linked to tainted applesauce pouches that sickened more than 500 U.S. children.",
      "Routine sampling of the baby food pouches found lead levels at 13.4 parts per billion, according to North Carolina agriculture officials. That exceeds the FDA's recommended limit of 10 parts per billion for such products intended for babies and young children.",
      "Publix said all the potentially contaminated products have been removed from store shelves. No illnesses have been reported, the company said. Customers can return the pouches to local stores for full refund.",
      "This is the second baby food pouch recall because of potential lead contamination in two months. In March, Target recalled more than 25,000 packages of its store brand Good & Gather Baby Pea, Zucchini, Kale & Thyme Vegetable Puree because of elevated lead levels.",
      "North Carolina collaborates with the FDA to conduct routine testing of food products, officials said.",
      "In 2023, state health officials investigated reports of lead poisoning in four children who consumed WanaBana apple cinnamon fruit puree. Those findings led to the detection of a nationwide outbreak linked to the pouches, which were widely sold in Dollar Tree and other stores. Tests showed they contained lead at levels 2,000 times higher than the FDA's maximum recommended level, as well as chromium.",
      "Federal health officials eventually identified 566 cases of confirmed, probable or suspected cases of lead poisoning tied to the pouches in 44 states.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said this week he may take home lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, winding down 17 years of federal control over two central parts of the U.S. housing market \u2014 a move that was cheered on by Trump ally and noted Wall Street investor Bill Ackman.",
      "Ending the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie \u2014 which guarantee trillions of dollars worth of mortgages \u2014 would be complicated, and critics say it's risky. A plan to do so in Mr. Trump's first term did not come to pass. But the president says he'll decide \"in the near future\" whether to try again, pointing to the firms' return to profitability since their 2008 government takeover.",
      "\"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are doing very well, throwing off a lot of CASH, and the time would seem to be right,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social late Wednesday \u2014 prompting a double-digit rally in shares the next day of both Fannie and Freddie, which trade over the counter rather than on a major stock exchange.",
      "The idea of taking the two government-sponsored enterprises public has drawn some support for years, with advocates arguing Fannie and Freddie could function better if released from federal control. Releasing Fannie and Freddie could also benefit some investors who have bought shares in the firms over the years, betting on an eventual federal spinoff of the mortgage giants.",
      "One of the largest \u2014 and most vocal \u2014 is Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management invested in Fannie and Freddie over a decade ago. The firm is the biggest private holder of Fannie, at just over 115 million shares according to S&P Capital IQ data \u2014 worth over $1.2 billion at Friday's price. Ackman said in an earnings call Thursday that Pershing Square owns about 220 million shares in Fannie and Freddie combined.",
      "Other major holders of the two enterprises include Capital Research and Management Company, which has the largest known stake in Freddie ($350 million) and the second-largest stake in Fannie (over $1 billion), according to S&P Capital IQ. Paulson & Co., founded by billionaire John Paulson, also invested in Fannie and Freddie at one point, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 \u2014 though the size of its current stake is unclear.",
      "Since Mr. Trump was reelected last year, Ackman has publicly pushed on X to end the federal conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie, calling it a good deal for taxpayers that could generate as much as $300 billion for the government. In January, Pershing Square put together a presentation called \"The Art of the Deal\" that made the case in more detail.",
      "\"Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history. I am confident he will get it done,\" Ackman wrote on X in December.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced Wednesday he's \"giving very serious consideration\" to the idea, Ackman responded on X with a thumbs-up emoji. In Thursday's earnings call, Ackman said, \"[W]e're extremely encouraged by the president's announcement.\" Ackman also said Thursday the firm wasn't aware of any plans by the Trump administration to release Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship.",
      "Famous for his sharp-elbowed activist investing strategy and pandemic-era bets, Ackman has made waves in recent months for his political views. He endorsed Mr. Trump in 2024 and has taken aim at the leadership of Harvard University over its handling of Israel-Hamas war protests.",
      "Skeptics of releasing Fannie and Freddie, like Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have pushed back on the idea, warning it could benefit investors at the risk of disrupting the mortgage market.",
      "\"[The president] hasn't come to Congress with any kind of plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2013 and the last thing we need is to privatize them in a way that rewards Wall Street while driving up housing prices for people already struggling to buy homes,\" Warren, a Massachusetts lawmaker and the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement, \"The Trump Administration is committed to strengthening the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to advance the President's mission of restoring the dream of homeownership for all Americans. Any actions under consideration will be carefully evaluated in a safe and sound manner to deliver on the President's historic agenda.\"",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square declined to comment to CBS News. FHFA \u2014 which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 and why could they be privatized?",
      "The government created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 or, more formally, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation \u2014 in the 20th century, with Fannie Mae dating back to the Great Depression. They essentially buy mortgages from lenders like banks and bundle them together into guaranteed mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors \u2014 a space known as the secondary mortgage market.",
      "The point of this work is to bring more money into the nation's residential lending system, making it easier for average families to buy a home. Fannie Mae describes itself as \"the backbone of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\"",
      "For decades, Fannie and Freddie were both publicly traded companies, though many observers believed they operated with an \"implicit guarantee\" that the government would step in if either company wobbled.",
      "But after a mortgage crisis sparked the 2008 recession, the Bush administration bailed out Fannie and Freddie and put them under federal conservatorship to save them from collapse. Since then, the FHFA has effectively controlled the two firms. That arrangement wasn't necessarily supposed to be permanent, but it has lasted for over a decade, with the two companies making billions in payments to the government.",
      "A push for the government to end its conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie has been brewing for years. Some critics view the firms as unfairly dominant in the mortgage industry and believe they fill a role that should be played by the private sector. Other supporters of privatization like Ackman argue it could provide a windfall to taxpayers, partly because, in a holdover from the financial crisis, the government has the right to purchase almost 80% of both firms' shares.",
      "Opponents of privatization argue it could push up mortgage rates, especially if Fannie and Freddie are no longer viewed as backstopped by the government. How that plays out could depend on how the government decides to end the conservatorship, though, and whether it still offers some kind of guarantee. Credit agency Fitch Ratings said it would keep rating Fannie and Freddie's debt similarly to the U.S. government's debt if the firms maintain a federal backstop, but if not, they would be rated separately \u2014 and could slip if their market dominance shrinks.",
      "The risk of higher mortgage costs could be a major stumbling block in an era of elevated interest rates. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg earlier this year, \"anything that is done around a safe and sound release [of Fannie and Freddie] is going to hinge on the effect of long-term mortgage rates.\"",
      "In part for that reason, Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen, said in a note Friday that the firm expects the Trump administration to make changes to Fannie and Freddie at a \"slower and more deliberate\" pace than it has moved on other issues, like tariffs.",
      "\"Tariffs may have impacted the stock market, but they did not result in immediate price hikes at Walmart or Dollar General. By contrast, the price of mortgages will respond to each recap and release development,\" Seiberg wrote. \"That makes the political cost more immediate and gives the President less room to alter positions as he has done on trade.\"",
      "In his first term, Mr. Trump's Treasury Department proposed ending Fannie and Freddie's conservatorship. While the first Trump administration ultimately didn't take this step, it made some changes to how the two institutions operate.",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square called releasing Fannie and Freddie the \"Unfinished Business of the First Trump Administration\" in its January presentation. The firm laid out a possible roadmap to turn Fannie and Freddie into independent publicly traded companies: It suggested holding initial public offerings by 2026 for Fannie and 2027 for Freddie, and then allowing the federal government to sell its stakes over five years.",
      "But it's unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 the Trump administration may pursue the idea. In his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this year, FHFA Director William Pulte said he believed that any end to government control of Fannie and Freddie needed to be \"extremely thoughtful.\"",
      "\"While their conservatorship should not be indefinite, any exit from conservatorship must be carefully planned to ensure the safety and soundness of the housing market without upward pressure on mortgage rates,\" Pulte said.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 May 2025 16:53:55 -0400",
    "summary": "Extreme weather linked to climate change will likely lead to more Americans losing their homes as foreclosure rates rise, researchers predict.",
    "story": [
      "Extreme weather linked to climate change could spell financial ruin for many American homeowners and lead to billions in losses for lenders, a new study finds.",
      "First Street, a research firm that studies the impact of climate change, projects in an analysis\u00a0released Monday that foreclosures across the U.S. caused by flooding, wind and other weather-related incidents could soar 380% over the next 10 years. By 2035, climate-driven events could account for up to 30% of all foreclosures by 2035, up from roughly 7% this year.",
      "Low- to moderate-income households are particularly vulnerable to the effect of severe weather on their homes, First Street noted. Much of Americans' wealth is tied up in the value of their properties.",
      "A cascade of foreclosures, driven by the mounting costs of repairs and rising insurance premiums stemming from extreme weather, \u00a0wouldn't only hurt homeowners. First Street estimates lenders will lose $1.2 billion a year in 2025 \u2014 and up to $5.4 billion in 10 years \u2014 as they are forced to absorb the cost of mortgage defaults.",
      "Such losses represent the \"hidden risks\" of climate change that lenders often fail to account for in their underwriting practices, Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at First Street, told CBS MoneyWatch. Lenders consider factors including a borrower's income, debt and credit score in issuing mortgages, but not the potential impact of extreme weather on a property or how it could raise premiums.",
      "First Street also looked at how indirect factors, like rising insurance premiums, are already shaping foreclosure trends. For every 1% increase in insurance costs, the firm projects a roughly 1% increase in the foreclosure rate nationwide.",
      "The findings comes as insurers are jacking up the cost of homeowners policies and in some cases exiting markets around the U.S. altogether, leading to spottier coverage in disaster-prone areas like California. That could leave more individual homeowners on the hook for damage from extreme weather.",
      "First Street said integrating climate risk into loan assessments could help lenders \u2013 and homeowners \u2013 be better prepared for weather-related disasters. But it could also tighten lending conditions, Porter said, putting potential homebuyers at a disadvantage.",
      "\"It's going to increase the price of homes. It's going to increase interest rates,\" he said.",
      "Where climate foreclosures could rise",
      "According to First Street, the communities around the U.S. at greatest risk for climate-related foreclosures in the years to come are densely populated areas with high property values and large numbers of underinsured homeowners. That includes coastal areas vulnerable to storm surge and hurricane winds.",
      "For example, Florida's Duval County in the northeastern corner of the state, home to the city of Jacksonville, could see up to $60 million in credit losses resulting from 900 foreclosures in a \"severe weather\" year, according to CBS MoneyWatch's analysis of First Street's data. Florida is home to 8 of the top 10 counties with the highest projected credit losses due to extreme weather, the data shows.",
      "Louisiana, California and swaths of the northeast are also projected to see high climate-related mortgage losses this year. But the impact won't just be felt in coastal areas: First Street also expects extreme rainfall and riverine flooding to drive up foreclosures in inland states.",
      "\"We do expect foreclosures to rise in those areas because the predominant driver is a lack of insurance,\" Porter said.",
      "According to First Street, flooding events in particular is likely to drive up foreclosure rates, as gaps in insurance coverage put more people at risk of defaulting on their mortgages.",
      "Unlike homeowners insurance, flood insurance is only required for people who have federally-backed mortgages in FEMA's Special Flood Hazard Areas. As of August 2023, that amounted to roughly 3.1 million policies, according to National Flood Insurance Program data. But far more people could be at risk.",
      "FEMA's 100-year flood zone maps include just under 8 million properties. But First Street estimates that nearly 18 million homes are at risk of flooding. That's because while the agency takes flooding from major river channels and coastal storm surge into account for its maps, it does not consider extreme precipitation, Porter said.",
      "\"We already know that about half the people with significant flood risk aren't mapped into [FEMA's] Special Flood Hazard Area,\" he said. \"So it leads to a state where we have a lot of underinsurance across the country, in particular from flooding.\"",
      "Meanwhile, whether or not you live in an official FEMA flood zone can make a difference when it comes to the likelihood of foreclosure, First Street found. That's because people outside flood zones often lack insurance.",
      "\"If you don't protect yourselves, then when the event does occur it's completely on you. You end up having to pay out of pocket and you may go into foreclosure,\" Porter said.",
      "In an analysis of 29 historical flood events from 2002-2019, First Street found that damaged properties outside of those FEMA-designated zones experienced foreclosure increases at an average of 52% higher than properties inside the zones.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on if and how it plans to update its flood maps. According to one estimate by the Association of State Floodplain Managers, it could take up to $11.8 billion to complete updated flood mapping in the U.S.",

      "For instance, almost 4 in 10 tipped workers earn so little that they pay no federal income tax, according to the Brookings Institution. Consequently, the tax break is likely to provide a bigger helping hand to higher-paid tipped workers, while leaving some low-income workers behind.",
      "\"If your goal is to help the poorest service workers, this is probably not the way to do it,\" said Michael Lynn, a professor of services marketing at Cornell University whose research largely focuses on tipping and other consumer behavior.",
      "The 1,100-page bill, which squeaked through the House on Thursday by a single vote, will now go to the Senate, where more changes are likely. Here's what to know about the provisions as they now stand.",
      "How would the \"No Tax on Tips\" provision work?",
      "Called the \"No Tax on Tips\" provision within the House bill, the rule would create a new tax deduction that eliminates federal income taxes on tips for people who work in jobs that have traditionally received them.",
      "There are about 4 million people in the U.S. who work in tipped occupations, or about 2.5% of all U.S. workers, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "The tax break includes some restrictions:",
      "Only those who earn less than $160,000 in 2025 would qualify.\u00a0Only workers with Social Security numbers can qualify, and if they are married, their spouse must also have a Social Security number.Tips must be reported to the employer and included on the worker's W-2 tax form.The provision would go into effect in 2025, but expire after 2028, making it a short-term tax break.\u00a0The deduction would only apply to certain jobs: The Trump administration must publish a list of occupations that qualify for the provision within 90 days of the bill's passage.",
      "Only those who earn less than $160,000 in 2025 would qualify.",
      "Only workers with Social Security numbers can qualify, and if they are married, their spouse must also have a Social Security number.",
      "Tips must be reported to the employer and included on the worker's W-2 tax form.",
      "The provision would go into effect in 2025, but expire after 2028, making it a short-term tax break.",
      "The deduction would only apply to certain jobs: The Trump administration must publish a list of occupations that qualify for the provision within 90 days of the bill's passage.",
      "\"The tip exemption will significantly increase take-home pay for most tipped workers, many of whom are low- to middle-income taxpayers,\" the White House's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), a group that advises the president on economic issues, said in a report published earlier this month.",
      "The CEA's report estimates that the average take-home pay for tipped workers would increase by $1,675 per year under the provision.",
      "Would it help all tipped workers?",
      "No, because 4 in 10 tipped workers earn too little to pay federal income taxes, which means they wouldn't see any benefit. There's also a concern that some employers could reclassify some workers as tipped workers by arguing they would receive a tax break, according to Brookings.",
      "The minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13 per hour, versus $7.25 an hour for non-tipped workers.",
      "One Fair Wage, an advocacy group representing service workers, criticized the measure, noting that the GOP bill also includes cuts to social safety net programs that many tipped workers rely on. \"It also slashes Medicaid, putting 1.2 million restaurant workers at risk of losing health care,\" One Fair Wage posted on social media.",
      "What about the Senate's No Tax on Tips Act?",
      "A separate, standalone bill called the No Tax on Tips Act, which is solely focused on giving a tax break to tipped workers, was passed by the Senate on May 20, with bipartisan support. That bill will now move to the House for a vote.",
      "The Senate bill offers similar benefits and restrictions as the \"one big, beautiful bill\" when it comes to taxes and tips, but with one major difference: The bigger GOP bill requires workers, as well as their spouses, to have a Social Security number.",
      "That requirement appears to be aimed at excluding some immigrants from tapping the tax break, while the Senate bill doesn't stipulate that taxpayers who claim this break, or their spouses, must have a Social Security number.",
      "Senator Jackie Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada, urged lawmakers to pass the Not Tax on Tips Act arguing in a statement that the bigger GOP bill combines the tax break with cuts to vital programs like Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "\"We shouldn't be forcing working families to choose between keeping their health care or keeping their tips, which is why we want this bipartisan bill on its own \u2014 on its own \u2014 not part of a harmful, extreme budget bill,\" Rosen said on the Senate floor on Wednesday.",
      "How does the \"No Tax on Overtime\" provision work?",
      "The GOP bill includes a tax break for workers who receive overtime, another one of Mr. Trump's campaign promises.",
      "About 8% of hourly workers and 4% of salaried workers receive overtime pay on a regular basis, according to the Yale Budget Lab. About 70% of salaried workers don't qualify for overtime pay, it noted.",
      "The legislation would enable workers to claim a deduction on their taxes for the amount they earned in overtime pay during the tax year, although there are some restrictions:",
      "Workers would need a Social Security number to claim the tax break, and if married, their spouses would also need a Social Security number.The tax break would go into effect in 2025 but expire after the 2028 tax year.",
      "Workers would need a Social Security number to claim the tax break, and if married, their spouses would also need a Social Security number.",
      "The tax break would go into effect in 2025 but expire after the 2028 tax year.",
      "But more guidelines about the provision would still need to be determined by the Treasury Department, according to tax firm Wolters Kluwer in a May 22 publication about the tax bill.",
      "The average overtime worker would see a tax cut between $1,400 to $1,750 per year through the new break, according to the Council of Economic Advisers.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans made a number of last-minute changes to the legislation containing President Trump's second-term agenda in order to win over opposing factions in the GOP. And, after an all-night session, the measure, entitled the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" squeaked through by a single vote.",
      "It'll now go to the Senate, which will leave its own mark on the bill. But here's what's in the legislation that was passed by the House Thursday.",
      "Tax cuts and extensions",
      "At the center of the legislation \u2014 and accounting for its biggest expense \u2014 are the provisions extending Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the cuts slated to sunset at year's end, the extension and new tax cuts have been a key priority for congressional Republicans and the White House.",
      "Beyond the 2017 tax cuts, the legislation includes a number of tax cuts that the president touted on the campaign trail. It includes no taxes on tips for workers in the service industry, like those who work at restaurants and bars, as well as people who work in the beauty industry. But it's a temporary exemption that expires at the end of 2028. The package also includes no taxes on overtime through 2028. And the new legislation would allow tax deductions on up to $10,000 in interest on auto loans for cars assembled in the U.S. This provision would be in place until 2029.",
      "The bill would also eliminate a longstanding $200 tax on gun silencers, which has been on the books since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934.",
      "And among the bill's provisions is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 through 2028.",
      "The package also includes a tax on remittances, imposing a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries. Though the bill initially would have subjected individuals to a 5% excise tax, the managers amendment, which contained the updates to the bill, lowered the tax to 3.5%.",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes changes to Medicaid, a popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans \u2014 imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children and adults.",
      "The amendment speeds up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026, a change sought by hardliners. The work requirements would apply to Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 18 and 65, and those who do not have a child under the age of 7.",
      "Increasing the State and Local Tax Deduction, or SALT",
      "Also included in the package is an increase to the cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law and currently stands at $10,000.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "The package initially included a $30,000 cap, but blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support, and they ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "Border security funding",
      "Though the bulk of the funding allocated in the legislation goes toward tax cuts, it also includes resources for border security and defense. Among the bill's provisions is $46.5 billion for the border wall, $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol agents and other personnel and more than $2 billion for signing and retention bonuses for Border Patrol agents. It also includes an additional $1,000 fee for people who are filing for asylum in the U.S.",
      "The amendment to the legislation added an additional $12 billion for expenses related to border security.",
      "$1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for child savings",
      "The legislation also creates $1,000 savings accounts for children, which were originally titled \"MAGA accounts\" \u2014 Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement. The name has been updated to \"Trump accounts.\" Under the plan, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to the accounts of children born between 2024 and 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year. The funds, which can begin to be distributed once the child turns 18, can be used for higher education, job training and the purchase of their first home.",
      "While income on the accounts can grow on a tax-deferred basis, distributions for qualified expenses, like those mentioned above, would be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate. Another type of education savings vehicle, 529 accounts, enables parents to save and grow the accounts on a tax-deferred basis, too, but the money can be withdrawn for specific education-related expenses tax-free.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The package also raises the upper age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. The House bill would update the age requirement to 18-64 and would also shift more of the costs to states.",
      "Rolling back clean energy programs",
      "The bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, like an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. A late addition to the bill would move up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "The legislation also adds annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners: $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "With a major deadline to address the debt limit on the horizon, the legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. Congressional Republicans added the debt ceiling to the larger budget package to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue, since the budget legislation can move forward in the Senate without support from across the aisle.",

      "President Trump threatened to impose a fresh round of tariffs Friday morning, including a 25% tariff on Apple if they do not shift some of their iPhone production to the U.S.",
      "\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" he posted\u00a0Friday on his Truth Social social media platform. \"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "In a subsequent post, Mr. Trump also threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the European Union, calling the group of countries \"very difficult to deal with.\"",
      "\"Our discussions with them are going nowhere!\" the president said in his post on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\"",
      "\"There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States,\" he added.",
      "President Trump met with Apple CEO Tim Cook at the White House on Wednesday, according to a White House official. The official did not disclose what was discussed at the meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs in early April but later announced he would\u00a0exempt high-tech products, including Apple's iPhone, which is primarily manufactured in China. Still, tariffs are expected to hurt the company's earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a May 1 earnings call that the stepped up U.S. levies could cost the company $900 million in the current quarter.",
      "Apple shares fell 2.6% in early trading on Friday as broader financial markets also slid. The S&P 500 sank 60 points, or 1%, to 5,782, while the Dow Jones Industrial Complex and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.",
      "Apple did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.",
      "Apple invests in India",
      "Mr. Trump's threats come after Apple's supplier, contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, on Tuesday\u00a0announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations.",
      "Apple continues to make most iPhones in China, but shifting its focus to other places like India, which is subject to lower levies than China.",
      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",
      "Apple announced in February it would invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a move the tech giant described as its \"largest-ever spend commitment.\"",
      "\"This new pledge builds on Apple's long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing,\" Apple posted in its announcement.",
      "The move was\u00a0cheered by the Trump administration, which has touted\u00a0corporate investment in the U.S. following the rollout of the president' tariffs.",
      "As part of their investment, Apple said it would built a new 250,000-square-foot factory in Houston, Texas where they will produce servers, which have previously been built outside of the U.S. The company hasn't announced any plans to ramp up domestic iPhone production.",
      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",
      "\"We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\" he said.",
      "President Trump has promoted tariffs as a way to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing, secure more favorable trade deals with other countries and advance the White House's other policies, such as curbing unauthorized immigration and trafficking of illicit drugs.",
      "Many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that higher U.S. tariffs are likely to spur an upsurge in domestic manufacturing. That's because companies typically base the decision on where to locate factories more on factors including labor and energy costs, tax rates, political instability and the regulatory environment.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's signature budget legislation would punish 14 states that offer health coverage to people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "The states, most of them Democratic-led, provide insurance to some low-income immigrants \u2014 often children \u2014 regardless of their legal status. Advocates argue the policy is both humane and ultimately cost-saving.",
      "But the federal legislation, which Republicans have titled the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" would slash federal Medicaid reimbursements to those states by billions of dollars a year in total unless they roll back the benefits.",
      "The bill narrowly passed the House on Thursday and next moves to the Senate. While enacting much of Mr. Trump's domestic agenda, including big tax cuts largely benefiting wealthier Americans, the legislation also makes substantial spending cuts to Medicaid that congressional budget scorekeepers say will leave millions of low-income people without health insurance.",
      "The cuts, if approved by the Senate, would pose a tricky political and economic hurdle for the states and Washington, D.C., which use their own funds to provide health insurance to some people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "Those states would see their federal reimbursement for people covered under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion cut by 10 percentage points. The cuts would cost California, the state with the most to lose, as much as $3 billion a year, according to an analysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Together, the 15 affected places cover about 1.9 million immigrants without legal status, according to KFF. The penalty might also apply to other states that cover lawfully residing immigrants, KFF says.",
      "Two of the states \u2014 Utah and Illinois \u2014 have \"trigger\" laws that call for their Medicaid expansions to terminate if the feds reduce their funding match. That means unless those states either repeal their trigger laws or stop covering people without legal immigration status, many more low-income Americans could be left uninsured.",
      "The remaining states and Washington, D.C., would have to come up with millions or billions more dollars every year, starting in the 2027 fiscal year, to make up for reductions in their federal Medicaid reimbursements, if they keep covering people in the U.S. without authorization.",
      "Behind California, New York stands to lose the most federal funding \u2014 about $1.6 billion annually, according to KFF.",
      "California state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who chairs the Senate budget committee, said Mr. Trump's legislation has sown chaos as state legislators work to pass their own budget by June 15.",
      "\"We need to stand our ground,\" he said. \"California has made a decision that we want universal health care and that we are going to ensure that everyone has access to health care, and that we're not going to have millions of undocumented people getting their primary care in emergency rooms.\"",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that Mr. Trump's bill would devastate health care in his state.",
      "\"Millions will lose coverage, hospitals will close, and safety nets could collapse under the weight,\" Newsom said.",
      "In his May 14 budget proposal, Newsom called on lawmakers to cut some benefits for immigrants without legal status, citing ballooning costs in the state's Medicaid program. If Congress cuts Medicaid expansion funding, the state would be in no position to backfill, the governor said.",
      "Newsom questioned whether Congress has the authority to penalize states for how they spend their own money and said his state would consider challenging the move in court.",
      "Utah state Rep. Jim Dunnigan, a Republican who helped spearhead a bill to cover children in his state regardless of their immigration status, said Utah needs to maintain its Medicaid expansion that began in 2020.",
      "\"We cannot afford, monetary-wise or policy-wise, to see our federal expansion funding cut,\" he said. Dunnigan wouldn't say whether he thinks the state should end its immigrant coverage if the Republican penalty provision becomes law.",
      "Utah's program covers about 2,000 children, the maximum allowed under its law. Adult immigrants without legal status are not eligible. Utah's Medicaid expansion covers about 75,000 adults, who must be citizens or lawfully present immigrants.",
      "Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, a consumer advocacy organization, said the federal House bill leaves the state in a difficult position.",
      "\"There are no great alternatives, politically,\" he said. \"It's a prisoner's dilemma \u2014 a move in either direction does not make much sense.\"",
      "Slonaker said one likely scenario is that state lawmakers eliminate their trigger law then find a way to make up the loss of federal expansion funding.",
      "Utah has funded its share of the cost of Medicaid expansion with sales and hospital taxes.",
      "\"This is a very hard political decision that Congress would put the state of Utah in,\" Slonaker said.",
      "In Illinois, the GOP penalty would have even larger consequences. That's because it could lead to 770,000 adults' losing the health coverage they gained under the state's Medicaid expansion.",
      "Stephanie Altman, director of health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law, a Chicago-based advocacy group, said it's possible her Democratic-led state would end its trigger law before allowing its Medicaid expansion to terminate. She said the state might also sidestep the penalty by asking counties to fund coverage for immigrants. \"It would be a hard situation, obviously,\" she said.",
      "Altman said the House bill appeared written to penalize Democratic-controlled states because they more commonly provide immigrants coverage without regard for their legal status.",
      "She said the provision shows Republicans' \"hostility against immigrants\" and that \"they do not want them coming here and receiving public coverage.\"",
      "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said this month that state programs that provide public coverage to people regardless of immigration status serve as \"an open doormat,\" inviting more people to cross the border without authorization. He said efforts to end such programs have support in public polling.",
      "A Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted May 16-18 found that 47% of Americans approve of Mr. Trump's immigration policies and 45% disapprove. The poll found that Mr. Trump's overall approval rating has sunk 5 percentage points since he returned to office in January, to 42%, with 52% of Americans disapproving of his performance.",
      "The Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, enabled states to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or $21,597 for an individual this year. Forty states and Washington, D.C., expanded, contributing to the national uninsured rate dropping to historic lows.",
      "The federal government now pays 90% of the costs for people added to Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion.",
      "In states that cover health care for immigrants in the U.S. without authorization, the Republican bill would reduce the federal government's contribution from 90% to 80% of the cost of coverage for anyone added to Medicaid under the ACA expansion.",
      "By law, federal Medicaid funds cannot be used to cover people who are in the country without authorization, except for pregnancy and emergency services.",
      "The other states that use their own money to cover people regardless of immigration status are Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, according to KFF.",
      "Ryan Long, director of congressional relations at Paragon Health Institute, an influential conservative policy group, said that even if they use their own money for immigrant coverage, states still depend on federal funds to \"support systems that facilitate enrollment of illegal aliens.\"",
      "Long said the concern that states with trigger laws could see their Medicaid expansion end is a \"red herring\" because states have the option to remove their triggers, as Michigan did in 2023.",
      "The penalty for covering people in the country without authorization is one of several ways the House bill cuts federal Medicaid spending.",
      "The legislation would shift more Medicaid costs to states by requiring them to verify whether adults covered by the program are working. States would also have to recertify Medicaid expansion enrollees' eligibility every six months, rather than once a year or less, as most states currently do.",
      "The bill would also freeze states' practice of taxing hospitals, nursing homes, managed-care plans, and other health care companies to fund their share of Medicaid costs.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office said in a May 11 preliminary estimate that, under the House-passed bill, about 8.6 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034. That number will rise to nearly 14 million, the CBO estimates, after the Trump administration finishes new ACA regulations and if the Republican-led Congress, as expected, declines to extend enhanced premium subsidies for commercial insurance plans sold through Obamacare marketplaces.",

    "story": [
      "In a TikTok video, then-17-year-old actor Symonne Harrison unveils a bathroom counter full of products from the skincare brand Drunk Elephant that would retail for at least $700 total.",
      "\"Guys, I just got the biggest package from them,\" Harrison tells her 3.8 million followers, adding that she's new to the brand's \"family.\" \"I know Drunk Elephant is known for mixing, doing little potion vibes.\"",
      "Those \"potions\" are so-called \"skincare smoothies,\" popular on social media and marketed by the brand, which suggests trios of products to mix together as part of a skincare regimen. They've become a blueprint for some of Generation Alpha's favorite \"get ready with me\" videos as skincare products and adult influencers who promote them have become increasingly trendy among tweens.",
      "But like in Harrison's video \u2014 which features an eye cream containing vitamin C that Drunk Elephant recommends those 12 and under avoid \u2014 many of those social media posts advertise products not suitable for such young skin. (Harrison did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.)",
      "CBS News Confirmed analyzed more than a dozen popular TikTok accounts featuring skincare-obsessed teens and tweens and found that many featured products with anti-aging ingredients that, according to dermatologists, can be harmful to young skin. Often, those were promotions done in partnership with brands.",
      "Nielsen data show that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion in 2023 on skincare and makeup \u2014 more than households with teens.",
      "Dr. Smita Awasthi, director of pediatric dermatology at U.C. Davis Health, said certain skincare products are meant to peel the skin, but removing the outer layer of a child's skin can lead to painful rashes and increased risk of sunburns. While she does prescribe retinoids for acne treatment to children in some rare cases, she stresses there is a stark difference between over-the-counter retinoid acne treatments and the retinol used in cosmetics.",
      "\"When I'm prescribing a retinoid, I know the concentration, and I know exactly what it is and how it's going to work,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Cosmetic retinol products include different ingredients which she said can lead to increased risk of irritation and adverse reactions in young skin.",
      "Packaging for over-the-counter acne retinoids clearly identify that it is an acne treatment, she said. But many popular skincare products that contain retinols and other harsh anti-aging ingredients don't clearly identify what they are intended for or that the ingredients can be harmful to young skin.",
      "Kierstyn McBrayer, a 22-year-old content creator who focuses on makeup and skincare, told CBS News her audience is mostly tweens. Her 16-year-old sister first got into skincare about three years ago, she said, and was using products with retinol and vitamin C until she realized they weren't good for her skin. Other viewers have told her they were doing the same until they learned what was harming their skin.",
      "\"A lot of the problem is just kids watching adults doing skincare content, and I know a lot of these adults are probably not purposely aiming their content at children, but it's kind of hard because it's like [in the] past few years, skincare content has been considered heavily by children,\" she said.",
      "In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would make it illegal to sell certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18 years old. The bill was defeated last year and reintroduced in the current legislative session.",
      "But while the proposed law would target retailers, brands could continue to use social media and kid-friendly branding and packaging to market their products to children.",
      "A CBS News review of 240 recent skincare posts from a dozen popular teen influencers on TikTok showed only 15 videos, or just 6% of posts, were tagged as promotional content.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission requires that online influencers disclose when they have a \"material connection\" to a brand, including being paid or receiving free products. The agency's website specifies the disclosure should not be mixed in with a group of hashtags or links.",
      "TikTok instructs creators to turn on the \"content disclosure setting\" when promoting a brand or product; this would add a label to the video that clearly states the footage is \"promotional content\" or a \"paid partnership.\" If the setting is not enabled, TikTok could remove or restrict the video.",
      "Embreigh Courtlyn, 15, often posts \"get ready with me\" TikToks \u2014 chatty, casual videos showing people doing skincare or makeup or getting dressed. In one video, she holds up two face masks from the Korean skincare brand I Dew Care, saying, \"It's my favorite face mask ever.\" At the bottom of the video is a small label that reads \"paid partnership.\"",
      "Courtlyn's manager told CBS News, \"For any brand deal she accepts, she either enables the paid partnership tab or includes #[brand]partner in the caption to ensure compliance with FTC guidelines.\"",
      "Sometimes TikTokers signal promos to their audience in less obvious ways, such as putting #ad or #partner in the caption.",
      "Mar Taylor, a 17-year-old with more than 270,000 TikTok followers, said the skincare brands he's worked with have instructed him on how to stylize and label the footage. Taylor used the hashtag \"glowpartner\" in a TikTok advertising Glow Recipe's new toner. Taylor also said brands can give influencers a custom discount code to share with their audience, and the influencers receive a cut of the money when people use the code.",
      "McBrayer said sometimes brands will ask her not to label her collaboration videos with #ad. Instead, they ask to be referred to as \"partners.\"",
      "She said this may be because videos with #ad don't perform as well, something she has noticed in her own TikTok content.",
      "This means that whether content creators intend to or not, they're advertising products to children who may not realize they're being marketed to.",
      "\"We know that developmentally, they don't recognize ads at the same level that adults do,\" said Drew Cingel, an associate professor at U.C. Davis who studies the intersection of adolescents, psychology and social media marketing. \"And it becomes much more blurred in a social media environment.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many tweens that I've spoken to that say, when I grow up, I want to be an influencer,\" he added. \"If they see a teenage influencer getting these products, getting likes and getting all of the social gratification and money, that's what they're going to want to do.\"",
      "As the skincare trend among tweens has grown, some brands launched counter-marketing campaigns to tell kids they don't need elaborate skincare routines. Dove launched a campaign called \"Face of 10\" where dermatologists post videos aiming to inform kids about appropriate skincare. On Instagram, Kiehl's posted an image of a young boy in the sand labeled \"the only exfoliating kids should do,\" and a young girl in a ballet class labeled \"the only 10-step routine kids should learn.\"",
      "At the same time, many skincare brands feature kid-friendly packaging and marketing. While Drunk Elephant advertises \"skincare smoothies,\" Glow Recipe sells a $76 \"glow essentials kit\" in a box made to look like a pink locker and labeled \"back to school.\" The set contains a watermelon toner and strawberry primer with beta hydroxy acid and a lip balm with hyaluronic acid, all ingredients dermatologists say tweens should avoid.",
      "Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "\"How do you get a child's attention amid all these other products in a store?\" Cingel said. \"You put fruits, you put things that are cute on it, you put bright colors, we know that those things draw and hold children's attention.\"",

      "Cheaper gas this time of year is unusual given that fuel prices typically rise during the spring and summer as demand increases. Federal regulations requiring that refineries shift to summer-grade blends that are less likely to evaporate also tend to boost fuel costs, according to the Energy Information Administration.",

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 16:50:51 -0400",
    "summary": "House Republican's budget bill would create $1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for babies born between January 2025 and January 2029.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration wants to kickstart wealth creation for American children by creating $1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for babies born during President Trump's second term in office.",
      "Originally called \"money account for growth and advancement,\" or \"MAGA\" savings accounts, the renamed accounts would be managed by banks or investment firms, and operate like traditional investment accounts.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposed \"Trump accounts\" for newborns.",
      "What are they called?",
      "House Republicans on Wednesday submitted an amendment to Mr. Trump's domestic policy bill to ditch the original \"Maga\" acronym and rename the accounts \"Trump accounts,\" after the president himself.",
      "Who would get one?",
      "Every child born in the U.S. between Jan. 1, 2025 and Jan. 1, 2029 with a Social Security number, and whose parents have Social Security numbers, would be automatically enrolled in the program. The U.S. Treasury would set up and fund the accounts.",
      "Madeline Brown, senior policy associate at the Urban Institute, said automatic enrollment is a key component of the proposed pilot program, given some adults' unfamiliarity with such investment vehicles. Some of the lowest-income families, who could most benefit from the boost, \"often don't know about these kinds of programs. There's a huge awareness gap,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Automatic enrollment is fundamental to improving the likelihood that it reaches the lowest-income families,\" she added.",
      "What would be in a \"Trump account\"?",
      "The government would contribute $1,000 to every eligible child's account, which would be invested in the stock market on their behalf. Families and third parties could also contribute up to $5,000 a year to a child's account.",
      "Sam Taube, investment expert at personal finance site Nerdwallet, said the proposed \"Trump accounts\" are similar to programs currently offered by a number of states, but the contributions aren't as generous. For instance Colorado's First Step program awards every newborn $100 in a 529 college savings account, plus a match of $500 a year for the first five years of savings, totaling up to $2,500 in gift contributions.",
      "What could the money be spent on?",
      "Accountholders would only be approved to be spend investment funds on prescribed costs, such as a down payment on a home, education-related expenses, or starting a small business. Use of the funds to pay for unapproved expenses would subject accountholders to penalties.",
      "But broadening the scope of approved expenditures would be even more beneficial to many families, Brown noted.",
      "\"When it comes to wealth building, we have to make sure the target sums that kids end up with at 18 are in line with the things we're saying you can use the money for,\" Brown explained.",
      "If lower-income accountholders' families can't contribute the additional $5,000 per year, the sum they would end up with as adults might not cover a down payment, for example.",
      "\"There are lots of different projections around what $1,000 can grow to with different interest rates, but it's not a down payment,\" she said. \"So unless additional contributions come from the community, the federal government or state governments, we're not likely to see these accounts grow to the sums that we're saying are qualified uses.",
      "When could the funds be withdrawn?",
      "Half of the funds could be withdrawn when a child turns 18, at which point the account's gains would be taxed at the long-term capital gains tax rate, so long as the money were spent as directed. If the funds were used for other purposes, withdrawals would be taxed as income. A 10% penalty for misspending the money could also apply. Accountholders would have access to their full balances between the ages of 25-30 for approved purposes, and after 30, would be able to withdraw the funds for any purpose.",
      "Brown said she thinks improvements could be made to the way the program is structured, particularly around how account withdrawals are taxed. She noted that the lowest-income families would be the most likely to spend the funds on unapproved expenses, and face tax penalties.",
      "Most Americans can't afford a $1,000 emergency expense, according to a January report from Bankrate, making low-earners more likely to need to tap into the funds for surprise costs.",
      "\"They are the most likely to have to withdraw dollars for nonqualified expenses, and in doing so, they [would] receive a tax penalty. So there are ways to exempt emergency expenses, and that would be a fix,\" Brown said.",
      "Otherwise, she said, the upsides to the accounts are limited. \"There are other places you can save money where you won't have that tax penalty if you withdraw the funds early,\" Brown said.",
      "Taube of Nerdwallet noted that the proposed accounts' tax benefits are also questionable.",
      "\"Although they are advertised as tax-advantaged accounts, the way they work does not seem to be that different from how a taxable brokerage account would work,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That said, \"given the state of saving for children's future expenses in this country, the accounts do seem like they could help at least somewhat,\" Taube said.",

    "story": [
      "When President Trump's new tariffs started throttling freight traffic, the leader of trucking logistics firm Freight Technologies used an unorthodox method to try and get the president's attention.",
      "The California-based firm purchased $2 million worth of Trump Coin, the signature cryptocurrency backed by Mr. Trump. The president and his family launched Trump Coin days before he took office in January. Anyone can buy the cryptocurrency. An analytics firm says Mr. Trump's family and other backers have collected more than $300 million in transaction fees so far.",
      "Donald Quinby, Freight Technologies' chief financial officer, told CBS News that the purchase seemed like \"really the best platform for us to make a splash, to make some noise.\"",
      "\"With the Trump meme token, this was just an opportunity to really advocate for free and fair trade,\" Quinby said. \"I'm sure he likes to follow who's purchasing his coins.\"",
      "In April, the Trump family announced an \"intimate private dinner\" with the president at Mr. Trump's golf course in Virginia to reward the biggest buyers of Trump Coin, or $TRUMP. A leaderboard was created so buyers could compete with one another. Buyers eventually spent $140 million trying to secure access to the event, according to data analytics firm Inca Digital.",
      "Some of the 220 leading buyers of $TRUMP received tickets to attend the dinner. Mr. Trump will also host a smaller reception for the token's top 25 holders. The guests are beneficiaries of a new opportunity to gain access and potential influence in a city with a long history of blending money and politics, experts said.",
      "\"This is really unprecedented,\" said Jessica Tillipman, a George Washington University law professor. \"This appears to be a president that could be potentially benefiting privately from something that he's doing out in the open.\"",
      "The White House pushed back hard on the notion that the gala dinner or the president's role in promoting the cryptocurrency crossed any ethical lines. Administration officials said they had not approved an initial plan suggesting top buyers of the meme coin product would receive a White House tour.",
      "\"This is a personal dinner that the president is attending on his personal time,\" a White House official told CBS News in a statement. \"The White House has absolutely nothing to do with it.\"",
      "Trump rewards cryptocurrency buyers",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is largely driven by social media buzz. They are not usually used in transactions, and are known for erratic price shifts. $TRUMP peaked at around $75 shortly after launch and plummeted to under $8 by April 2025, but soared in value after the dinner with Mr. Trump was announced.",
      "Among the attendees of Thursday's dinner is Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire and the largest holder of Trump Coin. Sun has a net worth of $8.5 billion, according to Forbes, and is best known for creating the Tron blockchain. He was also the buyer who paid $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall by artist Maurizio Cattelan. Sun promptly ate the fruit.",
      "Sun was sued for fraud by the Biden administration for allegedly \"fraudulently manipulating the secondary market\" and paying celebrities to promote a crypto token his company created \"without disclosing their compensation.\" Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission paused the lawsuit as part of a broader Trump administration shift toward easing crypto enforcement.",
      "Sun also said his firm has invested tens of millions in the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial. But the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency allows Sun, and other foreign buyers like him, to court access to power with little transparency.",
      "\"It's almost like the perfect kind of opaque structure for any type of foreign government or, you know, non-U.S. citizens who wanted to try to seek favor, curry favor with this particular administration,\" Tillipman\u00a0said.",
      "Experts raise concerns about conflicts of interest",
      "Tillipman compared the Trump family's foray into cryptocurrency to Hunter Biden's art sales during his father's administration.",
      "\"The argument was that [purchasers of Hunter Biden's artwork] could use it to influence\" then-President Joe Biden, she said.",
      "Like cryptocurrency, \"a lot of these types of transactions are by nature opaque because you don't know who's purchasing it. You don't know who the buyer is,\" Tillipman said. She noted that in effect, the Biden administration tried to distance the president from the transactions by saying information about the buyers and transactions would be kept secret by the gallery owner.",
      "Nonetheless, she said \"there were a lot of legitimate concerns associated with that particular dealing, as there was fear that it could be a back door to President Biden\" through a family member.",
      "\"The difference here is just the order of magnitude and the involvement of the president himself,\" Tillipman said. Hunter Biden's art netted him about $1.5 million by the end of his father's presidency, compared to the potentially far more lucrative Trump family crypto business.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously vowed on social media to \"make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" He and his eldest sons are also backing the\u00a0crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, and cryptocurrency makes up about $2.9 billion of Mr. Trump's net worth, according to a\u00a0recent report.",
      "On Monday, the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, which would regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is linked to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. They tend to have fewer price fluctuations than meme coins, but allow for the same opacity in transactions. Some Democrats pushed back against the bill, citing Mr. Trump's crypto holdings and calling for anti-corruption rules.",
      "\"This is corruption out in the open,\" said Massachusetts Sen.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salt-deduction-cap-trump-big-beautiful-bill-tax-40000-cbs-news-explains/",
    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 15:03:01 -0400",
    "summary": "The budget bill passed by the House includes a provision to quadruple the state and local tax deduction, a boon for some homeowners.",
    "story": [
      "Some U.S. homeowners may soon get a sizable tax break thanks to the massive budget package that was passed by the House early Thursday.",
      "The legislation \u2014 dubbed the \u00a0One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 includes a provision that would lift the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes, or SALT, to $40,000 from its current $10,000 limit. That could provide tax savings for homeowners with high property taxes or who earn enough to have significant state income tax liabilities.",
      "The SALT deduction cap was introduced by Mr. Trump in his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a way to offset that legislation's tax breaks, such as its reduction in individual income tax rates. Prior to that law, there was no limit on how much in state and local taxes taxpayers could deduct from their federal income taxes.",
      "The unlimited SALT deduction had been criticized by some policy experts as mainly benefiting upper-income\u00a0homeowners\u00a0in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But with real estate values surging in recent years, more homeowners around the U.S. are now getting socked with higher property taxes and bumping against the SALT deduction limit, prompting some lawmakers to call for changes to the $10,000 cap.",
      "The SALT deduction limit \"really eliminated a fairly significant deduction for most taxpayers in Massachusetts, especially given how high property taxes can be here,\" Boston tax attorney Dan Ryan told CBS News Boston.",
      "The backers of the new bill \"needed to keep Republicans in New York, New Jersey and California happy,\" which led to the negotiation for a higher SALT limit, he added.",
      "To be sure, the tax and spending bill could undergo more changes before it reaches President Trump's desk. The measure must now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already expressed opposition to certain aspects of the bill, such as Medicaid spending cuts.",
      "What is the SALT deduction cap?",
      "The SALT deduction cap was introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, and capped the deduction at $10,000 for both single and married couples. The provision covers state income taxes, property taxes and sales taxes.",
      "In 2017, the Treasury Department estimated that almost 11 million taxpayers in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey would forfeit\u00a0$323 billion in deductions\u00a0because of the new cap.",
      "Some lawmakers criticized the deduction limit for its marriage penalty, given that married couples are subject to the same SALT deduction threshold as single filers. Typically, tax provisions are more generous for married couples because they are designed to cover two individuals. For instance, the standard deduction for married couples is $30,000 in 2025, double the $15,000 standard deduction for single filers.",
      "What's changing with the SALT deduction cap?",
      "The House tax bill lifts the SALT deduction cap to $40,000, with the new threshold scheduled to take effect for the current 2025 tax year. An earlier version of the bill had proposed a $30,000 deduction limit, but some lawmakers pushed for a higher threshold to help more homeowners.",
      "The change was hailed by Republicans from high-tax congressional districts. Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said in a social media post that the increased SALT limit would ease \"the tax burden for middle-class and working families.\"",
      "\"This includes annual increases for inflation and income caps to ensure this is not a handout for the uber wealthy,\" Lawler added.",
      "The full $40,000 deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000. Those who earn above that amount would face a phaseout, although the deduction wouldn't go lower than $10,000. Both the cap and the income limit would increase 1% per year over the next decade, according to a May 22 analysis from law firm Kutak Rock.",
      "Who could benefit from the higher SALT cap?",
      "People whose deductible expenses \u2014 including property taxes, state income taxes and mortgage interest \u2014 exceed their standard deduction could benefit from the higher SALT cap.",
      "For instance, a married couple would need those costs to surpass their 2025 standard deduction of $30,000 to take advantage of the higher SALT cap. That's because taxpayers typically claim whatever is higher \u2014 the standard deduction or their total itemized deductions \u2014 to maximize the amount they can tap to lower their federal tax liability.",
      "\"It will benefit homeowners, especially people who live in wealthier towns with higher property taxes, and higher income taxpayers,\" Ryan, the tax attorney, told CBS News Boston.",
      "High-income homeowners would be the most likely to qualify for the new deduction, with more than half of the benefit going to taxpayers making at least $400,000, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "How much would raising the SALT cap cost the U.S.?",
      "If adopted, lifting the SALT cap would result in the federal government forgoing more tax revenue, policy experts say.",
      "The $40,000 limit would result in a loss of nearly $334 billion in tax revenue over the next decade, when compared with keeping the $10,000 cap in place, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania nonpartisan group that analyzes the fiscal impact of policy.",
      "That adds to the cost of a bill that has been criticized by some experts\u00a0and lawmakers as introducing new tax breaks that could outstrip any savings in the legislation and trillions to the U.S. debt.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model \"has projected that America will face certain risk of a fiscal crisis within the next two decades, eroding household purchasing power, unless action is taken to reduce federal deficits,\" Kent Smetters, head of the group, said in a email after the House passed the budget package.",

    "story": [
      "Republican-backed legislation approved Thursday morning by House lawmakers includes a number of\u00a0tax breaks promised by President Trump during the campaign, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay. One tax break that isn't in the bill: Mr. Trump's\u00a0suggestion\u00a0last year that seniors shouldn't have to pay income taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security and they won't,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0while during an August campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",
      "A provision to eliminate taxes on Social Security isn't included in President Trump's domestic policy bill that passed early Thursday following a dramatic all-night session.",
      "The bill will now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already voiced some opposition. The proposed legislation, which spans more than 1,000 pages and includes a 42-page amendment with last-minute changes, would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other temporary reductions.",
      "The reason for the Social Security exclusion boils down to a prohibition on making changes to the retirement program through the so-called reconciliation process, a legislative procedure Republicans are relying on to pass the bill, said Maria Freese, the senior legislative representative at the The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. That process represents a fast-track option that obviates the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance a bill in the Senate, she said.",
      "Trying to change the Social Security program through reconciliation would have violated what is known as the\u00a0Byrd rule, a rule (named after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what can be included in reconciliation bills, she explained.",
      "\"Enhanced deduction for seniors\"",
      "Instead of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, the House bill includes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older.",
      "Called an \"enhanced deduction for seniors,\" it would be available to people who both itemize and those who take the standard deduction. That could help lower taxes for the roughly 56 million people in the U.S. who are 65 or older.",
      "But the new deduction for seniors is a limited-time break: It would be effective starting in the current 2025 tax year, but expire starting in the 2029 tax year, according to the legislation.",
      "The tax break also has an income threshold, with the full $4,000 deduction available to single filers who earn $75,000 or less and for married couples with annual incomes below $150,000. The deduction would be phased out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Currently, about 40% of Social Security recipients \u2014 or about 27 million people \u2014 pay federal income taxes on their benefits, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"I'm sure there are a lot of seniors who would be quite disappointed they will continue to pay taxes\" on their benefits, Freese said.",
      "Social Security's fiscal outlook",
      "Social Security benefits were excluded from income taxes until 1984, when changes signed into law by President Ronald Reagan introduced taxes on Social Security income above a certain threshold.",
      "Because that threshold wasn't indexed to inflation, the number of older Americans who are required to pay income taxes on their benefits has steadily risen. The share of seniors who pay taxes on their benefits is now 40%, up from was 26% in 1998,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Those taxes directly support the Social Security and Medicare programs, providing about $50 billion in annual revenue,\u00a0according to the latest\u00a0annual report\u00a0from Social Security's board of trustees.",
      "Meanwhile, eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would hurt the long-term outlook of both the retirement program and of Medicare, the health insurance program for people 65 and older, according the Peter G. Peterson Institute, a think tank focusing on fiscal policy.",
      "Without that source of revenue, the trust fund for Social Security would be depleted in 2032, one year earlier than currently projected, while Medicare's trust fund would be depleted in 2030, six years earlier than forecast now, the group added.",
      "The result would be \"automatic cuts for millions of beneficiaries,\" the institute noted.",
      "Scrapping taxes on Social Security might sound appealing to many senior citizens in the near-term, but over the long term that would weaken the stability of the program, Freese said.",
      "\"We viewed it as a bait and switch,\" she said. \"You give some seniors a benefit upfront, but don't tell them that all seniors would run the risk of across-the-board cuts sooner than they would under current law.\"",

      "\"We looked at what was lucrative and accessible to people who are coming back from incarceration,\" Logan said. \"We don't have enough people who are skilled, and it's a very skilled profession...It gave [the formerly incarcerated] a really big opportunity to be part of the communities that they knew they did harm to.\"",
      "While the program may raise eyebrows for some New Yorkers who are skeptical of how their taxpayer dollars are being spent, Logan pointed to the impact of giving formerly incarcerated people a second chance to help drive the economy in their communities.",
      "\"If I have you incarcerated on Rikers, I have to pay for [the] facility, the officers, the food,\" she said. \"Whereas, when I take a person and give them opportunity, they pay taxes. So now, we as a society are getting taxpayer revenue from a person that is not in a box on a shelf.\"",
      "Emerge Career co-founder Uzoma \"Zo\" Orchingwa said the program is rooted in the belief that people coming out of prison are often undervalued and underestimated.",
      "\"Our people are just looking for someone that believes in them and someone that can give them a legit chance,\" Orchingwa told CBS News. \"These are people that \u2014 for the most part \u2014 have not had a fair shot for being able to be successful and contributing citizens. They just need that one opportunity that's going to support them.\"",
      "In the 2024 fiscal year, 94% of participants in the training program graduated, according to data provided by Emerge Career. All of those graduates received job offers with an average starting salary of $75,000 per year, the company said.",
      "Since the trucking program launched, 260 formerly incarcerated people have completed it.",
      "Orchingwa emphasized that the training program provides its participants with more than just a paycheck, but a sense of purpose.",

    "summary": "Federal judge strikes down government regulations requiring most U.S. employers to accommodate workers for abortions.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday struck down regulations requiring most U.S. employers to provide workers with time off and other accommodations for abortions.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Judge David Joseph of the Western District of Louisiana was a victory for conservative lawmakers and religious groups who decried the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's decision to include abortion among pregnancy-related conditions in regulations on how to implement the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which passed in December 2022.",
      "The EEOC's decision swiftly prompted several lawsuits and eroded what had been strong bipartisan support for the law designed to strengthen the rights of pregnant workers.",
      "Joseph, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, ruled that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion in its regulations. His ruling came in two consolidated lawsuits brought by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Mississippi, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic University and two Catholic dioceses.",
      "Joseph sided with the plaintiffs' argument that if Congress had intended for abortion to be covered by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, \"It would have spoken clearly when enacting the statute, particularly given the enormous social, religious, and political importance of the abortion issue in our nation at this time.\"",
      "Mississippi and Louisiana have near-total bans on abortion, except to save the life of the pregnant person or in cases of a rape that has been reported to law enforcement in Mississippi, and when there is a substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient in continuing the pregnancy and in cases where the fetus has a fatal abnormality in Louisiana.",
      "Bipartisan support for pregnant workers law",
      "The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act passed with widespread bipartisan support after a decade-long campaign by women's right advocates, who hailed it as a win for low-wage pregnant workers who have routinely been denied accommodations for everything from time off for medical appointments to the ability to sit or stand on the job.",
      "The federal law applies to employers with 15 or more employees.",
      "While the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 prohibits employers from firing pregnant workers, the law did little to guarantee that women would receive accommodations they might need at work. As a result, many women were forced to keep working under unsafe conditions, or were forced to take unpaid leave by employers who refused to accommodate their needs.",
      "But many Republican lawmakers, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who co-sponsored the bill, were furious when the EEOC stated that the law covered abortions. The EEOC's commissioners approved the rules in a 3-2 vote along party lines, with both Republican commissioners voting against it.",
      "Joseph vacated the provision of the EEOC regulations that included abortion as a \"related medical condition\" of pregnancy and childbirth. However, the rest of the regulations still stand.",
      "\"Victory! A federal court has granted Louisiana's request to strike down an EEOC rule requiring employers to accommodate employees' purely elective abortions. This is a win for Louisiana and for life!\" Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement e-mailed to The Associated Press.",
      "A Better Balance, the advocacy group that spearheaded a decade-long campaign for passage of the law, condemned the ruling.",
      "\"This court's decision to deny workers reasonable accommodations for abortion-related needs is part of a broader attack on women's rights and reproductive freedom,\" A Better Balance President Inimai Chettiar said in a statement.",
      "EEOC adrift",
      "Wednesday's ruling comes as the Trump administration has moved to impose tumultuous changes at the EEOC that will almost certainly lead the agency to eventually rewrite the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act regulations.",
      "President Trump fired two of the EEOC's democratic commissioners before their terms ended, paving the way for him to establish a Republican majority and make major policy changes on how to interpret and enforce the nation's workplace civil rights laws.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump's move left EEOC without the quorum needed to make key decisions, including rescinding or revising regulations. The president tapped an assistant U.S. attorney in Florida, Brittany Panuccio, to fill one of the vacancies. If she confirmed by the Senate, the EEOC will regain its quorum.",
      "Acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas, who voted against the regulations because of the abortion provision, has said she will work to change them.",
      "Similar lawsuits challenging the abortion provision are underway, including one filed by 17 states, led by Tennessee and Arkansas. In February, an appeals court ruled that lawsuit could proceed, overturning a lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the Justice Department had defended the EEOC against those lawsuits but it is unclear whether it will continue to do so under the Trump administration. The Justice Department did not reply to request for comment on Wednesday's ruling.",
      "Chettiar said the Trump administration is unlikely to appeal the ruling, adding to its significance.",
      "\"The impact of this is huge,\" Chettiar said in an interview with The Associated Press, calling the decision \"symbolic and a big signal of where the right is when it comes to the rights of women.\"",
      "However, the Trump administration has continued defend the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act itself in a lawsuit brought by the state of Texas that seeks to overturn the law in its entirety.",

    "summary": "Google is making more upgrades to its search engine with the addition of the AI Mode feature.",
    "story": [
      "Google on Tuesday rolled out AI Mode, its latest artificial intelligence feature designed to provide users with more detailed and tailored responses to questions entered into the search engine.",
      "Unveiled Tuesday at the search giant's annual Google I/O developer conference, AI Mode comes a year after the company introduced AI Overviews, its first tool to use generative AI technology to enhance its search engine capabilities.",
      "Sundar Pichai, CEO of both Google and parent company,Alphabet,\u00a0said in remarks at the conference that AI Mode represents a \"total reimagining of Search\" and that it would gradually be rolled out to all Google users.",
      "\"What all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people all over the world,\" Pichai told the crowd yesterday at an amphitheater near the company's \u00a0headquarters in Mountain View, California, according to the Associated Press.",
      "A\u00a0video teasing the technology showcases how it works. In response to lengthy, detailed questions typed into Google search, AI Mode displays how many searches Google is performing and how many sites it's scanning as the technology quickly generates a summarized response at the top of the search platform. It also provides a side bar with links to relevant sites.",
      "Google said it's also testing a \"Search Live\" feature that will enable the search engine to respond to questions based on video content, as well as voice searches, or to questions verbalized by the user, rather than typed.",
      "As an example, Google's\u00a0teaser\u00a0shows a person recording a video of themselves holding a bridge made of Popsicle sticks while asking the search engine what can be done to strengthen the structure. \"To make it stronger, consider adding more triangles to the design,\" an automated voice responds.",
      "Google said it will begin feeding its latest AI model, Gemini 2.5, into its search engine starting next week. The company calls Gemini 2.5 its \"most intelligent model\" yet.",
      "Rapid advancements",
      "The California-based company began testing AI Mode in March of this year. Google's latest AI search tool builds on AI Overviews, which was introduced in the U.S. in May 2024 and has 1.5 billion users, according to an article on the\u00a0Google\u00a0website.",
      "Some argue that AI Overviews, which provides an AI-generated summary of information online, at times eliminating the need to click directly on source links for further information, has undercut traffic to their sites. According to a\u00a0study by Ahrefs, AI Overviews led to a 35% lower average click-through rates for top-ranking pages on search engine results pages.",
      "Concerns over accuracy",
      "\"By making AI Mode a core part of the experience, Google is betting it can cater to the demand for AI without alienating its massive base,\" Gadjo Sevilla, a senior analyst for research firm eMarketer, wrote in a blog\u00a0post. \"But there are risks for hallucinations and factual errors which could drive users towards competitors,\" he added.",
      "Such factual errors were spotted with AI Overviews soon after its release, prompting Google to admit in a statement at the time that the technology produced \"some odd and erroneous overviews.\" In one instance, AI Overviews suggested that users add glue to pizza or eat at least one small rock a day,\u00a0according\u00a0to the MIT Technology Review.",
      "As for AI Mode, Google has indicated that its new AI search tech is performing well and serving its intended purpose.",
      "\"We conduct quantitative research and collect in-product feedback to ask users whether they're satisfied with their results. And we've seen that introducing AI Overviews on Search leads to an increase in satisfaction and reported helpfulness,\" a Google spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "summary": "House Speaker Mike Johnson shepherded through Congress President Trump's spending bill, which includes Medicaid work requirements.",
    "story": [
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who shepherded President Trump's \"one big, beautiful bill\" through Congress, said Sunday that the Medicaid work requirements \u2014 which could affect his home state of Louisiana \u2014 have a \"moral component\" to them because people on Medicaid who \"refuse\" to work are \"defrauding the system.\"",
      "\"If you are able to work and you refuse to do so, you are defrauding the system,\" Johnson said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"You're cheating the system. And no one in the country believes that that's right. So there's a moral component to what we're doing. And when you make young men work, it's good for them, it's good for their dignity, it's good for their self-worth, and it's good for the community that they live in.\"",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed the massive bill, which sets priorities for Mr. Trump's agenda for upcoming budgets, by just one vote in the early hours Thursday after an all-night session. The bill is now headed to the Senate, where several Republicans have already voiced concerns, including Sens. Josh Hawley and Rand Paul.",
      "The bill went through intense debate in two committees last week as an alliance of blue-state Republicans and fiscal hawks refused to budge. Given Republicans' razor-thin majority in the House, Mr. Trump went to the Hill on Tuesday to rally the holdouts in the GOP conference.",
      "To pay for some of Mr. Trump's tax reforms, such as extending his 2017 tax cuts and eliminating tax on tips, there are cuts to several programs. Republicans have insisted they are not cutting Medicaid, and reductions in the low-income entitlement program have become one of the most charged parts of the bill. In a closed-door session Tuesday with members of the Republican conference, sources in the room told CBS News Mr. Trump said, \"Don't f*** around with Medicaid.\"",
      "To save money on Medicaid, the final version of the bill puts work requirements on Medicaid, which Johnson has insisted will account for the bulk of any cost-cutting. An analysis by the healthcare nonprofit KFF found that 190,000 people in Louisiana, Johnson's home state, stand to lose Medicaid under new requirements.",
      "Johnson insisted on Sunday that \"we have not cut Medicaid, and we have not cut SNAP,\" the food stamp program.",
      "\"What we're doing \u2026 is working on fraud, waste and abuse, and everyone in Louisiana and around the country understands that that's a responsibility of Congress,\" Johnson said.",
      "He said there are 4.8 million Americans on Medicaid who are \"able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system.\" Calling it a \"moral component\" to put Americans to work, he added, \"when you make young men work, it's good for them, it's good for their dignity, it's good for their self-worth, and it's good for the community that they live in.\"",
      "Johnson also claimed some of those who are on Medicaid and SNAP are undocumented immigrants, although they are not eligible to receive food stamps or Medicaid.",
      "When moderator Margaret Brennan pushed back for Johnson to clarify that his position is that the estimated 190,000 Louisianans who stand to lose Medicaid coverage are \"lazy, not working? That they were undocumented? What about them? How do you defend that they will be losing their benefits?\"",
      "\"No. What we're talking about, again, is able-bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system,\" Johnson said. \"And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all.\"",
      "Johnson said the Medicaid work requirements are \"not some onerous, burdensome thing,\" saying they require recipients to work a minimum of 20 hours a week \u2014 either working, be in job training programs or volunteering in the community.",
      "\"When the American people understand what we are doing here, they applaud it,\" Johnson said. \"This is a wildly popular thing, because we have to preserve the programs. What we're doing is strengthening Medicaid and SNAP so that they can exist, so that they'll be there for the people that desperately need it the most, and it's not being taken advantage of. And this is something that everybody in Congress, Republicans and Democrats, should agree to.\"",
      "But as the bill heads to the Senate for debate, the GOP's Hawley has called it \"both morally wrong and politically suicidal\" to slash Medicaid, indicating brewing opposition to it in that chamber.",
      "Hawley particularly took issue with a cost-sharing measure with Medicaid between federal and state governments, which he said would force those at or just over the federal poverty level to pay as much as $35 for a medical visit. Johnson pushed back on that claim, saying that the House included in the bill a \"modest state-sharing component, so that they'll pay attention to that, so that we can reduce fraud.\"",
      "But as Brennan noted, the bill still has to pass the Senate, and if Senators make the expected changes to the bill, it will have to go back to the House. Johnson said he had lunch with his Republican counterparts in the upper chamber on Tuesday, and he said he reminded them that they are a team.",
      "\"It's the Senate and the House Republicans together that will deliver this ball over the goal line, so to speak,\" Johnson said. \"And I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House.\"",

      "MAN: Hip, hip.",
      "GRADUATES: Hooray!",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as these new members of the world's most powerful military go forward, are we doing enough to support them? We will talk with some veterans serving in Congress about the value of public service and we will honor those who protected us.",
      "On Capitol Hill, the president's big, beautiful bill squeaks through the House. What kind of impact will some of those tax-and-spend provisions have on Americans? And can they survive the Senate?",
      "We will ask House Speaker Mike Johnson and talk with the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes.",
      "Some humanitarian aid is returning to Gaza after a monthslong Israeli blockade, but will it be in time and enough to help those in desperate need of food?",
      "Plus, a new plan for American assistance in the region. We will talk to Cindy McCain, head of the U.N.'s World Food Program.",
      "All that and more is just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We have a lot to get to in honor of our military today, but we begin with the passage of what President Trump is calling his big, beautiful bill, and the man who got it through the House, Speaker Mike Johnson, who joins us from Benton, Louisiana.",
      "Good morning to you, Mr. Speaker.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-Louisiana): Hey. Good morning. And I wish a blessed Memorial Day weekend to everybody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Indeed.",
      "Well, you got this massive tax and border bill through, just barely, one vote margin. You pulled an all-nighter.",
      "Among other things, it will eliminate taxes on tips and overtime, put about $50 billion towards the border wall and hiring Border Patrol agents, keep in place existing individual tax rates, create savings accounts for kids with a one-time deposit of $1,000, increase the child tax credit by about 500 bucks.",
      "The \u2013 the bill on this is estimated to be between $4 trillion and $5 trillion over the next decade. How much do you think this is all going to cost?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, that's about the right estimate.",
      "But, at the same time, we have historic savings for the American people, cuts to government to make it more efficient and effective and \u2013 and work better for the people. That was a big campaign promise of President Trump and a big promise of ours, and we're going to achieve that.",
      "So, in the calculation here, there's more than $1.5 trillion in savings, Margaret, for the people. And that's \u2013 that's the largest amount \u2013 biggest cut in government really in at least 30 years and, if you adjust for inflation, probably the largest in the history of government.",
      "So we're proud of what we produced here. We've checked all the boxes, where all the things that you mentioned in existence \u2013 in addition to American energy dominance, investing in our military industrial base, which is appropriate for us to talk about this weekend, and so many other priorities.",
      "And that's why we call it the one, big beautiful bill. I think, arguably, it's the most consequential legislation that Congress will pass in many generations, and it's a long time coming.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, just this morning, we did hear from some of your Republican colleagues over in the Senate, where this heads next, that they can't support the bill as it is written. I think you know this.",
      "Senator Rand Paul said the cuts are \"wimpy and anemic. The math doesn't add up. It will explode the debt.\"",
      "In addition to that political criticism, you've already seen\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Yes, look, Senator Paul and I are\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 Moody's credit rating agency downgrade American credit.",
      "And Goldman Sachs says that this bill will not offset the damage from the president's tariffs. Isn't this an economic gamble?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No, it's not an economic gamble.",
      "It's a big investment. And, look, this \u2013 what this bill is going to do is be jet fuel to the U.S. economy. It is going to foster a pro-growth economy. What do we mean by that? Because we're reducing taxes. We're reducing regulations. We're going to increase and incentivize American manufacturing again.",
      "And what will \u2013 the effect this will have in the economy is that entrepreneurs and risk-takers and job creators will have an easier time in doing that. They will allow for more jobs and more opportunity for more people, and wages will increase.",
      "Now, Margaret, this is not a theoretical exercise. We did this already in the first Trump administration. After just the first two years, we brought about the greatest economy in the history of the world, not just the U.S., because we did it, followed a very simple formula. We cut taxes and we cut regulations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You didn't do it in the middle of a tariff war.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: This time, we're doing that on steroids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the first administration, there was sequencing.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No. Well\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You got tax reform. The Republicans got tax reform through and held off the tariff war.",
      "Goldman Sachs says, the hit to growth from tariffs will more than offset the boost to growth from the fiscal package. That's Goldman Sachs.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well \u2013 well, I know. I respect Goldman Sachs, but I think what they're discounting here is the growth that will be spurred on by this legislation and the fact that the so-called tariff war is beginning to subside already.",
      "You've got over 75 countries that are negotiating new, more fair trade agreements for the U.S. right now because of the president's insistence that that be done. And it was decades overdue. That is going to benefit every American. It's going to benefit the consumers.",
      "You know, they howled when the first tariffs \u2013 reciprocal tariffs policy was announced. And they said that prices would skyrocket. That simply hasn't happened. Many of those early estimates were far off, and that's being proven now.",
      "So what I think will happen is the tariffs, you know, contest will subside. This legislation will pass and get the economy going again. And people will feel that. They'll see it in their own pocketbooks, in their own opportunity. And every American household is going to benefit by these policies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know Walmart has already said that it will have to raise prices. It's not theoretical. And the president on Friday was talking about even more tariffs, this time on Apple and others.",
      "But back \u2013 back to your end of the \u2013 of the deal here, for this tax relief, you talked about the cuts to pay for it all. You are eliminating subsidized federal student loans, so the government will no longer cover the interest on debt while borrowers are in school. You're eliminating $500 billion in clean energy subsidies and you're terminating early tax breaks for electric vehicles.",
      "Alongside that, you're carrying out about a trillion in reductions to Medicaid and food stamps. We looked at your home state, and the projection is that nearly 200,000 Louisianians will lose their Medicaid coverage because of this. How do you defend that to your constituents?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: We have not cut Medicaid, and we have not cut SNAP.",
      "What we're doing, Margaret, is working on fraud, waste and abuse. And everyone in Louisiana and around the country understands that that's a responsibility of Congress. Just in \u2013 in Medicaid, for example, you've got 1.4 million illegal aliens receiving those benefits. That is not what Medicaid is intended for.",
      "It's intended for vulnerable populations, for young, single, pregnant women and the elderly and the disabled and people who desperately need those resources. Right now, they're being drained by fraud, waste and abuse.",
      "You've got about 4.8 million people on Medicaid right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system. If you are able to work and you refuse to do so, you are defrauding the system. You're cheating the system.",
      "And no one in the country believes that that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: So there's a \u2013 there's a moral component to what we're doing.",
      "And when you make young men work, it's good for them, it's good for their dignity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: It's good for their self-worth, and it's good for the community that they live in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure, but in \u2013 first of all, just undocumented immigrants, you know, are not eligible for food stamps or Medicaid. Some\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: And yet they're receiving them. That's the problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 lawfully present immigrants are.",
      "So the 190,000 Louisianians that are projected by KFF as losing their Medicaid, your position is, they were just lazy, not working, that they were undocumented? What \u2013 what about them? How do you defend that they will be losing their benefits?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No, what we're talking about, again, is able- bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system.",
      "And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all. By the way, the work requirements, Margaret, is not some onerous, burdensome thing. It's a minimum of 20 hours a week. You could either be working or be in a job program, a job training program\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: \u2026 or \u2013 or volunteering in your community. This is not some \u2013 some onerous thing. This is common sense.",
      "And when the American people understand what we are doing here, they applaud it. This is a wildly popular thing, because we have to preserve the programs. What we're doing is strengthening Medicaid and SNAP so that they can exist, so that they'll be there for the people that desperately need it the most, and it's not being taken advantage of.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: And this is something that everybody in Congress, Republicans and Democrats, should agree to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of your Republican colleagues over in the Senate has been very vocal about his concern in regard to what you're doing to Medicaid.",
      "Josh Hawley has been arguing: \"It is morally wrong and politically suicidal to slash health insurance for the working poor.\" He said the cost-sharing language will force people at or just over the federal poverty level to pay as much as $35 for a medical visit, which means working people will pay more.",
      "How do you defend that? Because you know, in the Senate, they are going to make changes to this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: My friend Josh Hawley is a fiscal conservative, as I am. We don't want to slash benefits.",
      "And, again, I make this very clear. We are not cutting Medicaid. We are not cutting SNAP. We're working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP, for example, listen to the statistics. In 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were \u2013 were erroneous. I mean, that's \u2013 that's a number that everyone acknowledges is real.",
      "It may be much higher than that. But here's the problem. The states\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Louisiana is like the second largest recipient of food stamps in the country, sir. So\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Let me explain it, Margaret. Let me explain it.",
      "The states \u2013 the states are not properly administering this, because they don't have enough skin in the game. So what we've done in the bill is add some \u2013 just a modest state sharing component, so that they'll pay attention to that, so that we can reduce fraud.",
      "Why? Again, so that it is preserved for the people that need it the most. This is common sense, Margaret. It's good government, and everybody on both sides of the aisle should agree to that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator Hawley objects to that cost-sharing language.",
      "He is the one leveraging that criticism. This is going to change, you know that, when it goes to the Senate.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Listen, right. So, I\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you \u2013 how do you put Republicans up to have to defend these things, when they are facing an election in 17 months?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: We got almost every vote in the House because we worked on it for more than a year in finding the exact balance of reforms to the programs, so that we can save them and secure them.",
      "I think \u2013 I think Senator Hawley will see that when he looks into the details of what we passed on Thursday. This is a big thing. It's an historic thing, once-in-a-generation legislation. We call it the one big, beautiful bill because it's going to do so much and the America first agenda will be delivered for the people just as we promised.",
      "And, look, I had lunch with my Senate Republican colleagues on Tuesday, their weekly luncheon, and I encouraged them to remember that we are one team. It's the Senate and the House Republicans together that will deliver this \u2013 this ball over the goal line, so to speak.",
      "And I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Yes, well, you have \u2013 you have five to six Republicans from high tax states who are not going to want to see that change in the state and local tax deductions. And there's not a commitment to that in the Senate. Can you still get this through the House without SALT?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Look, we \u2013 there's got to be a modification to SALT.",
      "And, as I have explained to my Senate colleagues many times, you know, they don't have SALT Caucus in the Senate because they're all from red states, but in the House, we do have a number of members who are elected in places like New York and California and New Jersey, and they have to provide some relief to their constituents.",
      "Those are what we call our majority makers. Those are the people who are elected in the toughest districts and help us have the numbers to keep the majority in the House. And so this is political reality. We'd love to cut more costs. We'd love to do even more, but we have to deal within the realm of possibility.",
      "And I think this is a huge leap forward for fiscal responsibility, for a government that's effective and accountable to the people and real relief for hardworking Americans, and they well deserve it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Well, before I let you go, I want to ask you about another provision that was tucked into this bill. Democrats say it is weakening separation of powers and punishing the courts. It's a specific provision that would restrict a federal court's power to enforce injunctions with contempt, unless there was a bond attached to it.",
      "Sounds really weedy, but it's causing a lot of outcry. If this might get stripped out in the Senate anyway, why did you bother to stick it in?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, we bothered to stick it in because that's our responsibility in Congress.",
      "It is about separation of powers. And, right now, you have activist judges, a handful of them around the country, who are abusing that power. They're issuing these nationwide injunctions. They're \u2013 they're engaging in political acts from the bench.",
      "And that is not what our system is intended for. And people have lost their \u2013 their \u2013 their faith in our system of justice. We have to restore it. And bringing about a simple reform like that is something that I think everybody should applaud.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, and he joins us today from Greenwich, Connecticut.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-Connecticut): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the speaker. I know you did not vote for this bill. But, you know, Connecticut has one of the highest state and local tax burdens in the country. Do you at least like that one little portion of this bill?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: That one little portion is going to be good for my constituents.",
      "But, Margaret, I \u2013 I got to tell you, it was like listening to \"1984\" or something listening to the speaker. You know, anybody can look this up. The American people want basically three things out of their federal budget. Number one, at this point in time, when Americans \u2013 the wealthiest Americans, are doing better than ever before, Americans want the wealthiest of the \u2013 of Americans to pay more taxes and to give tax relief to the middle class and below.",
      "Number two, they want us to address the deficit, which is now spiraling out of control, to the point where we got a downgrade in one of the U.S. credit ratings. And, third, they want a simpler tax code.",
      "This bill fails spectacularly on all three counts. They're cutting Medicaid and nutritional assistance, food stamps, to tens of millions of Americans in order to preserve tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. They're adding $3 trillion to the deficit with this bill. And, lastly, they're gumming up the tax code with, you don't have to pay taxes on tips. Now, what about the folks who don't earn tips, you know, auto lending?",
      "I mean, again, on the three things that Americans care most about, that they want the Congress to do, this bill fails spectacularly. Look, and that's going to show up in the polling pretty soon, as Americans come to realize what it is that the House of Representatives just did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about your other role on the House Intelligence Committee.",
      "When it comes to what the president has vowed to do to Russia, he floated this idea two weeks ago of possible sanctions if Russia doesn't stop its war in Ukraine. But then he spoke to Vladimir Putin on Monday, and we heard nothing about sanctions. We did hear from the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency that this war is trending in favor of Russia.",
      "What changes need to be made, if anything, to how the U.S. provides support?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, Margaret, look, we're at a fork in the road with respect to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "And, you know, Donald Trump and his acolytes in the Congress will go along with one of these two choices. Either we will continue the trajectory that started when the president and the vice president humiliated Vladimir \u2013 humiliated President Zelenskyy in the Oval Office and paused aid, and Vladimir Putin will learn from that experience that he can count on the U.S. to support his murderous incursions into neighboring countries.",
      "Or we can take another path, which I hope the president will take, which is to say, what we need to do right now is generate maximum leverage against Vladimir Putin, and I see the president getting a little frustrated by him.",
      "But that maximum leverage comes because we really uptick the sanctions, we stop the export of oil, we pressure India to stop buying Russian oil, and, of course, we keep arming the Ukrainians. Again, for this guy who considers himself the master of the deal, maximize the leverage of the West so that we can bring this war not just to a conclusion, but to a fair and just conclusion that will keep the Russians from invading countries in the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In your role on the Intelligence Committee, you get to see things the public does not.",
      "With that in mind, the president has designated this Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, TDA, as a foreign terrorist organization. He says they're invading the country. He's using the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members without a day in court.",
      "Part of the legal justification of all of this rests on the claim that the Venezuelan government is controlling what TDA is doing. The National Intelligence Council assessed the Maduro government does not control the gang.",
      "But, on this program last Sunday, the secretary of state rejected that. He says he favors the FBI's finding, which is that some members of the Venezuelan government do influence the gang.",
      "Why does all of this matter?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, it matters, Margaret, because I will remind you that, in the George W. Bush administration, exactly what is happening right now happened.",
      "It was a different topic. Right now, despite the conclusions of the intelligence community, the president, the director of national intelligence and the secretary of state are saying that Venezuela directs Tren de Aragua.",
      "Now, they're saying that because they need this no due process mechanism of deporting people, the Alien Enemies Act, which, by the way, the courts are now laughing at.",
      "But the reason it matters, Margaret, is because the last time the White House did this, when they were determined that the intelligence community be forced to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which there turned out not to be, 4,400 American servicemen perished in a war that was fought on false pretenses, not to mention, by the way, the many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who perished in that war, which was a catastrophic strategic mistake driven by the politicization, the \u2013 the notion that George W. Bush had that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.",
      "That's why intelligence matters. There's 4,400 families in this country who lost people because the White House decided they would override the conclusion of their $90 billion-a-year intelligence community. That's what Marco Rubio is doing, that's what the president is doing, and that's what Director Gabbard are doing when they contradict what their own organization is telling them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on that point, this is also becoming an issue for Joe Kent, who is the president's nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center.",
      "He's under scrutiny because e-mails show that, while acting as chief of staff to DNI Gabbard, he pressed analysts to amend an assessment of links between the government and TDA.",
      "According to redacted e-mails that my network has obtained, he wrote: \"We need to do some rewriting, a little more analysis so this document is not used against the DNI or POTUS,\" the president of the United States. He says: \"We need to incorporate the FBI's assessment.\"",
      "You have now read these declassified e-mails as well. Do you believe that Joe Kent was just asking for more context?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: No, he absolutely was not. And I have seen the redacted e-mails. He was pressuring the National Intelligence Council to alter their conclusions.",
      "And, look, he gave away the game. You just read the line. He told us why he did that, so that this report would not be used against the president or the director of national intelligence. Think about that. The chief of staff of the \u2013 of the Office of the Director National Intelligence wasn't saying, we need the very best intelligence here. We need you to go back and make sure you're 100 percent true.",
      "He was saying, we need to make sure that your product is not used to embarrass the president and the director of national intelligence. That is the very definition, the very definition of politicizing intelligence. This is not about embarrassing or not embarrassing anybody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Again, back to those 4,400 dead Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: So, no, Joe Kent must never be confirmed for any Senate-confirmed\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Look, it's all out there for the Senate to see. So, no, he may \u2013 he must never be confirmed for any Senate-confirmed position because of what he did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. OK. And those e-mails are available for the public to read as well.",
      "Congressman Himes, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In our next half-hour, we will be talking to not one, but two members of the McCain family, Cindy McCain and her son Jack.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One congressional tradition that brings out both Republicans and Democrats is the Memorial Day weekend cleaning of the Vietnam Wall.",
      "We ran into former Trump National Security Adviser Mike Waltz on Thursday when we visited. He's no longer in Congress, but he explained why he started encouraging his fellow veterans in the House to pitch in.",

      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the executive director of the United Nations World Food Programme, Cindy McCain. She joins us this morning from Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "CINDY MCCAIN (Executive Director, United Nations World Food Programme): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In Gaza we have this manmade catastrophe with Israeli authorities blocking the entry of all aid from March until about May 18th. The Trump administration said Israel needs to let in food.",
      "So, are your deliveries consistently now getting through?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, let's start with the fact that this is a catastrophe. And you're absolutely correct, and I'm very grateful that you are covering this issue. They have let a few trucks in. This is a drop in the bucket as to what's needed.",
      "Right now we have 500,000 people inside of Gaza that are \u2013 that are extremely food insecure and could be on the verge of famine if we don't help bring them back from that. We need to get in and we need to get in at scale, not just a few dribble of the trucks. Right now it's, as I said, it's a drop in the bucket.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, how many trucks need to be getting in daily to address the scale of the need you see? And \u2013 and can they get into northern Gaza?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, prior to the \u2013 you know, during the ceasefire, I should say, we were getting in 600 trucks a day. Right now we're getting in maybe 100. Something like that. So, it \u2013 it's not nearly enough. And it needs to be going to the correct places. So, the various gates. It's inconsistent as to how the gates are open. It's inconsistent as to the roads we can use. The roads that are the better roads. The ones that can get us further along aren't open at all much. It's complicated right now. And \u2013 and again, I will tell anybody who will listen, we need to get in and get in at scale and be allowed to feed these people before further catastrophe occurs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your organization announced at least 15 of your trucks were looted when they entered southern Gaza on route to \u2013 to bakeries. Israel has consistently said that the looting is being carried out by Hamas. Have you seen evidence that it is Hamas stealing the food?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: No, not at all. Not \u2013 not in this round.",
      "Listen, these people are desperate. And they see a World Food Programme truck coming in and they run for it. This \u2013 this doesn't have anything to do with Hamas or any kind of organized crime or anything. It has simply to do with the fact these people are starving to death.",
      "And so, we will continue to go in. We will continue to go in with food and the kinds of supplies that we need to help the bakeries operate and make sure that we can continue to do that and \u2013 and hopefully be able to do more of it.",
      "But, again, we can't do this unless the world community puts pressure on this. We can't be allowed to sit back and watch these people starve to death with no outside diplomatic influence to help us. These \u2013 these \u2013 these poor souls are really, really, really desperate. And, you know, having been in \u2013 in a food riot myself some years ago, I understand the desperation very well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, five days ago, Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to take control of all of Gaza, which seems to be a shift from going in, carrying out raids and then withdrawing. We've seen the pope speak out. We've seen the leaders of France, of Canada, of the U.K. calling the cutting of aid egregious. Netanyahu said criticism like that is feeding Hamas and really feeding anti-Semitism.",
      "What do you make of that pushback from him, that criticisms of the state are feeding hate?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: What I do know is they're not feeding people. And the most important part of this is that's what we're supposed to be doing.",
      "I'm very grateful for anyone, the pope, any of the folks that did \u2013 did shout out and say, listen, we need to get more in. But I can't tell you as to what \u2013 exactly what Netanyahu's thinking or anything else.",
      "What I do know for a fact is that we need food to get into Gaza to avoid an utter catastrophe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli army had announced aid will be distributed under what they described as an American plan. Prime Minister Netanyahu said it will be American companies giving food directly to Palestinian families in safe zones secured by the Israeli military. There's reporting in \"The Washington Post\" that these are armed private contractors doing logistics. Palestinians will have to submit to identity checks to be fed. And that would replace the U.N. coordinated networks, presumably also the World Food Programme.",
      "Do you know how much longer you will be allowed to operate in Gaza?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: I have not seen a plan from anybody. We continue to operate doing what we do best. And we are the largest and the best at what we do, I might add. I \u2013 we've never been \u2013 a plan has never been proposed to us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We haven't heard in \u2013 in the press at least from the administration any of the details either. But we do know that the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, announced back on May 9th that this is going to be a U.S. initiative involving only Israeli security. The Israelis are not distributing food.",
      "Secretary Rubio was just in Rome. He said he did meet with you. Did you share with him any of your concerns?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, we had a very frank discussion about exactly what was going on and what we could do to help alleviate a lot of this. Some of it, I'm not sure that they were completely clear on how we operate and the size that we are and the logistics ability that we have to be able to do this. So \u2013 so, we had a \u2013 a very nice discussion. As you know, the Rubio family and \u2013 and the McCain family have been friends for a very long time. And so I was grateful that he would take the time to listen to what \u2013 what we had to say and let us discuss exactly how we feel we should be able to operate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he assure you that the U.S. supports the U.N. and the World Food Programme continuing to supply food in Gaza?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: We didn't really discuss the U.S. participation in any of this. He was really \u2013 really concerned with and really trying to understand how we operate and \u2013 and the need for what exactly what we do. We will work with anybody as long as it feeds people, and feeds people safely, I might add, on the ground and keeps our people and people from other agencies safe as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Executive director of the World Food Programme, Cindy McCain. Thank you for your time this morning.",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Thank you very much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with another McCain. Jack McCain is the son of Cindy and the late Senator John McCain. He's a Navy veteran who served in the Afghanistan War. And he joins us now from Kyoto, Japan.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "JACK MCCAIN (Afghanistan War Combat Veteran): Thank you. I'm incredibly glad to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we know, when you were in Afghanistan, you flew alongside and helped to train some of the Afghan Black Hawk pilots. Why is it important to you now to speak out on their behalf? Are any of your personal contacts there at risk?",
      "JACK MCCAIN: Yes. Basically everyone that we were unable to get out is at risk. These pilots and crew members fought the Taliban toe to toe. And because of that, the Taliban is trying to seek them out for reprisal. Something that they distinctly promised that they would not do.",
      "So, not only are they \u2013 are they in danger, but we owe them a debt.",
      "I believe that I'm vertical and still on this earth because of the efforts of my Afghan pilots and crews. And not only do I owe them personally, but the nation owes them a debt of honor. One that we have yet to repay.",
      "Everyone, interpreters, ground troops, pilots, that worked and fought alongside the United States at our behest should be able to be evacuated here to the United States and should be taken care of.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you were active duty at the time of the very chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. I know you helped to get Afghans out during that period of time. There were a lot of Afghans airlifted out. Who was left behind and \u2013 and what promises were made?",
      "JACK MCCAIN: Yes, the problem is everyone was left behind. Whether it was family members, including family members of U.S. servicemen, whether it was pilots, crews, the people that I worked with, special forces, we did everything we could to get as many as we could out. But due to the chaos of the withdrawal and, frankly, the lack of planning on the part of the United States government, it was up to individuals and sometimes smaller military units to help either, in my case I had to triage who we were going to take out. I had to prioritize operational pilots over pilots in training versus crew members in the back simply because everyone was trying to do everything they could.",
      "So, we have tens of thousands that fought alongside us left behind. Each one of them in danger in their own way. Not to mention family members that can be used as tools of leverage against those that are even here in the United States now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And to that point, under the Taliban right now, the daughters, the wives, the female family members of a lot of these people who worked with Americans are facing some pretty tough conditions. However, this administration just recently said through Homeland Security that it is safe for Afghans to return. So those here could be sent back. Some Afghans who had arrived here and been given temporary protection.",
      "Does what the U.S. government said match in any way what you are hearing is happening on the ground?",
      "JACK MCCAIN: I would disagree with the entire notion that it is safe for anyone, especially if they've been in the United States, to return to rule under the Taliban. Whether they are male, female, young, old, that regime has proven itself to be \u2013 to not only have gone back on every promise they made to us, but to be \u2013 to have no problem using human lives as pawns to imprison, torture, rape, kill, even sell into slavery.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there are a number of veterans of the war in Afghanistan who serve currently as lawmakers in the United States Congress. And it is Congress that sets the number of visas for these \u2013 these special immigrant visas, SIVs. We checked. There are more than 144,000 applicants in the pipeline, but there are only 11,000 visas left. That's not even counting family members here.",
      "Have you gotten any indication from the lawmakers you know that they are going to raise that cap?",
      "JACK MCCAIN: No, I have not. And it is an utter travesty that that is the case. People on both sides of the aisle had \u2013 have served in Afghanistan or have fought alongside Afghans, much like me. And the political theater that has taken place of simply ignoring the problem can only be summarized by the word despicable.",
      "This is an issue of humanity. This is an issue of national honor. And this is a debt that we owe. So, I would urge lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to solve this problem because it is not going to go away. It is your job to legislate, so, please do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's in the hand of lawmakers. That was a problem even during the last administration. Now, though, we have this extra complication where the Trump administration has put in orders to restrict refugee admissions and said the U.S. should prioritize people who can, quote, \"fully and appropriately assimilate and who do not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States.\" That's made it hard for Afghan refugees, family members to enter here.",
      "How do you reassure the public that these refugees are not a risk? Even the vice president of the United States has said he does not trust the vetting of refugees.",
      "JACK MCCAIN: Well, I mean, I think I passed the ultimate test in that I literally put my lives in \u2013 my life in these people's hands. So, not only are they worthy of trust, but they are worthy of our care.",
      "The vetting process has taken place. It continues to take place. And if vetting is the issue, fantastic. Let's pass legislation to solve that problem. Let's make sure everyone up to this point has been vetted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, your father famously said, \"it matters less that you can fight, but what you fight for is the real test.\" I know you feel passionately about this particular issue. Can you ever see yourself entering politics to fight for other issues?",
      "JACK MCCAIN: That's a \u2013 a very interesting question. One that I happen to get asked fairly regularly. And I would say trying to follow his example that the best life is one lived adventurously and in service of a cause greater than one's self interest. I'm doing that. And if someday that does take me to office in service of the nation, then by all means. But to live a life simply focused on the single goal of attaining public office is not in my mind a life purposefully lived, in \u2013 in service in office, it is a purposefully lived one, but that should not be the overriding goal of your life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will continue watching.",
      "Jack McCain, thank you for weighing in on this important issue.",
      "JACK MCCAIN: Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This year, the bipartisan group, led in the past by then Congressman Mike Waltz, went from the House floor, where they had just passed the president's spending bill in an early morning vote, down to the Washington Mall. Cleaning the Vietnam War Memorial may have been delayed, but the mission was not deterred by either lack of sleep or rain.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were up all night. Why did you show up in the rain in your suit to still do this?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE SETH MOULTON (D-MA): Because this is way more important. You know, sometimes people ask me, God, Seth, Washington is a mess today. Is it as bad as Iraq? And every single day the answer is, this is easier than the war. And it's important to keep that perspective.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that the divisions in our country now are in the same place, different from what this country went through around the time of Vietnam, when it was a very divided country?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE SETH MOULTON: You know, I think there are actually a lot of \u2013 a lot of parallels. And one of the lessons that we should learn is to \u2013 to do right by our veterans, if for no other reason we've got to work on coming together. And, you know, it's \u2013 it's difficult when it feels like we've got the divider in chief to quote one of his former officials, at the head of our government right now. But that doesn't mean that those of us in Congress, especially veterans, can't work together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN (voice over): Iowa Republican Zach Nunn spent 20 years as an Air Force intelligence officer as still served in the Air Force Reserve. North Carolina Democrat Don Davis also served in the Air Force and told us that his work as a mortuary officer at nearby Andrews Air Force Base makes Memorial Day especially important to him.",
      "After the wall was cleaned, we talked about their work together on Capitol Hill.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress did give that boost of pay last year to the troops. Is it enough in this economy though? Is the country doing enough?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON DAVIS (D-NC): We know that families are still struggling to make ends meet. Taking care of the day to day, kids, putting gas in the tank. So, it's definitely, I'm sure, not enough. But we are moving, I believe, there with that (INAUDIBLE) in particular in the right direction, not only with pay, but looking at broader quality of life issues, housing, childcare that's available on our installations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: America spends more than any other country on its defense. How is it possible we have this happening to our troops?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ZACH NUNN, (R-IA): We've tried to work together on things that not only help veterans, leading a veteran's suicide bill, assistance to families in the military. I'm proud the bill that we just passed is going to be able to extent a 22 percent tax cut to military families. I'm proud that we got a child tax credit in there. I'm thrilled that we were able to get our bill in there that worked towards giving a family a tax credit for adoption. We've got two adopted kids. This goes a long ways to helping a middle American family, whether you're military or not, be successful going forward.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON DAVIS: But I want to also say, it's important to do all of this for recruitment, retention, addressing quality of life. We recruit families. But also, when I think about being right here, at the Vietnam Memorial, and I think about our service, my service, you don't do it for the money, you do it because you love the country.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ZACH NUNN: That's right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON DAVIS: So, because of that love for the country, realizing that families are fighting for our country, the service members and their families, we have to continue to just look and \u2013 at prioritizing our military families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you tell people now, encourage them to enter public service, at a time when they're being told, even by the federal government \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ZACH NUNN: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The private sector is going to be more rewarding for you?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ZACH NUNN: Look, Margaret, I think you highlight a really important part here. There's a number of ways that people can be called to serve. It's one of the things that I think has actually made us most combat effective in Congress is finding people who are mission oriented, who are working together. I tell my kids, the things that they could potentially learn in the military will echo throughout their entire life. But it's up for every American to make that decision, that pathway.",
      "You're right, less than 1 percent of Americans are serving. That 1 percent distinguishes itself time and time again.",
      "And there's lots of great ways to public service. Don and I have worked together to get more teachers, more nurses, more doctors. There's all great calls to public service. The federal government has a role to play in this, but ultimately it's up to Americans to decide how do they best give back to the communities that they represent? We certainly felt that military service was a way to do it, but I think we came to it in our own pathway.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON DAVIS: Yes, and I would love to say to any young person listening right now that's remotely interested, I had an amazing career serving in the United States Air Force. I love serving our country. And it was definitely a great career for me. And now as a member of the Armed Services Committee, we're doing everything to continue to make sure all of our branches are vibrant and we're doing things to make sure we support them. Give it a shot.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, we talk about the Vietnam War and the memorial behind you. There are it looks like students coming to reflect this morning. Three million people died in that war, 58,000 Americans among them. I wonder this Memorial Day, who are you thinking of?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ZACH NUNN: Look, this isn't ancient history. This is living history. I think of my uncle who flew spotter planes over Vietnam. I think of my dad, who had the choice between enlisting or joining the ROTC program. I also think about my mother, who got \u2013 back home taking care of, you know, at that point, her career as a nurse. Ay aunt, who had two little girls. These are the stories that I think it's so important that young people do have the opportunity to learn about. One, so we never enter this kind of a situation again where we send men and women off to fight and they come back home, not to a hero's welcome, but as a despised class. Peace through strength is a real deterrent. But also knowing that we've got a military that when we commit to fight, we have to go in there knowing that we have a strategy, a plan, and that we're not going to be bringing people home injured, broken or shattered to a country not ready to receive them.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON DAVIS: It's so warming to see young people, kids walking through and looking at the Vietnam Memorial. I think of those throughout my community back home in eastern North Carolina, who I know served our country during Vietnam.",
      "And I go beyond Vietnam. I think of Corporal Ryan Russell, who's from east North Carolina, who was killed in Iraq. And I have a special relationship with his mom, Kathy. And we're doing everything to commemorate those who were killed, not just Vietnam, but in all wars and conflicts so that they know the \u2013 that the families, that we're standing with them. There's a way to get through this, this healing process that so many families are going through, those tears, that they're not alone.",
      "But not only that, but to embrace nationally when we see this, to think about all those who ultimately gave their lives in service of our country.",
      "(END VT)",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And to that point: under the Taliban right now, women aren't even allowed to speak in public. They can't go to school over the sixth- past the sixth grade. They're not allowed to work. So the daughters, the wives, the female family members of a lot of these people who worked with Americans are facing some pretty tough conditions. However, this administration just recently said through Homeland Security that it is safe for Afghans to return.

So no, I disagree that Afghanistan is safe for anybody, much less those that fought on behalf of the United States. My pilots were doing gun runs on Taliban positions as they were moving forward on the base in Kandahar. I would say that they have a score- the Taliban have a score they'd like to settle. So absolutely, not unequivocally, it is not safe to return.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there are a number of veterans of the war in Afghanistan who serve currently as lawmakers in the United States Congress.

So not only are they worthy of trust, but they are worthy of our care. The vetting process has taken place. It continues to take place. And if vetting is the issue, fantastic. Let's pass legislation to solve that problem. Let's make sure everyone up to this point has been vetted. But if there's something else that would make anyone on any side of the aisle feel safer, then great, there's a solution for this. It's called the legislative process. So I would urge lawmakers to do the one job that they're paid by the American people to do, and to solve the problem that we have created ourselves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Secretary Rubio testified this week that he will follow the letter of the law as written by Congress. Congress had established a program to help pay for the Afghans to be resettled here. It's the CARE Program at the State Department, but now the program is no longer paying the way for these Afghans. How difficult is it for some of the Afghans you know to pay to get their wife, their family members here?",
      "MCCAIN:\u00a0 These people were taken from their country with only the clothes on their back in about 99% of cases. They were dumped off into locations that they were unfamiliar with, and as much as service members and the government did an amazing amount to try to support them, it's still not enough. When you imagine the massive change in their lives, not to mention the fact that their entire country and family has now been shattered as a result of American action. It is beyond difficult. I have individuals who are combat wounded, who have extreme injuries that make them almost unable to work, and it's not like I can send them to the VA despite the fact that they got shot at on behalf of the American government. So I would say that life is extremely difficult, but those individuals are of great resolve, and they are doing everything they can to overcome and to become great Americans, the great Americans that I know they will be, and that anybody that knows them personally knows them to be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 There have been a few investigations of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, by the Pentagon, by the State Department. They have found fault with the Biden administration. They have found fault with the first Trump administration. This past week, Secretary Hegseth announced he's going to do a new investigation of it all. That it will be led by his spokesperson. It's unclear why that person in particular. What do you think was missing from those original reviews?",
      "MCCAIN:\u00a0 I don't think anything is missing from those original reviews, and I don't think that going back over the process of the withdrawal is going to solve any of the very real problems that exist today. It was political theater the first time, it is political theater the second time, and it is political theater yet again. This does nothing to solve the problem that we created. This does nothing to make the lives of Afghans better. This does nothing to help stabilize the region. It is simply the Biden administration pointing the finger at the Trump administration, the Trump administration pointing the finger at the Biden administration. It's happening all over again. This is a useless waste of effort, but frankly, it is one that I see continuing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Before I let you go. Your father famously said it matters less that you can fight, but what you fight for is the real test. I know you feel passionately about this particular issue. Can you ever see yourself entering politics to fight for other issues?",
      "MCCAIN:\u00a0 That's a very interesting question, one that I happen to get asked fairly regularly. And I would say, trying to follow his example, that the best life is one lived adventurously, and if- in service of a cause greater than one's self interest. I'm doing that, and if someday that does take me to office, in service of the nation, then by all means. But to live a life simply focused on the single goal of attaining public office is not, in my mind, a life purposefully lived. In service and in office, it is a purposefully lived one, but that should not be the overriding goal of your life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We will continue watching. Jack McCain, thank you for weighing in on this important issue.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on May 25, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, and he joins us today from Greenwich, Connecticut. Good morning to you.",
      "REP. JIM HIMES: Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the speaker. I know you did not vote for this bill. But you know, Connecticut has one of the highest state and local tax burdens in the country. Do you at least like that one little portion of this bill?",
      "REP. HIMES: That one little portion is going to be good for my constituents, but Margaret, I- I got to tell you, it was like listening to \"1984\" or something, listening to the speaker. You know, anybody can look this up, the American people want basically three things out of their federal budget. Number one, at this point in time when Americans, the wealthiest Americans, are doing better than ever before, Americans want the wealthiest of the Amer- of Americans to pay more taxes, and to give tax relief to the middle class and below. Number two, they want us to address the deficit, which is now spiraling out of control to the point where we got a downgrade in one of the U.S. credit ratings. And third, they want a simpler tax code. This bill spe- fails spectacularly on all three counts. They're cutting Medicaid and nutritional assistance, food stamps, to tens of millions of Americans in order to preserve tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. They're adding $3 trillion to the deficit with this bill. And lastly, they're gumming up the tax code with, you don't have to pay taxes on tips. Now, what about the folks who don't earn tips? You know, auto lending. I mean, again, on the three things that Americans care most about, that they want the Congress to do, this bill fails spectacularly. Look, and that's going to show up in the polling pretty soon, as Americans come to realize what it is that the House of Representatives just did .",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about your other role on the House Intelligence Committee. When it comes to what the President has vowed to do to Russia, he floated this idea two weeks ago of possible sanctions if Russia doesn't stop its war in Ukraine. But then he spoke to Vladimir Putin on Monday, and we heard nothing about sanctions. We did hear from the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency that this war is trending in favor of Russia. What changes need to be made, if anything, to how the U.S. provides support?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, Margaret, look, we're at a fork in the road with respect to the Russia-Ukraine war. And you know, Donald Trump and his acolytes in the Congress will go along with one of these two choices: either we will continue the trajectory that started when the president and the vice president humiliated Vladimir- humiliated President Zelenskyy in the Oval Office and paused aid, and Vladimir Putin will learn from that experience that he can count on the U.S. to support his murderous incursions into neighboring countries. Or we can take another path, which I hope the president will take, which is to say, what we need to do right now is generate maximum leverage against Vladimir Putin, and I see the president getting a little frustrated by him, but that maximum leverage comes because we really uptick the sanctions. We stop the export of oil. We pressure India to stop buying Russian oil, and of course, we keep arming the Ukrainians. Again, for this guy who considers himself the master of the deal, maximize the leverage of the West so that we can bring this war not just to a conclusion, but to a fair and just conclusion that will keep the Russians from invading countries in the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In your role on the Intelligence Committee, you get to see things the public does not. With that in mind, the President has designated this Venezuelan gang, Tren de Ar- Aragua, TDA, as a foreign terrorist organization. He says they're invading the country. He's using the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members without a day in court. Part of the legal justification of all of this rests on the claim that the Venezuelan government is controlling what TDA is doing. The National Intelligence Council assessed the Maduro government does not control the gang. But, on this program last Sunday, the secretary of state rejected that. He says he favors the FBI's finding, which is that some members of the Venezuelan government do influence the gang. Why does all of this matter?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, it matters Margaret, because I'll remind you that in the George W. Bush administration, exactly what is happening right now happened. It was a different topic. Right now, despite the conclusions of the intelligence community, the president, the Director of National Intelligence and the secretary of state are saying that Venezuela directs Tren De Aragua. Now they're saying that because they need this no due process mechanism of deporting people, the Alien Enemies Act, which, by the way, the courts are now laughing at. But the reason it matters, Margaret, is because the last time the White House did this, when they were determined that the intelligence community be forced to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which there turned out not to be, 4,400 American servicemen perished in a war that was fought on false pretenses, not to mention, by the way, the many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who perished in that war, which was a catastrophic strategic mistake driven by the politicization, the- the notion that George W. Bush had that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. That's why intelligence matters. There's 4,400 families in this country who lost people because the White House decided they would override the conclusion of their $90 billion a year intelligence community. That's what Marco Rubio is doing. That's what the president is doing, and that's what Director Gabbard are doing when they contradict what their own organization is telling them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on that point, this is also becoming an issue for Joe Kent, who is the president's nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center. He's under scrutiny because emails show that while acting as chief of staff to DNI Gabbard, he pressed analysts to amend an assessment of links between the government and TDA. According to redacted emails that my network has obtained, he wrote, \"we need to do some rewriting, a little more analysis so this document is not used against the DNI or POTUS,\" the president of the United States. He says, \"we need to\u2026incorporate the FBI's assessment.\" You have now read these declassified emails as well. Do you believe that Joe Kent was just asking for more context?",
      "REP. HIMES: No, he absolutely was not. And I have seen the redacted emails. He was pressuring the National Intelligence Council to alter their conclusions. And look, he gave away the game. You just read the line. He told us why he did that, so that this report would not be used against the president or the Director of National Intelligence. Think about that. The chief of staff of the- of the Office of the Director National Intelligence wasn't saying, we need the very best intelligence here. We need you to go back and make sure you're 100% true. He was saying, we need to make sure that your product is not used to embarrass the president and the Director of National Intelligence. That is the very definition, the very definition, of politicizing intelligence. This is not about embarrassing or not embarrassing anybody. Again, back to those 4,400 dead Americans. So no, Joe Kent must never be confirmed for any Senate confirmed- look, it's all out there for the Senate to see. So no, he may- he must never be confirmed for any Senate confirmed position because of what he did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. And those emails are available for the public to read as well. Congressman Himes, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back with a lot more \"Face the Nation.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with House Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on May 25, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin with the passage of what President Trump is calling his \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" and the man who got it through the House, Speaker Mike Johnson, who joins us from Benton, Louisiana. Good morning to you, Mr. Speaker.",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Hey, good morning, and I wish a blessed Memorial Day weekend to everybody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Indeed. Well, you got this massive tax and border bill through, just barely, one vote margin. You pulled an all-nighter. Among other things, it will eliminate taxes on tips and overtime. Put about $50 billion towards the border wall and hiring Border Patrol agents, keep in place existing individual tax rates, create savings accounts for kids with a one-time deposit of $1,000, increase the child tax credit by about 500 bucks. The- the bill on this is estimated to be between four and $5 trillion over the next decade. How much do you think this is all going to cost?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, that's about the right estimate. But at the same time, we have historic savings for the American people. Cuts to government to make it more efficient and effective and- and work better for the people. That was a big campaign promise of President Trump and a big promise of ours, and we're going to achieve that. So in the calculation here, there's more than $1.5 trillion in savings, Margaret, for the people. And that's- that's the largest amount- biggest cut in government, really, in at least 30 years and if you adjust for inflation, probably the largest in the history of government. So we're proud of what we produced here. We've checked all the boxes, where all the things that you mentioned in existence- in addition to American energy dominance, investing in our military industrial base, which is appropriate for us to talk about this weekend and so many other priorities and that's why we call it the \"One Big Beautiful Bill. I think arguably, it's the most consequential legislation that Congress will pass in many generations, and it's a long time coming.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, just this morning, we did hear from some of your Republican colleagues over in the Senate, where this heads next, that they can't support the bill as it is written. I think you know this. Senator Rand Paul said the cuts are 'wimpy and anemic,' 'the math doesn't add up,' it will 'explode the debt.' In addition to that political criticism, you've already seen--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: --Yeah, Senator Paul and I are\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Moody's credit rating agency downgrade American credit and Goldman Sachs says that this bill will not offset the damage from the President's tariffs. Isn't this an economic gamble?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: No, it's not an economic gamble. It's a big investment. And look, this- what this bill is going to do is be jet fuel to the U.S. economy. It is going to foster a pro growth economy. What do we mean by that? Because we're reducing taxes, we're reducing regulations, we're going to increase and incentivize American manufacturing again. And what will- the effect this will have in the economy is that entrepreneurs and risk takers and job creators will have an easier time in doing that. They will allow for more jobs and more opportunity for more people, and wages will increase. Now, Margaret, this is not a theoretical exercise. We did this already in the first Trump administration. After just the first two years, we brought about the greatest economy in the history of the world, not just the U.S. because we did it- followed a very simple formula, we cut taxes and we cut regulations. This time--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You didn't do it in the middle of a tariff war.",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: --we're doing that on steroids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the first administration, there was sequencing\u2013",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You got tax reform- the Republicans got tax reform through and held off the tariff war. Goldman Sachs says, \"the hit to growth from tariffs will more than offset the boost to growth from the fiscal package.\" That's Goldman Sachs.",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well- well, I know. I respect Goldman Sachs, but I think what they're discounting here is the growth that will be spurred on by this legislation, and the fact that the so-called tariff war is beginning to subside already. You've got over 75 countries that are negotiating new, more fair trade agreements for the U.S. right now because of the President's insistence that that be done and it was decades overdue. That is going to benefit every American, it's going to benefit the consumers. You know, they howled when the first tariffs- reciprocal tariffs policy was announced, and they said that prices would skyrocket. That simply hasn't happened. Many of those early estimates were far off, and that's being proven now. So what I think will happen is the tariffs, you know, contest will subside. This legislation will pass and get the economy going again and people will feel that. They'll see it in their own pocketbooks, in their own opportunity and every American household is going to benefit by these policies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know Walmart has already said that it will have to raise prices. It's not theoretical. And the President on Friday was talking about even more tariffs, this time on Apple and others. But back- back to your end of the- of the deal here, for this tax relief, you \u00a0talked about the cuts to pay for it all. You are eliminating subsidized federal student loans so the government will no longer cover the interest on debt while borrowers' in school. You're eliminating 500 billion in clean energy subsidies and you're terminating early tax breaks for electric vehicles. Alongside that, you're carrying out about a trillion in reductions to Medicaid and food stamps. We looked at your home state, and the projection is that nearly 200,000 Louisianans will lose their Medicaid coverage because of this. How do you defend that to your constituents?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: We have not cut Medicaid, and we have not cut SNAP. What we're doing, Margaret, is working on fraud, waste and abuse, and everyone in Louisiana and around the country understands that that's a responsibility of Congress. Just in- in Medicaid, for example, you've got 1.4 million illegal aliens receiving those benefits. That is not what Medicaid is intended for. It's intended for vulnerable populations, for young, single, pregnant women and the elderly and the disabled and people who desperately need those resources. Right now, they're being drained by fraud, waste and abuse. You've got about 4.8 million people on Medicaid right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system. If you are able to work and you refuse to do so, you are defrauding the system. You're cheating the system. And no one in the country believes that that's right. So there's a- there's a moral component to what we're doing. And when you make young men work, it's good for them, it's good for their dignity, it's good for their self worth, and it's good for the community that they live in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure, but in- first of all, just undocumented immigrants, you know, are not eligible for food stamps or Medicaid. Some--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: And yet they're receiving them that's the problem\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --lawfully present immigrants are. So the 190,000 Louisianans that are projected by KFF as losing their Medicaid. Your position is they were just lazy, not working? That they were undocumented? What about them? How do you defend that they will be losing their benefits?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: No. What we're talking about again, is able-bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system. And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all. By the way, the work requirements, Margaret, is not some onerous, burdensome thing. It's a minimum of 20 hours a week. You could either be working or be in a job program, a job training program, or volunteering in your community. This is not some, some onerous thing ,this is common sense. And when the American people understand what we are doing here, they applaud it. This is a wildly popular thing, because we have to preserve the programs. What we're doing is strengthening Medicaid and SNAP so that they can exist, so that they'll be there for the people that desperately need it the most, and it's not being taken advantage of. And this is something that everybody in Congress, Republicans and Democrats should agree to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of your Republican colleagues over in the Senate has been very vocal about his concern in regard to what you're doing to Medicaid. Josh Hawley has been arguing it is 'morally wrong and politically suicidal' to slash health insurance for the working poor. He said the cost sharing language will force people at or just over the federal poverty level to pay as much as $35 for a medical visit, which means working people will pay more. How do you defend that? Because you know, in the Senate, they are going to make changes to this.",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: My friend Josh Hawley is a fiscal conservative as I am. We don't want to slash benefits. And again, I make this very clear. We are not cutting Medicaid. We are not cutting SNAP. We're working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP, for example, listen to the statistics, in 2024 over $11 billion in SNAP payments were- were erroneous. I mean, that's- that's a number that everyone acknowledges is real. It may be much higher than that--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Louisiana is like--",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: But here's the problem, the states--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- the second largest recipient of food stamps in the country, sir.",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Let me explain it, Margaret. Let me explain it. The states- the states are not properly administering this because they don't have enough skin in the game. So what we've done in the bill is add some- just a modest state sharing component, so that they'll pay attention to that, so that we can reduce fraud. Why? Again, so that it is preserved for the people that need it the most. This is common sense, Margaret. It's good government, and everybody on both sides of the aisle should agree to that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator Hawley objects to that cost sharing language. He is the one leveraging that criticism. This is going to change, you know that, when it goes to the Senate. How do you- how do you put Republicans up to have to defend these things when they are facing an election in 17 months?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: We got almost every vote in the House because we worked on it for more than a year in finding the exact balance of reforms to the program so that we can save them and secure them. I think- I think Senator Hawley will see that when he looks into the details of what we passed on Thursday. This is a big thing, it's an historic thing, once in a generation legislation. We call it the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' because it's going to do so much and the America first agenda will be delivered for the people just as we promised. And look, I had lunch with my Senate Republican colleagues on Tuesday, their weekly luncheon, and I encouraged them to remember that we are one team. It's the Senate and the House Republicans together that will deliver this- this ball over the goal line, so to speak. And I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, well, you- you have five to six Republicans from high tax states who are not going to want to see that change in the state and local tax deductions and there's not a commitment to that in the Senate. Can you still get this through the house without SALT?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Look, we- there's got to be a modification to SALT, and as I've explained to my Senate colleagues many times, you know, they don't have SALT caucus in the Senate because they're all from red states, but in the House, we do have a number of members who are elected in places like New York and California and New Jersey, and they have to provide some relief to their constituents. Those are what we call our majority makers. Those are the people who are elected in the toughest districts and help us have the numbers to keep the majority in the House, and so, this is political reality. We'd love to cut more costs. We'd love to do even more, but we have to deal within the realm of possibility. And I think this is a huge leap forward for fiscal responsibility, for a government that's effective and accountable to the people and real relief for hard working Americans, and they well deserve it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well before I let you go, I want to ask you about another provision that was tucked into this bill. Democrats say it is weakening separation of powers and punishing the courts. It's a specific provision that would restrict a federal court's power to enforce injunctions with contempt, unless there was a bond attached to it. Sounds really weedy, but it's causing a lot of outcry. If this might get stripped out in the Senate anyway, why did you bother to stick it in?",
      "SPEAKER JOHNSON: Well, we bothered to stick it in because that's our responsibility in Congress. It is about separation of powers, and right now you have activist judges, a handful of them around the country, who are abusing that power. They're issuing these nationwide injunctions. They're- they're engaging in political acts from the bench, and that is not what our system is intended for. And people have lost their- their- their faith in our system of justice. We have to restore it and bringing about a simple reform like that is something that I think everybody should applaud.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, thank you for your time this morning. 'Face the Nation' will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We turn now to the Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Programme, Cindy McCain. She joins us this morning from Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Good morning to you.",
      "U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CINDY MCCAIN: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a few hotspots in Africa, but let's start first on the Middle East if we could. In Gaza, we have this man-made catastrophe with Israeli authorities blocking the entry of all aid from March until about May 18. The Trump administration said Israel needs to let in food. So are your deliveries consistently now getting through?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, let's start with the fact that this is a catastrophe, and you're absolutely correct, and I'm very grateful that you are covering this issue. They have let a few trucks in. This is a drop in the bucket as to what's needed. Right now, we have 500,000 people inside of Gaza that are- that are extremely food insecure, and could be on the verge of famine if we don't help bring them back from that. We need to get in, and we need to get in at scale, not just a few dribble of the trucks right now, as I said, it's a drop in the bucket.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So how many trucks need to be getting in daily to address the scale of the need you see, and can they get into northern Gaza?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, prior to the, you know, during the cease-fire, I should say, we were getting in 600 trucks a day. Right now, we're getting in maybe 100 something like that. So it's not nearly enough, and it needs to be going to the correct places. So the various gates, it's inconsistent as to how the gates are open. It's inconsistent as to the roads we can use. The roads that are the better roads, the ones that can get us further along, aren't open at all. It's complicated right now and again, I will tell anybody who will listen, we need to get in and get in at scale and be allowed to feed these people before further catastrophe occurs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your organization announced at least 15 of your trucks were looted when they entered southern Gaza en route to bakeries. Israel has consistently said that the looting is being carried out by Hamas. Have you seen evidence that it is Hamas stealing the food?",
      "MCCAIN: No, not at all. Not- not in this round. Listen, these people are desperate, and they see a World Food Programme truck coming in, and they run for it. This- this doesn't have anything to do with Hamas or any kind of organized crime, or anything. It has simply to do with the fact these people are starving to death, and so we will continue to go in. We will continue to go in with food and the kinds of supplies we need to help the bakeries operate and make sure that we can continue to do that, and hopefully be able to do more of it. But again, we can't do this unless the world community puts pressure on this. We can't be allowed to sit back and watch these people starve to death with no outside diplomatic influence to help us. These- these- these poor souls are really, really, really desperate. And you know, having been in- in a food riot myself some years ago, I understand the desperation very well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, five days ago, Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to take control of all of Gaza, which seems to be a shift from going in, carrying out raids and then withdrawing. We've seen the Pope speak out. We've seen the leaders of France, of Canada, of the U.K. calling the cutting of aid egregious. Netanyahu said criticism like that is feeding Hamas and really feeding anti-semitism. What do you make of that pushback from him, that criticisms of the state are feeding hate?",
      "MCCAIN: What I do know is you're not feeding people and the most important part of this is that's what we're supposed to be doing. I'm very grateful for anyone, the Pope, any of the folks that did, did shout out and say, listen, we need to get more in, but I can't tell you as to what exactly what Netanyahu is thinking or anything else. What I do know for a fact is that we need food to get into Gaza to avoid an utter catastrophe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli army had announced aid will be distributed under what they described as an American plan. Prime Minister Netanyahu said it will be American companies giving food directly to Palestinian families in safe zones secured by the Israeli military. There's reporting in the Washington Post that these are armed private contractors doing logistics, Palestinians will have to submit to identity checks to be fed, and that would replace the U.N. coordinated networks, presumably also the World Food Programme. Do you know how much longer you will be allowed to operate in Gaza?",
      "MCCAIN: I've not seen a plan from anybody. We continue to operate, doing what we do best, and we are the largest and the best at what we do, I might add. I- we've never been- a plan has ever been proposed to us. We really don't know what's coming around the bend. We will continue to operate. We will work with anybody, if it will feed people. That's the most important part here is that we can't turf off on things we will, we need to work together. We need to be able to feed these people and be able to get in consistently and at scale.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We haven't heard in- in the press, at least, from the administration any of the details either, but we do know that the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, announced back on May 9, that this is going to be a U.S. initiative involving only Israeli security. The Israelis are not distributing food. Secretary Rubio was just in Rome. He said he did meet with you. Did you share with him any of your concerns?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, we had a very frank discussion about exactly what was going on and what we could do to help alleviate a lot of this. Some of it- I'm not sure that they were completely clear on how we operate and the size that we are and the logistics ability that we have to be able to do this. So- so we had a very nice discussion. As you know, the Rubio family and the McCain family have been friends for a very long time. And so I was grateful that he would take the time to listen to what- what we had to say, and let us discuss exactly how we feel we should be able to operate. And I was very grateful for and for and honored to have the opportunity to speak to him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he assure you that the U.S. supports the U.N. and the World Food Programme continuing to supply food in Gaza?",
      "MCCAIN: We didn't really discuss the U.S. participation in any of this. He was really, really concerned with and really trying to understand how we operate and- and the need for what exactly what we do. Again, I will tell you, we will- we will work with anybody, as long as it feeds people and feeds people safely, I might add, on the ground, and keeps our people and people from other agencies safe as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're speaking to us now from the Congo. President Trump claimed this past week, the administration was close to brokering a deal between the Congo and Rwanda to end their war. The numbers are staggering in terms of food insecurity. Do you have any sense that there is some kind of cease-fire that you're close to that could help feed people?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, I'm hearing that there are some possible discussions going to take place in Qatar, some other discussions that have taken place in other countries and certainly other regions of Africa. What I do know is we need to hurry up. People are hungry and people have been displaced, and people- disease outbreaks are becoming more prevalent now because of some of the flooding as a result of the weather, the weather issues here. So my my purpose in this particular trip, I've been here many, many times, and my purpose in this particular trip is to see just exactly where we sit, exactly what kind of kind of foods are being allowed in number one and number two, what we can do better to help alleviate some of the, the, these, the issues that are going on here with regards to food. There's a large amount of people within DRC, Congo, particularly in the east, that don't have access to food, and if they do, it's not very much. So it's- it's my- my time right now is to make sure that we're doing the very best we can to make sure people don't go hungry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've spoken in the past about just how horrific the conditions are inside Sudan right now. This past week, the Trump administration put further restrictions on the government after it used chemical weapons against its own people, something they said happened in 2024. There's also a famine there right now. Is there any sign that you will be able to get in and feed people there?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, we're in there right now. We're in there and you know, it's complicated to be able to, to be in there, but we're in there, we are feeding. But again, there is famine and being- being able to be able to feed, to travel freely, to distribute food, and to get into the places we need to go, is the issue here. And as you know, there's many factions that play on the ground in Sudan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Cindy McCain\u2013",
      "MCCAIN: But, let me say this\u2013",
      "MARAGRET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "MCCAIN: \u2013Sudan is the largest humanitarian crisis on the planet right now. It's the largest one, and we've got to- to pay attention to it and make sure that we can continue to get in there and other agencies be able to get in there to do just exactly what they need to do as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Executive Director of the World Food Programme, Cindy McCain, thank you for your time this morning.",

It wasn't meant to be.\"",
      "The last time the president gave a speech at the U.S. Military Academy came amid nationwide reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.

      "The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge's order at the time. But the U.S. put him on a bus and sent him to Mexico instead, a removal that U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy found likely \"lacked any semblance of due process.\"",
      "Mexico has since returned him to Guatemala, where he is in hiding, according to court documents. An earlier court proceeding determined that the man, identified by the initials O.C.G., risked persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala, but he also feared returning to Mexico. He presented evidence of being raped and held for ransom there while seeking asylum in the U.S.",
      "Court documents stated the Guatemalan man said he was only told about his deportation to Mexico, essentially as it was happening and that he begged to speak to his attorney but was denied.",
      "\"No one has ever suggested that O.C.G. poses any sort of security threat,\" Murphy wrote. \"In general, this case presents no special facts or legal circumstances, only the banal horror of a man being wrongfully loaded onto a bus and sent back to a country where he was allegedly just raped and kidnapped.\"",
      "O.C.G. entered the U.S. in March 2024, without prior authorization, according to court documents. The man said he had asked for asylum, was denied an interview and was deported shortly thereafter to Guatemala. In April 2024, O.C.G. decided to try again and crossed Mexico where, he said, he was raped and held hostage until a family member paid ransom.",
      "In May 2024, he arrived in the U.S. and was referred to an asylum officer after expressing fear of return to Guatemala. The officer determined he had had a credible fear of persecution or torture and initiated withholding-only proceedings. Two days later, he was sent to Mexico, court documents show.",
      "A message seeking comment was left with the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Murphy's order adds to a string of findings by federal courts against recent Trump administration deportations. Those have included other deportations to third countries and the erroneous deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran who had lived in Maryland for roughly 14 years working and raising a family.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. from a notorious Salvadoran prison, rejecting the White House's claim that it couldn't retrieve him after mistakenly deporting him. Both the White House and the El Salvadoran president have said they are powerless to return him. The Trump administration has tried to invoke the state secrets privilege, arguing that releasing details in open court - or even to the judge in private \u2013 about returning Abrego Garcia to the United States would jeopardize national security.",
      "In his Friday ruling, Murphy nodded to the dispute over the verb \"facilitate\" in that case and others, saying that returning O.C.G. to the U.S. is not that complicated.",
      "\"The Court notes that 'facilitate' in this context should carry less baggage than in several other notable cases,\" he wrote. \"O.C.G. is not held by any foreign government. Defendants have declined to make any argument that facilitating his return would be costly, burdensome, or otherwise impede the government's objectives.\"",

      "According to Planned Parenthood North Central States, the four closing in Iowa include the only Planned Parenthood facility in the state that provides abortion procedures, in Ames, home to Iowa State University. The others are in Cedar Rapids, Sioux City and the Des Moines suburb of Urbandale.",
      "The Planned Parenthood affiliate said it would lay off 66 employees and ask 37 additional employees to move to different clinics. The organization also said it plans to keep investing in telemedicine services and sees 20,000 patients a year virtually. The affiliate serves five states \u2014 Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota.",

      "While federal funds can't be used for most abortions, abortion opponents have long argued that Planned Parenthood affiliates should not receive any taxpayer dollars, saying the money still indirectly underwrites abortion services.",

    "story": [
      "Military air traffic controllers briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter as it neared the Pentagon on a flight that caused two commercial jets to abort their landings in early May at a Washington airport, the Army confirmed to CBS News Friday.",
      "An Army official confirmed that on May 1, the Pentagon tower lost contact with the Black Hawk helicopter for about 20 seconds as it was coming to land.",
      "FAA air traffic controllers at the airport aborted the landing of a Delta Air Lines Airbus A319 during the Black Hawk's initial flight toward the Pentagon because they realized both aircraft would be nearing the Pentagon around the same time, Brig. Gen. Matthew Braman, the head of Army aviation, told the Associated Press in an exclusive interview.",
      "Because of the 20-second loss of contact, the Pentagon's tower did not clear the Black Hawk to land, so the helicopter circled the Pentagon a second time. That's when air traffic controllers at the airport decided to abort the landing of a second jet, a Republic Airways Embraer E170, because they did not have a confident fix on the Black Hawk's location, Braman said.",
      "The Army said in a news release Friday evening that the cause of the lost contact with the Black Hawk is thought to be that a temporary antenna was in a location that did not maintain contact with the helicopter as it was coming in to land at the Pentagon. The Army said its initial review \"found no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic.\"",
      "Braman told the AP that the antenna was set up during construction of a new control tower and has now been moved to the roof of the Pentagon.",
      "The Army said the aircraft's location was continuously broadcast throughout its flight through its Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast (ADS-B) Out system.",
      "In initial reporting on the aborted landings, an FAA official suggested the Army helicopter was on a \"scenic route.\" But the ADSB-Out data, which the Army shared with the AP on Friday, shows the crew hewed closely to its approved flight path \u2014 directly up the I-395 highway corridor, which is called Route 5, then rounding the Pentagon.",
      "Reagan National Airport air traffic controllers had directed \"go-arounds\" for the two commercial aircraft \"out of an apparent abundance of caution,\" the Army said in its statement. The first go-around occurred before the Black Hawk arrived at the Pentagon helipad and resulted from \"an issue with sequencing of air traffic by DCA Tower,\" according to the Army, and the second occurred during the Black Hawk's subsequent traffic pattern and was based on \"conflicting positional data from legacy tracking systems.\"",
      "Braman said federal air traffic controllers inside the Washington airport also didn't have a good fix on the location of the helicopter. The Black Hawk was transmitting data that should have given controllers its precise location, but Braman said FAA officials told him in meetings last week that the data the controllers were getting from multiple feeds and sensors was inconclusive, with some of it deviating by as much as three-quarters of a mile.",
      "\"It certainly led to confusion of air traffic control of where they were,\" Braman said.",
      "The Black Hawk was not carrying any passengers.",
      "The aborted landings on May 1, first reported by the AP, added to general unease about continued close calls between government helicopters and commercial airplanes near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport after a deadly midair collision in January between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter that killed 67 people.",
      "In March, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that helicopters would be permanently restricted from flying on the same route where the collision occurred. After the May 1 incident, the Army paused all flights into and out of the Pentagon as it works with the FAA to address safety issues.",
      "The FAA declined to comment on whether its controllers were unable to get a good fix on the Black Hawk's location because of their own equipment issues, citing the ongoing crash investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "The NTSB Chairman Jennifer Homendy told CBS News on Friday that the agency was not briefed on the Army's findings and only learned about them after reading the report from the Associated Press.",
      "\"The NTSB is leading this investigation,\" Homendy told CBS News. \"That is well known. It is disappointing \u2014 frankly, shocking \u2014 that the Army would choose to release what is clearly investigative information through a media exclusive rather than provide it directly to us.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump says he'll decide soon whether to take Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public \u2014 a move that was vocally sought by Trump ally Bill Ackman.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said this week he may take home lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, winding down 17 years of federal control over two central parts of the U.S. housing market \u2014 a move that was cheered on by Trump ally and noted Wall Street investor Bill Ackman.",
      "Ending the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie \u2014 which guarantee trillions of dollars worth of mortgages \u2014 would be complicated, and critics say it's risky. A plan to do so in Mr. Trump's first term did not come to pass. But the president says he'll decide \"in the near future\" whether to try again, pointing to the firms' return to profitability since their 2008 government takeover.",
      "\"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are doing very well, throwing off a lot of CASH, and the time would seem to be right,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social late Wednesday \u2014 prompting a double-digit rally in shares the next day of both Fannie and Freddie, which trade over the counter rather than on a major stock exchange.",
      "The idea of taking the two government-sponsored enterprises public has drawn some support for years, with advocates arguing Fannie and Freddie could function better if released from federal control. Releasing Fannie and Freddie could also benefit some investors who have bought shares in the firms over the years, betting on an eventual federal spinoff of the mortgage giants.",
      "One of the largest \u2014 and most vocal \u2014 is Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management invested in Fannie and Freddie over a decade ago. The firm is the biggest private holder of Fannie, at just over 115 million shares according to S&P Capital IQ data \u2014 worth over $1.2 billion at Friday's price. Ackman said in an earnings call Thursday that Pershing Square owns about 220 million shares in Fannie and Freddie combined.",
      "Other major holders of the two enterprises include Capital Research and Management Company, which has the largest known stake in Freddie ($350 million) and the second-largest stake in Fannie (over $1 billion), according to S&P Capital IQ. Paulson & Co., founded by billionaire John Paulson, also invested in Fannie and Freddie at one point, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 \u2014 though the size of its current stake is unclear.",
      "Since Mr. Trump was reelected last year, Ackman has publicly pushed on X to end the federal conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie, calling it a good deal for taxpayers that could generate as much as $300 billion for the government. In January, Pershing Square put together a presentation called \"The Art of the Deal\" that made the case in more detail.",
      "\"Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history. I am confident he will get it done,\" Ackman wrote on X in December.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced Wednesday he's \"giving very serious consideration\" to the idea, Ackman responded on X with a thumbs-up emoji. In Thursday's earnings call, Ackman said, \"[W]e're extremely encouraged by the president's announcement.\" Ackman also said Thursday the firm wasn't aware of any plans by the Trump administration to release Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship.",
      "Famous for his sharp-elbowed activist investing strategy and pandemic-era bets, Ackman has made waves in recent months for his political views. He endorsed Mr. Trump in 2024 and has taken aim at the leadership of Harvard University over its handling of Israel-Hamas war protests.",
      "Skeptics of releasing Fannie and Freddie, like Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have pushed back on the idea, warning it could benefit investors at the risk of disrupting the mortgage market.",
      "\"[The president] hasn't come to Congress with any kind of plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2013 and the last thing we need is to privatize them in a way that rewards Wall Street while driving up housing prices for people already struggling to buy homes,\" Warren, a Massachusetts lawmaker and the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement, \"The Trump Administration is committed to strengthening the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to advance the President's mission of restoring the dream of homeownership for all Americans. Any actions under consideration will be carefully evaluated in a safe and sound manner to deliver on the President's historic agenda.\"",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square declined to comment to CBS News. FHFA \u2014 which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 and why could they be privatized?",
      "The government created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 or, more formally, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation \u2014 in the 20th century, with Fannie Mae dating back to the Great Depression. They essentially buy mortgages from lenders like banks and bundle them together into guaranteed mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors \u2014 a space known as the secondary mortgage market.",
      "The point of this work is to bring more money into the nation's residential lending system, making it easier for average families to buy a home. Fannie Mae describes itself as \"the backbone of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\"",
      "For decades, Fannie and Freddie were both publicly traded companies, though many observers believed they operated with an \"implicit guarantee\" that the government would step in if either company wobbled.",
      "But after a mortgage crisis sparked the 2008 recession, the Bush administration bailed out Fannie and Freddie and put them under federal conservatorship to save them from collapse. Since then, the FHFA has effectively controlled the two firms. That arrangement wasn't necessarily supposed to be permanent, but it has lasted for over a decade, with the two companies making billions in payments to the government.",
      "A push for the government to end its conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie has been brewing for years. Some critics view the firms as unfairly dominant in the mortgage industry and believe they fill a role that should be played by the private sector. Other supporters of privatization like Ackman argue it could provide a windfall to taxpayers, partly because, in a holdover from the financial crisis, the government has the right to purchase almost 80% of both firms' shares.",
      "Opponents of privatization argue it could push up mortgage rates, especially if Fannie and Freddie are no longer viewed as backstopped by the government. How that plays out could depend on how the government decides to end the conservatorship, though, and whether it still offers some kind of guarantee. Credit agency Fitch Ratings said it would keep rating Fannie and Freddie's debt similarly to the U.S. government's debt if the firms maintain a federal backstop, but if not, they would be rated separately \u2014 and could slip if their market dominance shrinks.",
      "The risk of higher mortgage costs could be a major stumbling block in an era of elevated interest rates. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg earlier this year, \"anything that is done around a safe and sound release [of Fannie and Freddie] is going to hinge on the effect of long-term mortgage rates.\"",
      "In part for that reason, Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen, said in a note Friday that the firm expects the Trump administration to make changes to Fannie and Freddie at a \"slower and more deliberate\" pace than it has moved on other issues, like tariffs.",
      "\"Tariffs may have impacted the stock market, but they did not result in immediate price hikes at Walmart or Dollar General. By contrast, the price of mortgages will respond to each recap and release development,\" Seiberg wrote. \"That makes the political cost more immediate and gives the President less room to alter positions as he has done on trade.\"",
      "In his first term, Mr. Trump's Treasury Department proposed ending Fannie and Freddie's conservatorship. While the first Trump administration ultimately didn't take this step, it made some changes to how the two institutions operate.",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square called releasing Fannie and Freddie the \"Unfinished Business of the First Trump Administration\" in its January presentation. The firm laid out a possible roadmap to turn Fannie and Freddie into independent publicly traded companies: It suggested holding initial public offerings by 2026 for Fannie and 2027 for Freddie, and then allowing the federal government to sell its stakes over five years.",
      "But it's unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 the Trump administration may pursue the idea. In his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this year, FHFA Director William Pulte said he believed that any end to government control of Fannie and Freddie needed to be \"extremely thoughtful.\"",
      "\"While their conservatorship should not be indefinite, any exit from conservatorship must be carefully planned to ensure the safety and soundness of the housing market without upward pressure on mortgage rates,\" Pulte said.",

    "story": [
      "Four partners at Paul Weiss \u2014 including the high-profile Democratic attorney Karen Dunn \u2014 are departing the law firm, a spokesperson told CBS News, after Paul Weiss drew attention for striking a deal with President Trump to avoid targeting by the federal government.",
      "In addition to Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jessica Phillips and Jeannie Rhee are leaving the 150-year-old firm.",
      "\"On behalf of the firm, Paul Weiss is grateful to Bill, Jeannie, Jessica and Karen for their many contributions. We wish them well in all their future endeavors,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "It's not clear if the four attorneys' departures from Paul Weiss are related to the firm's agreement with Mr. Trump.",
      "Dunn co-chaired Paul Weiss's litigation department, where she is known for representing high-profile clients like Apple and Google. She's also known for her longstanding role in Democratic politics, and has helped lead debate preparations for Democratic candidates for over a decade \u2014 including for former Vice President Kamala Harris last year, The New York Times reported.",
      "Rhee \u2014 who served as managing partner of Paul Weiss's office in Washington, D.C. \u2014 previously worked on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 election. Isaacson and Phillips served as litigators at the firm, according to their bios on Paul Weiss's website.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the four departing attorneys for comment.",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump targeted Paul Weiss with an executive order that sharply limited how the firm could interact with the government, seeking to revoke staff members' security clearances and cut off any federal contracts. The move was part of a wider gambit to punish the president's foes in the legal community, which he claims have \"played an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles.\"",
      "The president's executive order criticized Paul Weiss for employing Mark Pomerantz, who previously worked on the team of Manhattan prosecutors that investigated Mr. Trump. It also took aim at the firm \u2014 and Rhee \u2014 for\u00a0taking on a pro bono case\u00a0involving the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, and criticized Paul Weiss' diversity, equity and inclusion policies.",
      "But that order was later rescinded by Mr. Trump, who said Paul Weiss had agreed to a litany of compromises, like auditing its hiring practices and dedicating $40 million to pro bono legal services on causes that both the firm and the Trump administration agree upon.",
      "The apparent deal between the president and Paul Weiss \u2014 along with similar deals struck by other law firms threatened by Mr. Trump \u2014 proved controversial in the legal community.",
      "Some other law firms chose to sue the administration, arguing the orders were unconstitutional. Judges have struck down Mr. Trump's orders against the firms Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block \u2014 with one federal judge on Friday saying Mr. Trump's Jenner & Block order was unconstitutional and resembled a \"screed\" at some points.",

      "Detroit \u2014 When the National Guard has to be called out for an ice storm, as was the case in Northern Michigan at the end of March, the situation is dire.",
      "At the time, meteorologists couldn't forecast just how much of the region would be encased in ice.",
      "\"While it [the forecast] showed devastating ice, it ended up still being worse than expected,\" said Ahmad Bajjey, CBS News Detroit's chief meteorologist.",
      "Up to 1.5 inches of ice accumulated across large portions of Northern Michigan, knocking down power lines, blocking roads, and damaging homes and businesses. Last month, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer requested federal disaster aid.",
      "Bajjey said he was working without National Weather Service data he usually counts on.",
      "\"We couldn't get true real-world data as often as needed,\" Bajjey said.",
      "At least 13 of nearly 100 balloon sites were cut or reduced when the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE,\u00a0took aim at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration earlier this year.\u00a0  Two of them, one in Michigan and another in Wisconsin, left gaps in data.",
      "Those gaps could have helped during the March ice storm, as well as last week, when dangerous thunderstorms and tornadoes hit Wisconsin, meteorologists say.",
      "There have also been cuts in places like the Rocky Mountains in the western U.S. and \"Tornado Alley\" in the central U.S., where storms get started and move east. One balloon site was also eliminated in the Florida Panhandle\u00a0just days before the start of the Atlantic hurricane season.",

He also studies how artificial intelligence can improve forecasts.  \u00a0 But he says the data received from weather balloons is irreplaceable. He showed CBS News a device used to communicate with a weather balloon.",
      "\"So what this device is doing is reporting back every couple of seconds as we look through the whole column of the atmosphere,\" Allen said.",
      "His research in AI cannot make up for a lack of air pressure and moisture data collected by balloons.",

      "In a statement to CBS on News Friday, a NOAA spokesperson defended NWS forecasting.",
      "\"The National Weather Service is committed to delivering accurate, timely, and life-saving forecasts despite speculation,\" the spokesperson said. \"Through strategic transformation, staff reallocation, and updated service standards, NWS is ensuring resilience and continuity of mission-critical functions. Reports suggesting otherwise are false and disrespectful to the many weather scientists who work tirelessly to produce the best weather data in the world.\"",
      "In the meantime, some meteorologists like Bajjey say they have no choice but to make do with new limitations.   \"This is about public safety,\" Bajjey said. \"It's every single forecast, every warning, every alert, and every update. And this is where it comes from.\"",
      "In an open letter published earlier this month, five living former NWS leaders issued a warning about the impact of staffing and program cuts to the NOAA.",

      "The effort is expected to involve around 500 personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including green-uniformed Border Patrol agents in charge of interdicting the illicit entry of migrants and drugs, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal governments plans that have not been announced.",
      "The sources said the CBP teams would also include members of the agency's Office of Field Operations, which oversees legal entry points into the U.S., and Air and Marine Operations, a specialized law enforcement unit with maritime and aerial assets.",
      "CBP agents and officers assigned to the effort are expected to assist their counterparts in ICE's 25 field offices by supporting immigration enforcement operations targeting immigrants in the country illegally, the sources added.",
      "The effort could start as early as next week, two of the sources said.",
      "As immigration officers, CBP personnel have the legal authority to arrest and process immigrants who are suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. Historically, however, CBP's work has been mainly limited to the Mexican and Canadian borders, maritime sectors and international airports.",

      "Officials at DHS have also asked the Pentagon to allow 20,000 National Guard troops to provide support to interior immigration enforcement operations. The Department of Defense has already deployed thousands of additional active-duty troops to the southern border to help CBP deter illegal crossings.",
      "The effort also suggests interior enforcement operations are taking precedence over efforts at the U.S.-Mexico border amid a historic drop in illegal crossings there.",
      "In President Trump's first three full months in office, illegal crossings at the southern border have reached the lowest monthly tallies ever publicly reported by CBP. They are also likely the lowest levels since the late 1960s, according to historical government data.",
      "Officials have attributed the dramatic plunge in illegal border crossings to measures put in place by Mr. Trump immediately after he started his second term, including an unprecedented policy that has effectively closed the American asylum system on the premise the country is facing an \"invasion.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/noaa-hurricane-season-forecast-2025/",
    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 20:12:56 -0400",
    "summary": "With the 2025 hurricane season starting June 1, NOAA forecasters announced their prediction for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year.",
    "story": [
      "Ten days before start of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced their forecast for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year. The current outlook predicts a 60% chance of an \"above-normal\" hurricane season, with between 13 to 19 named storms. Six to 10 of those are expected to strengthen into hurricanes, and three to five could become major hurricanes, forecasters said.",
      "They estimated there's a 30% chance of a \"near-normal\" season and a 10% chance of a \"below-normal\" season.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, releases its seasonal hurricane outlook each spring. It incorporates research from the Climate Prediction Center, the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service, all branches of the agency.",
      "Acting NOAA administrator Laura Grimm and National Weather Service director Ken Graham presented the findings during a news conference Thursday morning at the Jefferson Parish Emergency Operations Center in Gretna, Louisiana, just outside of New Orleans. They chose that location to commemorate the victims and destruction of Hurricane Katrina, 20 years after that storm devastated the area.",
      "In their remarks, Grimm and Graham each emphasized the technological developments that have allowed NOAA and the weather service to produce forecasts that are more accurate with each passing year.",
      "\"The United States is fortunate to have the worlds best scientists, meteorologists and computer modeling experts,\" said Grimm. \"These experts are constantly learning from current and past events.\"",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until November 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",
      "According to forecasters, there are a \"confluence of factors\" influencing the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the outlook said, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to prepare for the season ahead. The agency may also release an updated hurricane forecast later in the season should their assessment change.",
      "NOAA's forecasting model, the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System or HAFS, is expected to undergo an upgrade that officials believe could increase the accuracy of storm tracking by about 5%.",
      "\"In my 30 years at the National Weather Service, we've never had more advanced models and warning systems in place to monitor the weather,\" said Graham in a statement. \"This outlook is a call to action: be prepared. Take proactive steps now to make a plan and gather supplies to ensure you're ready before a storm threatens.\"",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",
      "Threat of an above-average hurricane season",
      "When researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team published their annual forecast earlier this spring, they also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",
      "Silvers and his team predicted there would be 17 named storms this season \u2014 tropical storms with sustained wind speeds of at least 39 mph. According to their forecast, nine of the storms will grow into hurricanes, with three developing into major hurricanes. That would place hurricane activity at roughly 125% of the seasonal average recorded between 1991 and 2020, according to their report.",
      "\"It's a noticeable and important difference, because it matters for people along the coastlines whenever we have an above average season,\" Silvers said at the time.",
      "The Colorado State report largely attributed the higher activity expected this year to warm sea surface temperatures, which can essentially act as fuel for storms. But the findings also pointed to \"considerable uncertainty\" as to which phase of the ENSO cycle would coincide with the coming hurricane season.",
      "El Ni\u00f1o, the warmer half of the cycle, is often linked to conditions in a section of the equatorial Pacific that disfavor hurricanes, while La Ni\u00f1a, the colder inverse, is considered more conducive to hurricane formation. La Ni\u00f1a conditions ended shortly after CSU released its hurricane forecast and returned to \"neutral,\" a state that researchers said could be favorable for hurricanes to develop in the absence of El Ni\u00f1o.",

    "story": [
      "A new study casts doubt on a phenomenon that was previously believed to show water flowing on the surface of Mars.",
      "Since the 1970s, scientists have studied dark streaks seen on Mars' cliff sides and crater walls. The streaks tend to be hundreds of meters long. Some can last for a long time, while others are more short-lived. Those more short-lived slope streaks, called recurring slope lineae, or RSLS, tend to recur in the same areas from year to year, according to a news release announcing the study.",
      "Some scientists believe the streaks are proof of flowing water on the planet and could suggest the Red Planet is home to habitable environments. Others believe the streaks are caused by dry processes, like rock falls or wind gusts, and said the streaks only appear like liquid remnants because scientists are studying orbital images.",
      "Adomas Valantinas, a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University, and Valentin Bickel, a researcher at Switzerland's University of Bern, used machine learning to study the streaks. The process cataloged more than 86,00 high-resolution satellite images of the slope streaks and RSLs. That created a first-of-its-kind global Martian map showing more than half a million such features.",
      "\"Once we had this global map, we could compare it to databases and catalogs of other things like temperature, wind speed, hydration, rock slide activity and other factors.\" Bickel said. \"Then we could look for correlations over hundreds of thousands of cases to better understand the conditions under which these features form.\"",
      "The analysis, published in Nature on Monday, found that the slope streaks were not \"generally associated with factors that suggest a liquid or frost origin,\" according to the news release. Such factors would include a specific orientation of slopes, high humidity or surface temperature fluctuations.",
      "What the study did find was that the slopes were more likely to form in places that had above-average wind speeds and dust deposition, likely pointing to a dry origin. The slope streaks were more often found near recent-impact craters and could be caused when shockwaves shake surface dust. RSLs are more common in areas with frequent rockfalls or dust devils.",
      "\"Our study reviewed these features but found no evidence of water. Our model favors dry formation processes,\" Valantinas said.",
      "The results of the study cast doubt on claims that slope streaks could be signs of habitable regions. That means that researchers could send rovers or other spacecraft to explore the areas without contaminating the sites.",
      "\"That's the advantage of this big data approach,\" Valantinas said. \"It helps us to rule out some hypotheses from orbit before we send spacecraft to explore.\"",

The celestial send-off on May 31 \u2014 livestreamed with free public screenings in Vienna, Madrid and New York \u2014 also will celebrate the European Space Agency's founding 50 years ago.",
      "Although the music could be converted into radio signals in real time, according to officials, ESA will relay a pre-recorded version from the orchestra's rehearsal the day before to avoid any technical issues. The live performance will provide the accompaniment.",
      "The radio signals will hurtle away at the speed of light, or a mind-blowing 670 million mph (more than 1 billion kph).",
      "That will put the music past the moon in 1 \u00bd seconds, past Mars in 4 \u00bd minutes, past Jupiter in 37 minutes and past Neptune in four hours. Within 23 hours, the signals will be as far from Earth as NASA's Voyager 1, the world's most distant spacecraft at more than 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) in interstellar space.",
      "NASA also celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008 by transmitting a song directly into deep space: the Beatles' \"Across the Universe.\" And last year, NASA beamed up Missy Elliott's\u00a0\"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\" toward Venus.",
      "Music has even flowed from another planet to Earth \u2014 courtesy of a NASA Mars rover. Flight controllers at California's Jet Propulsion Laboratory sent a recording of will.i.am's \"Reach for the Stars\" to Curiosity in 2012 and the rover relayed it back.",

      "Now it's Strauss' turn, after getting passed over for the Voyager Golden Records nearly a half-century ago.",
      "Launched in 1977, NASA's twin Voyagers 1 and 2 each carry a gold-plated copper phonograph record, along with a stylus and playing instructions for anyone or anything out there.",
      "The records contain sounds and images of Earth as well as 90 minutes of music. The late astronomer Carl Sagan led the committee that chose Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Stravinsky pieces, along with modern and Indigenous selections.",
      "Among those skipped was Strauss, whose \"Blue Danube\" graced Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi opus \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"",
      "The tourist board in Vienna, where Strauss was born on Oct. 25, 1825, said it aims to correct this \"cosmic mistake\" by sending the \"the most famous of all waltzes\" to its destined home among the stars.",
      "ESA's big radio antenna in Spain, part of the space agency's deep-space network, will do the honors. The dish will be pointed in the direction of Voyager 1 so the \"Blue Danube\" heads that way.",

      "Everyone else had arrived, but Elon Musk was late as usual. It was the summer of 2015, and a group of men had gathered for a private dinner at Sam Altman's invitation to discuss the future of AI and humanity.",
      "Musk had met Altman, fourteen years his junior, a while earlier and had formed a good impression. President of the famed Silicon Valley startup accelerator Y Combinator, Altman's reputation preceded him. After starting his first company at age nineteen, he had rapidly established himself within Silicon Valley as a brilliant strategist and dealmaker with grand ambitions, even for the land of big\u2011thinking founders. Musk found him to be smart, driven, and, most important, someone who espoused like\u2011minded views on the need to carefully develop and govern artificial intelligence. It was as if, Musk would describe in a lawsuit years later, Altman had mirrored everything Musk had ever said about the subject to win his trust.",
      "For Altman's part, he often said that Musk had been a childhood hero. After the older entrepreneur had shown him around the sprawling SpaceX factory in Hawthorne, California, that admiration had only deepened. \"The thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars,\" Altman wrote later of the experience. \"I left thinking 'huh, so that's the benchmark for what conviction looks like.'\"",
      "Musk had been deeply concerned about AI for some time. In 2012, he'd met Demis Hassabis, the professorial CEO of the London\u2011based AI lab DeepMind Technologies. Shortly thereafter, Hassabis had also paid Musk a visit at his SpaceX factory. As the two men sat in the canteen, surrounded by the sounds of massive rocket parts being transported and assembled, Hassabis raised the possibility that more advanced AI, of the kind that might one day exceed human intelligence, could pose a threat to humanity. What's more, Musk's fail\u2011safe of colonizing Mars to escape would not work in this scenario. Superintelligence, Hassabis said with amusement, would simply follow humans into the galaxy. Musk, decidedly less amused, invested $5 million in DeepMind to keep tabs on the company.",
      "Later, at his 2013 birthday party in the lush wine\u2011growing landscapes of Napa Valley, Musk had gotten into a heated and emotional debate with his longtime friend and Google cofounder Larry Page over whether AI surpassing human intelligence was in fact a problem. Page didn't think so, calling it the next stage of evolution. When Musk balked, Page accused him of being a \"specist,\" discriminating against nonhuman species.",
      "After that, Musk began to speak incessantly about the existential risk of AI. At an MIT symposium, he described AI as probably the \"biggest existential threat\" to humanity and its development as \"summoning the demon.\" He met with publishers in New York, gripped by the thought of writing his own book about extinction\u2011level threats, including AI. Later, at a recurring AI Salon event at Stanford, a young researcher named Timnit Gebru would come up to him after a talk and ask him why he was so obsessed with AI when the threat of climate change was more clearly existential. \"Climate change is bad, but it's not going to kill everyone,\" he said. \"AI could render humanity extinct.\"",

      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",

      "The move was\u00a0cheered by the Trump administration, which has touted\u00a0corporate investment in the U.S. following the rollout of the president' tariffs.",
      "As part of their investment, Apple said it would built a new 250,000-square-foot factory in Houston, Texas where they will produce servers, which have previously been built outside of the U.S. The company hasn't announced any plans to ramp up domestic iPhone production.",
      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",

      "Many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that higher U.S. tariffs are likely to spur an upsurge in domestic manufacturing. That's because companies typically base the decision on where to locate factories more on factors including labor and energy costs, tax rates, political instability and the regulatory environment.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 09:00:42 -0400",
    "summary": "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
    "story": [
      "Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023. Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place \u2014 with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Last week, Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly's Education Committee, called phones \"a cancer on our kids\" that are \"driving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\"",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\"This is a not just an academic bill,\" Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \"This is a mental health bill. It's a public safety bill.\"",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "Teachers and administrators have long known cellphones were major distractions in learning: A\u00a02023 Pew survey showed 72%\u00a0 of high school teachers\u00a0view cellphones as a major problem in their classrooms. And U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has\u00a0issued an advisory\u00a0on the effects of social media on youth mental health.",
      "Aside from academic benefits, cellphone restrictions can assist with social development and creating community at the school, Kim Whitman a parent-turned-advocate told CBS News last year. Whitman, a co-founder of Phone Free, said if schools \"allow phones to be present it's hard for students to connect and create a sense of belonging.\"",
      "More focus on bans throughout school day",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \"a huge win.\"",
      "\"Teachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \"bell-to-bell\" bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group's political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\"That's often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\" Hoffman said.",
      "Some states want districts to set rules",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "Opposition from some parents, students",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\"It was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\"It is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\" Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "Most states provide no funding for laws",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",
      "\"Providing some specific money for this would kind of ease some of those implementation challenges,\" Hoffman said. \"That said, most states have not.\"",

    "summary": "House Speaker Mike Johnson shepherded through Congress President Trump's spending bill, which includes Medicaid work requirements.",
    "story": [
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who shepherded President Trump's \"one big, beautiful bill\" through Congress, said Sunday that the Medicaid work requirements \u2014 which could affect his home state of Louisiana \u2014 have a \"moral component\" to them because people on Medicaid who \"refuse\" to work are \"defrauding the system.\"",
      "\"If you are able to work and you refuse to do so, you are defrauding the system,\" Johnson said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"You're cheating the system. And no one in the country believes that that's right. So there's a moral component to what we're doing. And when you make young men work, it's good for them, it's good for their dignity, it's good for their self-worth, and it's good for the community that they live in.\"",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed the massive bill, which sets priorities for Mr. Trump's agenda for upcoming budgets, by just one vote in the early hours Thursday after an all-night session. The bill is now headed to the Senate, where several Republicans have already voiced concerns, including Sens. Josh Hawley and Rand Paul.",
      "The bill went through intense debate in two committees last week as an alliance of blue-state Republicans and fiscal hawks refused to budge. Given Republicans' razor-thin majority in the House, Mr. Trump went to the Hill on Tuesday to rally the holdouts in the GOP conference.",
      "To pay for some of Mr. Trump's tax reforms, such as extending his 2017 tax cuts and eliminating tax on tips, there are cuts to several programs. Republicans have insisted they are not cutting Medicaid, and reductions in the low-income entitlement program have become one of the most charged parts of the bill. In a closed-door session Tuesday with members of the Republican conference, sources in the room told CBS News Mr. Trump said, \"Don't f*** around with Medicaid.\"",
      "To save money on Medicaid, the final version of the bill puts work requirements on Medicaid, which Johnson has insisted will account for the bulk of any cost-cutting. An analysis by the healthcare nonprofit KFF found that 190,000 people in Louisiana, Johnson's home state, stand to lose Medicaid under new requirements.",
      "Johnson insisted on Sunday that \"we have not cut Medicaid, and we have not cut SNAP,\" the food stamp program.",
      "\"What we're doing \u2026 is working on fraud, waste and abuse, and everyone in Louisiana and around the country understands that that's a responsibility of Congress,\" Johnson said.",
      "He said there are 4.8 million Americans on Medicaid who are \"able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system.\" Calling it a \"moral component\" to put Americans to work, he added, \"when you make young men work, it's good for them, it's good for their dignity, it's good for their self-worth, and it's good for the community that they live in.\"",
      "Johnson also claimed some of those who are on Medicaid and SNAP are undocumented immigrants, although they are not eligible to receive food stamps or Medicaid.",
      "When moderator Margaret Brennan pushed back for Johnson to clarify that his position is that the estimated 190,000 Louisianans who stand to lose Medicaid coverage are \"lazy, not working? That they were undocumented? What about them? How do you defend that they will be losing their benefits?\"",
      "\"No. What we're talking about, again, is able-bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system,\" Johnson said. \"And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all.\"",
      "Johnson said the Medicaid work requirements are \"not some onerous, burdensome thing,\" saying they require recipients to work a minimum of 20 hours a week \u2014 either working, be in job training programs or volunteering in the community.",
      "\"When the American people understand what we are doing here, they applaud it,\" Johnson said. \"This is a wildly popular thing, because we have to preserve the programs. What we're doing is strengthening Medicaid and SNAP so that they can exist, so that they'll be there for the people that desperately need it the most, and it's not being taken advantage of. And this is something that everybody in Congress, Republicans and Democrats, should agree to.\"",
      "But as the bill heads to the Senate for debate, the GOP's Hawley has called it \"both morally wrong and politically suicidal\" to slash Medicaid, indicating brewing opposition to it in that chamber.",
      "Hawley particularly took issue with a cost-sharing measure with Medicaid between federal and state governments, which he said would force those at or just over the federal poverty level to pay as much as $35 for a medical visit. Johnson pushed back on that claim, saying that the House included in the bill a \"modest state-sharing component, so that they'll pay attention to that, so that we can reduce fraud.\"",
      "But as Brennan noted, the bill still has to pass the Senate, and if Senators make the expected changes to the bill, it will have to go back to the House. Johnson said he had lunch with his Republican counterparts in the upper chamber on Tuesday, and he said he reminded them that they are a team.",
      "\"It's the Senate and the House Republicans together that will deliver this ball over the goal line, so to speak,\" Johnson said. \"And I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House.\"",

      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as these new members of the world's most powerful military go forward, are we doing enough to support them? We will talk with some veterans serving in Congress about the value of public service and we will honor those who protected us.",
      "On Capitol Hill, the president's big, beautiful bill squeaks through the House. What kind of impact will some of those tax-and-spend provisions have on Americans? And can they survive the Senate?",
      "We will ask House Speaker Mike Johnson and talk with the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes.",

      "All that and more is just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We have a lot to get to in honor of our military today, but we begin with the passage of what President Trump is calling his big, beautiful bill, and the man who got it through the House, Speaker Mike Johnson, who joins us from Benton, Louisiana.",
      "Good morning to you, Mr. Speaker.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON (R-Louisiana): Hey. Good morning. And I wish a blessed Memorial Day weekend to everybody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Indeed.",
      "Well, you got this massive tax and border bill through, just barely, one vote margin. You pulled an all-nighter.",
      "Among other things, it will eliminate taxes on tips and overtime, put about $50 billion towards the border wall and hiring Border Patrol agents, keep in place existing individual tax rates, create savings accounts for kids with a one-time deposit of $1,000, increase the child tax credit by about 500 bucks.",
      "The \u2013 the bill on this is estimated to be between $4 trillion and $5 trillion over the next decade. How much do you think this is all going to cost?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, that's about the right estimate.",
      "But, at the same time, we have historic savings for the American people, cuts to government to make it more efficient and effective and \u2013 and work better for the people. That was a big campaign promise of President Trump and a big promise of ours, and we're going to achieve that.",
      "So, in the calculation here, there's more than $1.5 trillion in savings, Margaret, for the people. And that's \u2013 that's the largest amount \u2013 biggest cut in government really in at least 30 years and, if you adjust for inflation, probably the largest in the history of government.",
      "So we're proud of what we produced here. We've checked all the boxes, where all the things that you mentioned in existence \u2013 in addition to American energy dominance, investing in our military industrial base, which is appropriate for us to talk about this weekend, and so many other priorities.",
      "And that's why we call it the one, big beautiful bill. I think, arguably, it's the most consequential legislation that Congress will pass in many generations, and it's a long time coming.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, just this morning, we did hear from some of your Republican colleagues over in the Senate, where this heads next, that they can't support the bill as it is written. I think you know this.",
      "Senator Rand Paul said the cuts are \"wimpy and anemic. The math doesn't add up. It will explode the debt.\"",
      "In addition to that political criticism, you've already seen\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Yes, look, Senator Paul and I are\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 Moody's credit rating agency downgrade American credit.",
      "And Goldman Sachs says that this bill will not offset the damage from the president's tariffs. Isn't this an economic gamble?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No, it's not an economic gamble.",
      "It's a big investment. And, look, this \u2013 what this bill is going to do is be jet fuel to the U.S. economy. It is going to foster a pro-growth economy. What do we mean by that? Because we're reducing taxes. We're reducing regulations. We're going to increase and incentivize American manufacturing again.",
      "And what will \u2013 the effect this will have in the economy is that entrepreneurs and risk-takers and job creators will have an easier time in doing that. They will allow for more jobs and more opportunity for more people, and wages will increase.",
      "Now, Margaret, this is not a theoretical exercise. We did this already in the first Trump administration. After just the first two years, we brought about the greatest economy in the history of the world, not just the U.S., because we did it, followed a very simple formula. We cut taxes and we cut regulations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You didn't do it in the middle of a tariff war.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: This time, we're doing that on steroids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In the first administration, there was sequencing.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No. Well\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You got tax reform. The Republicans got tax reform through and held off the tariff war.",
      "Goldman Sachs says, the hit to growth from tariffs will more than offset the boost to growth from the fiscal package. That's Goldman Sachs.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well \u2013 well, I know. I respect Goldman Sachs, but I think what they're discounting here is the growth that will be spurred on by this legislation and the fact that the so-called tariff war is beginning to subside already.",
      "You've got over 75 countries that are negotiating new, more fair trade agreements for the U.S. right now because of the president's insistence that that be done. And it was decades overdue. That is going to benefit every American. It's going to benefit the consumers.",
      "You know, they howled when the first tariffs \u2013 reciprocal tariffs policy was announced. And they said that prices would skyrocket. That simply hasn't happened. Many of those early estimates were far off, and that's being proven now.",
      "So what I think will happen is the tariffs, you know, contest will subside. This legislation will pass and get the economy going again. And people will feel that. They'll see it in their own pocketbooks, in their own opportunity. And every American household is going to benefit by these policies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know Walmart has already said that it will have to raise prices. It's not theoretical. And the president on Friday was talking about even more tariffs, this time on Apple and others.",
      "But back \u2013 back to your end of the \u2013 of the deal here, for this tax relief, you talked about the cuts to pay for it all. You are eliminating subsidized federal student loans, so the government will no longer cover the interest on debt while borrowers are in school. You're eliminating $500 billion in clean energy subsidies and you're terminating early tax breaks for electric vehicles.",
      "Alongside that, you're carrying out about a trillion in reductions to Medicaid and food stamps. We looked at your home state, and the projection is that nearly 200,000 Louisianians will lose their Medicaid coverage because of this. How do you defend that to your constituents?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: We have not cut Medicaid, and we have not cut SNAP.",
      "What we're doing, Margaret, is working on fraud, waste and abuse. And everyone in Louisiana and around the country understands that that's a responsibility of Congress. Just in \u2013 in Medicaid, for example, you've got 1.4 million illegal aliens receiving those benefits. That is not what Medicaid is intended for.",
      "It's intended for vulnerable populations, for young, single, pregnant women and the elderly and the disabled and people who desperately need those resources. Right now, they're being drained by fraud, waste and abuse.",
      "You've got about 4.8 million people on Medicaid right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system. If you are able to work and you refuse to do so, you are defrauding the system. You're cheating the system.",
      "And no one in the country believes that that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: So there's a \u2013 there's a moral component to what we're doing.",
      "And when you make young men work, it's good for them, it's good for their dignity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: It's good for their self-worth, and it's good for the community that they live in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure, but in \u2013 first of all, just undocumented immigrants, you know, are not eligible for food stamps or Medicaid. Some\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: And yet they're receiving them. That's the problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 lawfully present immigrants are.",
      "So the 190,000 Louisianians that are projected by KFF as losing their Medicaid, your position is, they were just lazy, not working, that they were undocumented? What \u2013 what about them? How do you defend that they will be losing their benefits?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: No, what we're talking about, again, is able- bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system.",
      "And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all. By the way, the work requirements, Margaret, is not some onerous, burdensome thing. It's a minimum of 20 hours a week. You could either be working or be in a job program, a job training program\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: \u2026 or \u2013 or volunteering in your community. This is not some \u2013 some onerous thing. This is common sense.",
      "And when the American people understand what we are doing here, they applaud it. This is a wildly popular thing, because we have to preserve the programs. What we're doing is strengthening Medicaid and SNAP so that they can exist, so that they'll be there for the people that desperately need it the most, and it's not being taken advantage of.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: And this is something that everybody in Congress, Republicans and Democrats, should agree to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of your Republican colleagues over in the Senate has been very vocal about his concern in regard to what you're doing to Medicaid.",
      "Josh Hawley has been arguing: \"It is morally wrong and politically suicidal to slash health insurance for the working poor.\" He said the cost-sharing language will force people at or just over the federal poverty level to pay as much as $35 for a medical visit, which means working people will pay more.",
      "How do you defend that? Because you know, in the Senate, they are going to make changes to this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: My friend Josh Hawley is a fiscal conservative, as I am. We don't want to slash benefits.",
      "And, again, I make this very clear. We are not cutting Medicaid. We are not cutting SNAP. We're working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse. SNAP, for example, listen to the statistics. In 2024, over $11 billion in SNAP payments were \u2013 were erroneous. I mean, that's \u2013 that's a number that everyone acknowledges is real.",
      "It may be much higher than that. But here's the problem. The states\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Louisiana is like the second largest recipient of food stamps in the country, sir. So\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Let me explain it, Margaret. Let me explain it.",
      "The states \u2013 the states are not properly administering this, because they don't have enough skin in the game. So what we've done in the bill is add some \u2013 just a modest state sharing component, so that they'll pay attention to that, so that we can reduce fraud.",
      "Why? Again, so that it is preserved for the people that need it the most. This is common sense, Margaret. It's good government, and everybody on both sides of the aisle should agree to that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator Hawley objects to that cost-sharing language.",
      "He is the one leveraging that criticism. This is going to change, you know that, when it goes to the Senate.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Listen, right. So, I\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you \u2013 how do you put Republicans up to have to defend these things, when they are facing an election in 17 months?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: We got almost every vote in the House because we worked on it for more than a year in finding the exact balance of reforms to the programs, so that we can save them and secure them.",
      "I think \u2013 I think Senator Hawley will see that when he looks into the details of what we passed on Thursday. This is a big thing. It's an historic thing, once-in-a-generation legislation. We call it the one big, beautiful bill because it's going to do so much and the America first agenda will be delivered for the people just as we promised.",
      "And, look, I had lunch with my Senate Republican colleagues on Tuesday, their weekly luncheon, and I encouraged them to remember that we are one team. It's the Senate and the House Republicans together that will deliver this \u2013 this ball over the goal line, so to speak.",
      "And I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Yes, well, you have \u2013 you have five to six Republicans from high tax states who are not going to want to see that change in the state and local tax deductions. And there's not a commitment to that in the Senate. Can you still get this through the House without SALT?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Look, we \u2013 there's got to be a modification to SALT.",
      "And, as I have explained to my Senate colleagues many times, you know, they don't have SALT Caucus in the Senate because they're all from red states, but in the House, we do have a number of members who are elected in places like New York and California and New Jersey, and they have to provide some relief to their constituents.",
      "Those are what we call our majority makers. Those are the people who are elected in the toughest districts and help us have the numbers to keep the majority in the House. And so this is political reality. We'd love to cut more costs. We'd love to do even more, but we have to deal within the realm of possibility.",
      "And I think this is a huge leap forward for fiscal responsibility, for a government that's effective and accountable to the people and real relief for hardworking Americans, and they well deserve it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Well, before I let you go, I want to ask you about another provision that was tucked into this bill. Democrats say it is weakening separation of powers and punishing the courts. It's a specific provision that would restrict a federal court's power to enforce injunctions with contempt, unless there was a bond attached to it.",
      "Sounds really weedy, but it's causing a lot of outcry. If this might get stripped out in the Senate anyway, why did you bother to stick it in?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSON: Well, we bothered to stick it in because that's our responsibility in Congress.",
      "It is about separation of powers. And, right now, you have activist judges, a handful of them around the country, who are abusing that power. They're issuing these nationwide injunctions. They're \u2013 they're engaging in political acts from the bench.",
      "And that is not what our system is intended for. And people have lost their \u2013 their \u2013 their faith in our system of justice. We have to restore it. And bringing about a simple reform like that is something that I think everybody should applaud.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, and he joins us today from Greenwich, Connecticut.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-Connecticut): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the speaker. I know you did not vote for this bill. But, you know, Connecticut has one of the highest state and local tax burdens in the country. Do you at least like that one little portion of this bill?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: That one little portion is going to be good for my constituents.",
      "But, Margaret, I \u2013 I got to tell you, it was like listening to \"1984\" or something listening to the speaker. You know, anybody can look this up. The American people want basically three things out of their federal budget. Number one, at this point in time, when Americans \u2013 the wealthiest Americans, are doing better than ever before, Americans want the wealthiest of the \u2013 of Americans to pay more taxes and to give tax relief to the middle class and below.",
      "Number two, they want us to address the deficit, which is now spiraling out of control, to the point where we got a downgrade in one of the U.S. credit ratings. And, third, they want a simpler tax code.",
      "This bill fails spectacularly on all three counts. They're cutting Medicaid and nutritional assistance, food stamps, to tens of millions of Americans in order to preserve tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. They're adding $3 trillion to the deficit with this bill. And, lastly, they're gumming up the tax code with, you don't have to pay taxes on tips. Now, what about the folks who don't earn tips, you know, auto lending?",
      "I mean, again, on the three things that Americans care most about, that they want the Congress to do, this bill fails spectacularly. Look, and that's going to show up in the polling pretty soon, as Americans come to realize what it is that the House of Representatives just did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about your other role on the House Intelligence Committee.",
      "When it comes to what the president has vowed to do to Russia, he floated this idea two weeks ago of possible sanctions if Russia doesn't stop its war in Ukraine. But then he spoke to Vladimir Putin on Monday, and we heard nothing about sanctions. We did hear from the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency that this war is trending in favor of Russia.",
      "What changes need to be made, if anything, to how the U.S. provides support?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, Margaret, look, we're at a fork in the road with respect to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "And, you know, Donald Trump and his acolytes in the Congress will go along with one of these two choices. Either we will continue the trajectory that started when the president and the vice president humiliated Vladimir \u2013 humiliated President Zelenskyy in the Oval Office and paused aid, and Vladimir Putin will learn from that experience that he can count on the U.S. to support his murderous incursions into neighboring countries.",
      "Or we can take another path, which I hope the president will take, which is to say, what we need to do right now is generate maximum leverage against Vladimir Putin, and I see the president getting a little frustrated by him.",
      "But that maximum leverage comes because we really uptick the sanctions, we stop the export of oil, we pressure India to stop buying Russian oil, and, of course, we keep arming the Ukrainians. Again, for this guy who considers himself the master of the deal, maximize the leverage of the West so that we can bring this war not just to a conclusion, but to a fair and just conclusion that will keep the Russians from invading countries in the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In your role on the Intelligence Committee, you get to see things the public does not.",
      "With that in mind, the president has designated this Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, TDA, as a foreign terrorist organization. He says they're invading the country. He's using the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members without a day in court.",
      "Part of the legal justification of all of this rests on the claim that the Venezuelan government is controlling what TDA is doing. The National Intelligence Council assessed the Maduro government does not control the gang.",
      "But, on this program last Sunday, the secretary of state rejected that. He says he favors the FBI's finding, which is that some members of the Venezuelan government do influence the gang.",
      "Why does all of this matter?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, it matters, Margaret, because I will remind you that, in the George W. Bush administration, exactly what is happening right now happened.",
      "It was a different topic. Right now, despite the conclusions of the intelligence community, the president, the director of national intelligence and the secretary of state are saying that Venezuela directs Tren de Aragua.",
      "Now, they're saying that because they need this no due process mechanism of deporting people, the Alien Enemies Act, which, by the way, the courts are now laughing at.",
      "But the reason it matters, Margaret, is because the last time the White House did this, when they were determined that the intelligence community be forced to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which there turned out not to be, 4,400 American servicemen perished in a war that was fought on false pretenses, not to mention, by the way, the many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who perished in that war, which was a catastrophic strategic mistake driven by the politicization, the \u2013 the notion that George W. Bush had that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.",
      "That's why intelligence matters. There's 4,400 families in this country who lost people because the White House decided they would override the conclusion of their $90 billion-a-year intelligence community. That's what Marco Rubio is doing, that's what the president is doing, and that's what Director Gabbard are doing when they contradict what their own organization is telling them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on that point, this is also becoming an issue for Joe Kent, who is the president's nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center.",
      "He's under scrutiny because e-mails show that, while acting as chief of staff to DNI Gabbard, he pressed analysts to amend an assessment of links between the government and TDA.",
      "According to redacted e-mails that my network has obtained, he wrote: \"We need to do some rewriting, a little more analysis so this document is not used against the DNI or POTUS,\" the president of the United States. He says: \"We need to incorporate the FBI's assessment.\"",
      "You have now read these declassified e-mails as well. Do you believe that Joe Kent was just asking for more context?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: No, he absolutely was not. And I have seen the redacted e-mails. He was pressuring the National Intelligence Council to alter their conclusions.",
      "And, look, he gave away the game. You just read the line. He told us why he did that, so that this report would not be used against the president or the director of national intelligence. Think about that. The chief of staff of the \u2013 of the Office of the Director National Intelligence wasn't saying, we need the very best intelligence here. We need you to go back and make sure you're 100 percent true.",
      "He was saying, we need to make sure that your product is not used to embarrass the president and the director of national intelligence. That is the very definition, the very definition of politicizing intelligence. This is not about embarrassing or not embarrassing anybody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Again, back to those 4,400 dead Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: So, no, Joe Kent must never be confirmed for any Senate-confirmed\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Look, it's all out there for the Senate to see. So, no, he may \u2013 he must never be confirmed for any Senate-confirmed position because of what he did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. OK. And those e-mails are available for the public to read as well.",

      "CINDY MCCAIN (Executive Director, United Nations World Food Programme): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In Gaza we have this manmade catastrophe with Israeli authorities blocking the entry of all aid from March until about May 18th. The Trump administration said Israel needs to let in food.",
      "So, are your deliveries consistently now getting through?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, let's start with the fact that this is a catastrophe. And you're absolutely correct, and I'm very grateful that you are covering this issue. They have let a few trucks in. This is a drop in the bucket as to what's needed.",
      "Right now we have 500,000 people inside of Gaza that are \u2013 that are extremely food insecure and could be on the verge of famine if we don't help bring them back from that. We need to get in and we need to get in at scale, not just a few dribble of the trucks. Right now it's, as I said, it's a drop in the bucket.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, how many trucks need to be getting in daily to address the scale of the need you see? And \u2013 and can they get into northern Gaza?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, prior to the \u2013 you know, during the ceasefire, I should say, we were getting in 600 trucks a day. Right now we're getting in maybe 100. Something like that. So, it \u2013 it's not nearly enough. And it needs to be going to the correct places. So, the various gates. It's inconsistent as to how the gates are open. It's inconsistent as to the roads we can use. The roads that are the better roads. The ones that can get us further along aren't open at all much. It's complicated right now. And \u2013 and again, I will tell anybody who will listen, we need to get in and get in at scale and be allowed to feed these people before further catastrophe occurs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your organization announced at least 15 of your trucks were looted when they entered southern Gaza on route to \u2013 to bakeries. Israel has consistently said that the looting is being carried out by Hamas. Have you seen evidence that it is Hamas stealing the food?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: No, not at all. Not \u2013 not in this round.",
      "Listen, these people are desperate. And they see a World Food Programme truck coming in and they run for it. This \u2013 this doesn't have anything to do with Hamas or any kind of organized crime or anything. It has simply to do with the fact these people are starving to death.",
      "And so, we will continue to go in. We will continue to go in with food and the kinds of supplies that we need to help the bakeries operate and make sure that we can continue to do that and \u2013 and hopefully be able to do more of it.",
      "But, again, we can't do this unless the world community puts pressure on this. We can't be allowed to sit back and watch these people starve to death with no outside diplomatic influence to help us. These \u2013 these \u2013 these poor souls are really, really, really desperate. And, you know, having been in \u2013 in a food riot myself some years ago, I understand the desperation very well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, five days ago, Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to take control of all of Gaza, which seems to be a shift from going in, carrying out raids and then withdrawing. We've seen the pope speak out. We've seen the leaders of France, of Canada, of the U.K. calling the cutting of aid egregious. Netanyahu said criticism like that is feeding Hamas and really feeding anti-Semitism.",
      "What do you make of that pushback from him, that criticisms of the state are feeding hate?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: What I do know is they're not feeding people. And the most important part of this is that's what we're supposed to be doing.",
      "I'm very grateful for anyone, the pope, any of the folks that did \u2013 did shout out and say, listen, we need to get more in. But I can't tell you as to what \u2013 exactly what Netanyahu's thinking or anything else.",
      "What I do know for a fact is that we need food to get into Gaza to avoid an utter catastrophe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli army had announced aid will be distributed under what they described as an American plan. Prime Minister Netanyahu said it will be American companies giving food directly to Palestinian families in safe zones secured by the Israeli military. There's reporting in \"The Washington Post\" that these are armed private contractors doing logistics. Palestinians will have to submit to identity checks to be fed. And that would replace the U.N. coordinated networks, presumably also the World Food Programme.",
      "Do you know how much longer you will be allowed to operate in Gaza?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: I have not seen a plan from anybody. We continue to operate doing what we do best. And we are the largest and the best at what we do, I might add. I \u2013 we've never been \u2013 a plan has never been proposed to us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We haven't heard in \u2013 in the press at least from the administration any of the details either. But we do know that the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, announced back on May 9th that this is going to be a U.S. initiative involving only Israeli security. The Israelis are not distributing food.",
      "Secretary Rubio was just in Rome. He said he did meet with you. Did you share with him any of your concerns?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, we had a very frank discussion about exactly what was going on and what we could do to help alleviate a lot of this. Some of it, I'm not sure that they were completely clear on how we operate and the size that we are and the logistics ability that we have to be able to do this. So \u2013 so, we had a \u2013 a very nice discussion. As you know, the Rubio family and \u2013 and the McCain family have been friends for a very long time. And so I was grateful that he would take the time to listen to what \u2013 what we had to say and let us discuss exactly how we feel we should be able to operate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he assure you that the U.S. supports the U.N. and the World Food Programme continuing to supply food in Gaza?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: We didn't really discuss the U.S. participation in any of this. He was really \u2013 really concerned with and really trying to understand how we operate and \u2013 and the need for what exactly what we do. We will work with anybody as long as it feeds people, and feeds people safely, I might add, on the ground and keeps our people and people from other agencies safe as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Executive director of the World Food Programme, Cindy McCain. Thank you for your time this morning.",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Thank you very much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with another McCain. Jack McCain is the son of Cindy and the late Senator John McCain. He's a Navy veteran who served in the Afghanistan War. And he joins us now from Kyoto, Japan.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "JACK MCCAIN (Afghanistan War Combat Veteran): Thank you. I'm incredibly glad to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we know, when you were in Afghanistan, you flew alongside and helped to train some of the Afghan Black Hawk pilots. Why is it important to you now to speak out on their behalf? Are any of your personal contacts there at risk?",
      "JACK MCCAIN: Yes. Basically everyone that we were unable to get out is at risk. These pilots and crew members fought the Taliban toe to toe. And because of that, the Taliban is trying to seek them out for reprisal. Something that they distinctly promised that they would not do.",
      "So, not only are they \u2013 are they in danger, but we owe them a debt.",
      "I believe that I'm vertical and still on this earth because of the efforts of my Afghan pilots and crews. And not only do I owe them personally, but the nation owes them a debt of honor. One that we have yet to repay.",
      "Everyone, interpreters, ground troops, pilots, that worked and fought alongside the United States at our behest should be able to be evacuated here to the United States and should be taken care of.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you were active duty at the time of the very chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. I know you helped to get Afghans out during that period of time. There were a lot of Afghans airlifted out. Who was left behind and \u2013 and what promises were made?",
      "JACK MCCAIN: Yes, the problem is everyone was left behind. Whether it was family members, including family members of U.S. servicemen, whether it was pilots, crews, the people that I worked with, special forces, we did everything we could to get as many as we could out. But due to the chaos of the withdrawal and, frankly, the lack of planning on the part of the United States government, it was up to individuals and sometimes smaller military units to help either, in my case I had to triage who we were going to take out. I had to prioritize operational pilots over pilots in training versus crew members in the back simply because everyone was trying to do everything they could.",
      "So, we have tens of thousands that fought alongside us left behind. Each one of them in danger in their own way. Not to mention family members that can be used as tools of leverage against those that are even here in the United States now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And to that point, under the Taliban right now, the daughters, the wives, the female family members of a lot of these people who worked with Americans are facing some pretty tough conditions. However, this administration just recently said through Homeland Security that it is safe for Afghans to return. So those here could be sent back. Some Afghans who had arrived here and been given temporary protection.",
      "Does what the U.S. government said match in any way what you are hearing is happening on the ground?",
      "JACK MCCAIN: I would disagree with the entire notion that it is safe for anyone, especially if they've been in the United States, to return to rule under the Taliban. Whether they are male, female, young, old, that regime has proven itself to be \u2013 to not only have gone back on every promise they made to us, but to be \u2013 to have no problem using human lives as pawns to imprison, torture, rape, kill, even sell into slavery.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there are a number of veterans of the war in Afghanistan who serve currently as lawmakers in the United States Congress. And it is Congress that sets the number of visas for these \u2013 these special immigrant visas, SIVs. We checked. There are more than 144,000 applicants in the pipeline, but there are only 11,000 visas left. That's not even counting family members here.",
      "Have you gotten any indication from the lawmakers you know that they are going to raise that cap?",
      "JACK MCCAIN: No, I have not. And it is an utter travesty that that is the case. People on both sides of the aisle had \u2013 have served in Afghanistan or have fought alongside Afghans, much like me. And the political theater that has taken place of simply ignoring the problem can only be summarized by the word despicable.",
      "This is an issue of humanity. This is an issue of national honor. And this is a debt that we owe. So, I would urge lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to solve this problem because it is not going to go away. It is your job to legislate, so, please do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's in the hand of lawmakers. That was a problem even during the last administration. Now, though, we have this extra complication where the Trump administration has put in orders to restrict refugee admissions and said the U.S. should prioritize people who can, quote, \"fully and appropriately assimilate and who do not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States.\" That's made it hard for Afghan refugees, family members to enter here.",
      "How do you reassure the public that these refugees are not a risk? Even the vice president of the United States has said he does not trust the vetting of refugees.",
      "JACK MCCAIN: Well, I mean, I think I passed the ultimate test in that I literally put my lives in \u2013 my life in these people's hands. So, not only are they worthy of trust, but they are worthy of our care.",
      "The vetting process has taken place. It continues to take place. And if vetting is the issue, fantastic. Let's pass legislation to solve that problem. Let's make sure everyone up to this point has been vetted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, your father famously said, \"it matters less that you can fight, but what you fight for is the real test.\" I know you feel passionately about this particular issue. Can you ever see yourself entering politics to fight for other issues?",
      "JACK MCCAIN: That's a \u2013 a very interesting question. One that I happen to get asked fairly regularly. And I would say trying to follow his example that the best life is one lived adventurously and in service of a cause greater than one's self interest. I'm doing that. And if someday that does take me to office in service of the nation, then by all means. But to live a life simply focused on the single goal of attaining public office is not in my mind a life purposefully lived, in \u2013 in service in office, it is a purposefully lived one, but that should not be the overriding goal of your life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will continue watching.",
      "Jack McCain, thank you for weighing in on this important issue.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This year, the bipartisan group, led in the past by then Congressman Mike Waltz, went from the House floor, where they had just passed the president's spending bill in an early morning vote, down to the Washington Mall. Cleaning the Vietnam War Memorial may have been delayed, but the mission was not deterred by either lack of sleep or rain.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were up all night. Why did you show up in the rain in your suit to still do this?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE SETH MOULTON (D-MA): Because this is way more important. You know, sometimes people ask me, God, Seth, Washington is a mess today. Is it as bad as Iraq? And every single day the answer is, this is easier than the war. And it's important to keep that perspective.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that the divisions in our country now are in the same place, different from what this country went through around the time of Vietnam, when it was a very divided country?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE SETH MOULTON: You know, I think there are actually a lot of \u2013 a lot of parallels. And one of the lessons that we should learn is to \u2013 to do right by our veterans, if for no other reason we've got to work on coming together. And, you know, it's \u2013 it's difficult when it feels like we've got the divider in chief to quote one of his former officials, at the head of our government right now. But that doesn't mean that those of us in Congress, especially veterans, can't work together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN (voice over): Iowa Republican Zach Nunn spent 20 years as an Air Force intelligence officer as still served in the Air Force Reserve. North Carolina Democrat Don Davis also served in the Air Force and told us that his work as a mortuary officer at nearby Andrews Air Force Base makes Memorial Day especially important to him.",
      "After the wall was cleaned, we talked about their work together on Capitol Hill.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress did give that boost of pay last year to the troops. Is it enough in this economy though? Is the country doing enough?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON DAVIS (D-NC): We know that families are still struggling to make ends meet. Taking care of the day to day, kids, putting gas in the tank. So, it's definitely, I'm sure, not enough. But we are moving, I believe, there with that (INAUDIBLE) in particular in the right direction, not only with pay, but looking at broader quality of life issues, housing, childcare that's available on our installations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: America spends more than any other country on its defense. How is it possible we have this happening to our troops?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ZACH NUNN, (R-IA): We've tried to work together on things that not only help veterans, leading a veteran's suicide bill, assistance to families in the military. I'm proud the bill that we just passed is going to be able to extent a 22 percent tax cut to military families. I'm proud that we got a child tax credit in there. I'm thrilled that we were able to get our bill in there that worked towards giving a family a tax credit for adoption. We've got two adopted kids. This goes a long ways to helping a middle American family, whether you're military or not, be successful going forward.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON DAVIS: But I want to also say, it's important to do all of this for recruitment, retention, addressing quality of life. We recruit families. But also, when I think about being right here, at the Vietnam Memorial, and I think about our service, my service, you don't do it for the money, you do it because you love the country.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ZACH NUNN: That's right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON DAVIS: So, because of that love for the country, realizing that families are fighting for our country, the service members and their families, we have to continue to just look and \u2013 at prioritizing our military families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you tell people now, encourage them to enter public service, at a time when they're being told, even by the federal government \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ZACH NUNN: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The private sector is going to be more rewarding for you?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ZACH NUNN: Look, Margaret, I think you highlight a really important part here. There's a number of ways that people can be called to serve. It's one of the things that I think has actually made us most combat effective in Congress is finding people who are mission oriented, who are working together. I tell my kids, the things that they could potentially learn in the military will echo throughout their entire life. But it's up for every American to make that decision, that pathway.",
      "You're right, less than 1 percent of Americans are serving. That 1 percent distinguishes itself time and time again.",
      "And there's lots of great ways to public service. Don and I have worked together to get more teachers, more nurses, more doctors. There's all great calls to public service. The federal government has a role to play in this, but ultimately it's up to Americans to decide how do they best give back to the communities that they represent? We certainly felt that military service was a way to do it, but I think we came to it in our own pathway.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON DAVIS: Yes, and I would love to say to any young person listening right now that's remotely interested, I had an amazing career serving in the United States Air Force. I love serving our country. And it was definitely a great career for me. And now as a member of the Armed Services Committee, we're doing everything to continue to make sure all of our branches are vibrant and we're doing things to make sure we support them. Give it a shot.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, we talk about the Vietnam War and the memorial behind you. There are it looks like students coming to reflect this morning. Three million people died in that war, 58,000 Americans among them. I wonder this Memorial Day, who are you thinking of?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ZACH NUNN: Look, this isn't ancient history. This is living history. I think of my uncle who flew spotter planes over Vietnam. I think of my dad, who had the choice between enlisting or joining the ROTC program. I also think about my mother, who got \u2013 back home taking care of, you know, at that point, her career as a nurse. Ay aunt, who had two little girls. These are the stories that I think it's so important that young people do have the opportunity to learn about. One, so we never enter this kind of a situation again where we send men and women off to fight and they come back home, not to a hero's welcome, but as a despised class. Peace through strength is a real deterrent. But also knowing that we've got a military that when we commit to fight, we have to go in there knowing that we have a strategy, a plan, and that we're not going to be bringing people home injured, broken or shattered to a country not ready to receive them.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON DAVIS: It's so warming to see young people, kids walking through and looking at the Vietnam Memorial. I think of those throughout my community back home in eastern North Carolina, who I know served our country during Vietnam.",
      "And I go beyond Vietnam. I think of Corporal Ryan Russell, who's from east North Carolina, who was killed in Iraq. And I have a special relationship with his mom, Kathy. And we're doing everything to commemorate those who were killed, not just Vietnam, but in all wars and conflicts so that they know the \u2013 that the families, that we're standing with them. There's a way to get through this, this healing process that so many families are going through, those tears, that they're not alone.",
      "But not only that, but to embrace nationally when we see this, to think about all those who ultimately gave their lives in service of our country.",

    "published": "Sun, 25 May 2025 12:27:15 -0400",
    "summary": "In the past, the U.S. military informed families about the deaths of service members with a telegram. Julie Moore, whose husband served during the Vietnam War, led other Army wives to lobby for a more dignified way of informing families of the fallen.",
    "story": [
      "When Kisha Patterson last spoke to her husband, Esau, it was an ordinary conversation under extraordinary circumstances. \"We talked that morning,\" she said. \"It was like any other day. He was like, 'Hey, I'll call you back.' I was like, 'Okay.' You know, not thinking too much of it, kind of took it for granted.\"",
      "In April of 2004, Army Staff Sergeant Esau Patterson was serving in Iraq. They'd met years earlier in church, at Ft. Benning in Georgia. They got married, had two children, and were planning a family reunion for when he returned.",
      "But then came a knock at the door. \"And there's two uniformed service members standing there,\" said Kisha. \"And they looked at me, and I could see tears in their eyes, and that's when I knew.\"",
      "A car bomb had killed her husband. He was 25 years old. \"I would never get to say goodbye,\" she said. \"I would never get to touch him. I would never get to do anything else.\"",
      "I asked, \"What did it mean to you to have service members there with you?\"",
      "\"It meant that what he died for was okay, that he was truly protecting and serving this country,\" Kisha replied.",
      "Those soldiers were carrying out a solemn duty that had not always been performed. During the Civil War, the military had no formal casualty notification system. Occasionally families would receive a letter. By World War I and through the Vietnam War, the military was sending telegrams, until an Army wife named Julia Moore (known as Julie) stepped in.",
      "\"She completely changed the culture of the military,\" said her son, Greg Moore. \"In 1965, during the Battle of the Ia Drang, death notices were delivered to spouses by telegrams and taxicabs. Cold, cruel, dispassionate. She was outraged.\"",
      "Julie Moore's husband, Hal, was a highly-regarded Lt. Colonel then serving in Vietnam when, as she described in a letter, a taxi driver pulled up to her house: \"When he rang the bell I decided not to answer; that way, everything would be all right,\" she wrote. \"I finally said to myself, 'Come on, Julie, you have to face up to what's to come, so go answer the door.\"",
      "It turned out, the driver needed directions.",
      "Greg Moore said, \"At that moment, she knew what it felt to get that telegram, and she never wanted to have anybody else get that telegram and not have somebody physically with them.\"",
      "So, Julie Moore made a deal with the local Western Union office: they would call her whenever a telegram came.",
      "The 2002 movie \"We Were Soldiers\" portrayed how Julie Moore would rush to comfort the widows.",
      "Even as she cared for her five young children, Moore helped other Army wives on the home front, as she recounted in a 2001 interview: \"I think people forget that these men had families. And these families had problems. And the wives are left alone to deal with them as best they can. And these women were really up to the task. They really were.\"",
      "Together, the Army wives successfully lobbied the base commander. Julie's son Dave Moore said, \"What they really wanted was the Army to make a fundamental change, which they did, in that the Army should take responsibility for delivering these telegrams to the wives and personally care for the spouse during that time of cathartic change.\"",
      "Service members now notify families in person, and offer additional support.",
      "When Army Sgt. First Class Kendrick Ray delivered a casualty notification in 2021, it was a sacred mission. Now, he helps families in the days after. Asked what goes through his mind before he knocks on the door, Ray replied, \"I just said a prayer, like, 'How can I be of service to this family? I don't know what they're going through, but give me strength to, you know, face whatever it is once I ring the doorbell.'",
      "\"I believe now it's my purpose,\" he said. \"I can let people know, like, 'Hey, you're not alone. we're right here with you, every step of the way.'\"",
      "Julie Moore died in 2004. Her husband died 13 years later.",
      "In 2023, the Pentagon renamed Ft. Benning Ft. Moore to honor them both. It marked the first time an American military base had been named for a civilian.",
      "Dave Moore said, \"It's not a legacy she asked for; it's a legacy she built herself towards. And the hero rises to a moment and achieves great things.\"",
      "This year, the Army post was re-named Ft. Benning. But just down the road, at the National Infantry Museum, her name endures.",
      "I asked Kisha Patterson, \"When you think about what she did, what comes to your mind?\"",
      "\"She's phenomenal,\" Patterson replied. \"I can't imagine having received a telegram with that information on it. So, I just thank her. There're husbands that endure this same pain. There are mothers and fathers, there are children that get these knocks. So, she has, yes, she has truly made a difference for all of us.\"",

      "Before Delta, there was Huff-Daland Dusters, started in 1925 in Macon, Georgia. Force said, \"After the first growing season, they realized that most of the center of the business was in the Mississippi Delta region. And so, that's where the name Delta comes from.\"",
      "And in 1929, Delta Air Lines' founder C.E. Woolman expanded the company from pest control to people. Its first passenger flight was from Dallas, Texas, to Jackson, Mississippi, with two stops in Louisiana along the way. A ticket cost $90 round trip \u2013 about $1,700 today. Expensive, and not for everyone. Force said, \"At that time, about 80% of Delta's passengers were businessmen\" \u2013 people trying to speed up a trip that took 12 hours by train to a five-hour flight.",
      "Nearly a century after that first flight, Delta now has more than 5,000 flights a day. The airline has survived mergers, recessions, and bankruptcy, growing from that single route to a nationwide carrier, and the global force we know today.",
      "\"Glamour personified\"",
      "If you've flown Delta lately, you've seen flight attendant Susan Slater in the pre-flight safety video. If you've flown Delta in the last 60 years, you may have shared a cabin with either Slater (who started with the airline on March 2, 1964) or Kay Carpenter (who started in January 1966). It was the \"Golden Age\" of air travel, that romanticized era of flights with exceptional service, extravagant meals, and everyone dressed to the nines.",
      "Back then, said Slater, \"You had to be unmarried. Your hair couldn't touch your collar. You had a weight restriction. Back then I think I weighed 103 pounds and I was 5 foot 2-and-a-half. I'm five feet now, barely, and not 103!\"",
      "I asked, \"What was it about the job that you think spoke to you so much?\"",
      "\"All I knew was that this was glamour personified,\" Slater replied.",
      "Atmosphere Research Group's Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst, says there is no need to be so quite so nostalgic: \"We certainly had a so-called Golden Age of flying back in the early 1960s,\" he said. \"But it was less convenient. There were fewer flights. You often had to connect. And it certainly wasn't as reliable and safe as it is today.",
      "\"We're in the new type of Golden Age now, where flying is a lot more accessible,\" he said. \"You can either buy or create a much nice journey for yourself. You can buy an extra leg room seat. You can pay for priority boarding. And by the way, if you don't need or value those things or perhaps can't afford it, you're not being charged for services that you don't want.\"",
      "Ed Bastian, the CEO of Delta Air Lines, said, \"Air travel is one of the great bargains. If you think about the average fare today versus where it was 30, 40 years ago, it's less than half of what you pay in real dollars.\"",
      "While low fares are sought after by some fliers, Delta has built its business around a premium experience, according to Bastian: \"The single biggest reason why people chose an airline was fare; whoever had the lowest cost won. And Delta, well, yes, we have a product to compete on the lower end. [But] the majority of our revenue comes from higher-end tickets.\"",
      "Their 100th summer is about to take flight, amid clouds of uncertainty \u2026 worries about a slowing economy and aviation safety. But Bastian says it could still be their busiest ever, as he looks to the future.",
      "So, what does he see for Delta's next hundred years? \"When you think in the United States, you know, air travel is relatively ubiquitous \u2013 you jump on a plane almost any hour of the day and get to almost anywhere you want, you know, pretty, pretty easily,\" Bastian said. \"However, when you think about the world, and you realize that only one in five people in the world has even been on an airplane, it's pretty remarkable. We need to figure out ways to make it accessible, to make it affordable, to make it sustainable.\"",
      "I said, \"Part of that legacy is just how much the world has shrunk in those 100 years.\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's what we do,\" Bastian said. \"We make the world a more connected place, a smaller place. And that's needed now more than ever.\"",
      "While Delta helped shrink the world in the 20th century, they hope their own growth continues, thanks to folks like Susan Slater and Kay Carpenter.",
      "\"It's been a wonderful adventure,\" Carpenter said. \"I never dreamed that I would be here for this long. When I started, we had just small airplanes. We flew to small cities. And now we fly to six continents. So, I tell all these new hire flight attendants to always remember that one mile on a highway is going to take you exactly one mile. But a mile on a runway will take you anywhere.\"",

    "story": [
      "Five years after the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, the city is still reckoning with the calls for police reform that followed.",
      "Police Chief Brian O'Hara, who was sworn in two years after Floyd's death in November 2022, has been adamant about implementing changes from within that lead to safer streets and more positive interactions with Minneapolis police.",
      "Still, O'Hara said Floyd's death is still an \"open wound\" in the city. While police data shows shootings are trending down, Minneapolis is one of the few major cities where violent crime has not improved much since 2020, according to an analysis of the Major Cities Chiefs Association's violent crime report. Crime in the city \"skyrocketed\" after Floyd's death and the protests that followed, O'Hara said, while \"the numbers of the police force just diminished.\"",
      "\"People have a very, very basic need to feel safe, and that has been taken away for a lot of people because of everything that's happened since,\" said O'Hara.",
      "The officer shortage continues to strain the department. In 2024, O'Hara told CBS News that the Minneapolis Police Department was short by about 200 officers.",
      "\"I go to these crime scenes. I've been standing there, boys, teenagers, men are dead in the street, and moms behind the crime scene tape wailing, and I'm going through my head thinking, 'We've had so many murders already this week, what happens if someone else dies?'\" O'Hara said. \"We don't have enough homicide investigators. I mean, it's been that critical at times. The urgency of the problem is real.\"",
      "Still, O'Hara is determined to make a difference with the resources he does have. He has focused on \"getting back to the basics\" and ensuring that \"everything we do revolves around both reducing crime while earning trust with the community.\"",
      "O'Hara has also worked to \"restore some pride in this profession\" to try to draw more officers back to the job, and tried to change the culture in the department. Minneapolis police have also adjusted arrest tactics and are working on community engagement and officer training.",
      "\"In my experience, the people who are here today are dramatically different from the impression that I had of this department in 2020,\" O'Hara said.",
      "Earlier this week, the Justice Department announced it was ending investigations of six police agencies and canceling consent decrees proposed for Louisville and Minneapolis. O'Hara\u00a0said that reform efforts will continue, even without the federal oversight. The Minneapolis City Council approved the consent decree in January.",
      "Minneapolis resident Omar Mohammed told \"CBS Saturday Morning\" that he was impressed with the changes he has seen over the past few years.",
      "\"The new chief did a great, great job, because what I see now is, before, police used to pull over everybody, the kids on the street, they used to use a lot of difficult stuff, you know?\" Mohammed said. \"A lot of big things changed, that's what I see.\"",

    "story": [
      "Like Subway's $5 footlong, affordable fast food may soon be a thing of the past.",
      "The average price of fast food in larger U.S. cities is now in the double digits, with the typical meal costing $11.56, according to a new\u00a0report from LendingTree. Prices are highest in San Francisco, where the average fast-food meal costs $13.88, followed by Seattle at $13.48. Columbus, Ohio, has the most affordable fast food, but meals still came to $10.01 on average.",
      "Fast food has long been considered a more economical, if not more healthful, way to eat. Whether it's Wendy's \"Biggie Bag\" or McDonald's \"McValue\" menu, most major fast-food chains offer some sort of meal deal for under $10. But as costs rise and inflation pinches Americans' wallets, the cost of burgers, fries and chicken nuggets may be slipping out of reach for many consumers.",
      "A FinanceBuzz analysis\u00a0found last year that average fast-food prices have risen between 39% and 100% over the last decade. For example, a McDouble sandwich that cost $1.19 in 2014 would easily cost more than $3 in 2024, the personal finance site found.",
      "Thirty-nine percent of Americans expect to spend less on dining given heightened uncertainty about the economy, according to a recent Bankrate survey.",

      "\"Heightened anxiety\" about the economy is weighing on lower- and middle-income Americans, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a May 1 earnings call.",
      "Among the consumers who may be struggling with the cost of fast food \u2014 the low-income employees who make it. The average hourly wage for fast-food workers is $15.07, according to LendingTree. That means it takes workers more than two times longer than someone on an average wage in the U.S. to earn enough to afford a typical fast-food meal, while factoring in the cost of other living expenses.",
      "\"No one has ever expected to get rich off of fast-food wages, but the fact that these workers can't even expect a livable wage is troubling,\" LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz said in the report.",
      "LendingTree found that a fast-food worker who purchased three meals a day from their employer, seven days a week, would end up spending 40% of their salary on average \u2014 leaving them with just 60% of their paycheck to live on.",

The talks, however, failed to produce a ceasefire between the warring countries.",

      "\"These were deliberate strikes on ordinary cities,\" Zelenskyy posted on social media, adding that Sunday's targets included Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Chernihiv, Sumy, Odesa, Poltava, Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Cherkasy regions.",
      "\"Without truly strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped.

      "The number of aid trucks being allowed to enter Gaza last week is only a \"drop in the bucket\" of what is actually needed to stave off potential famine in the territory, the head of the U.N. World Food Program said.",
      "Cindy McCain, the program's executive director, warned that the blockade by Israel of Gaza \u2013 which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says is to pressure Hamas into releasing the rest of the hostages \u2013 has caused a catastrophe for the 2.3 million Palestinians living there.",

      "In March, Israel ended a ceasefire and renewed its offensive in the territory, vowing to destroy Hamas and bring home the hostages Hamas still holds from the Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that triggered the war.

      "Israel also blocked the import of all food, medicine and fuel for 2 \u00bd months before allowing a small number of aid trucks to enter in the last few days. The move only came after warnings from experts of a famine in Gaza and after pressure from some of Israel's top allies, including the United States.",

      "Noboa, 37, who wore a presidential sash over his chest, was sworn in alongside his Vice President Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Pinto, and their terms will run until May 2029.",
      "The young president, who has become known for his fight against a surge of armed group violence in the South American country, pledged in his inauguration speech to continue to tackle corruption, drug trafficking and violent crime. He also swore to implement reforms and said he would lay \"a solid foundation for job creation and investment\" by working with Ecuador's private sector.",
      "\"We are at the doorstep of four years of progress,\" he said.",
      "The ceremony in the capital, Quito, was attended by Health Secretary Robert Kennedy, Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, and many other international guests and delegates.",
      "A U.S. intelligence assessment completed before the election concluded that a win for Noboa against challenger Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez would better serve U.S. interests over the next four years. The Trump administration has been mulling over establishing a permanent U.S. military presence in the South American country.",
      "Noboa was first\u00a0elected as president in November 2023 at age 35, with little political experience. He unexpectedly entered the race and was elected to complete the term of his predecessor, Guillermo Lasso, who had dissolved the Assembly and stepped down to avoid impeachment.",
      "Noboa was re-elected on April 13 in a run-off against left-wing candidate Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez, who has made repeated allegations of electoral fraud. Her Citizen Revolution party, led by former president Rafael Correa, boycotted Saturday's ceremony, even though Gonz\u00e1lez claims were rejected by Ecuador's electoral authority and both national and international observers.",
      "Violence and high unemployment levels remain the biggest challenges facing the president and his National Democratic Action party, which was also able to hold the majority in the country's congress through a number of political alliances.",
      "Maintaining that majority will be crucial for Noboa in pushing through his agenda, including a crime-fighting bill marked as \"urgent\" for its economic implications. The proposal has already drawn criticism from the opposition.",
      "Juan Francisco Camino, a professor at the Equinoctial Technological University, said Noboa's tight majority could easily shift the balance.",
      "\"Just one lost vote from his allies could paralyze his plans,\" Camino said in an interview.",
      "Asked whether Noboa might change his governing approach in this new term, Camino predicted continuity, especially with the government's focus on using state power to fight crime, which he said \"sells legitimacy.\"",
      "Ecuador is one of the most dangerous countries in the region, with around 8,000 violent deaths by the end of 2024 and crime continuing to rise in 2025. Last year, masked men broke onto the set of a public television channel in\u00a0Ecuador,\u00a0waving guns and explosives during a live broadcast and the president issued a decree declaring that the country had entered an \"internal armed conflict.\"",
      "Camino stressed that Noboa must \"look beyond security\" and focus on rebuilding Ecuador's social fabric, especially in areas like jobs, healthcare, and education.",
      "Others said it was important to focus on root causes of violence, like lack of opportunities which often pushes young people to join criminal groups. Only 33% of Ecuadorians had full-time jobs as of late last year, with the rest working in the informal economy.",

      "In that case, cartel members fought security forces who had arrested Ovidio Guzman, a son of Sinaloa cartel co-founder Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman.",
      "Mexican authorities controversially released Ovidio Guzman at the time, saying they wanted to avoid further bloodshed. But he ultimately was re-arrested in 2023 and extradited to the United States, where he remains in custody.",
      "Earlier this month, Harfuch confirmed that 17 family members of cartel leaders crossed into the U.S. recently as part of a deal between Ovidio Guzman and the Trump administration.\u00a0 El Chapo's ex-wife, Griselda Lopez Perez, and her daughter were among the family members to enter the U.S.,\u00a0local media reported.",
      "Mexican press reports said Figueroa belonged to a Sinaloa cartel faction run by the sons of the older Guzman, who is serving a life sentence in the United States.",
      "This group has been fighting another faction led by heirs of cartel co-founder Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, who was lured to the United States in a sting operation in 2024 and arrested.",
      "The newspaper Reforma said Figueroa was head of security for the faction led by Guzman's sons \u2014 known as the Chapitos. According to a 2023 indictment by the U.S. Justice Department, the Chapitos and their cartel associates used corkscrews, electrocution and hot chiles to\u00a0torture their rivals\u00a0while some of their victims were \"fed dead or alive to tigers.\"",

Furthermore, stating he believed their experiences were \u2018completely natural.\u2019 Kid Cudi\u2019s recount of decade-old allegations also assisted the defense, which was supported by the Judge sustaining an objection by the defense when it came to a speculative statement that Mr. Combs committed burglary and/or arson.\"",

      "\"It flows through the ventricles and then around the surface of the brain and spinal cord, where it is then reabsorbed.\"",

      "A skydiver lost his iPhone during a 14,000-foot fall, but the phone miraculously survived without a scratch.",
      "Fingerprint sensors have been around for quite some time, and they\u2019ve become a standard feature in most smartphones. Apple introduced Touch ID on the iPhone 5s in 2013. Since then, it has appeared on 12 major iPhone models (and some iPads as well).",
      "Though Apple removed it from most phones after the iPhone 8, it\u2019s still found in the iPhone SE series. On the flip side, almost every Android phone on the market has a fingerprint scanner. But are fingerprint scanners impossible to bypass? Frank from Deerton, Michigan, asked a similar question that I want to highlight and address because it helps all of us:",
      "\"Can a website be hacked/compromised with password and fingerprint protection (multiple verification)?\"",
      "I get what you\u2019re saying, Frank. You\u2019d think that since a fingerprint scanner literally requires your fingerprint, it couldn\u2019t be bypassed. But you\u2019d be wrong. While fingerprint scanners are generally more secure than facial recognition and passwords, they\u2019re not foolproof. In fact, there are several ways bad actors can bypass them to steal your identity.",

      "A smartphone on a table\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5 ways bad actors can bypass fingerprint scanners",
      "There are multiple ways hackers use to bypass fingerprint scanners. Below, I will discuss five of the more prominent methods.",
      "Hackers exploit the concept of \"masterprints,\" which are fingerprints engineered to match multiple individuals' prints. Researchers at\u00a0NYU Tandon developed \"DeepMasterPrints\" using machine learning to generate synthetic fingerprints that can deceive sensors by mimicking common fingerprint features. These artificial prints can match with a significant percentage of stored fingerprints, especially on devices with less stringent security settings.",
      "Another trick hackers use is making fake fingerprints. They can lift prints off things you\u2019ve touched and then use stuff like fabric glue or even 3D printers to make molds. For example,\u00a0researchers at Cisco Talos tried out a bunch of different ways to do this using 3D printing and tested them on phones like the iPhone 8 and Samsung S10; laptops like the Samsung Note 9, Lenovo Yoga and HP Pavilion X360; and even smart gadgets like padlocks.",
      "On average, the fake fingerprints worked about 80% of the time. They were able to fool the sensors at least once. Interestingly, they couldn\u2019t crack the biometric systems on Windows 10 devices, but they pointed out that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean those are more secure. It just means this particular method didn\u2019t work on them.",
      "19 BILLION PASSWORDS HAVE LEAKED ONLINE: HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF",
      "Attackers have found a cheap way to break into smartphones by brute force fingerprint authentication. The method, called BrutePrint, lets attackers get around the usual limits that stop too many failed fingerprint attempts. It works by taking advantage of two previously unknown flaws in the fingerprint system. These flaws, named Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and Match-After-Lock (MAL), exist because of weak protection for fingerprint data on a part of the hardware called the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).",
      "Basically, BrutePrint uses a hardware-based man-in-the-middle attack to hijack fingerprint data. It sits between the fingerprint sensor and the phone\u2019s secure area (called the Trusted Execution Environment) and tries as many fingerprint images as needed until it finds a match. The relieving part is that the attacker needs to have physical access to the phone for this method to work.",
      "PrintListener is a side-channel attack that captures the sound of a finger swiping on a screen to extract fingerprint features. It might sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, but researchers have already built a proof of concept. By analyzing the friction sounds, attackers can reconstruct fingerprint patterns, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of masterprint attacks.",
      "Some devices store fingerprint data without adequate encryption. If attackers gain access to this unprotected data, they can replicate fingerprints to bypass authentication. For example, in 2024, a misconfigured server exposed nearly 500 GB of sensitive biometric data, including fingerprints, facial scans and personal details of law enforcement applicants.",

      "So, can you trust fingerprint scanners?",
      "Fingerprint scanners make it easy and fairly secure to unlock your devices. Since everyone has unique fingerprints, you don\u2019t need to remember complicated passwords. Just a quick touch and you are in. Most modern devices store your fingerprint data in secure parts of the system, and they use things like liveness detection to make sure someone is not trying to trick the scanner with a fake finger.",
      "Still, no security method is perfect. Skilled attackers have found ways to get past fingerprint scanners using high-resolution photos or 3D-printed fingers or by taking advantage of flaws in how the scanner communicates with the rest of the device. The risk really depends on how well the scanner is designed and how much effort someone puts into breaking it. For most people, fingerprint authentication is quick, easy and secure enough. However, if you are dealing with very sensitive information, relying only on biometrics might not be the best idea.",

      "Safeguard your biometric identity with these essential security measures.",
      "1. Choose trusted phone brands:\u00a0If you're buying a phone, stick with well-known brands like Apple, Samsung or Google. These companies take extra steps to protect your fingerprint data by storing it in secure areas of the phone that are harder to access. Cheaper or lesser-known brands may not have these protections, which makes it easier for attackers to steal your data.",
      "2. Keep your phone updated:\u00a0Phone updates are not just about new features. They fix security problems that hackers might use to break into your device. If your phone asks you to install an update, do it. Most phones also let you turn on automatic updates, so you don\u2019t have to worry about remembering. Keeping your software updated is one of the easiest and most important ways to stay protected.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Install strong antivirus software to detect malware that could compromise biometric data storage.\u00a0Strong antivirus software offers real-time threat detection, anti-phishing and privacy features to block unauthorized access to fingerprint data. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "4. Don\u2019t rely only on your fingerprint:\u00a0Using a fingerprint to unlock your phone is convenient, but it shouldn\u2019t be your only line of defense, especially for sensitive apps like banking or email. Always set up a PIN, password or pattern as a backup on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android. This way, even if someone manages to copy your fingerprint, they still need another piece of information to get in.",
      "5. Be careful about who handles your phone:\u00a0If someone else uses your phone, especially a stranger or someone you don\u2019t know well, they might be able to copy your fingerprint from the screen. It\u2019s rare, but it happens. To reduce this risk, avoid handing your phone to people unnecessarily and wipe your screen occasionally to remove any clear fingerprints.",
      "6. Only use fingerprint login with trusted apps:\u00a0Not every app that asks for your fingerprint is trustworthy. It\u2019s safest to use fingerprint login only with apps from known and reliable companies, like your bank, phone manufacturer or email provider. If an unfamiliar app asks for fingerprint access, it\u2019s better to skip it and use your password instead.",
      "7. Consider using a personal data removal service: Even fingerprint scanners can be bypassed, and large amounts of personal and biometric data have been exposed in breaches. Using a personal data removal service helps reduce your risk by removing your sensitive information from public databases and data broker sites, making it harder for hackers to piece together details that could be used to steal your identity.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "WHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Passwords are generally easier to hack than biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition. However, the key difference is that passwords can be changed if they\u2019re compromised. Your biometrics cannot. Most modern devices allow both options, and biometrics can offer an extra layer of security by making it harder for someone else to access your phone or apps. They're also fast and convenient, since you don\u2019t need to remember or type anything. That said, in most cases, your device still falls back on a password or PIN when biometric identification doesn\u2019t work, so both systems often go hand in hand.",

    "story": [
      "From face recognition to dynamic lock, there are options you may be unfamiliar with.",
      "Passwords are outdated, and it's time for both tech companies and users to move on. There, I said it. Like it or not, the weakest link in cybersecurity is anything that relies on human input. While organizations continue to invest in firewalls and endpoint security, the most persistent vulnerability remains the human password.",
      "The internet has long struggled with poor password practices, but a recent discovery highlights just how serious the problem is.",
      "Security researchers have uncovered more than 19 billion newly leaked passwords, collected from hundreds of breaches between April 2024 and April 2025. An astonishing 94% of these passwords were either reused, predictable or both.",

      "What you need to know",
      "Between April 2024 and April 2025, data from nearly 200 separate cybersecurity incidents became publicly available, as discovered by\u00a0Cybernews. These were not isolated events. They involved massive leak repositories including combolists, stealer logs and compromised databases. In total, over 3 terabytes of raw leaked data were analyzed, comprising more than 19 billion passwords. Only 6 percent of these, just over 1.1 billion, were unique.",
      "Among the most used passwords, \"123456\" appeared in over 338 million instances. Words like \"Password\" and \"admin\" followed close behind, despite years of public warnings. Such defaults often originate from devices like routers or enterprise tools, where they are rarely changed and frequently reused elsewhere.",
      "1.7 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED ON DARK WEB AND WHY YOURS IS AT RISK",
      "Personal names remain a common pattern as well. The name \"Ana\" appeared in nearly 179 million passwords, followed by countless other first names and name-based combinations. Pop culture, food, cities and even swear words were frequent themes. Words like \"Mario,\" \"love,\" \"pizza,\" \"Rome\" and various profanities were not just creative choices. They are now security liabilities.",
      "Even worse, attackers do not need to guess anymore. They have automation. Credential stuffing tools now run through billions of known passwords across hundreds of platforms, breaching accounts at success rates as high as two percent. That equates to thousands of compromised profiles, bank accounts, emails and cloud tools every single day.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "The bigger problem",
      "According to CyberNews researcher Neringa Macijauskaite, the core issue is not just weak passwords but how often they are reused. Only six percent of passwords are unique. For most users, security depends entirely on\u00a0two-factor authentication, if it is enabled at all.",
      "Most passwords fall between eight to 10 characters, with eight being the most common. Around 27 percent of them contain only lowercase letters and digits, making them highly vulnerable to brute force attacks. Less than 20 percent use a mix of cases and numbers, and only a small fraction includes symbols.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Despite widespread education efforts, user habits remain stagnant, but one positive trend has emerged. In 2022, only one percent of passwords used a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols. Now that figure has grown to 19 percent, likely driven by stricter password requirements across platforms.",

      "Four ways to stay safe from password-stealing scammers",
      "Protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are four effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your password is stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links:\u00a0Infostealer malware is the root cause of why your password is out there. It often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "4. Consider a personal data removal service:\u00a0These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "When it comes down to it, passwords just aren't cutting it anymore. The sheer number of leaked passwords and the fact that so few are unique show how vulnerable we really are. Cybercriminals are getting smarter and faster, but we don't have to make it easy for them. By using password managers, enabling two-factor authentication, keeping our software updated and considering extra privacy tools, we can take back some control over this situation. It might take a little effort to change old habits, but the peace of mind you get is worth it.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier has the latest on the Murdoch Children's Research Institute's partnership with the Gladstone Institutes for the \"Decoding Broken Hearts\" initiative on \"Special Report.\"",
      "Imagine having a tireless guardian watching over you during your subway commute. It notices every detail with steady focus, all with one goal in mind: keeping you safe on the subway.",
      "New York City's subway system is testing artificial intelligence to boost security and reduce crime. Michael Kemper, a 33-year NYPD veteran and the chief security officer for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which is the largest transit agency in the United States, is leading the rollout of AI software designed to spot suspicious behavior as it happens.",

      "New York City subway (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How AI surveillance will work in the New York City Subway",
      "The AI system will analyze real-time camera feeds across subway platforms and train cars to detect unusual or potentially dangerous behaviors. Instead of identifying individuals, the technology focuses on behavior patterns that might signal trouble, such as erratic movements or confrontations. When the AI flags something suspicious, it can alert transit police to respond quickly, which could help prevent crimes before they escalate.",
      "Currently, about 40% of subway cameras are monitored live by staff. The AI aims to expand this coverage without needing additional personnel, which could enhance safety across the system. While details about the AI providers and full deployment timelines have not been shared, the MTA emphasizes that facial recognition technology will not be part of this system. This is intended to protect rider privacy.",

      "Crime in NYC subways has seen ups and downs over recent years. While major crimes dropped by about 7.7% through mid-2024, assaults have unfortunately increased. To bolster safety, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul deployed 1,000 National Guard members to support transit police efforts. AI technology is viewed as a complementary tool in this broader strategy to keep subways safe, not a standalone solution.",

      "Is AI being used in public transit elsewhere?",
      "New York is not alone in exploring AI for transit security. Cities like Los Angeles and Chicago have experimented with AI-powered cameras for tasks ranging from weapons detection to issuing parking citations. These initiatives reflect a growing interest in using technology to enhance public safety in transit environments.",

      "While the promise of AI surveillance is encouraging, several questions remain unanswered. We do not yet know exactly which behaviors the system will flag or how effective it will be in practice. Perhaps more importantly, privacy advocates and civil liberties groups warn about potential biases in AI systems and the risk of false positives that could unfairly target certain groups.",
      "The MTA's decision to exclude facial recognition is a positive step, but ongoing transparency and oversight will be crucial. Michael Kemper's extensive experience leading the NYPD's Transit Bureau, where he helped reduce subway crime, adds credibility to the initiative. Still, as this technology rolls out, balancing safety with privacy and fairness will be key to earning public trust.",

      "1. Check the source and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Look for verified pages and official websites. Scammers often copy the names and logos of trusted brands, but the web address or page details may be off. Always double-check the URL for slight misspellings or extra characters and avoid clicking links in ads if you're unsure about their legitimacy.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be skeptical of deals that seem too good to be true:\u00a0If an ad offers products at an unbelievable price or promises huge returns, pause and investigate before clicking. Scammers often use flashy discounts or urgent language to lure people in quickly. Take a moment to think before you act, and remember that if something sounds impossible, it probably is.",
      "3. Research the seller:\u00a0Search for reviews and complaints about the company or individual. If you can't find any credible information, it's best to avoid the offer. A quick online search can reveal if others have reported scams or had bad experiences, and legitimate businesses usually have a track record you can verify.",
      "4. Consider using a personal data removal service:\u00a0There are companies that can help remove your personal info from data brokers and people-search sites. This means less of your data floating around for scammers to find and use. While these services usually charge a fee, they can save you a lot of time and hassle compared to doing it all yourself. Over time, you might notice fewer spam calls, emails and even a lower risk of identity theft.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5. Never share sensitive information:\u00a0Don't enter your credit card or bank details on unfamiliar sites. If you're asked for personal information, double-check the legitimacy of the request. Scammers may ask for sensitive data under the guise of \"verifying your identity\" or processing a payment, but reputable companies will never ask for this through insecure channels.",
      "6. Keep your devices updated: Keeping your\u00a0software updated adds an extra layer of protection against the latest threats. Updates often include important security patches that fix vulnerabilities hackers might try to exploit. By regularly updating your devices, you help close those security gaps and keep your personal information safer from scammers and malware.",
      "7. Report suspicious ads:\u00a0If you see a scam ad on Facebook or Instagram, report it using the platform's tools. This helps alert others and puts pressure on Meta to take action. Reporting is quick and anonymous, and it plays a crucial role in helping platforms identify patterns and remove harmful content.",
      "8. Monitor your accounts:\u00a0Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized transactions, especially after making online purchases. Early detection can help you limit the damage if your information is compromised, and most banks have fraud protection services that can assist you if you spot something suspicious.",
      "By following these steps, you can better protect yourself and your finances from online scams. Staying alert and informed is your best defense in today's digital world.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The mess with scam ads on Meta's platforms shows why it's important to look out for yourself online. Meta says it's working on the problem, but many people think it's not moving fast enough. By staying careful, questioning suspicious offers and using good security tools, you can keep yourself safer. Until the platforms step up their game, protecting yourself is the smartest move you can make.",

      "Removing your personal information from people-search sites can feel pretty overwhelming. There are hundreds of these sites in the U.S. alone. In fact, the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse says there are over 500 companies that collect and sell personal information.",
      "At first, it might seem impossible to get your details removed from all of them. But here's the good news: You don't need to tackle every single site. Your information isn't on all 500-plus sites.",

      "First, find which people-search sites have your info",
      "The process will be easier if you have a list of people-search sites that have your personal information. Not only can you check them off as you go, but you'll also need a list for the last step. The easiest place to start is with a\u00a0free scan that some data removal services provide. These scans automatically check a ton of people-search sites for your personal information and send you a report. You can also search for your full name on Google. This will probably bring up a mix of results, including your social media profiles.",
      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR DATA YOURSELF? HERE'S WHY YOU'RE PROBABLY WRONG",
      "The bigger your online presence, the more search results you'll likely have to sift through to find the people-search sites. I recommend searching for your name together with other personal details, like your email, phone number or home address. For some reason, this is more likely to bring up people-search sites, different ones depending on the combination of personal details you try. You may not be able to find all the people-search sites that have your info like this, though. You should also check any state-specific people-search sites, like\u00a0StateofFlorida.com, and search all of the most popular people-search sites like:",

      "Follow the opt-out process for each site",
      "Every people-search site has its own opt-out process, but most of them will require you to do something like this:",
      "Find your listing:\u00a0You'll usually need to search for your name, phone number, address or email on the site.Submit a removal request:\u00a0Most sites have an online form where you can request removal.

      "Pro tip: Use a separate email address for opt-out requests",
      "Many sites require email verification. Using your regular email can expose it to spam or further data collection. Creating a dedicated or alias email address just for these requests helps protect your primary inbox and keeps things organized. Also, using various email aliases makes it so you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach.\u00a0An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",
      "A woman working on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Phone verification and a secondary number",
      "If a site requires phone verification, consider using a secondary number to avoid exposing your personal phone number. Services like\u00a0Google Voice can provide you with a secondary number that you can use for online activities, keeping your primary number private. The process should take between five and 20 minutes for each site on your list, depending on how difficult they make it for you. But once you submit the request, removal is usually pretty quick. Your information should be off the site within 24 hours to a week, though it can sometimes take up to 30 days.",
      "Don't forget about Google search results",
      "People-search sites aren't the only places your info can pop up. Sometimes your personal info appears directly in Google search results, pulled from public records or other sites. If you find sensitive info in Google results, you can request removal through Google's own removal tools, especially if the info includes things like your Social Security number, bank account info or images you don't want to be public. This is a separate process, but it is worth doing alongside removing info from people-search sites.",
      "Google Search image (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK",
      "Keep in mind, this isn't a one-and-done deal",
      "Even after you remove your info, there's a good chance it'll show up again. People-search sites constantly scrape public records and other databases to refresh their listings. Some sites offer \"suppression lists\" you can add your name to, but it's not a perfect system. Small changes, like a slightly different address, a new phone number or a missing middle name, can slip past their filters and pop up as a \"new\" profile.",
      "The best way to stay on top of it is to set a reminder to recheck the main people-search sites every few months and repeat the opt-out process when needed. Maintaining a detailed tracker or spreadsheet with the sites you've contacted, dates and confirmation info can make this easier and help you avoid missing any sites.",

Many of these laws require companies to honor requests to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal data, and some even require businesses to respect browser-based global opt-out signals. But even if you don't live in one of these states, you should still submit removal requests. Most people-search sites do not filter opt-out requests by state; they generally process any request they receive to avoid potential legal issues, regardless of your location.",
      "If this sounds like too much work, there's help",
      "Removing your data manually takes real time and commitment, especially since you have to keep doing it to stay off these sites. That's why many people turn to personal data removal services. Instead of going site by site yourself, a service can automatically send removal requests on your behalf, track the responses and re-request removals if your data reappears later.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Manual removal is free and gives you full control, but it takes time and requires ongoing effort. Automated services cost money but save you time, handle rechecks and can catch new listings faster. Choose what best fits your budget and privacy needs. If you follow these steps and stay consistent, you can take back control of your personal information online. It might take some work, but every removal counts toward protecting your privacy.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses how users can keep their genetic data safe amid DNA testing company 23andMe's bankruptcy sale.",
      "The state of cybersecurity in the healthcare industry worries me a lot. Healthcare organizations, whether nonprofit or for-profit, collect an enormous amount of data. And it's not just phone numbers, addresses or emails but also sensitive information like medical records, insurance details and more. This data is extremely valuable, which makes it a prime target for hackers.",
      "What's worse is that many healthcare institutions often neglect cybersecurity and treat it as an afterthought. In 2024 alone, an industry tracker recorded 1,160 healthcare breaches that exposed 305 million patient records. This marked a 26% increase compared to the previous year.",
      "Against this backdrop, Ascension, a Missouri-based Catholic health system with 142 hospitals and 142,000 employees, recently disclosed that a December 2024 breach exposed the personal and medical information of more than 430,000 patients.",

      "According to\u00a0Ascension's breach notification letters, the compromise began on Dec. 5, 2024, when the network learned patient data\u00a0\"may have been involved in a potential security incident.\" By Jan. 21, 2025, its investigators had determined that Ascension had \"inadvertently disclosed information to a former business partner,\" and that attackers likely stole data from that partner via a flaw in its software. In other words, patient records passed from Ascension into a third party's system and were then siphoned off by cybercriminals.",
      "The attackers gained a broad array of information. Impacted patients' demographic and financial details, names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, race, gender and Social Security numbers were exposed. Even more worryingly, the breach included clinical data from hospital stays, including physician names, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis and procedure codes, medical record numbers and insurance details. This is the very data that criminals can exploit for fraud or identity theft.",

      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK",

      "Ascension reported the breach to regulators via an HHS filing on April 28, 2025, which shows 437,329 patients affected. By comparison, the company had earlier disclosed the impact in state filings. For example, 114,692 Texas patients and 96 Massachusetts residents were individually notified of exposure. In response, Ascension is offering those affected two years of free identity monitoring services (credit monitoring, fraud consultation and identity theft restoration).",
      "For scale, Ascension is a major nonprofit health system, one of the largest in the U.S., operating 142 hospitals across North America. The company has not named the third-party partner, but its description fits a vendor whose secure file-transfer software was breached.",
      "The timing aligns with a series of\u00a0recent Cl0p ransomware attacks. Cl0p has publicly claimed responsibility for exploiting a zero-day flaw in Cleo's secure file-transfer products, stealing data from dozens of organizations worldwide. While Ascension itself was not directly hit by ransomware, its data might have ended up in that same attack campaign.",
      "Ascension's patients and employees are no strangers to data breaches. In May 2024, a\u00a0Black Basta ransomware attack compromised Ascension's own network. That incident, traced back to a single employee opening a malicious file, resulted in the exfiltration of data belonging to nearly 5.6 million people.",
      "The fallout was severe. Hospitals lost access to digital records, forcing clinicians to record vitals, medications and orders on paper. Elective procedures and some appointments were paused, and emergency services were redirected to unaffected facilities to avoid delays in care.",

      "2) Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Ascension breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Ascension breach, including Social Security numbers and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You might want to consider investing in identity theft protection, which can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5) Monitor your credit reports: Regularly check your credit reports through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6) Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7) Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Attackers have frequently targeted Ascension, but the company does not seem to be learning its lesson. If it were a one-off incident, it might be understandable. But how do you fail to strengthen cybersecurity after experiencing a nationwide blackout? Rather than being an isolated event, this breach feels like part of a larger pattern. The industry relies on complex vendor networks and outdated IT systems, while cybercriminals continue to exploit emerging vulnerabilities.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Scammers are always coming up with new tricks. Just when you start feeling confident about spotting phishing emails, suspicious links and fake banking apps, they find a new angle. Lately, they have been getting more creative, turning to the built-in features of our phones to pull off their schemes. One of the latest targets is NFC, the technology behind tap-to-pay.",
      "It might seem harmless, but a new scam is using it in ways most people would never expect. An Android malware called SuperCard goes beyond just stealing your card details. It gives attackers the ability to use your card remotely for real transactions. And the worst part is that it all begins with something as simple as a text message.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "An Android phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What makes SuperCard X different?",
      "SuperCard X stands out from other Android malware because of how it operates. As reported by\u00a0researchers at Cleafy, instead of stealing usernames, passwords or verification codes, it uses a method called NFC relay. This allows attackers to copy card data from a victim's device in real time and use it elsewhere to make payments or withdraw cash. The process does not require physical access to the card or knowledge of the PIN.",
      "The malware is offered through a Malware-as-a-Service model, which means different cybercriminals can use it in their own regions. This makes the threat more scalable and harder to contain. Unlike most banking trojans, SuperCard X is not focused on one specific institution. It targets any cardholder regardless of which bank issued their card.",
      "Another key difference is how stealthy the malware is. It uses minimal permissions and does not include extra features that would make it easier to detect. This lean approach helps it avoid detection by antivirus software and allows it to operate quietly on infected devices.",
      "SuperCardX fully undetectable (FUD | Cleafy) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "How the scam works",
      "The fraud begins with a message sent through SMS or WhatsApp. It pretends to be from a bank and warns the recipient about a suspicious transaction. The message includes a phone number and urges the person to call to resolve the issue. This is the first step in gaining the victim's trust.",
      "Once on the phone, the attacker poses as a bank representative and walks the victim through a fake security process. This may include asking them to confirm personal details or adjust settings in their mobile banking app, such as removing spending limits on their card.",
      "Next, the attacker asks the victim to install a mobile app that is described as a tool to verify the account or enhance security. In reality, this app contains the SuperCard X malware. After the installation, the attacker instructs the victim to tap their card against the phone. The malware then captures the NFC data from the card and sends it to a second phone controlled by the attacker.",
      "Using the copied data, the attacker can make contactless payments or make ATM withdrawals almost instantly. This method allows them to steal funds quickly and leaves little opportunity for banks or victims to intervene in time.",
      "A woman scrolling on her phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "8 ways you can stay safe from SuperCard X malware",
      "1) Be cautious of suspicious texts and calls. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Fraudulent campaigns often begin with an SMS or call that seems to come from your bank. These messages usually claim there's suspicious activity on your account and urge you to click a link or dial a number to resolve the issue. However, this is a tactic used to gain access to your personal information. Always approach such messages with skepticism.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:\u00a0One of the key ways malware like SuperCard X spreads is through deceptive apps that victims are persuaded to install. These apps often look harmless, posing as tools for security or account verification. If you receive a link to download an app via SMS, email or messaging apps like WhatsApp, do not click on it. Instead, only download apps from trusted sources, such as the Google Play Store. Additionally, carefully review app permissions and avoid granting unnecessary access, particularly to sensitive data like NFC, location or personal contacts.",
      "3) Turn off NFC when not in use:\u00a0NFC, or Near Field Communication, is a useful feature that allows contactless payments and data exchanges. However, it can be exploited by attackers to capture your card information without you even realizing it. To minimize your risk of falling victim to NFC-based malware like SuperCard X, turn off NFC when you're not actively using it.",
      "On most Android devices, you can do this by going to \"Settings,\" then \"Connected Devices\" or \"Connection Preferences,\" where you\u2019ll find the NFC toggle. By disabling NFC, your phone won't transmit data wirelessly, which helps protect your payment card information from being stolen by nearby attackers.",
      "4) Keep a close eye on your bank accounts and cards:\u00a0If your device has come into contact with the SuperCard or anything similar, it\u2019s possible your banking details are already compromised. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to regularly check your transaction history for anything odd, like a small payment you don\u2019t remember making or a charge from a strange location could be a sign of misuse. If you spot anything suspicious, report it to your bank right away. It\u2019s also worth checking your credit reports every now and then to catch signs of identity theft before they snowball into bigger issues.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service: If scammers have targeted you once, there's a higher chance they\u2019ll try again, especially if your personal details (like your phone number, address or email) are easily found online. Data removal services scan people-search sites and brokers, then request the removal of your info. This reduces your exposure and helps prevent future phishing or social engineering attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Contact your bank and freeze your cards:\u00a0If you think you\u2019ve tapped or handled a suspicious card, or if your phone acted strangely afterward, don\u2019t brush it off. Call your bank and let them know what happened. They can freeze your card to stop any unauthorized payments and issue a new one for added safety. You should also ask them to monitor your account more closely for a while. On top of that, place a fraud alert with a credit bureau so no one can easily open a new line of credit in your name.",
      "7) Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services:\u00a0If you've been targeted by a sophisticated scam like SuperCard X, there's a chance your personal information, not just your card data, may be at risk. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information, like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8) Report the scam to your national cybercrime authority: Whether or not you lost money, reporting the scam helps authorities track emerging threats and warn others. You can report such fraud to the FBI\u2019s\u00a0Internet Crime Complaint Center or the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. Your report could help catch the people behind the scam or at least shut down their infrastructure.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The SuperCard X malware campaign represents a significant shift in how cybercriminals are targeting individuals and financial institutions. By exploiting NFC technology and combining it with social engineering tactics, attackers have found a way to bypass traditional fraud detection systems. What's especially concerning is how quickly these attacks unfold, making them harder to detect before the damage is done. As this threat evolves, it's important for both consumers and institutions to recognize the potential risks of these multilayered fraud strategies.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reports on China\u2019s Zhiyuan unveiling the world\u2019s first tri-ducted wearable eVTOL with hands-free control.",
      "Have you ever imagined what personal flying could look like in the near future? China's Zhiyuan Research Institute, based in Hangzhou, is bringing that vision closer to reality. They just unveiled what they're calling the world's first tri-ducted wearable electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for individual use, and their recent demo flight is already sparking curiosity about the future of personal flight.",

      "Tri-ducted wearable eVTOL for individual use (Zhiyuan Research Institute) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's so special about this flying machine?",
      "The coolest thing about this eVTOL is its tri-ducted propulsion system. That means it has three powerful propellers, one on the left, one on the right and one in the back, all working together to keep the aircraft stable and efficient. This setup isn't just for show. It actually helps the vehicle fly smoother, cut down on noise and hover more reliably. It's the first time a manned aircraft has used this kind of design, which is pretty groundbreaking.",
      "Safety is a huge focus for the Zhiyuan team. They built in a one-click separation system that lets the pilot quickly detach from the aircraft and deploy a low-altitude parachute if something goes wrong. That way, the pilot can land safely even in an emergency, which is a big comfort for anyone flying solo.",
      "Flying this thing isn't just for experts. Zhiyuan developed a ground control system that helps keep things simple. The eVTOL can hover steadily and fly on its own without the pilot having to constantly control it, and it can make quick, agile moves when needed. The controls are designed to be easy to use, so even people without much flying experience can handle them.",
      "On the power side, the team created a new propulsion system with a high thrust-to-weight ratio. They used advanced ducted motor designs to make the whole thing more efficient. Plus, the flight control system can handle turbulent weather, so the ride stays smooth even when the air gets rough.",

It could help with emergency rescues, maintaining electrical infrastructure or cleaning skyscrapers. It also has the potential for sightseeing and leisure flights, and it could be used for border patrol or customs inspections. With its versatility and easy controls, this aircraft could be a game changer for both professionals and adventure seekers.",

      "\"For those two days, the vibe in the room was good,\" Guendelman recalled. \"We asked him the hard questions, and we talked about it. But there was a moment when we started asking harder questions, one after the other. We caught him in a few lies, and [he] then snapped for a couple of minutes.",
      "Netflix confirmed to Fox News Digital that this is the last known interview Lewis gave about the case. (Netflix)",

And for the first time, you can see someone who, even though I do think he tried not to do the worst in his life, when you put him in a corner, when he feels he\u2019s up against the wall, he becomes scary for a second.

In 2010, he gave DNA samples to the FBI and even created a website on which he said he was framed.

      "\"First of all, he loved the attention,\" Pines claimed. \"He was cautious, but our producer, Molly Forster, built this relationship with him for almost a year. She gained his trust bit by bit. And it worked. I think he also enjoyed the fact that we didn\u2019t just look at him as this sensational character, which he is, but also as a human being.\"",

Lewis served more than 12 years in prison for sending an extortion note to manufacturer Johnson & Johnson demanding $1 million to \"stop the killing.\"",

In 1978, he was charged in Kansas City, Missouri, with the dismemberment murder of Raymond West, 72, who had hired Lewis as an accountant.

      "In 1983, Lewis was convicted of extortion and spent 12 years in federal prison, the New York Times reported. After Lewis was convicted, he offered to help prosecutors solve the Tylenol murders, the outlet reported.

      "Retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Daniel Gade, a wounded soldier who refused to let the enemy win and built a career helping other soldiers in the classroom, is now assisting veterans as they cope with returning to normal life while facing dark times and possibly suicide.",
      "The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) National Veteran Suicide Prevention annual report, released in December 2024, revealed there were 47,891 suicides among all U.S. adults in 2022, averaging just over 131 per day. The numbers included 17.6 veteran suicides per day.",
      "Gade, a two-time Purple Heart recipient, serves as a senior advisor for America\u2019s Warrior Partnership (AWP), which has a mission to partner with communities to prevent veteran suicide, while also helping communities figure out how to provide for their veterans.",

      "Daniel Gade was injured while serving in the Army, and now he spends time helping wounded veterans find their place back in society, while helping to prevent veteran suicide. (America's Warrior Partnership)",
      "In fact, the research conducted by AWP and its partners shows the veteran suicide rate is actually higher, Gade said, because many deaths go unreported. The organization, he added, is conducting rigorous research that is getting to some of the root causes of veteran dislocation, a term Gade used because dislocation, or disconnectedness, is \"kind of a precondition for suicide.\"",
      "\"What they're looking at is the disconnectedness in order to better prevent suicide,\" he said. \"So, it's not about dumping money into crisis lines, because by the time somebody calls a crisis line, it's way too late. And for a lot of people, they never call a crisis line; they just go to the gun safe. And that's not good enough.\"",
      "Instead, the process is about building veterans back up and helping them find their place in society, a process Gade said he personally experienced.",
      "Gade joined the Army in 1992 at the age of 17. A year later, he was accepted into the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in New York. He graduated from the academy in 1997, becoming an armored officer in the Army. Seven years later, he was deployed to Iraq, where he was wounded twice.",

      "The first time he was wounded was in November 2004, when the tank he was in was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade. Gade said he was wounded mildly, though a young soldier next to him, Dennis Miller from La Salle, Michigan, was killed in the attack. Two months later, Gade was involved in another attack.",
      "\"I was hit by a roadside bomb, an IED [improvised explosive device] that caused me to lose my entire right leg. So, I'm a right leg, hip-level amputee,\" he said, adding that the wounds forced him to spend a year in the hospital. \"During that time\u2026 I had to find a way to rebuild myself.\"",
      "Rebuilding meant Gade had to rediscover who he was going to be professionally and personally. It also meant pondering the type of athletics he would be able to do and whether he would be able to provide for his family.",

      "\"I went from being sort of a user-level wounded warrior\u2026 to being at the very highest levels of government, you know, helping to formulate policy that would help wounded warriors,\" Gade said.",

      "After that, Gade dabbled in politics, making a run for the U.S. Senate in Virginia in 2020 as a Republican against Democratic Sen. Mark Warner. Gade ultimately lost, but he was able to join Glenn Youngkin\u2019s campaign for Virginia governor as an advisor, and when Youngkin won, Gade was tapped to serve as the commissioner of the Department of Veterans Services.",
      "\"I got to go back to my roots, kind of, serving veterans, which is what I\u2019ve done as a personal mission for many years now, basically since I became a wounded warrior back in 2005,\" Gade said.",

      "\"If you think about people in society who are disadvantaged\u2026 you always sort of think about, you know, minorities in the inner city or people born into a tough situation like that,\" Gade explained. \"But very few people know the plight of the American Indian.\"",
      "Gade grew up in North Dakota near a Sioux reservation. Like many Native American reservations, the people who live there suffer from poverty, alcoholism, dysfunctional families, divorce and many other issues.",
      "He explained that many people in the Navajo Nation \u2014 which AWP works with \u2014 join the military because they are patriotic, but also because they are searching for a way to escape and better themselves. Oftentimes, they go on to do great things in the military, Gade said, pointing to the Navajo Code Talkers, who used their native language to create secret codes during World War II.",

(America's Warrior Partnership)",
      "After serving their country, the tribal members return to their communities, but according to Gade, they bring back post-traumatic stress, physical injuries or other conditions that get laid on top of what were already tough economic and social conditions for them.",
      "\"America\u2019s Warrior Partnership, through its connectedness with the Navajo Nation, [is] taking sort of a whole-of-society approach,\" Gade said. \"It\u2019s not just helping police figure out how you divert somebody instead of arresting somebody. In some cases, you might want to offer them resources so they can escape that path themselves.\"",

      "While the VA reports a veteran suicide rate of about 17%, AWP found through Operation Deep Dive that the rate is almost double that.",
      "Gade said the difference came down to unreported suicides. For example, there may be a 25-year-old veteran who crashes a vehicle at midnight, but it is not known why he crashed the car. The coroner may just write the cause of death as a single-vehicle accident, but a deeper dive by Operation Deep Dive may look into the person\u2019s life. That same investigation may find the veteran was despairing, had just gone through a divorce or something along those lines.",
      "Another example where Operation Deep Dive may help is if someone has an overdose of a prescription medication prescribed by the VA. The coroner has to determine if it is accidental or suicide, and by doing a deep dive, the organization is finding that the deaths are more likely than not to have been self-harm or accidental self-harm, rather than just pure accidents.",

      "\"That\u2019s where the difference comes \u2014 it\u2019s expanding our definition of unnatural death to include these others,\" Gade said. \"And then you realize, oh, man, a whole lot of these are suicides and not just single-vehicle accidents.\"",
      "\"Every suicide is tragic, but every suicide, you know, suicide is a disease of despair,\" he added. \"What America's Warrior Partnership is doing is really trying to get at the roots of that and defeat suicide before it comes into somebody's life.\"",

      "\"Williams admitted to agents that one of the escapees advised him to turn the water off in the cell where the inmates escaped from,\" Murrill said in the statement. \"Instead of reporting the inmate, Williams turned the water off as directed, allowing the inmates to carry out their scheme to successfully escape.\"",
      "Pack said the inmates' choice to target a maintenance worker for help was a smart and calculated move.",
      "\"If you think about it, maintenance people are not really looked after there. They're kind of low-key, and they have keys to doors. They have access to utilities and panels, so it was pretty smart to target him on the part of the criminals,\" Pack said.",
      "He added that the prison escape was also not a \"crime of opportunity\" and had most likely been planned for some time.",
      "\"Inmates are resourceful when it comes to things on the inside. It's not out of the realm of possibility that they hatched this plan over a few days or a few weeks,\" Pack said.",
      "Additionally, Williams' arrest may not be the only one coming, Pack theorized, stating that this could be just the first initial wave of arrests as other employees had been suspended.",
      "\"It seems like these inmates are going to exploit any crack in the system they can. And sometimes the cracks will lead to pressure whether waiting or not for folks who are in vulnerable positions. And that seemed to be what happened here, enough so that he (Williams) was able to turn the water off, they were able to pull the toilet out and escape through the corridor there and out the back door,\" Pack said.",
      "\"And I think when we say jailbreak from now on, all of us are going to remember that video of the 10 people just fleeing out the jail.\"",
      "Pack added that \"the bigger issue is what allowed this to happen in the first place.\"",
      "\"That jail had just 36 officers working with over 1,000 inmates. That\u2019s not enough people to keep a place like that running safely. When staff are stretched that thin, it\u2019s easy for things to slip through the cracks. Most jails around the country are dealing with similar problems \u2013 low staffing, budget cuts and buildings that are falling apart,\" Pack said.",
      "The jail is only at 60% staffing, and at the time of the escape, four supervisors and 36 staff members were monitoring 1,400 inmates, authorities said.",

      "Corey Boyd, 19, who was briefly spotted last Friday hours after the jailbreak, was taken into custody Tuesday, the Louisiana State Police said. Boyd was originally jailed for second-degree murder, attempted second-degree murder, aggravated battery and threatening a public official.",
      "However, the escapee who is considered most dangerous is Derrick Groves, 27, who remains at large.",

      "Louisiana State Police captured escaped inmate Gary C. Price. (X/@LAStatePolice)",
      "Pack said what makes this case more unique than other prison breaks is the number of convicts that escaped at once.",
      "\"It's very unusual to have a 10-person manhunt in a prison escape like this. These don't happen regularly. And when they do, it just shows you the danger that folks can risk close to the community and why corrections officers are an important part of the law enforcement team,\" Pack said. \"There is a nationwide shortage of correction officers around. They're low-paid and under-appreciated and it's a very difficult job dealing with inmates.\"",
      "Pack said the number one goal for law enforcement right now is getting the inmates \"back into custody quickly and safely.\"",
      "\"Some of them are facing serious charges, and when people are on the run, especially if they\u2019re scared, things can get dangerous fast. They might steal a car, break into a house, or hurt someone if they feel cornered. The longer this drags out, the more chance someone gets hurt,\" Pack said.",
      "The five fugitives still on the run are Groves, Jermaine Donald, 42, Antoine Massey, 33, Leo Tate, 31, and Lenton Vanburen, 27.",
      "Pack added that while it is unlikely any of the convicts fled the country, they would run into obstacles anywhere trying to run, as there are agencies nationwide and around the world assisting in locating them.",
      "\"You can't outrun the feds, and you can't outrun the FBI or the Marshals Service, because they have offices around the country and indeed, around the world,\" Pack said. \"So even if they do happen to make it to another country \u2013 I'm not suggesting that that's what's happened yet \u2013 but if they had to do that, the FBI and the Marshals and federal law enforcement have liaisons in other countries that are able to step in and help them even though they don't have jurisdiction there.",
      "\"So you can run, you can hide, but you can't hide forever. And just because this case may lose traction in the media, it's not going to lose traction with law enforcement.\"",

      "Pack added that having no incidents reported since the inmates escaped has been a \"miracle in itself.\"",
      "\"The fugitives get desperate out there and so when they feel the pressure, and they're feeling the heat, sometimes they act in desperation. So hopefully they'll continue not to. It's possible and likely that they have people on the outside that are helping them hide out in these matters,\" Pack said.",
      "\"Police don\u2019t want this to end with anyone getting injured, including the escapees. The goal is to find them, surround them, and bring them in without any drama,\" Pack continued. \"That\u2019s what officers train for. It\u2019s not about chasing headlines. It\u2019s about doing the job carefully and professionally, even when the public is watching.\"",

    "summary": "A U.K. report suggests chemical castration for sex offenders to ease prison overcrowding, sparking debate over ethics and informed consent in medical treatment.",
    "story": [
      "The U.K. is considering mandating the use of chemical castration for sex offenders under an overhaul of the justice system aimed at freeing up more space in its overcrowded prisons, Reuters reported. (Credit: Reuters.)",
      "A British government minister says she\u2019s \"not squeamish\" about the idea of chemical castration for male sex offenders, and wants to make it mandatory.",
      "The UK is considering a range of options from a new report, which aims to cut the country\u2019s prison population by 10,000 inmates to help alleviate chronic overcrowding.",
      "\"Problematic sexual arousal and preoccupation can be reduced via chemical suppressants and other medications, which can be prescribed for individuals who have committed a sexual offense under certain circumstances,\" the new report states.",
      "Prisons in the south-west of England have been involved in a pilot program of chemical castrations since 2002, and Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood from the ruling Labour Party told lawmakers in parliament on Thursday that the program would expand to 20 more prisons in two other regions of England.",

      "Prisoners would be given two drugs as part of the treatment: one limits sexual thoughts, while the other reduces testosterone and \"problematic sexual arousal.\" Inmates would also have ongoing counseling to treat their psychological issues, such as a desire for sexual power and control. One recent study found that reoffending rates were up to 60% lower for prisoners who had received the treatment.",
      "\"For some, offending relates to power, but for another subset of offenders, the combination of chemical suppressants and psychological interventions can, we believe, have a big and positive impact,\" Minister Mahmood told parliament.",
      "Initially, the option for chemical castration treatment would be only voluntary, and medical ethicists say it could be a problem to force doctors to treat an inmate who doesn\u2019t want to have it done. In Britain, there is a strict tradition of informed medical consent where a patient can refuse medical treatment, and a doctor can\u2019t ordinarily be forced to carry it out.",

(Photo by Andrew Aitchison / In pictures via Getty Images)",
      "Sex offenders make up a significant percentage of the prison population in England, and at the end of March, more than 20% of inmates were incarcerated on sex crimes charges. The new report cautions that chemical castration \"should never be used as a risk management tool or standalone rehabilitative offer, and it is only appropriate for a limited number of sex offenders\".",
      "Chemical castration is already being used in some other European prisons to treat sex offenders. Authorities in Sweden have been carrying out limited clinical trials on volunteers at a Stockholm prison, while in Germany and Denmark it is more widely used but still on a voluntary basis. In Poland, courts can pass a sentence of mandatory chemical castration for some categories of sex-offense prisoners.",
      "Thursday\u2019s report, written by a former government minister from the Conservative Party, also made four dozen recommendations to try and ease prison overcrowding.",
      "These include giving fewer people jail sentences under 12 months and encouraging other types of punishment instead, such as community service or fines; developing new policies for early release with good behavior for inmates, and tagging all offenders who committed crimes of abuse against women and girls.",

      "\"This is a gift to criminals, who will be free to offend with impunity,\" the party\u2019s justice spokesman Robert Jenrick told reporters.",

      "Since its establishment over 160 years ago, the ICRC has prided itself on serving as a neutral body focused on delivering aid and medical care. However, since the war in Gaza began, the ICRC has faced criticism from some for not pushing to visit the hostages and for its volunteers taking part in Hamas-led hostage release ceremonies.",
      "When asked by Fox News Digital about the ceremonies, Kurtzer said that ICRC workers in Gaza have \"very little ability to dictate the terms and the protocols of the release operations.\" However, he added that the organization believes these hostage release operations \"must be done in dignity and should be done privately.\"",
      "\"So, certainly there were things that we saw that we didn't like. We conveyed our views about those directly through what we call our bilateral and confidential dialogue,\" Kurtzer said.",
      "Despite facing mounting pressure and obstacles, the ICRC seems to be sticking to its mission. Kurtzer said that the organization is ready to \"jump at\" any opportunity to reach the hostages and provide them with assistance. However, Hamas has still not given them that opportunity.",

Kurtzer later clarified the comments in a statement to Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The ICRC recognizes the distinction between hostages and detainees enshrined in international humanitarian law (IHL). Hostages are captured or held with the threat of being harmed or killed to pressure another party into doing something, as a condition for the hostage\u2019s release or safety. Hostage-taking is a violation of IHL,\" he said. \"We provide assistance and work to alleviate suffering on all sides of a conflict. Under IHL, the ICRC must be notified of and granted access to Palestinians in Israeli custody, and we continue to seek this access.\"",

    "summary": "Sen. Ron Johnson said he thinks there are \u201cenough\u201d Republicans to \u201cstop the process\u201d on the GOP's domestic package in order to prioritize spending reductions.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As the Senate prepares to consider the sprawling domestic package that House Republicans passed last week, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he thinks there are \u201cenough\u201d Republicans to \u201cstop the process\u201d in order to prioritize stronger reductions in spending and the national deficit.",
      "The Wisconsin Republican has criticized the bill\u2019s impact on the deficit, characterizing outsize spending as \u201cmortgaging our children\u2019s future.\u201d The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the bill would add $2.3 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years.",
      "Johnson said in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that congressional Republicans should examine spending \u201cline by line, like DOGE has done\u201d to find areas to eliminate.",
      "The senator\u2019s criticism comes as the Senate is gearing up to consider changes to the House bill, which passed by a single vote, setting up another fight over government deficit levels, funding for programs and attempts to rein in spending ahead of Republicans\u2019 goal to send a final version of the bill to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk by July 4.",
      "Several Republicans in the Senate have expressed skepticism about aspects of the bill for what they view as inadequate spending cuts or shrinking Medicaid access and have promised to change it. Any changes to the bill would need to be approved by the House before it goes to Trump.",
      "Trump told reporters on Sunday that he expected the Senate to make \"fairly significant\" changes to the funding package, but remained confident the bill would ultimately pass both chambers and reach his desk.",
      "\"I want the Senate and the senators to change, you know, to make the changes they want, and we\u2019ll go back to the House and we\u2019ll see if we can get them,\" Trump said. \"In some cases, those changes maybe are something I\u2019d agree with.\"",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the current spending cuts in the bill \u201care wimpy and anemic,\u201d adding that he \u201cstill would support the bill even with wimpy and anemic cuts if they weren\u2019t going to explode the debt.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe problem is the math doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d Paul said, adding that \u201cthey\u2019re going to explode the debt.\u201d",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has also criticized potential Medicaid cuts. The bill, if passed in its current form, is expected to rescind health coverage for about 8.6 million people, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Hawley told NBC News shortly after the House passed the bill that \u201cthe Senate will basically write its own version of this bill, and I just want to make sure that there are no Medicaid benefit cuts.\u201d",
      "In an op-ed in The New York Times earlier this month, Hawley accused a wing of the Republican Party of wanting \u201cRepublicans to build our big, beautiful bill around slashing health insurance for the working poor.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut that argument is both morally wrong and politically suicidal,\u201d Hawley said.",
      "When asked during a Sunday interview on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d to respond to Hawley\u2019s comments, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said that \u201cwe are not cutting Medicaid\u201d but instead \u201cworking in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse.\u201d",
      "The House speaker repeatedly defended the bill\u2019s impact on people who would lose Medicaid coverage, instead casting the bill as targeting waste, fraud and abuse among Medicaid users. He said in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the Republican-led bill was not cutting Medicaid, arguing that \u201cthe numbers of Americans who are affected are those that are entwined in our work to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse.\u201d",
      "The speaker pointed to \u201cillegal aliens on Medicaid,\u201d saying that \u201cMedicaid is not intended for non-U.S. citizens.\u201d Certain non-U.S. citizens are allowed to enroll in government health care options.",
      "Johnson also criticized \u201cyoung men, for example, who are on Medicaid and not working.\u201d He argued that people were committing \u201cfraud\u201d by \u201cchoosing not to work when they can.\u201d",
      "Anchor Jake Tapper asked Johnson whether he believed that if any of his constituents were to lose benefits like Medicaid, it would be because they should not have received those benefits \u201cbecause they were committing waste, fraud or abuse.\u201d",
      "\u201cYeah,\u201d Johnson answered. \u201cLook, my district, as every district in America, has people who are on the program who shouldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Democrats have seized on potential Medicaid cuts, blasting Republicans\u2019 domestic policy bill and working to characterize the GOP as willing to cut health insurance options for poor people while increasing the wealth of Americans with higher incomes.",
      "NBC News previously reported that during negotiations over the bill last week, Trump visited House Republicans and instructed them, \u201cDon\u2019t f--- around with Medicaid,\u201d according to two lawmakers present.",
      "The House speaker said during multiple Sunday-morning interviews that he has urged Senate Republicans to make as few changes to the bill as possible. The House and Senate will ultimately need to reconcile different versions of the bill before it heads to Trump\u2019s desk to be signed into law.",
      "\u201cI had lunch with my Senate Republican colleagues on Tuesday, their weekly luncheon, and I encouraged them to remember that we are one team,\u201d Johnson said on CBS News. \u201cIt\u2019s the Senate and the House Republicans together that will deliver this ball over the goal line, so to speak. And I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance.\u201d",
      "The bill passed the House 215-214, with two Republicans opposing the bill, one voting \u201cpresent\u201d and two missing the vote.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., criticized the bill last week, saying that \u201cTrump promised to love and cherish Medicaid.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead, his One Big Ugly Bill represents the largest healthcare cut in our country\u2019s history,\u201d Jeffries said in a statement. \u201cMillions of people will lose their Medicaid coverage and hardworking American taxpayers will be forced to pay higher premiums, copays and deductibles.\u201d"

      "A bill that would require the Ten Commandments to be posted in every public school classroom in Texas cleared a key legislative hurdle Sunday and is closer to heading to Gov. Greg Abbott for approval.",
      "The state House of Representatives passed a version of the Ten Commandments bill in a 82-46 vote following a week of debate and delay, when Democratic lawmakers attempted to introduce amendments, including allowing individual school districts to opt in and for the Ten Commandments to be in different languages.",
      "After the House passed the bill with an amendment on Sunday \u2014 requiring the state, rather than school districts, to defend any legal challenges to the law \u2014 it must now return to the Senate for approval. Advocates of the law celebrated the win after\u00a0they\u00a0initially assumed the bill would proceed directly to the governor once passed by the House.",
      "Abbott\u2019s office did not immediately comment about its passage, but the Republican governor is expected to sign it into law if it reaches his desk. The state Senate approved a previous version of the legislation in March on a 20-11 party-line vote.",
      "Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick\u00a0had said\u00a0the success of the bill, known as SB 10, was among his priorities for the current session, which ends next month, after similar legislation failed in 2023 because of time constraints.",
      "\u201cBy placing the Ten Commandments in our public school classrooms, we ensure our students receive the same foundational moral compass as our state and country\u2019s forefathers,\u201d Patrick said.",
      "Still, Texas\u2019 Ten Commandments legislation is likely to face constitutional opposition, as it has in Louisiana, where a GOP-drafted law was signed last year by Gov. Jeff Landry and was quickly challenged by a coalition of parents of different religious beliefs.",
      "Under Texas\u2019 bill, all public elementary or secondary schools would have to \u201cdisplay in a conspicuous place in each classroom of the school a durable poster or framed copy of the Ten Commandments.\u201d The displays would have to be at least 16 inches wide and 20 inches tall and include the text of the Ten Commandments as written in the bill.",
      "Once the bill is signed into law, schools \u201cmust accept any offer of privately donated\u201d displays or may use district funds, starting in the 2025-26 school year.",
      "The legislation does not have an enforcement mechanism, and it\u2019s unclear what might happen to schools or individual teachers who refuse to comply. According to a state House committee analysis, the bill itself also \u201cdoes not expressly create a criminal offense.\u201d",
      "State Sen. Phil King, the lead author of\u00a0the bill, had said he was introducing the legislation because \u201cthe Ten Commandments are part of our Texas and American story.\u201d",
      "But state Rep. James Talarico, a Democrat who is Christian, objected to the bill last week during an earlier vote, saying a display of such religious text may feel exclusionary to non-Christian students.",
      "\u201cForcing our religion down their throats is not love,\u201d Talarico said.",
      "With Louisiana and most recently Arkansas mandating the Ten Commandments in public schools, legal arguments over such laws could eventually wind up again before the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 1980 ruled that classroom displays of the Ten Commandments were unconstitutional.",
      "Louisiana has not fully implemented its law as officials await a federal appeals court ruling on its constitutionality. In November, a\u00a0lower court judge concluded\u00a0the state had not offered \u201cany constitutional way to display the Ten Commandments.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Texas House members on Friday approved another religion-based bill that would permit school districts to adopt policies allowing for a period of prayer and reading of the Bible or \u201cother religious text\u201d with parental consent. Abbott is also expected to sign it into law.",
      "Emily Witt, a spokeswoman for the Texas Freedom Network,\u00a0a grassroots group that advocates for religious freedom, said the wave of conservative-leaning legislation across Texas and other states is part of a wider \u201ccoordinated strategy\u201d to infuse the Bible in public school education.",
      "\u201cThe message this sends to kids is that they\u2019re being told their religion doesn\u2019t matter and isn\u2019t as important as this one,\u201d Witt said. \u201cWe worry that leads to bullying and otherism \u2014 all things in public schools that we try to prevent.\u201d",
      "CLARIFICATION (May 25, 2025, 4:50 p.m. ET): This article was updated after publication to clarify that the legislation must go back to the state Senate for approval, rather than directly to the governor, as supporters of the law had initially indicated in a news release."

      "NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio loves EltaMD face sunscreen for sensitive skin because it\u2019s free of heavy moisturizers that can clog pores or flare her rosacea-prone skin. Pair it with a body sunscreen like the EltaMD UV Sport SPF, and you\u2019re ready for beach day.",

This 65-inch version originally launched in 2024 for $2,699.99 \u2014 you can grab it today for almost half that price. I always recommend buying last year\u2019s TVs, like this one, as you can get a much better deal than buying current models (the 2025 65-inch LG C5, for example, costs more than $2,000 right now).",

      "Palou, who has won three IndyCar titles in four years \u2014 including the last two, came to the speedway with four wins through the first five races this season. But it was No. 6, \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing,\u201d that he had circled on his calendar.",
      "Without an Indy 500 win, Palou said his career resume would never be complete.",
      "Palou stopped the car just beyond the Yard of Bricks, climbing out of it and nearly losing his balance as he raised his arms in triumph.

    "story": [
      "A bill that would require the Ten Commandments to be posted in every public school classroom in Texas cleared a key legislative hurdle Sunday and is closer to heading to Gov. Greg Abbott for approval.",
      "The state House of Representatives passed a version of the Ten Commandments bill in a 82-46 vote following a week of debate and delay, when Democratic lawmakers attempted to introduce amendments, including allowing individual school districts to opt in and for the Ten Commandments to be in different languages.",
      "After the House passed the bill with an amendment on Sunday \u2014 requiring the state, rather than school districts, to defend any legal challenges to the law \u2014 it must now return to the Senate for approval. Advocates of the law celebrated the win after\u00a0they\u00a0initially assumed the bill would proceed directly to the governor once passed by the House.",
      "Abbott\u2019s office did not immediately comment about its passage, but the Republican governor is expected to sign it into law if it reaches his desk. The state Senate approved a previous version of the legislation in March on a 20-11 party-line vote.",
      "Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick\u00a0had said\u00a0the success of the bill, known as SB 10, was among his priorities for the current session, which ends next month, after similar legislation failed in 2023 because of time constraints.",
      "\u201cBy placing the Ten Commandments in our public school classrooms, we ensure our students receive the same foundational moral compass as our state and country\u2019s forefathers,\u201d Patrick said.",
      "Still, Texas\u2019 Ten Commandments legislation is likely to face constitutional opposition, as it has in Louisiana, where a GOP-drafted law was signed last year by Gov. Jeff Landry and was quickly challenged by a coalition of parents of different religious beliefs.",
      "Under Texas\u2019 bill, all public elementary or secondary schools would have to \u201cdisplay in a conspicuous place in each classroom of the school a durable poster or framed copy of the Ten Commandments.\u201d The displays would have to be at least 16 inches wide and 20 inches tall and include the text of the Ten Commandments as written in the bill.",
      "Once the bill is signed into law, schools \u201cmust accept any offer of privately donated\u201d displays or may use district funds, starting in the 2025-26 school year.",
      "The legislation does not have an enforcement mechanism, and it\u2019s unclear what might happen to schools or individual teachers who refuse to comply. According to a state House committee analysis, the bill itself also \u201cdoes not expressly create a criminal offense.\u201d",
      "State Sen. Phil King, the lead author of\u00a0the bill, had said he was introducing the legislation because \u201cthe Ten Commandments are part of our Texas and American story.\u201d",
      "But state Rep. James Talarico, a Democrat who is Christian, objected to the bill last week during an earlier vote, saying a display of such religious text may feel exclusionary to non-Christian students.",
      "\u201cForcing our religion down their throats is not love,\u201d Talarico said.",
      "With Louisiana and most recently Arkansas mandating the Ten Commandments in public schools, legal arguments over such laws could eventually wind up again before the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 1980 ruled that classroom displays of the Ten Commandments were unconstitutional.",
      "Louisiana has not fully implemented its law as officials await a federal appeals court ruling on its constitutionality. In November, a\u00a0lower court judge concluded\u00a0the state had not offered \u201cany constitutional way to display the Ten Commandments.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Texas House members on Friday approved another religion-based bill that would permit school districts to adopt policies allowing for a period of prayer and reading of the Bible or \u201cother religious text\u201d with parental consent. Abbott is also expected to sign it into law.",
      "Emily Witt, a spokeswoman for the Texas Freedom Network,\u00a0a grassroots group that advocates for religious freedom, said the wave of conservative-leaning legislation across Texas and other states is part of a wider \u201ccoordinated strategy\u201d to infuse the Bible in public school education.",
      "\u201cThe message this sends to kids is that they\u2019re being told their religion doesn\u2019t matter and isn\u2019t as important as this one,\u201d Witt said. \u201cWe worry that leads to bullying and otherism \u2014 all things in public schools that we try to prevent.\u201d",
      "CLARIFICATION (May 25, 2025, 4:50 p.m. ET): This article was updated after publication to clarify that the legislation must go back to the state Senate for approval, rather than directly to the governor, as supporters of the law had initially indicated in a news release."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As the Senate prepares to consider the sprawling domestic package that House Republicans passed last week, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he thinks there are \u201cenough\u201d Republicans to \u201cstop the process\u201d in order to prioritize stronger reductions in spending and the national deficit.",
      "The Wisconsin Republican has criticized the bill\u2019s impact on the deficit, characterizing outsize spending as \u201cmortgaging our children\u2019s future.\u201d The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the bill would add $2.3 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years.",
      "Johnson said in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that congressional Republicans should examine spending \u201cline by line, like DOGE has done\u201d to find areas to eliminate.",
      "The senator\u2019s criticism comes as the Senate is gearing up to consider changes to the House bill, which passed by a single vote, setting up another fight over government deficit levels, funding for programs and attempts to rein in spending ahead of Republicans\u2019 goal to send a final version of the bill to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk by July 4.",
      "Several Republicans in the Senate have expressed skepticism about aspects of the bill for what they view as inadequate spending cuts or shrinking Medicaid access and have promised to change it. Any changes to the bill would need to be approved by the House before it goes to Trump.",
      "Trump told reporters on Sunday that he expected the Senate to make \"fairly significant\" changes to the funding package, but remained confident the bill would ultimately pass both chambers and reach his desk.",
      "\"I want the Senate and the senators to change, you know, to make the changes they want, and we\u2019ll go back to the House and we\u2019ll see if we can get them,\" Trump said. \"In some cases, those changes maybe are something I\u2019d agree with.\"",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the current spending cuts in the bill \u201care wimpy and anemic,\u201d adding that he \u201cstill would support the bill even with wimpy and anemic cuts if they weren\u2019t going to explode the debt.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe problem is the math doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d Paul said, adding that \u201cthey\u2019re going to explode the debt.\u201d",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has also criticized potential Medicaid cuts. The bill, if passed in its current form, is expected to rescind health coverage for about 8.6 million people, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Hawley told NBC News shortly after the House passed the bill that \u201cthe Senate will basically write its own version of this bill, and I just want to make sure that there are no Medicaid benefit cuts.\u201d",
      "In an op-ed in The New York Times earlier this month, Hawley accused a wing of the Republican Party of wanting \u201cRepublicans to build our big, beautiful bill around slashing health insurance for the working poor.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut that argument is both morally wrong and politically suicidal,\u201d Hawley said.",
      "When asked during a Sunday interview on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d to respond to Hawley\u2019s comments, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said that \u201cwe are not cutting Medicaid\u201d but instead \u201cworking in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse.\u201d",
      "The House speaker repeatedly defended the bill\u2019s impact on people who would lose Medicaid coverage, instead casting the bill as targeting waste, fraud and abuse among Medicaid users. He said in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the Republican-led bill was not cutting Medicaid, arguing that \u201cthe numbers of Americans who are affected are those that are entwined in our work to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse.\u201d",
      "The speaker pointed to \u201cillegal aliens on Medicaid,\u201d saying that \u201cMedicaid is not intended for non-U.S. citizens.\u201d Certain non-U.S. citizens are allowed to enroll in government health care options.",
      "Johnson also criticized \u201cyoung men, for example, who are on Medicaid and not working.\u201d He argued that people were committing \u201cfraud\u201d by \u201cchoosing not to work when they can.\u201d",
      "Anchor Jake Tapper asked Johnson whether he believed that if any of his constituents were to lose benefits like Medicaid, it would be because they should not have received those benefits \u201cbecause they were committing waste, fraud or abuse.\u201d",
      "\u201cYeah,\u201d Johnson answered. \u201cLook, my district, as every district in America, has people who are on the program who shouldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Democrats have seized on potential Medicaid cuts, blasting Republicans\u2019 domestic policy bill and working to characterize the GOP as willing to cut health insurance options for poor people while increasing the wealth of Americans with higher incomes.",
      "NBC News previously reported that during negotiations over the bill last week, Trump visited House Republicans and instructed them, \u201cDon\u2019t f--- around with Medicaid,\u201d according to two lawmakers present.",
      "The House speaker said during multiple Sunday-morning interviews that he has urged Senate Republicans to make as few changes to the bill as possible. The House and Senate will ultimately need to reconcile different versions of the bill before it heads to Trump\u2019s desk to be signed into law.",
      "\u201cI had lunch with my Senate Republican colleagues on Tuesday, their weekly luncheon, and I encouraged them to remember that we are one team,\u201d Johnson said on CBS News. \u201cIt\u2019s the Senate and the House Republicans together that will deliver this ball over the goal line, so to speak. And I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance.\u201d",
      "The bill passed the House 215-214, with two Republicans opposing the bill, one voting \u201cpresent\u201d and two missing the vote.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u2014 Strauss\u2019 \u201cBlue Danube\u201d is heading into space this month to mark the 200th anniversary of the waltz king\u2019s birth.",
      "The classical piece will be beamed into the cosmos as it\u2019s performed by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. The celestial send-off on May 31 \u2014 livestreamed with free public screenings in Vienna, Madrid and New York \u2014 also will celebrate the European Space Agency\u2019s founding 50 years ago.",
      "Although the music could be converted into radio signals in real time, according to officials, ESA will relay a pre-recorded version from the orchestra\u2019s rehearsal the day before to avoid any technical issues. The live performance will provide the accompaniment.",
      "The radio signals will hurtle away at the speed of light, or a mind-blowing 670 million mph (more than 1 billion kph).",
      "That will put the music past the moon in 1 \u00bd seconds, past Mars in 4 \u00bd minutes, past Jupiter in 37 minutes and past Neptune in four hours. Within 23 hours, the signals will be as far from Earth as NASA\u2019s Voyager 1, the world\u2019s most distant spacecraft at more than 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) in interstellar space.",
      "NASA also celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008 by transmitting a song directly into deep space: the Beatles\u2019 \u201cAcross the Universe.\u201d And last year, NASA beamed up Missy Elliott\u2019s \u201cThe Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\u201d toward Venus.",
      "Music has even flowed from another planet to Earth \u2014 courtesy of a NASA Mars rover. Flight controllers at California\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory sent a recording of will.i.am\u2019s \u201cReach for the Stars\u201d to Curiosity in 2012 and the rover relayed it back.",
      "These are all deep-space transmissions as opposed to the melodies streaming between NASA\u2019s Mission Control and orbiting crews since the mid-1960s.",
      "Now it\u2019s Strauss\u2019 turn, after getting passed over for the Voyager Golden Records nearly a half-century ago.",
      "Launched in 1977, NASA\u2019s twin Voyagers 1 and 2 each carry a gold-plated copper phonograph record, along with a stylus and playing instructions for anyone or anything out there.",
      "The records contain sounds and images of Earth as well as 90 minutes of music. The late astronomer Carl Sagan led the committee that chose Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Stravinsky pieces, along with modern and Indigenous selections.",
      "Among those skipped was Johann Strauss II, whose \u201cBlue Danube\u201d graced Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1968 sci-fi opus \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d",
      "The tourist board in Vienna, where Strauss was born on Oct. 25, 1825, said it aims to correct this \u201ccosmic mistake\u201d by sending the \u201cthe most famous of all waltzes\u201d to its destined home among the stars.",
      "ESA\u2019s big radio antenna in Spain, part of the space agency\u2019s deep-space network, will do the honors. The dish will be pointed in the direction of Voyager 1 so the \u201cBlue Danube\u201d heads that way.",
      "\u201cMusic connects us all through time and space in a very particular way,\u201d ESA\u2019s director general Josef Aschbacher said in a statement. \u201cThe European Space Agency is pleased to share the stage with Johann Strauss II and open the imaginations of future space scientists and explorers who may one day journey to the anthem of space.\u201d"

They function by taking lottery ticket orders from players over the phone or online, buying the agreed-upon tickets from licensed lottery retailers and charging fees for purchasing and managing tickets.",
      "Doe\u2019s suit says her winning ticket was obtained on her behalf from Winners Corner, a licensed lotto retailer in Austin. The same night of her purchase, her ticket\u2019s numbers were drawn for the jackpot prize of $83.5 million, according to the lawsuit.",

      "Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen, the reigning world champion, finished in a distant fourth place after a gamble on tire strategy that didn\u2019t work out.",
      "The 78-lap race took place on a sunny day on the streets of Monaco, the wealthy principality on the French Riviera that turns into a race track once a year.",
      "Norris qualified first on Saturday in a race where grid position is uniquely important. He led from the start, fending off a valiant attempt by Leclerc to overtake him in the first few corners. He faced another challenge late in the race as Verstappen stayed out  in the second stint, creating a roadblock for Norris and allowing Leclerc and Piastri to close up.",
      "\u201cIt feels amazing! It\u2019s a long race. It\u2019s a long, grueling race. But good fun,\u201d Norris said in a post-race interview.",
      "\u201cWe won in Monaco! An amazing weekend,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is was I did dream of as a kid.\u201d",
      "The race carries significant implications for the championship. Piastri still leads the standings, but his 13-point advantage over Norris has narrowed to just 3 points. Verstappen is another 22 points behind Norris, sitting third in the title race.",
      "It was a much-needed comeback weekend for Norris, who hasn\u2019t won a Grand Prix since the season opener in Australia in March. Norris, who began the season as the betting-odds title favorite, had struggled in previous races and fallen behind Piastri in the title standings. Monaco could mark a turning point.",
      "Piastri said he had some struggles throughout the race weekend, but took some positives from his third-place finish.",
      "\u201cPretty happy with that overall,\u201d Piastri said. \u201cSmall points on the board, another trip to the podium in Monaco. So not bad.\u201d",
      "A new rule causes strategy gambles",
      "Leclerc, who realized his own childhood dream by winning the Monaco Grand Prix last year, said his failure to qualify in first place again sealed his fate this year.",
      "\u201cWe lost the race yesterday,\u201d Leclerc said Sunday, referring to his narrow defeat for pole position to Norris.",
      "The glitzy event attracted celebrities who were photographed over the weekend, including singer-songwriter Dua Lipa, actor and racer Patrick Dempsey, fashion model Naomi Campbell and French soccer manager and former player Zinedine Zidane.",
      "There was strategic jeopardy in the race after F1 introduced a new rule for the Monaco Grand Prix requiring that every driver must make at least two pit stops through the race, an attempt to spice up an event where the narrow streets make overtaking difficult. This rule created a series of permutations on tire strategy, forcing teams to rethink their approach.",
      "As they raced past Casino Square in Monte Carlo each lap, some drivers gambled on early pit stops in the hope of making up ground later, and certain teams used their second driver as a roadblock to create a gap for their leading driver.",
      "A group of cars down the order made their first pit stop early, saving time due to a \u201cvirtual safety car\u201d caused by Sauber\u2019s Gabriel Bortoleto hitting the wall. Others \u2014 most notably Mercedes, which qualified poorly \u2014 sought to go long on their race-starting tires in the hopes of a quicker pit stop due to a safety car. It didn\u2019t come.",
      "Finishing in fifth was Ferrari\u2019s Lewis Hamilton, ahead of rookie Isack Hadjar of Racing Bulls in sixth and Esteban Ocon of Haas in seventh.",
      "In post-race interviews broadcast on the F1TV app, the drivers expressed mixed feelings about the new rule. Some said they executed on it well, like Liam Lawson of Racing Bulls, who finished in eighth place. Others thought it was detrimental to the racing, like Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz of Williams, who finished ninth and 10th, respectively.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Albon said, accusing the Racing Bulls team of initiating the tactic to slow the rest of the pack down. \u201cIt\u2019s not really how we want to go racing. I don\u2019t like going racing like that. ... It just makes this messy, messy race. I could have brought a pillow in the car, and a coffee, and chilled out for a bit.\u201d",
      "Norris pitted on lap 20, the first of the front-runners to do so, and came out in fourth place. He made his way back to the lead as rivals came in for new tires, and never quite relinquished it. Verstappen pitted late twice in the hopes of a lucky safety car or a red flag, but the strategy didn\u2019t work to help him make up ground.",
      "Norris takes a step back from social media",
      "After he put in a brilliant qualifying performance to win pole position, the jovial Norris told reporters he\u2019s taking a step back from social media as he focuses on the championship race.",
      "He said it has helped improve his performance and mentality after he made a series of errors and admittedly fell short of his expectations over the last two months.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very, very happy because I feel like it\u2019s a waste of my life. I have better things to focus on,\u201d Norris said on Saturday. \u201cI have had many things to focus on and try to improve on. There\u2019s many, many factors that add up to a day like today. I can certainly say that\u2019s one of them. So, I\u2019m happy. Everyone can do their own thing, but for me, I\u2019m happy to stay away from that.\u201d",
      "Still, Norris said his goal was to achieve \u201cconsistency of results\u201d in order to call his Monaco performance a \u201cbreakthrough.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can look at it both ways. I can see, easily, the positive \u2014 it\u2019s a breakthrough in that I had a good Saturday. And for me, that\u2019s at least a step in the right direction, which I\u2019m very, very happy about. But it\u2019s still one weekend. And like I said, consistency is a big part of it too,\u201d Norris said Saturday after qualifying. \u201cI\u2019ll be happier if I know and I can get to that point where I\u2019m confident into every session that I can perform like I did today, because I think my performance was at a very, very strong level.\u201d"

      "Murthy, who served as surgeon general during the Obama and Biden administrations, said he would specifically like to see Congress pass legislation that would force social media apps to include warning labels about their harms to children and would allow for more data transparency from social media companies so that researchers can more accurately study the effects of the internet on kids.",
      "The former surgeon general compared social media to cars, pointing to the introduction of safety features like seat belts, air bags and crash testing decades ago.",
      "\u201cThose have reduced the number of deaths,\u201d Murthy told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do the same for social media, because what we\u2019re doing now, Kristen, is we\u2019re basically \u2014 it\u2019s the equivalent of putting our kids in cars with no seat belts, with no air bags, and having them drive on roads with no speed limits and no traffic lights. And that is just morally unacceptable.\u201d",
      "Congress has tried in recent years to pass legislation to better regulate social media platforms and their interactions with children, with the Senate passing the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children and Teens\u2019 Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0) last year with strong bipartisan support.",
      "But both bills faced headwinds from civil liberties groups and social media companies. COPPA 2.0 faced criticism from advertising companies as it sought to update a 1998 law of the same name by raising the age at which companies are allowed to collect information about children from 12 to 17. It also included provisions that would place limits on how third-party companies can advertise to children under 17.",
      "KOSA, meanwhile, would create a \u201cduty of care\u201d for social media companies, making them legally liable for feeding kids content that could be harmful to their mental health. Civil liberties groups warned that social media companies could overcompensate to reduce their legal liability, leading them to censor anything that could be deemed controversial.",
      "Neither bill received a vote on the House floor last year.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., reintroduced KOSA in the Senate earlier this month.",
      "Murthy, who is the author of the 2020 book \u201cTogether: Why Social Connection Holds the Key to Better Health, Higher Performance, and Greater Happiness,\u201d linked the rise in social media use among children to the broader loneliness epidemic, warning that chronic loneliness can be detrimental to people\u2019s health.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when it starts to increase inflammation in our body, increase our risk for heart disease, and other conditions that ultimately shorten our life,\u201d the former surgeon general said.",
      "Online connections, Murthy added, are not the same as connecting and sharing friendships and relationships with people in person.",
      "\u201cI worry about, for young people in particular, is the impact that technology is having on their social connection,\u201d the former surgeon general said. \u201cWe tend to think, \u2018Oh, kids are on social media. That\u2019s great because they\u2019re connected to one another.\u2019 But no, we have to recognize there\u2019s a difference between the connections you have online and the connections you have in person.\u201d",
      "Murphy warned that \u201cmore kids are struggling with this intense culture of self-comparison online, which is shredding their self-esteem.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of them are trying to be somebody that they\u2019re not online. And they actually don\u2019t have as many friendships in person as we all need. So you put this all together and what you see is escalating loneliness and isolation,\u201d he added.",

    "summary": "Robyn Hurder, Caroline Bowman and choreographer Joshua Bergasse discuss the Broadway production of \"Smash\" and how it was inspired by the 2012 NBC drama.",
    "story": [
      "When Robyn Hurder takes the stage in Broadway\u2019s \u201cSmash,\u201d she portrays the dream role of Marilyn Monroe \u2014 sort of.",
      "In the Broadway production inspired by the 2012 NBC drama of the same name, Hurder plays Ivy Lynn, a musical theater darling tackling the role of a lifetime in the fictional show \u201cBombshell.\u201d Ivy is introduced as a beloved leader of the still developing production, fostering friendly rapport with everyone from her understudy, Karen (Caroline Bowman), to director Nigel (Brooks Ashmanskas). But as the pressure of portraying an icon increases, her grip on reality declines, and she goes full method.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve loved Marilyn my entire life. She\u2019s been such an influence in my career on Broadway. The roles I play, I always put some of her into it, into any role I originate,\u201d Hurder tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut actually playing her is, obviously, it\u2019s intimidating, because she is the icon of icons.",
      "\u201cSo what made it easier for me to approach it is: I am Robyn Hurder, who\u2019s playing Ivy Lynn, who\u2019s playing Marilyn Monroe,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cSmash\u201d aims to give a behind-the-scenes look at how a Broadway production is made, portraying the heightened dramatics expected of musical theater. The opening number, \u201cLet Me Be Your Star,\u201d features Hurder singing in costume as Marilyn, before the perspective shifts, showing Hurder as Ivy rehearsing in a studio surrounded by backup dancers, writers and the show\u2019s producer.",
      "In addition to Hurder and Bowman, \u201cSmash\u2019s\u201d main characters are actors playing the creative forces at work behind the scenes, like co-writers Tracy (Krysta Rodriguez) and Jerry (John Behlmann) and director\u2019s assistant Chloe (Bella Coppola).",
      "It\u2019s a similar format to the original show \u201cSmash,\u201d which starred Megan Hilty as Ivy, Katharine McPhee as Karen, as well as Debra Messing and Christian Borle as \u201cBombshell\u2019s\u201d writers and Angelica Huston as the show\u2019s producer.",
      "But it's a very different style. Instead of following Ivy and Karen's battle to play Marilyn and other interpersonal melodramatic dynamics, the Broadway show goes full tilt comedy.",
      "Bowman, calling the production an entry into the \u201c\u2018Smash\u2019 multiverse,\u201d is confident that the differences will appeal to even the most dedicated superfan of the original show, which has achieved an almost cult-like legacy since its cancellation after Season 2.",
      "\u201cI do feel like if those cult followers came to see this musical, and if they do give it a chance, they\u2019re going to be really pleasantly surprised,\u201d Bowman says.",
      "\u201cThe way the show took itself too seriously and then didn\u2019t take itself too seriously \u2014 we do the same thing,\" she adds. \"We don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously, and we lean into the funny elements that everybody kind of laughed at on the TV show.\u201d",
      "Making a Musical About a Musical",
      "Joshua Bergasse, who choreographed both the 2012 show and the Broadway production, says the original idea for NBC\u2019s \u201cSmash\u201d was, \u201cWe\u2019ll do one season, and then we\u2019ll have the show within the show, and that show will then move to Broadway.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow, it actually took 14 years to make the first one come to Broadway,\u201d Bergasse adds with a laugh.",
      "Bergasse says part of why a Broadway production of \u201cBombshell\u201d \u2014 the musical about the life of Marilyn Monroe within the \u201cSmash\u201d storyline \u2014 didn\u2019t work is because the part of Marilyn would be simply too demanding.",
      "The \u201cSmash\u201d musical uses the same songs from the 2012 show, many of which are energetic, dance-heavy, blockbuster numbers, like \u201c20th Century Fox Mambo\u201d and \u201cThe National Pastime.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhoever played Marilyn would literally play one performance then probably die because she would have to do too much,\u201d Bergasse says.",
      "The show-within-a-show format offered a solution to that problem, with the Monroe numbers being performed by Ivy, Karen and even Chloe at one point.",
      "When it came to choreographing the show, Bergasse, who won an Emmy for his work on \u201cSmash\u201d and now is nominated for a 2025 Tony Award for best choreography, says he looked back at the TV series and \u201creinvented\u201d memorable moments for the stage. \u201cCut, Print... Moving On\u201d is now used to show the staccato pacing of rehearsals. \u201c20th Century Fox Mambo\u201d occurs as a backdrop to show the passage of time, Ivy\u2019s continuing descent into Marilyn madness and Karen\u2019s potential to take over the lead role.",
      "And as Bergasse was choreographing and developing the musical, the writers were taking notes. While the script was in development, Bergasse provided feedback on how the dialogue of a Broadway rehearsal would actually go.",
      "\"I would say to the writers, 'Guys, I would never say that,'\" Bergasse says with a laugh.",
      "\u201cI was just happy that it makes sense,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo all my dancer and choreographer friends will come and say, \u2018Oh, yeah, that\u2019s right.\u2019\u201d",
      "Bowman says the real-life actors also played a role in the show's creation, albeit unintentionally.",
      "\u201cI felt like the writers, too, kind of were really listening to conversations that we were having, because then suddenly, like lines would show up in the script and we\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh my gosh. That was said in rehearsal yesterday,\u2019\u201d Bowman said.",
      "When it came to preparing for the part, Hurder says playing Ivy took some of the pressure off as she donned Marilyn\u2019s iconic blond curls and white halter dress. She says she watched Monroe\u2019s movies, read biographies, and studied her mannerisms and speech patterns.",
      "\u201cPlaying Ivy Lynn, I\u2019m just being myself. Like when people see that, they\u2019re like, \u2018Well, you\u2019re Robyn,\u2019\u201d Hurder says.",
      "\u201cSo I kind of apply Robyn into Ivy, and then I did what Robyn would do,\" she adds. \"... I did not want to do an impression. I just want to honor (Marilyn Monroe) in the most authentic way.\u201d",
      "In the story of the show, as Ivy\u2019s method acting approach goes south, the creative team can't agree on how to tell the story of an icon. From the beginning, the show\u2019s writers insist they don\u2019t want to tell the sob story of Monroe; rather, they want to celebrate her status as legend. But as they write more songs and opening night barrels closer, they end up with emotional ballads, and the narrative arc bends toward tragedy.",
      "\u201cA lot of this stuff is stuff that happens \u2014 it\u2019s a little exaggerated for dramatical purposes, but it\u2019s not far off,\u201d Bergasse says. \u201cLots of times you create something, and you\u2019re like, \u2018Wait a minute that is not what I meant to do.\u2019",
      "\u201cWhen Jerry says at the end, \u2018How did we do everything exactly the opposite of what we meant to do?\u2019 You know, that happens,\u201d he adds.",
      "Updating a Cult Favorite",
      "When Hurder got the audition for Ivy, she went back to re-watch the 2012 show, 12 years later, and she \u201creally, really enjoyed it.\u201d",
      "But she adds, \"We can't take that TV show and put it on stage in 2025. We had to change it. They wanted to make it a comedy, and we need to laugh right now.\"",
      "The script is notably different, including how it portrays the nature of Ivy and Karen's relationship. Instead of the perpetual chorus girl going up against the naive Broadway newbie, Ivy is a beloved veteran of the stage and Karen is her longtime friend and understudy.",
      "Like Hurder, Bowman says Karen \u201cfeels very close to who I am as a human.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know what it feels like to cover a star,\u201d says Bowman, who before \u201cSmash,\u201d was the standby for Norma Desmond in \u201cSunset Boulevard.\u201d \u201cI have been a swing and understudy, a standby, a principal, supporting and leading lady. So it\u2019s really not difficult to tap into what it feels like to always be ready and be on the edge of your seat.\u201d",
      "Karen and Ivy\u2019s friendship is established early in the Broadway production. Hurder describes them as \u201cbest friends\u201d with a strong working relationship.",
      "The musical also touches on the note that their bond transcends a job. Ivy goes on to alienate the rest of the cast, including her friend, but in the end, it\u2019s Karen who helps pull her back to the reality and says, \u201cOur friendship means more than anything to me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s just not trendy to pit women against each other,\u201d Bowman says, emphasizing the importance of this in 2025. \u201cThese girls, they butt heads, but in a different way and it's kind of a funny way. I just think it\u2019s so special to have two women, especially two leading ladies like Robyn and I, be in the show together and be on each other\u2019s same level.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s hilarious is like, I would never be able to understudy Robyn Hurder in my real life,\u201d Bowman adds. \u201cI can\u2019t do what that woman can do.\u201d"

      "His wife, Nancy Falconer (Katherine Waterston), is shocked by the revelation, but stays behind to answer the police's questions as Tiffany and Lori \u2014 who happen to be neighbors \u2014 are sent home with police officers.",
      "In the car ride home, Tiffany begins her redemption, apologizing to Lori and admitting that she was \"never good enough\" for her parents, and she's always \"felt like nothing.\"",
      "\"You start to sympathize with her,\" Fowler says. \"And I definitely, when reading the script, sympathized with Tiffany because it\u2019s back to that kind of teenage girl going through mental turmoil. You start seeing her as this real human, young woman.\"",
      "Finna Strazza describes her character as just being a \"product of her environment.\"",
      "\"She has always had a lot of pressure put on her her whole life, by her family, by her peers,\" she adds.",
      "When the girls finally reach their homes, Tiffany asks Lori not to leave. Lori offers to stay and goes inside, and the two spark a \"potential friendship\" after the night's bloody events, Fowler says.",
      "\"Lori will always choose to care for somebody and choose to be selfless,\" Fowler says.",
      "Eventually, Nancy Falconer gets home, but she's not a concerned mother \u2014 she's another killer. She grabs a knife and begins chasing the girls through the house while humming. Terrified, they hide in the closet. There, Tiffany begins freaking out that both her parents are dangerous, yet it turns out she is, too. Tiffany pulls out a knife and tries to kill Lori.",
      "Strazza says this part was not initially in the script.",
      "\u201cThe original version I read, Tiffany was not involved at all, and it was just the parents,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the scene that I was doing for my audition, she was just crying, and was like, \u2018Mom, how could you do this?\u2019\u201d",
      "Director Matt Palmer had her improvise being the killer during her final audition. Strazza landed the part, and the script was altered so she was involved in the gruesome finale.",
      "Even with the threat of Tiffany, Lori escapes, running into the hallway where Nancy stabs her in the shoulder blade. With Lori injured, Nancy admits that she used to date Lori's dad and reveals she killed him after he left her for Lori's mom. Nancy prepares to kill Lori, but Tiffany asks to do it.",
      "\"I warned you,\" Tiffany tells Lori before Lori kicks her, sending her flying over the banister where she is then impaled on a table decoration below.",
      "Strazza says that she always likes to do her own stunts, and this 12-foot fall was no different. She describes it as a \"roller coaster.\" But when it came time for the impalement, that was a silicone mold.",
      "\"They made an entirely silicone mold of my entire body, where I was first covered in silicone,\" she says. \"And while that hardened, they covered that in plaster, so I was just kind of stuck as this statue. It ended up taking six and a half hours to get my whole body, but the artistry that was involved in that was so impressive because it looked exactly like me. And it was kind of spooky to see that on set.\"",
      "\"I would walk past my own dead body, which was frightening,\" she adds.",
      "What does Lori's final line mean?",
      "With just Nancy left, Lori tries to escape, but the doors are locked. Eventually, Lori grabs a trophy and whacks Nancy in the head with it. She falls to the ground, slowly dying as she begs Lori for help.",
      "But Lori just walks away as Nancy spews insults, calling her \"trash,\" \"nothing\" and a \"nobody.\"",
      "Nancy's final words before slumping to her death are, \"Who the f--- do you think you are?\"",
      "\"I'm Lori f---ing Granger,\" Lori responds.",
      "Fowler considers the whole film to be Lori's journey to \"self-realization,\" with this final moment being her true acceptance of self.",
      "\"'I\u2019m Lori f---ing Granger' is that moment,\" she says. \"It\u2019s earnest. And she really has gone through it. And been there, like you\u2019ve seen her go through the turmoil.\"",
      "Fowler believes that after the film ends, Lori is \"definitely traumatized,\" but she hopes she comes to terms with what has happened.",
      "\"It would be interesting to imagine how she deals with self-redemption and self-acceptance, which I hope she's experiencing post film,\" she says.",
      "What does the end credit scene mean?",
      "Even though the film is on Netflix, stick around a little longer for an end credit scene. Although it's brief, fans of the \"Fear Street\" franchise will recognize the end credit scene ties the film back to the original trilogy.",
      "The end credit scene shows Nancy Falconer's dead body lying on the ground, blood oozing from her head. But then, the blood begins to form into the Witch's Mark \u2014 also known as the Devil\u2019s Mark from the original franchise.",
      "In the initial trilogy, the Witch's Mark was where Shadyside residents were sacrificed by the Goode family to Satan.",
      "Fowler calls this moment \"a nod to the curse\" from the original trilogy and a way for their film to \"pay homage\" to the origins.",
      "\"This film is its own thing,\" she says. \"You don't necessarily have to watch the first three to understand this film, but I think that they did such a good job of doing the subtle nod to the fact that Shadyside is a cursed town, and it's inescapable and it's still apparent.\"",
      "She adds that the end credits aren't the only \"Easter egg\" to the original trilogy. In fact, at the beginning of the film, there's a small shrine to everyone who died in the 1978 camp massacre, alluding to the events of the second film.",
      "Were the Falconers cursed?",
      "With that in mind, it begs the question: Was the Falconer family another victim of the curse of Shadyside?",
      "Strazza thinks so.",
      "\"I think there's something in the water,\" she says. \"I think that it's not a coincidence that these crazy people end up on the loose. Who knows who is connected to the Falconers in the past?\"",
      "Personally, Strazza thinks Tiffany \"sold her soul to the devil.\"",
      "One potential reason? Strazza pitches a search for \"forever beauty.\"",
      "\"That would be something the Falconers would be into,\" she adds."

      "The premise takes place after Lord Voldemort has been defeated, and Dolores Umbridge is being put on trial. Guests enter a lift and soon after the ride begins, they are greeted by Harry, Ron and Hermione, all of whom are on their way to see Umbridge\u2019s trial. However, things take a turn when Umbridge escapes, and a quest to stop her before she does permanent damage ensues.",

      "\u201cI feel like in Utah, it\u2019s very common, parents definitely want their kids to be doing an activity. That\u2019s just kind of something that is, like, very prominent. Like, you put your kid in something and you really put them all in,\" Arnold, 31, said during a recent appearance on the \u201cHot Smart Rich\u201d podcast.",
      "The Provo, Utah native, whose younger sister, Rylee Arnold, later made her own debut as a \u201cDWTS\" pro in 2023, said the pair's parents \"loved pushing\" them in their dancing \"passions\" when they were kids because it kept them \"out of trouble.\"",
      "\u201cIf we weren\u2019t at home for hours after school, just bored out of our minds looking for something to do, we weren\u2019t getting in as much trouble,\" she explained.",
      "\u201cThe Mormon culture,\" she continued, \"is very much, like, we want our kids to be good kids and to not get into trouble and to not explore different things that could lead them in troubled areas,\u201d she said.",

      "She described Utah\u2019s dance culture as \u201cvery intense in the best way.\u201d",
      "\"There\u2019s been so many of us (from Utah) that have kind of paved the way that these dancers and parents see what\u2019s possible,\" she said. \"So they\u2019re more willing to put (in) money, time. Because dance is a full-on investment.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \"Sirens.\"",
      "Is Michaela Kell's mysterious lifestyle really a cult? The question that loomed over the five episodes of Netflix's \"Sirens\" is finally answered in the finale, which premiered on May 22.",
      "The resolution of an explosive weekend on a lavish New England island leaves no character unscathed, as the lives of the people in Michaela's orbit are completely upended.",
      "Julianne Moore, who stars as Michaela in the series, tells TODAY.com the series started as a look at the Greek myth of sirens \u2014 winged creatures, half-birds and half-women, with songlike voices capable of luring sailors at sea to their demise.",
      "\u201cWhy do we hear about the sirens from this perspective? We always hear about it from the sailors\u2019 perspectives, not from the sirens\u2019 perspective,\u201d Moore says. \u201cSo it\u2019s like, what are the sirens asking for? And in fact, why are they responsible and not the men?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe men are always saying, \u2018These women lured me in. These women made me crash my ship. These women made me throw my life away.\u2019 Suddenly, these men have no agency. They have no autonomy,\u201d she adds.",
      "Moore says it was the daughter of the series\u2019 showrunner, Molly Smith Metzler, who asked her mom the questions about Greek sirens that led her to write the play the series is based on.",
      "\u201cI think Molly wanted to incorporate that idea into the show, this idea of, \u2018What\u2019s their story?\u2019\u201d Moore says.",
      "What is 'Sirens' about?",
      "The five-episode Netflix series also stars Meghann Fahy as Devon, who travels to the island after being unable to reach her sister Simone, played by Milly Alcock, who is employed as Michaela's assistant.",
      "Devon's arrival on the island causes utter chaos in Michaela's perfectly precise and planned out life. The final episode starts at the end of the whirlwind weekend, as Michaela's annual gala is just beginning.",
      "Michaela has been preparing for the event with beloved assistant Simone by her side for months, but the party gets upended when Michaela decides to fire her hours before it's set to begin. The socialite discovered that her husband, Peter Kell (Kevin Bacon), kissed Simone \u2014 and had photographic evidence to prove his infidelity.",
      "While Simone insisted Peter came on to her and that she walked away after the kiss, the discovery came after Michaela found out Simone had been lying to her about her secret relationship with Peter's best friend Ethan (Glenn Howerton).",
      "Simone and Ethan did go public with their relationship earlier in the season, leading him to propose to her, but Simone turned him down. After the rejection, Ethan began to spiral, and he fell off of a cliff while fighting with Simone.",
      "How does 'Sirens' end?",
      "The beginning of Episode 5 starts with Ethan recovering in the hospital, and when he sees Simone in the room, he starts screaming and telling her to get out. Kevin sticks up for Simone, telling Ethan he needs to respect her.",
      "Moore says the series represents a push-and-pull of power dynamics between men and women. While it may look like Michaela is calling the shots, it\u2019s really Peter who is pulling the strings all along.",
      "\u201cPeter Kell has all the power because he has all the money, and this is very much about social and economic hierarchy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when you really peel it back, you realize the person making the decisions, if you go all the way up, is that billionaire.\u201d",
      "After Peter asks Michaela why she fired Simone, he sees Simone running down to the beach. He follows her, and he tells her that the end of her employment was his fault and that he would fix it. She says she has to tell him something, but the scene cuts away.",
      "The gala is in full swing back at the house as Devon confronts Michaela about the rumors she's a cult leader \u2014 and that she killed Peter's first wife \u2014 in front of all of the guests. Michaela shares that after Peter's divorce, his ex-wife had botched plastic surgery and became a recluse, shutting down all of the town gossip.",
      "After the confrontation, Peter approaches Michaela and asks to talk to her in private. He then tells her he wants a divorce after he claims she kept him from his children from his previous marriage. He also reveals that he had found the photo of him and Simone \u2014 and destroyed it.",
      "Moore says she thinks Devon's arrival on the island may have ignited the tension between Michaela and Peter, but adds their marriage was doomed no matter what.",
      "\"I think it was inevitable,\" Moore says. \"I think these kind of situations, particularly in marriages, if that\u2019s gonna happen, that\u2019s gonna happen. So it\u2019s not like Devon not coming would have changed anything. I think there would have been the same result.\"",
      "After Michaela storms out of the room, Simone walks down a set of stairs wearing an evening gown. Peter extends his hand, and walks her out \u2014 signaling that what they talked about down at the beach was starting a real relationship.",
      "As they walk into the gala, Simone sees Devon and fills her in that she's now with Peter, much to Devon's shock. Devon says she is going to go back to Buffalo to take care of their father, and the pair share a tearful goodbye when it's clear Simone is planning to stay on the island with Peter.",
      "Simone gets up and gives a toast to the gala's attendees, standing in Michaela's usual place. Devon gets on a ferry back to the mainland.",
      "On the ferry, she runs into Michaela and the pair have a heartfelt conversation about what's next for them.",
      "\"I think she\u2019s ready to get on with her life,\" Moore says of her character. \"In a sense, she\u2019s kind of back to herself. She\u2019s really back to someone who doesn\u2019t know what her future is, but she has agency, and she\u2019ll make decisions based on her own life and her own needs. So I actually think she\u2019s in a good place.\"",
      "The episode ends with a shot of Simone standing in front of Peter's home, looking out at what is now hers and thinking about all it took for her to get here \u2014 and what happened to the person who got in her way."

      "\u201cHonest to God, I thought she was great,\u201d Willie continues, adding that her chill vibe made it feel like they were just having lunch at her house. \u201cIt\u2019s a good reminder of what it\u2019s like to be on that side of it, about making our guests comfortable so that they open up more, reveal and feel like it\u2019s a place where they can really share.\u201d"

      "On Oct. 5, 2023, as bullets ripped into his apartment and rockets exploded nearby, he said he hid under his bed. When he emerged, he said eight or nine RSF members had surrounded him and asked if he was a member of the military.",
      "Refusing to believe he was a civilian, Ali said they started \u201cbeating me like crazy.\u201d Accusing him of being in the military, he said they \u201cwere just pointing guns at my face, shooting it next to my ears, next to my feet\u201d and threatening to kill him.",

      "He said he could smell \u201cweed and alcohol\u201d on the breath of the fighters who hit him with pipes and sticks and threatened to shoot him in mock executions. The beatings only stopped at night after other RSF fighters complained about the screaming because they were trying to sleep, Ali added.",
      "After 10 days, Ali said he was allowed to contact his family who provided evidence that he was a civilian. This, he said, led to a complete change in attitude from his captors, who took him somewhere for a shower and gave him new clothes. Over a large meal, he said an RSF member apologized for his mistreatment.",

      "After he was released on Oct. 31, he said he immediately sought medical treatment. His hand had to be re-broken so it could heal properly, he added.",
      "Then he fled Sudan for Egypt, where he is waiting to be resettled by the U.N. Asked whether he accepted the RSF\u2019s apology, he said, \u201cAbsolutely not. They ruined my country.\u201d",

      "With her husband back in the U.K., she said she moved in with her mother-in-law, Asmaa, 70, and over the course of 18 months watched as law and order broke down and armed gangs roamed the neighborhood \u201cstealing from houses and people were getting killed.\u201d",
      "A 12-year-old friend of her son \u201cwas shot by a sniper,\u201d Natasha, 47, tearfully recalled, adding that the bullet \u201cwent through him and it went through his sister.\u201d",

      "She said that her driver cleared RSF checkpoints without stopping, before dropping her off near a military checkpoint.",
      "As they neared, Natasha said soldiers fired above their heads and she quickly waved a piece of white clothing. The shooting stopped and they were allowed across the checkpoint.",

      "Sudan\u2019s military said Tuesday it had taken full control of the Greater Khartoum region, but the RSF still controls most of the western region of Darfur and some other areas where battles continue to rage.",
      "The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in Darfur, according to the U.N. and international rights groups. In March the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund reported that armed men have raped hundreds of children, including some as young as 1.",
      "On Thursday, the United States said it would impose sanctions on\u00a0Sudan's government after it determined that Sudan used chemical weapons last year. They will include limits on U.S. exports and government lines of credit, and they will take effect around June 6, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement.",
      "Sudan rejected the move and described the allegations as false in a statement.",
      "Nonetheless, 24.6 million people, or around half the population, face acute hunger, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification \u2014 an organization that sets a scale the United Nations and governments use to assess hunger.",
      "\u201cI did my very best not to leave Sudan, but yeah, the situation just wasn\u2019t really helping,\u201d Ali, the photographer, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting better. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d"

      "The phone call between President Donald Trump and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin may not have achieved great strides on ending the war in Ukraine, but it did confirm one thing: The bromance is real. But a question is left hanging: What does this bonhomie actually deliver for the men in the Kremlin and White House?",
      "\u201cThe tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent,\u201d Trump said of his Russian counterpart after their two-hour conversation Monday, adding that Putin is a \u201cnice gentleman.\u201d Putin adviser Yuri Ushakov, meanwhile, said Trump and Putin called each other by their first names and \u201cneither of them wanted to end the conversation.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Putin commissioned a portrait of his American counterpart and delivered it to him. One of Trump\u2019s envoys, Steve Witkoff, told Tucker Carlson in March that the president was \u201cclearly touched\u201d by what he called a \u201cbeautiful\u201d portrait.",
      "Trump is not just seeking an end to the war in Ukraine, which Russia started by launching its large-scale 2022 invasion; in addition, he has made no secret of his desire to do lucrative deals with a Kremlin reintroduced to the international financial fold.",
      "In April he wrote on Truth Social that he was \u201chopeful Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week,\u201d adding that \u201cboth will then start to do big business with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "Before that happens, Trump and his team have suggested they want the war to end, something the president has made a clear political goal, having promised during his presidential campaign that it would take just 24 hours to secure, although he later told Time magazine that this was an \u201cexaggeration.\u201d",
      "His call with Putin appears to have brought that no closer to fruition, with a chasm still aching between Ukraine\u2019s willingness for a 30-day ceasefire and Russia\u2019s demand for Kyiv\u2019s effective surrender.",
      "It\u2019s not been a total love-in between the leaders of these former Cold War foes. Trump has expressed frustration with his Russian counterpart for continuing to launch missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians while negotiations to end the fighting are ongoing.",
      "And Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the White House is not asking the Senate to hold back on a bill that would slap a 500% tariff on imports from countries that buy Russian oil, gas and other products.",
      "But one thing that Putin\u2019s personal connection with Trump does is buy him time, according to Mark Galeotti, director of the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "Putin has shown little desire for any sort of ceasefire that does not satisfy his maximalist goals. And right now his forces continue to make slow but steady battlefield advances in eastern Ukraine, according to independent monitors like the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War think tank.",
      "So, with negotiations at an impasse, Putin will be more than happy to delay any definite decision \u2014 on both American support for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, Galeotti said.",
      "\u201cEvery week counts\u201d in this \u201cparticularly pivotal moment,\u201d Galeotti said. If his call with Trump delays making any decisions, then \u201cI think Putin will see it as a good job done,\u201d he said.",
      "As with its lack of detail on how the war might end, the call also provided little clarity on whether or when Trump and Putin might meet in person, something they have both suggested could happen. If and when this real-world t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate does take place, it will be harder for Putin to resist giving Trump something, according to Galeotti.",
      "The Russians are \u201ctrying to avoid giving anything because they are very, very hard-nosed negotiators,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they do meet in person, then Trump will have to leave with something.\u201d",
      "While no date for a meeting between the two leaders has been set, their longtime fondness has long caused widespread alarm across the West. Intelligence agencies see Putin as a foe who has challenged international norms through hybrid warfare such as cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against democratic institutions.",
      "Asked for a response to these criticisms, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in an email that \u201cunlike his predecessor, President Trump is willing to look anyone in the eye and negotiate deals that deliver peace.\u201d",
      "Kelly said that \u201cthanks to his leadership\u201d Russia and Ukraine \u201cwill begin ceasefire talks to stop the killing in the bloodiest European war since World War II.\u201d A date and venue for ceasefire talks has not been set.",
      "The American president\u2019s connection with Putin has roots at least as far back as 2013, when he visited Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant and pondered on Twitter whether Putin will \u201cbecome my new best friend?\u201d",
      "By 2015, before the two men had even met, Putin was heaping praise on Trump as a \u201ccolorful, talented person,\u201d something the American leader said was a \u201cgreat honor\u201d coming from the \u201chighly respected\u201d Russian leader.",
      "A year later, Trump openly urged Putin to influence the American presidential election, telling a rally in Doral, Florida, that \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201d This was in the eyes of many observers an overt invitation for Russian intelligence services to hack into the account of his opponent, Hillary Clinton.",
      "Putin would indeed conduct a campaign to interfere, according to a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released in 2020.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, the pair met on multiple occasions without any staff present, a highly unusual departure from standard protocol. But the Russian government would ultimately conclude that while the president himself was friendly, his administration was not. The Trump White House imposed sanctions and withdrew from a nuclear deal it said Russia wasn\u2019t respecting.",
      "Now Trump\u2019s second term looks like it could be a repeat.",
      "Asked about future opportunities for face-to-face diplomacy between himself Putin, Trump replied: \u201cWe have to meet. He and I will meet. I think we\u2019ll solve it, or maybe not.\u201d"

      "In 2018, Trump said \u201cnobody treats us much worse than the European Union\u201d and argued the bloc was designed to exploit the U.S. He repeated that claim this year, describing the E.U. as being \u201cformed in order to screw the United States.\u201d",

      "Vice President J.D. Vance lashed out in February at European leaders at a security conference in Munich over issues ranging from free speech to migration and defense, dealing a sucker punch to the European view of America as a steadfast cultural ally.",
      "\u201cThe threat that I worry the most about vis-\u00e0-vis Europe,\u201d Vance said, \u201cis the threat from within \u2014 the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "That came after Elon Musk \u2014 the world\u2019s richest man, who also served as Trump\u2019s close adviser earlier in his second term \u2014 threw his support behind Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany party, which has called for Germany to leave the E.U.",
      "Underlying much of the second Trump administration\u2019s animosity toward Europe has been security funding, most prominently over the war in Ukraine.",
      "While the administration\u2019s view of the war in Ukraine has since softened, Vance has repeatedly opposed sending military aid to Kyiv, saying in February that \u201cI don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\u201d",
      "And in a Signal conversation between senior administration officials leaked in March, the vice president initially resisted U.S. strikes in Yemen, arguing he didn\u2019t want to \u201cbail Europe out,\u201d while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that Europe was treating America like a \u201csucker\u201d by relying on it for defense.",
      "While \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d\u2019s call for a \u201cdeal that works for both\u201d reflects the E.U.\u2019s characteristically restrained response to the Trump administration\u2019s jabs, Europe has been bracing itself for months for the possibility of a more distant economic relationship with the U.S. too.",
      "Earlier this month, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said the bloc preferred to negotiate, \u201cbut not at any cost,\u201d before announcing more than $100 billion worth of possible retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods the following day.",
      "Europe also appears to be preparing for a future without America\u2019s guarantee of European security against Russia. Germany this week deployed a permanent military brigade beyond its borders for the first time since the end of World War II.",
      "A brewing trade war with the bloc throws into relief the position of Britain, which voted to leave the E.U. in 2016, but recently signed a trade deal with Europe and an economic deal with the U.S.",
      "London appears to have sidestepped the steepest tariffs after Trump agreed last month to hold the levy on British goods at 10%, but the U.K. must now walk a delicate line: maintaining its \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Washington while seeking closer alignment with its largest trading partner in Brussels.",
      "But with tensions rising across the Atlantic, even allies risk being caught in the crossfire. The E.U. \u2014 a geopolitical heavyweight in its own right \u2014 is unlikely to take hefty U.S. tariffs lying down without making moves of its own."

      "Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday for his revenge thriller \"It Was Just an Accident,\" handing the festival's top prize to a director who had been banned from leaving Iran for more than 15 years.",
      "Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who three years ago was imprisoned in Iran before going on a hunger strike. For a decade and a half, he has made films clandestinely in his native country, including one film (\"This Is Not a Film\") made in his living room, and another (\"Taxi\") set in a car.",
      "The crowd rose in a thunderous standing ovation for the filmmaker, who immediately threw up his arms and leaned back in his seat in disbelief before applauding his collaborators and the audience around him. On stage, Panahi was cheered by Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche, who in 2010 at the festival held up Panahi's name to honor the director then under house arrest.",
      "On stage, Panahi said what mattered most was freedom in his country.",
      "\"Let us join forces,\" said Panahi. \"No one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do or what we should not do. The cinema is a society. Nobody is entitled to tell what we should or refrain from doing.\"",
      "\"Let's continue to hope,\" he concluded.",
      "The win for \"It Was Just an Accident\" extend one of the most unprecedented streaks in movies: The indie distributor Neon has backed the last six Palme d'or winners. Neon, which acquired \"It Was Just an Accident\" for North American distribution after its premiere in Cannes, follows its Palmes for \"Parasite,\" \"Titane,\" \"Triangle of Sadness,\" \"Anatomy of a Fall\" and \"Anora.\"",
      "All those films were Oscar contenders and two, \"Parasite\" and \"Anora,\" won best picture.",
      "Last year, filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran to attend the premiere of his film in Cannes, and resettle in Germany. Panahi, though, has said life in exile isn't for him. He planned to fly home to Tehran on Sunday.",
      "\"It Was Just an Accident\" was inspired by Panahi's experience in jail. In it, a group of former prisoners encounter the man who terrorized them in jail, and weigh whether or not to kill him.",
      "\"The film springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today,\" Binoche told reporters after the ceremony. \"Art will always win. What is human will always win.\"",

      "\"We live in a time of tremendous excess and saturation of images. Moving images are being thrown at us all the time,\" said Trier. \"And I want to give homage to the Cannes Film Festival for being a place where the big cinematic image, which is the foundation of the moving image, the free image, the image that we take time to look at, the image where we can identify with each other in contemplation and empathy, to be cherished in this place in such a way is very important in this moment.\"",
      "Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho's Brazilian political thriller \"The Secret Agent\" won two big awards: best director for Filho and best actor for Wagner Moura. Though Cannes juries are generally urged to spread awards around, the two for \"The Secret Agent\" showed the jury's strong feelings for it. Asked about the two prizes, juror Jeremy Strong explained, simply, \"That was our wish.\"",
      "The wins, which followed the international film Oscar victory for Walter Salles' \"I'm Still Here\" in March, gave Brazil more to celebrate. On X, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said the awards \"show that our country's cinema is second to none.\"",
      "The jury prize was split between two films: \u00d3liver Laxe's desert road trip \"Sir\u00e2t \" and Mascha Schilinski's German, generation-spanning drama \"Sound of Falling.\" Best actress went to Nadia Melliti for \"The Little Sister,\" Hafsia Herzi's French coming-of-age drama.",
      "The Belgian brothers Jean-Luc and Pierre Dardennes, who are two-time Palme d'Or winners, won best screenplay for their latest drama, \"Young Mothers.\" Cannes' award for best first film went to Hasan Hadi, for \"The President's Cake,\" making it the first Iraqi film to win an award at the festival.",
      "What else shaped Cannes this year",
      "Saturday's ceremony brings to a close a 78th Cannes Film Festival where geopolitics cast a long shadow, both on screen and off. Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world's largest movie market, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.",
      "Most filmmakers responded with a shrug, calling the plan illogical. \"Can you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn't ship that way,\" said Wes Anderson, who premiered his latest, \"The Phoenician Scheme\" at the festival.",
      "That was one of the top American films in Cannes, along with Spike Lee's \"Highest 2 Lowest,\" the Christopher McQuarrie-Tom Cruise actioner \"Mission: Impossible \u2014 Final Reckoning\" and Ari Aster's \"Eddington.\""

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio also issued a 180-day waiver under the Caesar Act to ensure that sanctions do not obstruct investment and to facilitate the provision of electricity, energy, water and sanitation and enable humanitarian efforts, he said in a statement.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s actions represent the first step in delivering on the President\u2019s vision of a new relationship between Syria and the United States,\u201d Rubio said, adding that Trump had made clear his expectation that sanctions relief would be followed by action by the Syrian government.",
      "The White House said after Trump met Sharaa last week that the president asked Syria to adhere to several conditions in exchange for sanctions relief, including telling all foreign militants to leave Syria, deporting what he called Palestinian terrorists, and helping the U.S. prevent the resurgence of ISIS.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is providing the Syrian government with the chance to promote peace and stability, both within Syria and in Syria\u2019s relations with its neighbors,\u201d Rubio said.",

      "Most of the U.S. sanctions on Syria were imposed on the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and key individuals in 2011 after civil war erupted there. Sharaa led militias that overthrew Assad in December.",
      "The general license names Sharaa, formerly sanctioned under the name Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani, among the people and entities with whom transactions are now authorized. It also lists Syrian Arab Airlines, the Central Bank of Syria and a number of other banks, several state oil and gas companies and the Four Seasons Damascus hotel.",
      "Trump unexpectedly announced last week that he would lift the sanctions at the behest of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, a major U.S. policy shift he made before meeting briefly with Sharaa in Riyadh.",
      "It is hoped that easing Syria sanctions will clear the way for greater engagement by humanitarian organizations working in Syria, encouraging foreign investment and trade as the country rebuilds. But the U.S. has imposed layers of measures against Syria, cutting it off from the international banking system and barring many imports, and the potential for sanctions on a country to return can chill private-sector investment.",

      "The stakes are high for both sides. President Donald Trump wants to curtail Tehran\u2019s potential to produce a nuclear weapon that could trigger a regional nuclear arms race and perhaps threaten Israel. The Islamic Republic, for its part, wants to be rid of devastating sanctions on its oil-based economy.",
      "Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said on X the talks between Araghchi and Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had ended \u201cwith some but not conclusive progress\u201d.",
      "Ahead of the talks, Araghchi wrote on X: \u201cZero nuclear weapons = we Do have a deal. Zero enrichment = we do NOT have a deal. Time to decide.\u201d",
      "Among remaining stumbling blocks are Tehran\u2019s refusal to ship abroad its entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium \u2014 possible raw material for nuclear bombs \u2014 or engage in discussions over its ballistic missile program.",
      "Diplomats have said reaching a concrete deal before the summer would technically be impossible given the complexities of an accord. In the meantime, a senior Iranian official involved in nuclear talks with the U.S. said \u201cif Washington drops its \u2018zero enrichment\u2019 demand, a political agreement is feasible.\u201d",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday that Washington was working to reach an accord that would allow Iran to have a civil nuclear energy program but not enrich uranium, while acknowledging that this \u201cwill not be easy\u201d.",
      "Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last say on matters of state, rejected demands to stop refining uranium as \u201cexcessive and outrageous\u201c, warning that such talks were unlikely to yield results.",
      "Iran says it is ready to accept some limits on enrichment, but needs watertight guarantees that Washington would not renege on a future nuclear accord.",
      "Trump in his first term in 2018 ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between major powers and Iran. Since returning to office this year, he has restored a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign on Tehran and reimposed sweeping U.S. sanctions that continue to hobble the Iranian economy.",
      "Iran responded by escalating enrichment far beyond the 2015 pact\u2019s limits.",
      "Wendy Sherman, a former U.S. undersecretary who led the U.S. negotiating team that reached the 2015 agreement, earlier said that Tehran presents enrichment as a matter of sovereignty.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it is possible to get a deal with Iran where they literally dismantle their program, give up their enrichment, even though that would be ideal,\u201d she told Reuters.",
      "The cost of failure of the talks could be high. Iran\u2018s arch-foe Israel sees Iran\u2018s nuclear program as an existential threat and says it would never allow the clerical establishment to obtain nuclear weapons. Tehran says it has no such ambitions and the purposes are purely civilian.",
      "Israel\u2019s strategic affairs minister and the head of its foreign intelligence service, Mossad, were also due to be in Rome for talks with the U.S. negotiators, a source aware of the matter told Reuters.",
      "Araghchi said Thursday that Washington would bear legal responsibility if Israel attacked Iranian nuclear installations, following a CNN report that Israel might be preparing strikes."

    "story": [
      "Ukraine's capital came under a large-scale Russian drone and missile attack overnight and into early Saturday that left at least 15 people injured, according to Ukrainian officials. Explosions and machine gun fire were heard throughout Kyiv as many sought shelter in subway stations.",
      "The attack came hours after Russia and Ukraine began a major prisoner exchange of hundreds of soldiers and civilians, the first phase of a swap agreed on by the two sides at a meeting in Istanbul last week.",
      "The agreement was a rare moment of cooperation in otherwise failed efforts to reach a ceasefire in the 3-year-old war.",
      "Russia attacked Ukraine with 14 ballistic missiles and 250 Shahed drones overnight, officials said, adding that Ukrainian forces shot down 6 missiles and neutralized 245 drones \u2014 128 drones were shot down and 117 were thwarted using electronic warfare.",
      "The Kyiv City Military Administration said it was one of the most massive combined missile and drone attacks on the capital.",
      "\u201cA difficult night for all of us,\u201d the administration said in a statement.",
      "The debris of intercepted missiles and drones fell in at least six city districts of the Ukrainian capital. According to the acting head of Kyiv's military administration, Tymur Tkachenko, six people required medical care after the attack and two fires were sparked in the Solomianskyi district of Kyiv.",
      "The Obolon district, where a residential building was heavily damaged in the attack, was the hardest hit. There were at least five wounded in the area, the administration said.",
      "Yurii Bondarchuk, a local resident, said the air raid siren \u201cstarted as usual, then the drones started to fly around as they constantly do.\u201d",
      "Moments later, he heard a boom and saw shattered glass fly through the air.",
      "\u201cThe balcony is totally wiped out, as well as the windows and the doors,\u201d he said, describing the damage to his apartment as he stood in the dark of the night, smoking a cigarette to calm his nerves while firefighters worked to extinguish the flames.",
      "The air raid alert in Kyiv lasted more than seven hours, warning of incoming missiles and drones.",
      "Kyiv's mayor, Vitalii Klitschko, warned residents ahead of the attack that more than 20 Russian strike drones were heading toward the city. As the attack continued, he said drone debris fell on a shopping mall and a residential building in Obolon district of Kyiv. Emergency services were headed to the site, Klitschko said.",
      "The prisoner swap on Friday was the first phase of a complicated deal involving the exchange of 1,000 prisoners from each side.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the first phase of the deal brought home 390 Ukrainians, with further releases expected over the weekend, which will make it the largest swap of the war. Russia's Defense Ministry said it received the same number of people from Ukraine.",
      "The swap took place at the border with Belarus, in northern Ukraine, according to a Ukrainian official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "The released Russians were taken to Belarus for medical treatment, the Russian Defense Ministry said.",
      "However, the exchange \u2014 the latest of dozens of swaps since the war began and the biggest involving Ukrainian civilians so far \u2014 did not herald a halt in the fighting.",
      "Battles continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed, and neither country has relented in its deep strikes.",
      "After the May 16 Istanbul meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan called the prisoner swap a \u201cconfidence-building measure\u201d and said the parties had agreed in principle to meet again.",
      "But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that there has been no agreement yet on the venue for the next round of talks as diplomatic maneuvering continued.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow would give Ukraine a draft document outlining its conditions for a \u201csustainable, long-term, comprehensive\u201d peace agreement, once the ongoing prisoner exchange had finished.",
      "European leaders have accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of dragging his feet in peace efforts while he tries to press his larger army's battlefield initiative and capture more Ukrainian land.",
      "The Istanbul meeting revealed that both sides remained far apart on key conditions for ending the fighting. One such condition for Ukraine, backed by its Western allies, is a temporary ceasefire as a first step toward a peaceful settlement.",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry said it had shot down 788 Ukrainian drones away from the battlefield between May 20 and May 23.",
      "Ukraine's air force said Russia fired 175 Shahed and decoy drones, as well as a ballistic missile since late Thursday."

      "One of the 10 defendants was fully acquitted on charges of planning and carrying out the armed robbery during Paris Fashion Week in 2016, while another was convicted on a weapons charge that arose from the Kardashian probe \u2014 but wasn\u2019t directly tied to the original crime.",
      "Defendants were cleared of kidnapping allegations but three were convicted of a lesser, similar charge of sequestration with no voluntary liberation as Kardashian was bound at the scene but let there to be found safely.",

He says the real leader was someone called \u201cX\u201d or \u201cBen\u201d \u2014 who prosecutors assert does not exist.",
