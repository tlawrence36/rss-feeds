      "The annual Pritzker Architecture Prize has been awarded to Liu Jiakun of China, who earned the field\u2019s highest honor for \u201caffirming architecture that celebrates the lives of ordinary citizens.\u201d",
      "The annual Pritzker Architecture Prize has been awarded to Liu Jiakun of China, who earned the field\u2019s highest honor for \u201caffirming architecture that celebrates the lives of ordinary citizens,\u201d organizers announced Tuesday.",
      "Liu, based in Chengdu in China\u2019s southwestern Sichuan region, has said that the purpose of his architecture \u201cis to create a beautiful, just and dignified living environment,\u201d and that he tries to balance commercial needs with the human needs of the public.",
      "The architect \u201cupholds the transcendent power of the built environment through the harmonizing of cultural, historical, emotional and social dimensions, using architecture to forge community, inspire compassion and elevate the human spirit,\u201d Pritzker organizers said in a statement.",
      "Liu is known for creating public areas in highly populated cities where there is little public space, \u201cforging a positive relationship between density and open space,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Organizers cited his West Village in Chengdu, a 2015 five-story project that spans a block. It includes a perimeter of pathways for cyclists and pedestrians around \u201cits own vibrant city of cultural, athletic, recreational, office and business activities within, while allowing the public to view through to the surrounding natural and built environments.\u201d",
      "They also noted the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute Department of Sculpture in Chongqing, which they said displays an alternate solution to maximizing space, \u201cwith upper levels protruding outward to extend the square footage of a narrow footprint.\u201d",
      "In an interview Sunday in his office in Chengdu, Liu said he was not one of those architects who likes to have a strongly recognizable visual style. Rather, he said, he pays more attention to method and strategy.",
      "\u201cMany architects use a strong personal style and form to gain a foothold in the world,\u201d Liu told The Associated Press, speaking in Mandarin. \u201cNo matter where it is, people can tell immediately that it is his or her work with a very strong symbolism. But I am not such a kind of architect.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a very clear or obvious style that can be recognized as mine just at a glance,\u201d he said. \u201cI take a more methodological and strategic approach. I hope that when I go to a specific place, I can use my methodology and strategy to adapt to local conditions. I like to fully understand the place, and then look for resources, problems \u2026 and then distill and refine, and finally turn (this) into my work.\u201d",
      "Liu also said he tries to balance his country\u2019s artistic and architectural heritage with the realities of modern technology.",
      "\u201cI think China\u2019s traditional architecture is of course brilliant and very classic,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is a product of its time.\u201d",
      "He said he hopes to deeply understand \u201cthe thematic part of tradition that can survive,\u201d and then express it with contemporary technology and language. In that way, he said, \u201ctradition can be used as a core \u2026 but the presentation of your work is contemporary.\u201d",
      "Liu said he also seeks to balance commercial imperatives with civic concerns.",
      "\u201cThe rapid development of cities nowadays is basically driven by capital. It is natural for capital to pursue profits,\u201d he said. But he added: \u201cYou have to leave the public the space they deserve. Only in this way can the development of a city be positive and healthy, rather than being completely high-density, where people live in drawers and boxes \u2026 without even a place to go and no space for communication.\u201d",
      "Liu is the 54th laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, established in 1979 by the late entrepreneur Jay A. Pritzker and his wife, Cindy. Winners receive a $100,000 grant and a bronze medallion.",
      "The prize has often been equated to the Nobel. Asked if he thought the honor would impact his life, Liu replied: \u201cI have thought about it. But I want to maintain normalcy \u2026 I don\u2019t want to become nervous about everything. Of course, it has its advantages. I will definitely not need to promote myself too much. But will it also make me better at work? Not necessarily. Excessive expectations may become a pressure.\u201d",
      "He had another concern, too.",
      "\u201cAnd will it make me too busy and prevent me from working more attentively?\u201d he pondered. \u201cI hope to keep the normalcy and the freedom, as well as calmness.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "George Clooney, the proud son of a journalist, likes journalism and telling truth to power",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 George Clooney made waves in July when he called on Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race, citing diminished capacity. For Clooney, there wasn't a choice to stay silent.",
      "\u201cI was raised to tell the truth and telling the truth means telling it when it's not comfortable,\" the actor-director and big Democratic booster tells The Associated Press. \u201cI did what I was raised and taught to do. That\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "There was inevitable backlash \u2014 just as there was back when he was branded a traitor for speaking out against the invasion of Iraq \u2014 but Clooney took the hits.",
      "\u201cTelling the truth to power or taking chances like that \u2014we\u2019ve seen it over our history,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here and survived these things and we will survive it.\u201d",
      "Clooney's truth-to-power stance takes another step this spring as he makes his Broadway debut, telling the story of legendary reporter Edward R. Murrow in an adaptation of his 2005 film \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d Performances starts March 12.",
      "Murrow, who died in 1965, is considered one of the architects of U.S. broadcast news and perhaps his greatest moment was opposing Sen. Joe McCarthy, who cynically created paranoia of a communist threat in the 1950s.",
      "\u201cThis is a story about who we are at our best, when we hold our own feet to the fire, when we check and balance ourselves,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cWhat\u2019s scary about now and the difference between Murrow\u2019s time is that we\u2019ve now decided that truth is negotiable.\u201d",
      "In the movie version \u2014 which Clooney co-wrote with Grant Heslov \u2014 the role of Murrow went to David Strathairn and Clooney played CBS executive Fred Friendly; this time, Clooney takes up the mantle of Murrow. When he and Heslov did a reading for theater investors he just played Murrow and the financiers agreed to sink their money in the play \u2014 on the condition Clooney stay in the role.",
      "As in the movie, the play version will have footage of the real McCarthy on screens and the stage will resemble a newsroom with several dozen old-fashioned monitors mixing old and new footage.",
      "The transition to Broadway makes a lot of sense since many of the movie's reviewers said it felt to them a lot like a play. It actually was originally conceived as a live TV movie, an idea scuttled after Justin Timberlake exposed Janet Jackson's nipple in the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show and scared away any notion of live network events.",
      "\u201cIt is an incredibly literary play,\u201d says Tony-winning director David Cromer. \u201cIt is filled with debate. It is filled with well-reasoned and very complex arguments about is this the right thing to do? Is this the right thing to do now? What happens when we do this? How do we say this?\u201d",
      "Two-time Oscar winner Clooney returns to Murrow at a time when journalists are under fire from the new U.S. administration and being denied access for not following White House talking points.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t decide to remount or do the play for any real political reasons,\u201d says Heslov, a frequent Clooney collaborator who is also making his Broadway writing debut. \u201cIt turns out that the environment might be ripe for it.\u201d",
      "Murrow had a large presence in Clooney\u2019s home growing up. His father, Nick Clooney, a veteran journalist, worked as a TV news anchor and host in a variety of cities including Cincinnati, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles. He also wrote a newspaper column in Cincinnati and taught journalism at American University.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the son of a journalist, a proper journalist, a guy who tells the truth. My father\u2019s still out there fighting the good fight,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cI believe in it. I believe in the whole idea of how this works.\u201d",
      "Clooney is part of a starry group of Hollywood veterans arriving on Broadway this season, a list that includes Denzel Washington, Jake Gyllenhaal, Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Parsons, Sarah Snook and John Mulaney.",
      "Clooney insisted before he came that he didn't want to be the highest paid actor on Broadway. It mirrored the time he mortgaged his house and paid himself a salary of just $1 to finance the movie version of \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s like, pay Patti LuPone the most of anybody on Broadway. Pay somebody who\u2019s paid their dues. It shouldn\u2019t be somebody who\u2019s doing his first Broadway play,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to be part of that. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d",
      "The box office for a ticket to see him at the Winter Garden is white hot even before previews begin but Clooney deflects that to Murrow \u2014 it's not me, he suggests, it's the character he's playing.",
      "\u201cThe words of Edward Murrow are words that kind of soothe us,\" he says. \"It\u2019s a salve for insanity. And I think people are excited to be in a room and share some of those conversations.\u201d",
      "Clooney hasn't done a full-length play since he got his Equity Card in 1986 in Chicago as the comic relief in \u201cVicious,\u201d about punk icon Sid Vicious. \u201cMost of the cast members that I\u2019m working with weren\u2019t born when I did my last play. So it\u2019s scary,\u201d he says.",
      "He thought he'd missed his chance at Broadway, a notch on many actor's bucket list. He's 63 now and it would mean uprooting his family for months.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve succeeded in my career. I\u2019m not saying that I haven\u2019t succeeded, but I hadn\u2019t done anything on Broadway and I thought maybe it\u2019s too late,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d been offered a couple of plays that I didn\u2019t think I was right for, and I thought if I was going to do it, I should do something that I was right for. And this was an opportunity where I thought, \u2018Well, I know how to tell this story. I may not do a great job with it. You know, I may really screw it up, but I know what\u2019s required of the thing.\u2019\u201d"

      "EDINA, Minn. -- Joey Molland, a guitarist with the Welsh pop-rock band Badfinger that was known for such 1970s hits as \u201cNo Matter What\u201d and \u201cDay After Day,\u201d has died at age 77.",
      "Molland was the last to join and had been the last survivor from the most famous lineup of the group, which recorded for the Beatles \u2019 Apple label. His death was confirmed Tuesday by Sam Sheffield-West, the funeral director at Washburn-McReavy Funeral Chapels in Edina, Minnesota. Molland had lived in the state for decades. Additional details about his death weren't immediately available.",
      "Badfinger was a quartet that also included singer-guitarist Pete Ham, bassist Tom Evans and drummer Tom Gibbins. They were among the first acts signed to Apple after the Beatles launched it in 1968 and would remain closely associated with the Beatles \u2014 not always to Badfinger's liking \u2014 throughout their brief years of success. Molland even grew up near Liverpool's Penny Lane, immortalized in the Beatles song of the same name.",
      "Badfinger's breakout hit, \u201cCome and Get It,\u201d was written and produced by Paul McCartney, and another top 10 single, \u201cDay After Day,\u201d was produced by George Harrison and featured Harrison's slide guitar. \u201cNo Matter What\u201d was produced by Apple official/Beatles assistant Mal Evans, and another Badfinger song, \u201cWithout You,\u201d became a hit for Beatles friend Harry Nilsson. Molland and his bandmates would also appear at Harrison's 1971 benefit concert for Bangladesh and provide backing on two Beatles member's solo albums: Harrison's \u201cAll Things Must Pass\u201d and John Lennon's \u201cImagine.\u201d",
      "Critics could not stop likening Badfinger's catchy melodies, layered harmonies and tight arrangements to their benefactors: \u201cIt\u2019s as if John, Paul, George, and Ringo had been reincarnated as Joey, Pete, Tom, and Mike of Badfinger,\" Rolling Stone wrote of them in 1970. Even the band's name originated from the Beatles. Badfinger had called itself the Ivies in the years preceding their joining Apple, but, at the suggestion of Apple official/Beatles assistant Neil Aspinall, agreed to change it to Badfinger. (The working title of the Beatles' \u201cWith a Little Help from My Friends\u201d was \u201cBad Finger Boogie\u201d).",
      "Their time on top ended after 1972. Amid cutbacks at Apple and allegations of financial mismanagement, Badfinger left for Warner Bros., faded commercially and sustained a tragic loss when Ham took his life in 1975. After initially breaking up, the remaining members periodically reunited but never approached their early success.",
      "Evans took his own life in 1983 and Gibbins died of a brain aneurysm in 2005.",
      "Molland remained active well after Badfinger's prime, touring until his health began to fail last year and releasing such solo albums as \u201cThis Way Up\u201d \u201cAfter the Pearl\u201d and \u201cBe True To Yourself.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was raised to go to work \u2014 to get up in the morning and go to work,\u201d he told The Associated Press in 2001.",

      "Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s west side, but this year there\u2019s even more, with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school back in the top parade league for the first time in 57 years",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, a favela on Rio de Janeiro's west side, but this year the pulse is even stronger with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school returning to the top samba parade league for the first time in almost 60 years.",
      "As one of Rio's 12 top-tier samba schools, Unidos de Padre Miguel will have its shot at fame, perhaps even glory \u2014 all while bringing in more money into its community.",
      "Last year, competing in the second division, Padre Miguel received about 900,000 reais ($150,000) from City Hall, missing out on the lucrative sponsorship deals and revenue from television rights, pre-Carnival parties and ticket sales enjoyed by top-flight samba schools. But their victory in last year's Carnival secured their place in the main event that kicks off Sunday night.",
      "The shift has sent Padre Miguel\u2019s budget this year ballooning more than tenfold, to about 11 million reais ($2 million), including nearly 2 million reais from the city, according to the samba school's deputy chairman Dr. Willie Baracho.",
      "The school has already invested a significant portion into the community, funding local seamstresses, carpenters and welders for parade preparations.",
      "Vila Vintem is already experiencing the positive effects. Several of the favela's formerly jobless residents told The Associated Press they have bought smartphones and household appliances.",
      "Padre Miguel's new headquarters, nearing completion, will relocate rehearsals and other community activities from a hangar-like space that served as a vital center for the community during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cOur samba school has projects, it helps people, distributes food, throws parties for our children,\u201d Luana Borges, 42, said as she fixed details on several costumes, some bearing the school's traditional red and white colors.",
      "\u201cWhen Carnival comes, it offers opportunities to people like me,\" said Borges, who used to be unemployed.",
      "Nearly all samba schools sit in working-class neighborhoods around Rio\u2019s metropolitan region and compete against each other in the legendary Sambadrome parade grounds. Favelas in Rio are typically associated with dense, hillside neighborhoods, but they feature other geographies, too. The 14,000-resident Vila Vintem cropped up almost a century ago on flatlands next to a railway under construction.",
      "When first settled, the swampy area was said to be worth not even a \u201cvintem,\u201d the cheapest coin at the time, akin to a penny. Decades passed before basic services arrived, sometimes only after residents agreed to do the work themselves.",
      "Even with its new Carnival windfall, Padre Miguel remains a financial underdog.",
      "Baracho said its more popular rivals don\u2019t depend as much on city money, and can bring in up to 18 million reais ($3 million) when accounting for corporate sponsorships, sales of merchandise, coveted parade positions and cover charges for their pre-Carnival parties.",
      "While Padre Miguel employs almost all locals, Baracho said wealthier samba schools can spend over 1 million reais, for instance, on coaches and dancers, whose performance is one of the categories scored by judges.",
      "\u201cThe sky is the limit for some, but we fight,\u201d Baracho said. \u201cWe managed to get promoted because we are invested in our people, we work hard to foster our own creativity.\"",
      "Padre Miguel will be the first samba school to parade on Sunday night. Their procession will tell the story of Iya\u0301 Nasso\u0302, the founder of the first space in Brazil for rituals of the Afro-Brazilian faith Candomble.",
      "Experts say the best path for scrappy samba schools like Padre Miguel to sustain their community impact is to focus on avoiding relegation, rather than pursuing Carnival\u2019s top prize, amounting to 20% of the revenue of the tickets sold for the Champions Parade, which takes place the following weekend.",
      "\u201cThere's little chance for a samba school to win the title coming from the second division,\" said F\u00e1tima Costa de Lima, a Carnival researcher and scenic arts professor at Santa Catarina State University. \u201cIt happened before, but it is rare. The main goal for a samba school like (Padre Miguel) is to stay on.\u201d",
      "Ingrid Lima Leal has worked for Padre Miguel for 15 years, and paraded with the school for even longer. The 66-year-old says that creating jobs in Vila Vintem and being at the world-famous parade is worth every cent. She wants to see more next year \u2014 hopefully still in the top division.",
      "While sewing a white costume in her home workshop, Leal expressed the \u201camazing emotion\u201d of marching in the parade wearing something she helped create.",

      "The publicist for Scottish painter Jack Vettriano says he has been found dead in his apartment in France",
      "LONDON -- Scottish painter Jack Vettriano, known for his works depicting elegant men and women on dreamlike beaches, has been found dead in his apartment in France, his publicist said Monday. He was 73.",
      "British media reported there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death on Saturday.",
      "Vettriano, born Jack Hoggan in Fife, Scotland on Nov. 17, 1951, was a self-taught artist who created some of the world's most recognizable contemporary paintings.",
      "His 1992 painting \u201cThe Singing Butler\u201d \u2014 featuring a couple in evening dress dancing on a storm-swept beach as their butler and maid proffered umbrellas \u2014 became a best-selling image in Britain.",
      "In 2005, elusive street artist Banksy based a satirical painting titled \u201cCrude Oil (Vettriano)\u201d on \u201cThe Singing Butler,\u201d adding a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste to the composition to send an environmental message.",
      "Vettriano left school at 15 to become a mining engineer but took up painting after a girlfriend gave him a box of watercolors for his 21st birthday. His breakthrough came in 1998 when he submitted two paintings to the Royal Scottish Academy\u2019s annual show. Both sold on the first day.",
      "Although some art critics dismissed his work, he enjoyed commercial success and held exhibitions in London, Hong Kong, New York and elsewhere. Actor Jack Nicholson and lyricist Tim Rice were among those who acquired Vettriano's work.",
      "\u201cJack Vettriano\u2019s passing marks the end of an era for contemporary Scottish art,\u201d his publicist said in a statement. \"His evocative and timeless works will continue to captivate and inspire future generations.\u201d"

      "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- At the Oscars ceremony, they were there. At the after-parties, they were barely there.",
      "Celebrities bared a lot more than their emotions on Oscar night. The naked fashion trend was on full display at places like the Vanity Fair party carpet, where guests clearly bought into the idea that less is more.",
      "Among them: actor-director Olivia Wilde, who wore a sheer, embroidered lace negligee by Chlo\u00e9, \u201cwith metal ends and embroidered lace lingerie panties,\u201d according to the designer.",
      "While Wilde's outfit had a demure bohemian charm, actor Julia Fox leaned much further toward naked, arriving in a see-through wrap dress where the only adornment seemed to be strategically placed hair extensions.",
      "Doja Cat sang \u201cDiamonds Are Forever\u201d on the telecast during a James Bond tribute segment in what looked like only diamonds, with little fabric in between. Then she showed up at the Vanity Fair party in a custom Balmain strapless gown with fringes, which the designer said \u201cwas crafted by 39 artisans over the course of 3,450 hours.\u201d The inspiration: an Oscar statue reflecting the female form \u2014 and that form was celebrated, beneath all the hand-threaded glass beads in nine different shades of gold.",
      "Kendall Jenner drew attention at the Vanity Fair fete with a vintage 1992 Mugler number in black lace that was actually made of rubber. \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d actor Leslie Bibb decided to go with the popular nude-sparkle look.",
      "Although the trend may feel somewhat new \u2014 as evidenced by the chatter around the recent Grammys carpet appearance by Bianca Censori and Ye \u2014 naked fashion has been in vogue for a number of years, noted Madeline Hirsch, features director at InStyle Fashion.",
      "\u201cThough it originated on the runway, the naked dress trend is fed largely by celebrity red carpet moments \u2014 stars and their stylists can\u2019t seem to get enough,\u201d Hirsch said in an email. She added that in 2025, sheer lace is the most prominent expression of the trend \u2014 not a surprise since bohemian style is resurgent.",
      "Though many Oscar attendees, of course, opt for much more traditional looks both before and after the ceremonies, it tends to be at the after-parties where the naked look pops up the most, Hirsch said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the time when attendees can let down their hair after hours, and generally speaking, it\u2019s a lower stakes red carpet and less formal event than the ceremony itself,\u201d Hirsch said. \u201cNext-to-naked dressing matches that energy.\u201d"

      "Actor Lily James, ballet dancer Maria Bogdanovich and model Ana Beatriz Barros were among the guests who sat cozily on curving sofas for the back-to-back shows. Armani also invited Italian senator-for-life Liliana Segre, a Holocaust survivor, and figures from Milan's cultural institutions.",

    "story": [
      "When Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d swept the 97th Academy Awards, its five wins, including best picture, heralded a different kind of Oscar winner",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Last fall, Sean Baker was sitting in a Manhattan restaurant, talking about a poll. The survey, about sex in movies and television, showed that Gen Z moviegoers were mostly turned off by sex in film.",
      "\u201cThat broke my heart. I thought, there\u2019s something wrong here,\u201d said Baker. \u201cYou\u2019re OK with all the violence that\u2019s out there? Sex is a vital part of existence. Why don\u2019t you want to see sex in our stories?\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember being on set and being like: We\u2019re pushing against that poll.\u201d",
      "When Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d swept the 97th Academy Awards on Sunday, its five wins, including best picture, heralded a different kind of Oscar winner. \u201cAnora,\u201d about an erotic dancer (Mikey Madison, the best actress winner ) who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, is atypically sexually explicit for a best picture winner \u2014 a class that includes more staid movies like \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cDriving Miss Daisy.\u201d A young woman\u2019s relationship to her own sexuality has not been, historically speaking, in the Oscars' wheelhouse.",
      "But that\u2019s just one quality that makes \u201cAnora\u201d unique as a best picture winner. The film, made for $6 million and distributed by Neon, was made with little interest in the mainstream. If anything, \u201cAnora\u201d was more oriented to the Cannes Film Festival, the French citadel of cinema, where it won the Palme d\u2019Or last May \u2014 a prize that Baker said meant the most to him.",
      "But, increasingly, these are converging movie worlds. In the last five years, four Palme d\u2019Or winners have been nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards, including Bong Joon Ho\u2019s \u201cParasite\u201d (also distributed by Neon), which became the first non-English language movie to win Hollywood\u2019s top prize.",
      "\u201cAnora,\u201d a film that inverts a Hollywood fairy tale like \u201cPretty Woman,\u201d is \u2014 like many of the winners on Sunday \u2014 an unabashedly modern movie and a film comfortable, even proud of the label of \u201ccinema.\u201d In a movie industry where manufactured franchise stewardship rules the day, \u201cAnora\u201d was celebrated, in part, because it's the real deal.",
      "It's also a more traditional choice than it might seem. Baker, a filmmaker who has sworn off making a series, a studio film or anything for streaming, is an apostle of '70s cinema. At an Oscars that host Conan O\u2019Brien called \u201cthe 97th Longform Content Awards,\u201d \u201cAnora\u201d \u2014 which shared some of the same Brooklyn streets as \u201cThe French Connection\u201d \u2014 stood for upholding an increasingly threatened theatrical legacy, with Baker ardently defending a very old-fashioned thing: the big screen.",
      "\u201cFilmmakers, keep making films for the big screen. I know I will,\u201d Baker said from the Dolby Theatre stage. \u201cDistributors, please focus first and foremost on the theatrical releases of your films. Parents, introduce your children to feature films in movie theaters and you will be molding the next generation of movie lovers and filmmakers. And for all of us, when we can please watch movies in a theater and let\u2019s keep the great tradition of the moviegoing experience alive and well.\u201d",
      "The coronation of \u201cAnora\u201d was a triumph for independent moviemaking, but that\u2019s also been a battle waged and won before. We\u2019ve seen \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d best \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cMoonlight\u201d defeat \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Last year\u2019s crowning of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d was, if anything, an exception in a string of smaller best pictures that haven't fit the Oscar mold. \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d the 2023 winner, was antic, lewd and about the furthest thing possible from \u201cOscar bait.\u201d",
      "What was different this year was that the stiffest competition for \u201cAnora\u201d wasn\u2019t \u201cWicked\u201d or \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d or any other studio product. It was \u201cConclave\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d All of the major award winners on Sunday hailed from movies made independently. At the Oscars, the studios are out of the picture.",
      "That trend has been developing for years, but the 97th Academy Awards showed just how much things have changed. In the best animated category, where Universal and DreamWorks\u2019 \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d was the heavy favorite, \u201cFlow,\u201d a wordless Latvian movie made with open-source software, triumphed instead.",
      "\u201cAny kid now has tools that are used to make these now Academy-winning films,\u201d \u201cFlow\u201d director Gints Zilbalodis said backstage. \u201cSo I think we\u2019re going to see all kinds of exciting films being made from kids who might not have had a chance to do this before.\u201d",
      "That win, like those for \u201cAnora,\u201d suggested the academy\u2019s international voters have emerged as a dominant bloc. When the academy, reacting to pressure to diversify its ranks, brought in new members in recent years, it cast a wide net overseas. Hundreds of new international voters \u2014 people more likely to favor what succeeds in Cannes or Venice \u2014 now significantly sway the Oscars.",
      "What does that mean for the Academy Awards going forward? A further tilt toward indie and arthouse cinema will surely alienate some viewers. \u201cAnora,\u201d with $16 million in domestic ticket sales, is one of the lowest-grossing best picture winners ever. Oscar producers did everything they could to lean into bigger films, opening with a lavish medley by \u201cWicked\u201d stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, cutting repeatedly to a mascot sandworm from \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d and even paying James Bond tribute.",
      "The 007 musical number was oddly timed, coming on the heels of the franchise\u2019s creative takeover by Amazon MGM Studios after decades of Broccoli family stewardship. It seemed to only highlight how much of Hollywood\u2019s regular, day-to-day business of brand management lay outside the new Oscar landscape.",
      "But just as assuredly as an \u201cAnora\u201d Academy Awards might turn some away, it could also inspire a new generation of cinephiles. \u201cAnora\u201d is at turns screwball farce, neorealistic drama, capitalism satire and devastating tragicomedy. It\u2019s arguably one of the best best picture winners of recent years, a movie that tries on nearly every genre before concluding in an unforgettable scene that catapults \u201cAnora\u201d into something classic and outside of time.",
      "What aftershocks will follow Baker's Oscar romp remains to be seen. But shortly after the Academy Awards concluded, 3.9 magnitude tremors were felt in nearby Burbank \u2014 a fitting coda for the small quake of \u201cAnora.\u201d"

It was the latest instance of destruction targeting a collection of hamlets whose population is threatened with expulsion.",
      "Palestinians in the Masafer Yatta area cheered the Oscar win of the documentary \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which depicts life in the beleaguered community, and hoped it will bring them some help.",
      "In al-Tuwaneh, one of the hamlets that make up Masafer Yatta, Salem Adra said his family stayed up all night for the Oscar ceremony. They watched as his older brother, Basel Adra, the film\u2019s co-director, came on stage to accept the award for best documentary.",
      "\u201cIt was such a huge surprise, such joy,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d follows Basel Adra as he risks arrest to document the destruction of Masafer Yatta at the southern edge of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, joined by his co-director, Israeli journalist and filmmaker, Yuval Abraham.",
      "The joint Palestinian-Israeli production has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2024. Five years in the making, it gained greater resonance amid Israel\u2019s devastating military campaign in Gaza that forced almost its entire population from their homes, as well as increasing raids in the West Bank that have caused the displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "At the same time, the film has raised hackles in Israel, scarred by the bloody the Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Hamas that triggered the war.",
      "Salem Adra, who at times helped his brother film for the movie, said he hoped the Oscar win \u201copens the world\u2019s eyes to what\u2019s happening here in Masafer Yatta.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a win for all of Palestine and for everyone who lives in Masafer Yatta,\u201d he said.",
      "He said that since the film was first released, threats and pressure against his family have increased. Their car has been stoned by settlers. After the movie won an award at the Berlin International Film Festival a year ago, the military returned over and over to the family home, and once detained his father, searching his phone and asking, \u201cWhy are you filming?\u201d",
      "The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. Israel said the Bedouin did not have permanent structures in the area. But families say they have lived and herded their sheep and goats across the area long before Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "After a 20-year legal battle by residents, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court upheld the expulsion order in 2022. The around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but troops regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards \u2013 and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.",
      "Salem Adra said the latest destruction came Wednesday, when troops tore down the shed of a family in a nearby hamlet.",
      "Standing on a stony ridge above al-Tuwaneh, Salem Adra said Jewish settlers backed by the military have set up 10 outposts around the village since Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Shepherd Raed al-Hamamdeh, 48, led his herd of goats across the rocky land. He pointed to one outpost \u2013 with tents and a trailer flying the flag of an Israeli military unit \u2013 on the other side of a small valley. Farmers no longer tend the olive grove in the valley for fear of being attacked.",
      "Al-Hamamdeh said the military uses drones to drive off herds if they get too close to the outposts. \u201cSettlers attack. When we herd sheep, we can\u2019t go far as you can see. Only up to this point can we reach,\u201d he said. He pointed to the rubble of a house that he said settlers had destroyed, driving out the family and burning their furniture.",
      "In Israel, the film garnered little media attention since its release \u2014 and what attention it did get has been angry. When it won the documentary prize at the Berlin festival, its Israeli director Abraham came under fire for an acceptance speech that called for an end to the war in Gaza without mentioning Hamas\u2019 initial attack and taking of the hostages held in Gaza.",
      "In his Oscar acceptance speech, Abraham spoke of both. But that did little to calm criticism in Israel. Culture and Sports Minister Miki Zohar called the win \u201ca sad moment for the world of cinema.\u201d He said the film distorted reality and accused its creators of using \u201cdefamation\u201d of Israel as a way help promote the documentary.",

      "Its closest competition is \u201cConclave,\u201d the papal thriller starring Ralph Fiennes. It won at the BAFTAs and the SAG Awards, wins that came just as Pope Francis was hospitalized for double pneumonia. Oscar voting concluded before the pope fell ill.",
      "Also in the mix are \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d nominated for 10 awards, and the musical hit \u201cWicked,\u201d also with 10 nominations. Several of the early craft Oscars could be shared between \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d",
      "For the first time, an actor is nominated for playing the sitting U.S. president. Sebastian Stan is nominated for best actor for his performance as a young Donald Trump in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d as is his co-star, Jeremy Strong, for playing Roy Cohn. Trump has called those involved with the film \u201chuman scum.\u201d",
      "The political tenor of this year\u2019s ceremony could be volatile, with the Oscars coming weeks into the second Trump administration and falling two days after the president\u2019s dramatic rupture with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House.",
      "Speaking earlier this week, O\u2019Brien said he'll strive to strike a delicate balance.",
      "\u201cI cannot ignore the moment we\u2019re in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also have to remember it\u2019s threading a needle. I also have to remember what we\u2019re here to celebrate and infuse the show with positivity.\u201d",
      "While the supporting acting categories feature overwhelming favorites in Zoe Saldana (\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d) and Kieran Culkin (\u201cA Real Pain\u201d), both best actor and best actress are close contests.",
      "In best actress, Demi Moore (\u201cThe Substance\u201d) is most likely to win, but Mikey Madison (\u201cAnora\u201d) or Fernanda Torres (\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d) could pull off the upset.",
      "Adrien Brody is favored in best actor for his performance in \u201cThe Brutalist. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet stands a decent chance of beating him, for his performance as Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d The 29-year-old Chalamet, who won at the Screen Actors Guild, would become the youngest best actor winner ever, edging Brody\u2019s record, set in 2003 in his win for \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d",
      "This year's Oscars are unspooling after a turbulent year for the film industry. Ticket sales were down 3% from the previous year and more significantly from pre-pandemic times. The strikes of 2023 played havoc with release schedules in 2024. Many studios pulled back on production, leaving many out of work. The fires, in January, only added to the pain.",
      "Last year\u2019s telecast, propelled by the twin blockbusters of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie,\u201d led the Oscars to a four-year viewership high, with 19.5 million viewers. This year, with smaller independent films favored in the most prominent awards, the academy will be tested to draw as large of an audience.",
      "With a not particularly starry array of best song nominees, the academy has done away with performances of original songs this year. But there will be music, including a performance by \u201cWicked\u201d stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, and a tribute to the late Quincy Jones, with Queen Latifah.",
      "Last year\u2019s acting winners \u2014 Emma Stone, Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph \u2014 will also take part in the ceremony. Though the academy initially said it would bring back the \u201cfab five\u201d style of presenting the acting awards, with five previous winners per category, organizers have reportedly abandoned those plans.",
      "The ceremony will be taking place days following the death of Gene Hackman. The 95-year-old two-time Oscar winner and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were found dead Wednesday at their New Mexico home.",

    "story": [
      "The Metropolitan Opera is staging a production of Herman Melville's masterpiece about a white whale, \u2018Moby-Dick",
      "When Leonard Foglia was invited to direct an opera based on Herman Melville\u2019s masterpiece about a white whale, his first reaction was: \u201cMoby-Dick. That\u2019s great!\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I ran to a used bookstore and got the book,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand I thought: \u2018Oh my God, what am I in for here?\u2019 It\u2019s so daunting. I didn\u2019t panic, but I thought, \u2018How do we do this?\u2019\u201d",
      "How he and his collaborators did it will be on display at the Metropolitan Opera beginning March 3. The opera is composed by Jake Heggie to a libretto crafted by Gene Scheer.",
      "To begin with, Scheer had to whittle a novel of more than 600 pages down to a 64-page libretto. He kept as much of Melville\u2019s language as possible, and estimates that 40% to 50% of his libretto can be found in the original text, though he often tweaked the phrasing to make it more singable.",
      "Heggie and his initial partner, Terrence McNally (who withdrew for health reasons), had already decided to lop off the opening chapters, which take place on land. They set the entire opera aboard the whale-hunting ship Pequod.",
      "Another crucial change was renaming the narrator, calling him Greenhorn to reflect his status as a novice aboard the ship. Now the book\u2019s famous opening line, \u201cCall me Ishmael,\u201d is transposed to the very end of the opera when the character has matured.",
      "\u201cIn the novel, Ishmael is telling a story that happened many years ago,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cBut in the theater, you want to see it happen in real time. \u2026 We\u2019re watching him take in all the experiences so that when he says \u2018Call me Ishmael,\u2019 he\u2019s ready to write the book. In essence, this opera is the education of Ishmael.\u201d",
      "Tenor Stephen Costello, who is performing the role for the fifth time and is the lone cast holdover from the Dallas premiere in 2010, sees his character as \u201cthe only one who really has an arc.",
      "\u201cHe goes on the Pequod because there was nothing for him on land,\u201d Costello said. \u201cSo he\u2019s either going to die at sea or figure out who he is.\u201d",
      "In addition to Costello, the Met cast includes tenor Brandon Jovanovich as the vengeance-obsessed Captain Ahab. Pip, his cabin boy, is written as a \u201ctrousers role\u201d (a male character portrayed by a woman) and will be sung by soprano Janai Brugger. Starbuck, the first mate, will be baritone Peter Mattei, and bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green will sing the part of Queequeg. Karen Kamensek conducts the eight performances through March 29.",
      "The opera, commissioned to celebrate the opening of a new opera house in Dallas, has been a success from the beginning, drawing praise from audiences and critics \u2014 and even scholars.",
      "Bob Wallace, a professor at Northern Kentucky University and past president of the Melville Society, admired the opera so much that he wrote a book about its creation.",
      "\u201cScheer and Heggie did a brilliant job of shrinking the novel to make it fit the stage and yet preserve so much of the essence of it,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "As much as critics admired Scheer\u2019s adaptation and Heggie\u2019s tuneful, atmospheric and at times gripping score, they lavished special praise on the physical production, with sets by Robert Brill and projections by Elaine J. McCarthy.",
      "The action, Steve Smith wrote in The New York Times, \u201cplayed out against a multimedia-enriched staging that ranged from striking to near-miraculous.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the most stunning effect is the way animated projections superimposed on a climbing wall that is curved a bit like a skateboard ramp create the illusion of the crew leaving the Pequod to board three whaling boats.",
      "\u201cA lot of the excitement and thrill of watching this is due to the work of the production team,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cLenny kept saying to me, \u2019You imagine it the way you want it, and let me figure out how to do it.\u201d",
      "That often involved imposing unusual physical demands on the singers. For instance, when Pip gets lost at sea, his character sings the equivalent of an operatic mad scene dangling high above the stage, with projections making it appear he\u2019s treading water.",
      "\u201cI said to Janai when we first rehearsed it,\u201d Foglia recalled, \u201cOK, you can just get mad at me now, because you have to sing your hardest aria hanging from not even a full harness, just a single wire.\u201d",
      "In addition, Queequeg and Greenhorn climb up and down ladders to sing at the top of the mastheads. Ahab, who has lost a leg in a prior encounter with Moby-Dick, has to hobble on a wooden prosthesis. And Greenhorn \u2014 finally named Ishmael \u2014 ends the opera grabbing onto a whale hook from a passing ship that lifts him to safety.",
      "\u201cI joke with them that everything opera singers count on in life \u2014 having both feet planted on the ground \u2014 I\u2019ve taken away from them,\u201d Foglia said.",

      "Chilean-born Marco Evaristti is courting controversy to make a point about the treatment of pigs in Denmark, where about 25,000 piglets die daily as a result of the conditions in which they are bred.",
      "The central exhibit at Copenhagen's \u201cAnd Now You Care\u201d exhibition is a makeshift cage created with shopping carts containing three piglets. As the exhibition opened Friday evening, they were still fine, but they will not be given food and drink, and can be expected to die of hunger within a few days.",
      "Evaristti says on his Instagram page that the exhibition \u201cis a confrontation with Denmark's bloody reality\u201d in slaughterhouses, and that he urges people to reduce their meat consumption and support agriculture that improves animal welfare.",
      "Denmark's largest and oldest animal welfare organization, Animal Protection Denmark, says it is grateful for Evaristti's interest in the problem, but disagrees with how he wants to convey it.",
      "\u201cWe completely understand the indignation\u201d of the artist, said Birgitte Damm, a spokesperson for the organization. \u201cBut we do not agree that three piglets, three individual living beings, should be starved and prevented from drinking until they die from it. It is illegal and it is abuse of the animals.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that happens to thousands each day in the industry doesn\u2019t make it right,\u201d she said. But she also praised the artist for asking \u201cthe large questions about who we are as human beings or want to be, and what we are doing to fellow creatures in the name of enormous amounts of mass-produced cheap meat.\u201d",
      "Damm explained that sows are bred in the Danish pig industry to produce about 20 piglets at a time, but only have 14 teats, forcing the piglets to compete for breastmilk, and leading to the starvation of many. She said some 25,000 piglets die every day from starvation or the result of the conditions in which they are held in Denmark.",
      "It's not Evaristti's first controversial project.",
      "One of his projects included goldfish in blenders, tempting viewers to press the button and create goldfish soup.",
      "In 2006 he used some of his own body fat removed via liposuction to prepare meatballs, and then ate some of them.",
      "He described that project called \u201cPolpette Al Grasso Di Marco\u201d as a critique on people overconsuming and then buying their way to slimness with liposuction, and at the same time an attempt to transcend the taboo of cannibalism.",

      "A depressed German loaf of bread named Bernd das Brot is celebrating his 25th anniversary as the reluctant star of a children\u2019s television program",
      "BERLIN -- Forget SpongeBob SquarePants, Sesame Street and the sourdough starter craze: a depressed German loaf of bread named Bernd das Brot is celebrating his 25th anniversary as the reluctant star of a children's television program that accidentally became equally popular with adults.",
      "A cult classic in Germany, Bernd das Brot (Bernd the Bread) is a puppet renowned for his deep, gloomy voice, his perpetual pessimism and his signature expression, \"Mist!\" (Think \u201ccrap!\u201d in English.)",
      "Played and voiced by puppeteer J\u00f6rg Teichgraeber, Bernd is a television presenter who wants nothing to do with TV and can\u2019t wait to go home to stare at the wallpaper.",
      "This year, his friends \u2014 a sheep and a flower bush \u2014 are urging him to become a bread influencer.",
      "Born as a sketch on the back of a napkin in a pizzeria, creator Tommy Krappweis drew Bernd's infamous grimace after co-creator Norman C\u00f6ster's face when they were asked to come up with mascots for KiKA, a German children\u2019s public television channel.",
      "Comic artist Georg Graf von Westphalen designed Bernd as a pullman loaf \u2014 white bread typically sliced for sandwiches \u2014 with short arms and a permanent scowl. Bernd channels German stereotypes with his grumpy disposition, penchant for complaining and dry sense of humor and irony.",
      "Bernd's first episode aired on KiKA in 2000 alongside his more-optimistic pals, Chili the Sheep and Briegel the Bush.",
      "Because KiKA is a children's channel, there was typically dead air from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. On Jan. 1, 2003, the network put Bernd's short episodes into the night loop for the first time.",
      "The move brought an adult audience \u2014 often those sitting at home and smoking pot, or returning after a long night of partying \u2014 into Bernd's world, cementing his popularity as a German cult classic.",
      "In 2004, Bernd won the Adolf Grimme Prize \u2014 the German television equivalent of an Emmy \u2014 because the jury said he represents \u201cthe right to be in a bad mood.\u201d",
      "\u201cBernd shows you that you are less vulnerable with humor and self-irony. And perhaps the most important point is: It\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t feel well sometimes. That\u2019s completely fine,\u201d Krappweis, Bernd's creator, said in a KiKA Q&A about Bernd's anniversary.",
      "Bernd is depressed for a multitude of reasons, including his failed attempt to be the mascot for a bakery's advertising campaign (that's how he ended up as a TV presenter, as a last resort).",
      "But it's in Episode 85 that we finally learn about Bernd's broken heart.",
      "\u201cA long, long time ago I fell in love with a beautiful, slim baguette. She was so incredibly charming and funny,\u201d Bernd tells Chili and Briegel. \u201cBut unfortunately it was in vain.",
      "\u201cShe only had eyes for this run-of-the-mill multigrain bread with its 10 types of grain. It was so depressing.\u201d",
      "Despite Bernd\u2019s best efforts \u2014 one of his catchphrases is \u201cI would like to leave this show\u201d \u2014 the episodes have never become stale. He sings, he dances, he\u2019s been to space. He's the star of merchandise, a video game and headlines like \u201cGive Us Our Daily Bernd.\u201d",
      "He was even kidnapped! In 2009, his 2-meter-tall (6.56 feet) statue was stolen from his traditional place outside the town hall in Erfurt, where KiKA is based.",
      "A claim of responsibility surfaced on YouTube, by sympathizers of a group of demonstrators who were protesting a company that had produced cremation ovens for the Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz. The demonstrators, however, denied involvement in Bernd\u2019s kidnapping and the video was removed from the internet.",
      "Bernd was held hostage for nearly two weeks before being discovered unharmed in an abandoned barracks.",
      "KiKA is honoring Bernd's 25th anniversary \u2014 despite his complaints \u2014 with new episodes, an update to his hit song and online activities for kids and adults alike. The celebrations begin now, as Bernd\u2019s birthday is Feb. 29.",
      "The latest series will premiere in September as Bernd, Chili and Briegel launch the social media channel \u201cBetter with Bernd\" in their efforts to make him into a bread influencer.",
      "The trio will present inventions to make school, and life, easier for viewers but naturally their concoctions backfire. Bernd instead becomes a defluencer \u2014 and an involuntary trendsetter.",

    "story": [
      "Senate Republicans in Georgia have advanced two bills restricting gender-affirming care for transgender people",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's Senate passed two bills Monday that would ban most gender-affirming care for minors and people incarcerated in state prisons, mirroring moves by Republicans across states and a handful of executive orders by President Donald Trump targeting transgender people.",
      "The chamber voted 34-19 for a bill that would ban puberty blockers and most gender-affirming care for people under 18, including those already undergoing treatment. Georgia lawmakers in 2023 banned most gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapies for transgender minors unless they were already receiving treatment. The law lets doctors prescribe puberty blockers.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re asking (minors) to make changes that will have changes to the rest of their lives,\u201d bill sponsor Republican Sen. Ben Watson, of Savannah, said Monday. \u201cIt is not a fair decision to them. It is not a fair decision to the parents.\u201d",
      "A second bill sponsored by Senate Majority Whip Randy Robertson passed 37-15 and would ban most gender-affirming care for people incarcerated in state prisons.",
      "Last month, the chamber passed bills to ban transgender people from playing in school sports and cut off public funding for gender-affirming care for adults. The four bills will now head to the House for debate.",
      "Opponents said Republicans are playing politics by targeting transgender people and that lawmakers should focus on helping Georgians with more pressing issues such as housing and healthcare. They say both bills infringe on the rights of transgender people and their families to make decisions about gender-affirming care.",
      "\u201cThis body has promulgated bill after bill attacking trans people with the ultimate goal of making trans fols disappear. We\u2019ve been here before,\" said Senate Minority Whip Kim Jackson, a Stone Mountain Democrat who is openly lesbian.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting gender-affirming care for minors, and most are facing lawsuits. A study released in January found that fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents with commercial insurance during a five-year period received gender-affirming medications such as puberty blockers or hormones.",
      "Jackson and other Democrats proposed a failed amendment to Watson\u2019s bill that would let minors receiving treatment keep going to avoid the medical and emotional ramifications of stopping midway.",
      "Sens. Elena Parent and Sonya Halpern, both Atlanta Democrats, reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights of transgender people but broke with their party to vote for Robertson\u2019s bill because they said they do not think taxpayers should pay for gender-affirming care for people in prison. Parent proposed an amendment to make an exception for incarcerated people already undergoing hormone replacement therapy that failed.",
      "\u201cI will not let my party be dragged into an argument that makes us look out of touch with the very people we claim to represent,\u201d Halpern said.",
      "Sen. Sally Harrell, an Atlanta Democrat who has two transgender children, took the stand toward the end of the evening.",
      "\u201cIt felt like we were debating a political football instead of people,\" Harrell said of a debate on the school sports bill. \"And so I came to this well to remind people that we are talking about very real people \u2014 parents, children, families.\u201d",
      "Dawson Democrat Sen. Freddie Powell Sims voted for both bills. Four Democrats for the bill banning gender-affirming care for people in prison.",

      "Food and Drug Administration nominee Dr. Marty Makary is known for his contrarian views and fiery criticism of traditional medical institutions",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Marty Makary rose to national attention by skewering the medical establishment in books and papers and bashing the federal response to COVID-19 on TV.",
      "Now the Johns Hopkins University surgeon and researcher has been nominated to lead the Food and Drug Administration. The agency \u2014 responsible for regulating products ranging from toothpaste to vaccines \u2014 is famously understated, issuing carefully worded statements devoid of opinion or scientific speculation.",
      "That's the opposite approach of Makary, whose sweeping rhetoric and biting criticism often veer into hyperbole, according to a review of recent speeches, interviews and podcast appearances by The Associated Press.",
      "Makary has called the U.S. food supply \u201cpoison,\u201d says the federal government is the \u201cgreatest perpetrator of misinformation\u201d about COVID-19 and regularly suggests that pesticides, fluoride and overuse of antibiotics may be to blame for rising rates of infertility, attention deficit disorder and other health conditions. He\u2019ll appear Thursday before a Senate panel considering his nomination.",
      "Makary\u2019s views align with those of the man who would be his boss: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who built a following by sowing doubts about vaccines, ultraprocessed foods and fluoride. Notably, Makary has never embraced Kennedy\u2019s discredited idea that vaccines might cause autism.",
      "Experts who have worked with Makary say his contrarian approach could be useful at FDA \u2014 but only if he\u2019s able to resist political pressure from Kennedy and others on hot-button issues like vaccines.",
      "\u201cHe has this reputation of being someone who cares about evidence and transparency,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran of Yale University, who was part of an informal research group with Makary. \u201cThe question is whether he\u2019s going to preserve and defend the integrity of the agency or is he going to fall in line with the administration.\u201d",
      "Makary did not respond to an AP interview request.",
      "Trained as a pancreatic surgeon, Makary\u2019s initial work focused on uncontroversial topics like hospital costs and surgical checklists.",
      "In 2016, he made headlines with a paper stating that medical errors were \u201cthe third leading cause of death in the U.S.\u201d That conclusion was quickly disputed by other experts, who said the paper\u2019s death estimate was ten times higher than more rigorous reviews.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary reached a much broader audience as a regular on Fox News, where he opposed vaccine mandates and called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Makary often directs his harshest criticism toward the \u201cmedical hubris\u201d of fellow doctors, as in his latest book \u201cBlind Spots,\u201d which catalogues a number of cases where experts \u201cgot the science perfectly backwards.\u201d",
      "For example, he examines early recommendations that parents delay giving babies peanut-based foods due to allergy risks. Today, pediatricians generally recommend earlier introduction to prevent food allergies.",
      "Many researchers view such examples differently.",
      "\u201cThese are cases of people doing the best they can with evolving information and needing to make decisions along the way,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School. \u201cAs commissioner, he\u2019s going to have to be OK with making decisions based on evolving evidence \u2014 and some of those decisions might be wrong.\u201d",
      "Like others in Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, Makary says many of the chronic health problems afflicting Americans may be related to food additives, pesticides and other chemicals.",
      "\u201cHow about research on the pesticides that have hormone effects in children that may explain the declining fertility and lowering age of puberty?\u201d Makary asked, in a September podcast with Dr. Drew Pinsky.",
      "New York University food researcher Marion Nestle says Makary\u2019s questions \u201care extremely difficult to settle,\u201d because there\u2019s no way to ethically do the type of research needed to reach a firm conclusion: give one group of children food with pesticides and compare them with a control group getting food not grown with pesticides.",
      "\u201cI sympathize with his frustration and think we would be much better off with a lot fewer pesticides in our food supply, but I tend to view these issues more cautiously,\u201d Nestle said.",
      "Nutrition experts also say it\u2019s overly simplistic to declare all ultraprocessed foods harmful, since the category includes an estimated 60% of U.S. foods, including granola, peanut butter and ice cream.",
      "\u201cThey are not all created equal,\u201d said Gabby Headrick of George Washington University. \u201cIt is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultraprocessed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic has been the United States government,\u201d Makary told House lawmakers during a 2023 roundtable hosted by Republicans.",
      "Among the many COVID-19 policies Makary attacked was the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. That group received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild. Complicating the issue was the fact that COVID-19 itself also caused cases of myocarditis that were usually more severe.",
      "A 2022 paper coauthored by Makary concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions.",
      "\u201cThey made mistake after mistake and every time it either minimized the vaccine\u2019s benefits or exaggerated the risks,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris of the University of Washington, who published a critique of the work. \u201cThis paper really fed the whole notion that the vaccine is worse than the disease.\u201d",
      "Makary's conclusion contradicted that of U.K. experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimated the booster prevented 114 hospitalizations for every seven it caused in young people.",
      "Despite such pushback, Makary told Congress that CDC and FDA \u201clied to the American people\u201d about the need for boosters and other COVID measures.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser, says the Biden administration made missteps in rolling out boosters, including announcing plans to make them available for all age groups before outside experts had weighed in. But, Offit said, Makary\u2019s language has damaged public trust in health institutions, including the one he\u2019s been picked to lead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rhetoric that\u2019s purposefully inflammatory to win over a certain crowd, which is part of today\u2019s zeitgeist of disdaining public health agencies,\u201d Offit said. \u201cSo he\u2019s offered the position at FDA because he has disdain for the agency.\u201d",

      "James Harrison, who was credited with saving 2.4 million babies through blood plasma donations over six decades, has died at 88",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- An Australian man credited with saving 2.4 million babies through his record-breaking blood plasma donations over six decades, has died, his family said Tuesday. He was 88.",
      "James Harrison, a retired state railway department clerk, died in a nursing home on the central coast of New South Wales state on Feb. 17, according to his grandson, Jarrod Mellowship.",
      "Harrison\u2019s plasma contained a rare antibody, known as anti-D, which is used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman\u2019s immune system attacks her fetus\u2019 red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh negative blood type and her baby\u2019s is Rh positive.",
      "Australia has only 200 anti-D donors who help 45,000 mothers and their babies annually.",
      "Despite an aversion to needles, Harrison made 1,173 donations after he turned 18 in 1954 until he was forced to retire in 2018, aged 81.",
      "\u201cHe did it for the right reasons. As humble as he was, he did like the attention. But he would never do it for the attention,\u201d Mellowship said, adding his grandfather had been surprised to be recognized by Guinness World Records in 2005 as the person who had donated the most blood plasma in the world.",
      "The record was beaten in 2022 by American Brett Cooper from Walker, Michigan.",
      "The Australian Red Cross Blood Service said Harrison was renowned as the \u201cMan with the Golden Arm.\u201d",
      "He was credited with saving the lives of 2.4 million babies through his plasma donations, the national agency responsible for collecting and distributing blood products, also known as Lifeblood, said in a statement.",
      "Lifeblood chief executive Stephen Cornelissen said Harrison had hoped that someone in Australia would one day beat his donation record.",
      "\u201cJames was a remarkable, stoically kind and generous person who was committed to a lifetime of giving and he captured the hearts of many people around the world,\u201d Cornelissen said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIt was James\u2019 belief that his donations were no more important than any other donors' and that everyone can be special in the same way that he was,\u201d Cornelissen added.",
      "Mellowship said his mother, Tracey Mellowship, Harrison\u2019s daughter, needed the treatment when he and his brother, Scott, were born.",

      "Measles has sickened nearly 150 mostly unvaccinated people in rural West Texas, and a school-age child has died",
      "SEMINOLE, Texas -- Measles had struck this West Texas town, sickening dozens of children, but at the Community Church of Seminole, more than 350 worshippers gathered for a Sunday service. Sitting elbow-to-elbow, they filled the pews, siblings in matching button-down shirts and dresses, little girls\u2019 hair tied neatly into pink bows.",
      "Fathers shushed babbling toddlers as their wives snuck out to change infants' diapers.",
      "A little girl in this mostly Mennonite congregation was among those who\u2019d fallen ill with the highly contagious respiratory disease, senior pastor David Klassen said \u2014 but she\u2019s doing fine, and she happily played through her quarantine. He heard that at least two Mennonite schools shut down for a bit to disinfect.",
      "What he hasn\u2019t heard: Any direct outreach from public health officials on what to do as the number of those sickened with measles has grown to 146 and a school-age child has died. And though Klassen is a trusted church and community leader, his congregants haven\u2019t asked about whether they should vaccinate their kids \u2014 and he wouldn\u2019t want to weigh in.",
      "\u201cWith this measles situation, I can honestly just tell you we haven\u2019t taken any steps as a church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did leave it up to the mothers.\u201d",
      "As measles \u2014 a preventable disease the U.S. considered eliminated in 2000 \u2014 spreads through West Texas\u2019 rural expanse, Klassen is sticking to an approach on vaccines that is a key tenet for Mennonites. Family leaders are the top decision-making authority \u2014 not outside recommendations, certainly not government mandates.",
      "Alongside measles in this region, where voters overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump, there\u2019s another outbreak: one of misinformation about vaccines, distrust of local public health officials and fear of governmental authority overruling family autonomy. And on the national stage, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the country\u2019s top health official and an anti-vaccine activist, dismissed the Texas outbreak as \u201cnot unusual.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I trust all the vaccines? No,\u201d Klassen said. \u201cAnd I get from (Kennedy) that he doesn\u2019t trust all the vaccines, either. And he is very well educated in that; I\u2019m not.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece for Fox News Digital, Kennedy wrote about the value of the vaccine but stopped short of calling on families to get it, saying the decision is \u201ca personal one.\u201d He urged parents to speak to their health care providers about options.",
      "Vaccine skepticism has also been spurred by state lawmakers who this year filed more than a dozen bills that would strengthen or expand vaccine exemptions, which Texas already allows for \u201creasons of conscience, including a religious belief.\u201d",
      "At hospitals in Lubbock, 80 miles to the north and on the front lines of the outbreak, babies with measles are struggling to breathe.",
      "Dr. Summer Davies, a Texas Tech Physicians pediatrician, said she has treated about 10 of the outbreak\u2019s patients, most very young or teens. She said children have had to be intubated, including one younger than 6 months old. Others come in with such high fevers or severe sore throats that they refuse to eat or drink to the point of dehydration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard as a pediatrician, knowing that we have a way to prevent this and prevent kids from suffering and even death,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do agree that the herd immunity that we have established in the past isn\u2019t the same now. And I think kids are suffering because of that.\u201d",
      "In Lubbock County, 92% of kindergarteners are up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella shots, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That\u2019s lower than the 95% threshold experts say is needed to prevent measles from spreading. Gaines County, which includes Seminole, has an 82% MMR vaccination rate, though rates for homeschooled or private school students may be much lower. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Many Mennonite families don\u2019t send children to public schools.",
      "All of the children admitted with measles to Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital in Lubbock were unvaccinated, officials said last week. Dr. Lara Johnson, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer, told The Associated Press that Covenant has seen more than 20 patients, including children, teens and pregnant mothers, since the outbreak began in late January.",
      "News of a measles case in Seminole, population 7,200, put doctors on a \u201cshared high alert,\u201d said Dr. Martin Ortega, a family physician for Texas Tech Physicians in Odessa, about an hour away. The small towns of West Texas may look completely isolated on a map, with little between them beyond oil and gas facilities and sprawling desert. But the region is connected by its people, who regularly travel long distances to grocery stores, hospitals and houses of worship.",
      "Many doctors are seeing measles cases for the first time in their careers. In Lea County, New Mexico, 30 minutes west of Seminole, nine measles cases with no clear connection to the Texas outbreak, rattled doctors and parents. An unvaccinated infant in Austin also tested positive for measles after an overseas vacation.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca little bit surreal,\u201d said Dr. Rumbidzai Mutikani, a pediatrician at Nor-Lea Hospital District\u2019s Hobbs Medical Clinic. Parents were so concerned \u201cour phones were just ringing,\u201d Mutikani said.",
      "Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock\u2019s public health department, said West Texas' rural landscape is a major challenge, not just in getting to patients and transporting test samples, but also in getting the word out.",
      "A lot of the messaging is word of mouth, she said, but they are working on public-service announcements featuring trusted Gaines County residents, putting up billboards about measles, handing out flyers and posting in WhatsApp groups.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic caused \u201ca lot of distrust in public health\u201d and government requirements, Wells said. On Facebook, people have accused her of making up the measles outbreak. They hope her department loses its funding.",
      "It\u2019s \u201creally hurtful stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really working to help encourage vaccines for our community and help those kids that are infected to make sure they get medical treatment so that we don\u2019t end up with another death.\u201d",

      "Brownfield Mayor Eric Horton is pro-Trump, he said, but also pro-MMR vaccine.",
      "His county was hard-hit by COVID-19, Horton said, with nearly 90 deaths. So when measles cases came to his town of 8,600, Horton feared for his community. He said the local hospital has been busy administering vaccines since the outbreak started.",
      "\u201cOut here on the south plains of Texas, we are conservative people, but we also are not anti-vaxxers,\u201d he said.",

Mitch McConnell\u2019s vote against Kennedy\u2019s nomination, she said the fact that \u201cthe only Republican that went against RFK was a polio survivor says a lot.\u201d But she said she voted off other issues: her religious beliefs, stance on abortion and who would be best for the region\u2019s oil and gas industry.",
      "\u201cAs far as RFK being an anti-vaxxer, this is the most important thing: People have to make a decision for themselves and be as informed as they possibly can,\u201d Horton said.",

      "Mutikani, the Hobbs pediatrician, said she\u2019s seen vaccine hesitancy increase in recent years as parents come to her with worries that line up with what\u2019s trending on social media. \u201cVirulent\u201d misinformation is especially worrisome in rural areas with few news sources or where many people who don\u2019t regularly see doctors live, she said.",

    "story": [
      "There's a mid-March deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown, and hesitation is surfacing among congressional Republicans about potential cuts to Medicaid",
      "WASHINGTON -- Every time a baby is born in Louisiana, where Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson handily won reelection last year, there\u2019s more than a 60% chance taxpayers will finance the birth through Medicaid.",
      "In Republican Rep. David Valadao \u2019s central California district, 6 out of 10 people use Medicaid to pay for doctor visits and emergency room trips.",
      "And one-third of the population is covered by Medicaid in GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski's Alaska, one of the nation\u2019s costliest corners for health care.",
      "Each of these Republicans \u2014 and some of their conservative colleagues \u2014 lined up last week to defend Medicaid, in a departure from long-held GOP policies. Republicans, who already have ruled out massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare, are turning their attention to siphoning as much as $880 billion from Medicaid over the next decade to help finance $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "But as a deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown nears, hesitation is surfacing among Washington's Republican lawmakers \u2014 once reliable critics of lofty government social welfare programs such as Medicaid \u2014 who say that deep cuts to the health care program could prove too untenable for people back home.",
      "\u201cI've heard from countless constituents who tell me the only way they can afford health care is through programs like Medicaid,\u201d Valadao said on the House floor. \u201cAnd I will not support a final reconciliation bill that risks leaving them behind.\u201d",
      "And on Wednesday, President Donald Trump, too, made his position on Medicaid clear: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to touch it.\u201d",
      "States and the federal government jointly pay for Medicaid, which offers nearly-free health care coverage for roughly 80 million poor and disabled Americans, including millions of children. It cost $880 billion to operate in 2023.",
      "Johnson has ruled out two of the biggest potential cuts: paying fixed, shrunken rates to states for care and changing the calculation for the share of federal dollars that each state receives for Medicaid. Just a few years ago, Johnson spearheaded a report that lobbied for some of those changes during the first Trump administration.",
      "Johnson insisted in a CNN interview that the focus will instead be ferreting out \u201cfraud, waste and abuse, in Medicaid, although it's unlikely to deliver the savings Republicans seek.",
      "GOP pressure over Medicaid is mounting, with some state party leaders joining the calls to preserve the program. States are already struggling with the growing cost of sicker patients and could be left to cover more if the federal government pulls back. In some states, the federal government picks up over 80%.",
      "More than a dozen Minnesota GOP lawmakers wrote the president recently warning that \u201ctoo deep of a cut is unmanageable in any instance.\u201d Gov. Joe Lombardo, R-Nev., told Congress in a letter that \u201cproposed reductions would put lives at risk.\" In Alaska, state Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, a Republican and nurse, cited \u201chuge concerns\u201d during a floor speech.",
      "Nationally, 55% of Americans said the government spends too little on Medicaid, according to a January poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now a very popular program that touches a very broad cross-section of American society,\u201d said Drew Altman, president of the health care research firm KFF. \u201cRoughly half of the American people say that they or a family member have at one time been served by the program.\u201d",
      "Significant changes to Medicaid are still on the table. They have to be for Republicans get the savings they need to pay for tax cuts.",
      "Work requirements, which could save as much as $109 billion over the next decade, seem to have solid support among GOP members, with some individual Republican-led states already moving to implement them.",
      "Republicans also could consider cuts in benefits or coverage, as well as eliminating a provider tax that states use to finance Medicaid, Altman added.",
      "Democrats warn that reductions are inevitable and could be dire.",
      "Starting Monday, TV ads will caution people across 20 congressional districts that hospitals are at risk of closing and millions of people could lose coverage if Republicans cut Medicaid \"to fund massive tax cuts for Elon Musk and billionaires.\u201d The Democratic super political action committee House Majority Forward has launched the seven-figure campaign.",
      "Trump and Republicans have for years called to lower government spending on health care, but they have struggled to formulate a serious plan that gains traction. Trump, for example, has spent nearly a decade arguing for an overhaul of the Affordable Care Act. His efforts to repeal the Obama-era national health care law failed during his first term and in his most recent presidential campaign he offered only \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d to adapt the program.",
      "Michael Cannon, a director of health studies at libertarian Cato Institute, believes Medicaid needs an overhaul because it is a significant part of the federal budget and a contributor to the nation's growing debt.",
      "But Republicans, he said, are not looking at serious ways to drive down the cost of health care.",
      "\u201cThe only reason for the cuts right now is to pay for the tax cuts,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cNone of them are talking about the need to do better health reform.\u201d",

      "Eating greasy food can keep you awake at night",
      "Anyone who has ever suffered in bed after eating three slices of pizza could surmise there is some relationship between food and sleep quality.",
      "For Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director of Columbia University\u2019s Center of Excellence for Sleep and Circadian Research, years of studying the relationship confirmed it.",
      "Data from large-scale population studies showed that eating a lot of saturated fat and simple carbohydrates made it harder to get deep, restorative sleep, she said. The inverse was also true. People who don\u2019t get enough sleep, for example, were more likely to be obese.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cycle of having poor sleep leading to poor dietary choices, and lower dietary quality that further propels poor sleep,\u201d St-Onge said.",
      "If bad food could keep you awake, she wondered, can good food help you sleep? Her research led to a new cookbook, \u201cEat Better, Sleep Better,\u201d co-written with Kat Craddock, editor-in-chief of the food magazine Saveur.",
      "St-Onge said the answer is yes. The book's recipes reflect her findings that people with high-fiber diets report better sleep, and the dishes rely heavily on what she called sleep-supporting ingredients.",
      "Nuts, seeds and whole grains such as barley, buckwheat and kasha contain melatonin, a compound the body also produces naturally to regulate the circadian rhythm. Research suggests the anti-inflammatory properties of ginger and turmeric improve sleep quality, as do the phytochemicals in brightly colored fruits and vegetables like squash, cherries, bananas and beefsteak tomatoes, St-Onge said.",
      "Besides the properties of particular ingredients, the combination of certain foods is key to encouraging your body to produce the hormones it needs to fall and stay sleep, she said. Tryptophan, for example, is an essential amino acid only found in food, but it requires nutrients such as magnesium, zinc and B vitamins to be converted into melatonin and serotonin.",
      "St-Onge noted that people shouldn\u2019t expect to fall dead asleep after loading up on certain ingredients at dinner. Food has to be processed, with chemical reactions transforming nutrients over time before they are absorbed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s making sure you have a healthy diet across the day to have the nutrients at the ready,\u201d she said.",
      "Recipes were developed for every meal of the day, plus snacks and desserts, the authors said. The two then arranged them into a 28-day meal plan designed to improve your sleep.",
      "Craddock said developing the recipes came naturally because the research stressed using a variety of foods she likes to cook with anyway. The challenge was making sure the recipes fell within the nutritional requirements.",
      "\u201cMy instincts are to go hard on bacon and butter and cheese and heavy cream, and she pared a lot of that back,\u201d Craddock said.",
      "Instead of bacon, Craddock said, she could achieve similar flavors with a little olive oil and smoked paprika. \u201cIt was a bit of a dance back and forth between my more restaurant approach to making foods delicious and her nutritional goals.\u201d",
      "A Creole gumbo recipe, for instance, is inspired more by a vegetarian version often served during Lent than the heavier traditional one. The andouille often used \u2014 a pork product high in saturated fat \u2014 is swapped out for healthier chicken sausage. Adding more than a pound of mixed greens makes it more like a vegetable stew, and brown rice adds a complex carbohydrate.",
      "With numerous charts and scientific research, the book is a practical guide to improving your diet in general. But Craddock said it also introduces people to international ingredients and dishes so they might think beyond what they eat every day.",
      "\u201cIf you dig a little deeper and look a little further, there are healthful and flavorful and exciting ingredients from many cultures that are right in our own backyard,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Forest Service has terminated $75 million awarded to the Arbor Day Foundation to help disadvantaged communities plant trees",
      "Arthur Johnson has lived in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward for nearly three decades, long enough to appreciate the trees that filter pollution from the big ships traveling the nearby Mississippi River and that offer shade on sweltering summer days.",
      "When Hurricane Katrina roared through two decades ago, it wiped out 200,000 trees across the city, including many in Johnson's neighborhood and several in his own yard. The city has struggled ever since to restore its tree canopy.",
      "Those efforts will be set back by the U.S. Forest Service's decision in mid-February to terminate a $75 million grant to the Arbor Day Foundation, which was working to plant trees in neighborhoods that might not otherwise be able to afford them. The program is the latest victim of a drive by President Donald Trump's administration against environmental justice initiatives.",
      "In New Orleans, part of the money was going to the environmental group Sustaining Our Urban Landscape (SOUL), which has planted more than 1,600 trees in the historically Black community but has now paused plans for another 900.",
      "Those are trees that largely low-income residents otherwise couldn\u2019t afford to plant or maintain, said the 71-year-old Johnson, who runs a local nonprofit, the Lower 9th Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement and Development, that has helped SOUL with its work and done some tree plantings of its own in the area.",
      "\u201cYou're not just cutting out the tree, the environment\u201d with such cuts, said Johnson. If those trees aren\u2019t replaced and more aren\u2019t continually added, \u201cit really takes a toll on the sustainability of the Lower 9th Ward and its community.\u201d",
      "The benefits of trees are vast. They capture stormwater and replenish groundwater. They help clean the air in polluted areas, improve mental health, and cool air and surfaces of the built environment, especially during heat waves that are growing more intense and frequent with climate change.",
      "One study by the UCLA Luskin Center found that shade can reduce heat stress on the human body from 25% to 35% throughout the day. And much research shows that low-income and communities of color have fewer trees \u2014 and are hotter \u2014 than better-off neighborhoods.",
      "The Arbor Day Fund's grant was part of former President Joe Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, which sent $1.5 billion to the forest service\u2019s Urban and Community Forestry program. In a Feb. 14 email canceling the grant, the Forest Service wrote that the award \"no longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.\u201d",
      "But Dan Lambe, the Arbor Day Foundation's chief executive, said the projects weren't just going to serve disadvantaged people. They were going to benefit every member of the community, he said. In total, 105 nonprofits, municipalities and Indigenous organizations \u2014 from Alaska to Florida to Maine \u2014 have lost funding for critical environmental projects, the foundation said.",
      "\u201cThis was an opportunity to make a really meaningful impact on people\u2019s lives, so it\u2019s been disappointing,\" Lambe said.",
      "The Forest Service didn't say if other recipients of the $1.5 billion forestry investment also had grants terminated. In a statement, its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said the agency was following directions to comply with Trump's executive orders.",
      "\u201cProtecting the people and communities we serve, as well as the infrastructure, businesses, and resources they depend on to grow and thrive, remains a top priority for the USDA and the Forest Service,\u201d the agency said.",
      "For SOUL in New Orleans, losing the grant means they don't have the money to water trees already planted, and they've had to drop plans to hire three people. Another $2.5 million grant is on hold due to the federal funding freeze, and founder and executive director Susannah Burley said the nonprofit's survival is uncertain. Its annual budget is a little more than $1 million.",
      "\u201cWe kind of are lost because we don\u2019t know if we should be planning to close our doors or if we should be planning for next season,\u201d she said.",
      "For others who were set to get Arbor Day Foundation money, the loss is not existential but still devastating. In the city-county of Butte-Silver Bow in southwest Montana, forester Trevor Peterson was going to use a $745,250 grant to buy chain saws, rigging gear and other essential tools, remove up to 200 dead or dying cottonwoods and plant as many as 1,000 trees as part of a decades-long effort to replenish trees cut to make way for copper mining. He wanted to help organize large community events focused on education, hoping to impart the knowledge necessary for future stewardship of the urban forest.",
      "\u201cWe will now have to go back to the drawing board to determine where to go from here,\u201d he said.",
      "Jackson County, Oregon, was awarded a $600,000 grant to replant trees after wildfires in 2020 destroyed thousands of homes and charred more than 60,000 trees. The town of Talent lost two-thirds of its trees.",
      "The nonprofit Oregon Urban Rural and Community Forestry, founded in the fires' aftermath, fought for years to get a single dollar, recalled Mike Oxendine, the group's founder and director.",
      "The grant money from the Arbor Day Foundation was being used to help low-income and disadvantaged mobile home park residents \u2014 among the hardest-hit by the fires \u2014 identify and remove hazardous trees badly burned or killed, and replant trees for shade and cooling.",
      "\u201cThis is a rural red area that needs it badly,\u201d said Oxendine. \u201cWe hit temperatures that exceed 110 degrees every summer now. We go through massive droughts and we\u2019re always prone to wildfire here.\u201d",
      "The loss of funding will create a \u201ctremendous burden\u201d for the organization, he said.",

      "The number of babies born in South Korea has rebounded for the first time in nine years",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The number of babies born in South Korea rebounded for the first time in nine years in 2024, welcome news for a country grappling with one of the the world\u2019s most serious demographic crises.",
      "South Korea\u2019s statistics agency said Wednesday that 238,300 babies were born last year, an increase of 8,300 from a year earlier. It said the country\u2019s fertility rate \u2014 the average number of babies born to each woman in their reproductive years \u2014 was 0.75 in 2024, up from 0.72 in 2023.",
      "It\u2019s the first time that the yearly number of births has increased since 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say this is a considerably meaningful rebound,\u201d Choi Yoon Kyung, an expert at the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, said Thursday. \u201cWe still have to see figures in the next few years to find whether it was a temporary rebound or it was driven by structural changes.\u201d",
      "Park Hyun Jung, a senior official at the Statistics Korea, said that her agency assessed the increase in births was partly attributable to an increase in marriages among couples who delayed weddings during the COVID-19 pandemic period.",
      "Park said that another factor behind the rebound was a growing number of people entering their early 30s. She also cited a government survey showing a small increase in the number of young people hoping to have children after marriage.",
      "Official data show South Korea\u2019s fertility rate has been the lowest in the developed world in recent years. In 2022, it was the only country whose fertility rate was below 1 among members of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "The low fertility rate poses a major potential threat to South Korea\u2019s economy, Asia's fourth largest, as it will cause labor shortages and greater welfare spendings. South Korea\u2019s central and regional governments have been increasingly offering a variety of financial incentives and other support programs to those who give birth to children.",
      "But experts say that it will be extremely difficult to address the country's demographic challenges as young people don't want to have babies, owing to a mix of factors that make it difficult to raise them in the brutally competitive, fast-changing country. They cite expensive housing, low levels of social mobility, the huge cost of raising and educating children and a culture that requires women to handle far more of childcare.",
      "Park said that the fertility rate will likely stay on an upward trend at least for another year. But observers say it remains to be seen whether the rate will go back down as post-pandemic marriages even out. The country\u2019s demographic structure will also eventually see a drop in people in their early 30s.",
      "Some experts argue that the government should focus on supporting young couples who want to have babies, rather than providing broad programs meant to address diverse social problems.",
      "\u201cThere are still people with solid wills to have a family and babies. When we help them realize their hopes, our fertility rate won\u2019t suffer a steep, 45-degree drop,\u201d Choi said."

      "Officials say Pakistan has reported two new cases of polio in its southern and eastern provinces, posing a setback to the country\u2019s efforts to eradicate a disease that remains endemic only in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan",
      "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan has reported two new cases of polio in its southern and eastern provinces, health officials said on Friday, posing a setback to the country\u2019s efforts to eradicate a disease that remains endemic only in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan.",
      "The latest cases, confirmed by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Program, were detected in Sindh and Punjab provinces. This brings the total number of polio cases in Pakistan to five since January 2025. In 2024, Pakistan recorded 74 polio cases.",
      "The latest development comes as health workers conclude a targeted vaccination drive in high-risk areas later Friday. Earlier this month, authorities launched a weeklong nationwide anti-polio campaign aiming to immunize 44.2 million children under the age of five.",
      "Escorted by police, polio teams go door-to-door to administer the oral vaccine, though they are often attacked by militants who falsely claim that vaccination efforts are part of a Western plot to sterilize Muslim children. Since the 1990s, more than 200 polio workers and the police assigned to protect them have been killed in attacks."

      "BANGKOK -- The U.S. registered its first death from measles since 2015 this week, as a child who wasn\u2019t vaccinated died in a measles outbreak in rural West Texas.",
      "Normally, most U.S. cases are brought into the country by people who have traveled overseas. So far, Texas state officials have reported 124 cases. New Mexico has reported nine.",
      "Experts point to declining measles vaccination rates worldwide since the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United States, most states now are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "Britain reported 2,911 confirmed measles cases in 2024, the highest number of cases recorded annually, since 2012.",
      "Measles cases in the United States last year were nearly double the total for all of 2023, raising concerns about the preventable, once-common childhood virus. Health officials confirmed measles cases in at least 18 states in 2024, including in New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago.",
      "\"Measles anywhere is a threat everywhere,\" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control say on their website.",
      "Here's a brief look at the global measles situation.",
      "According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 10.3 million people were infected with measles in 2023 and 107,500 died. Most were unvaccinated people or children younger than five. Cases were most common in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia where incomes are low and health services insufficient.",
      "In places where measles have largely been eradicated, cases have been spread by travelers from other countries.",
      "While measles-related deaths declined slightly in 2023, the number of outbreaks increased. Major outbreaks took place in 57 countries in 2023, including India and Indonesia, Russia, Yemen and Iraq. The largest number of cases in 2023 was 311,500 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "The worldwide rate of childhood vaccinations has fallen in recent years, to 83% in 2023 from 86% in 2019, partly due to disruptions in immunization and health care due to the pandemic.",
      "The WHO estimates that vaccination helped to prevent more than 60 million deaths worldwide between 2000 and 2023, as efforts to get the shots to more people ramped up. In 2000, 800,062 people are estimated to have died of measles. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, major epidemics caused about 2.6 million deaths a year.",
      "Measles is so highly infectious that 95% immunity is required to prevent epidemics, the WHO says. Put another way, it infects about 9 of 10 people exposed if they lack immunity.",
      "The WHO and others are backing an effort called \u201cImmunization Agenda 2021-2030,\u201d to push for elimination of measles.",
      "Independent experts declared the Americas free of endemic measles in 2016 but that status was lost in 2018 due to measles outbreaks in Brazil and Venezuela. Reduced vaccination rates are undermining efforts to fully eradicate the disease, experts say.",
      "Global health organizations and other groups have increased their efforts to speed up immunization programs and close the gaps in prevention."

    "story": [
      "A bill that would strip gender identity protections from Iowa\u2019s civil rights code has received final legislative approval and now goes to the governor",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa lawmakers became the first in the nation to approve legislation removing gender identity protections from the state\u2019s civil rights code Thursday, despite massive protests by opponents who say it could expose transgender people to discrimination in numerous areas of life.",
      "The measure raced through the legislative process after first being introduced last week. The state Senate was first to approve the bill on Thursday, on party lines, followed by the House less than an hour later. Five House Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it.",
      "The bill would remove gender identity as a protected class from the state\u2019s civil rights law and explicitly define female and male, as well as gender, which would be considered a synonym for sex and \u201cshall not be considered a synonym or shorthand expression for gender identity, experienced gender, gender expression, or gender role.\u201d",
      "The measure would be the first legislative action in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank.",
      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who signed earlier policies banning sports participation and public bathroom access for transgender students. A spokesperson for Reynolds declined to comment on whether she would sign the bill. If she does, it will go into effect on July 1.",
      "Hundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading \u201cTrans rights are human rights\u201d and chanting slogans including \u201cNo hate in our state!\u201d There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. Of the 167 people who signed up to testify at a 90-minute public hearing before a House committee, all but 24 were opposed to the bill.",
      "Protesters who watched the vote from the House gallery loudly booed and shouted \u201cShame!\u201d as the chamber adjourned. Many admonished Iowa state Rep. Steven Holt, who floor managed the bill and delivered a fierce defense of it before it passed.",
      "Supporters of the change say the current law incorrectly codified the idea that people can transition to another gender and granted transgender women access to spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams that should be protected for people who were assigned female at birth. Holt said the inclusion of gender identity in the civil rights codes threatens recent \u201ccommonsense\u201d laws to ban transgender participation in sports and access to bathrooms.",
      "\u201cThe legislature of Iowa for the future of our children and our culture has a vested interest and solemn responsibility to stand up for immutable truth,\u201d Holt said.",
      "The Iowa lawmakers\u2019 actions came as the Georgia House backed away from removing gender protections from the state\u2019s hate crimes law, which was passed in 2020 after the death of Ahmaud Arbery.",
      "Iowa\u2019s current civil rights law protects against discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.",
      "Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state\u2019s Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.",
      "Iowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the last Democrat to speak out Thursday against the bill removing those protections, becoming emotional as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: \"I transitioned to save my life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,\u201d Wichtendahl said. \u201cThe sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.\u201d",
      "About half of U.S. states include gender identity in their civil rights code to protect against discrimination in housing and public places, such as stores or restaurants, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Some additional states do not explicitly protect against such discrimination but it is included in legal interpretations of statutes.",
      "Iowa\u2019s Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Several Republican-led legislatures are pushing to enact more laws this year creating legal definitions of male and female based on the reproductive organs at birth following an executive order from President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump also signed orders laying the groundwork for banning transgender people from military service and keeping transgender girls and women out of girls and women\u2019s sports competitions, among other things. Most of the policies are being challenged in court.",

      "EL PASO, Texas -- On the Texas border, Dr. Hector Granados treats children with diabetes at his El Paso clinics and makes hospital rounds under the shadow of accusations that have thrown his career into jeopardy: providing care to transgender youth.",
      "In what's believed to be a U.S. first, Texas is suing Granados and two other physicians over claims that they violated the state's ban on gender-affirming care for minors, calling the doctors \u201cscofflaws\u201d in lawsuits filed last fall that threaten to impose steep fines and revoke their medical licenses. He denies the accusations, and all three doctors have asked courts to dismiss the cases.",
      "The cases are a pivotal test of intensifying Republican efforts to prevent such treatments, including President Donald Trump's executive order that would bar federal support for gender-affirming care for youth under 19.",
      "Some hospitals have already begun unwinding services for pediatric patients. But, so far, only Texas is demonstrating what punishing doctors looks like when bans are allegedly broken.",
      "Granados, in an interview with The Associated Press, said he was meticulous in halting transgender care before Texas' ban took effect in 2023. He denied that he continued prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to transitioning patients and said he was initially unclear which patients, who are not named in the lawsuit, he is accused of wrongfully treating.",
      "The other accused doctors \u2014 both in Dallas \u2014 are under temporary court orders not to see patients and only practice medicine in research and academic settings.",
      "\u201cLooking at the patients was hard because they were kind of disappointed of what was going on,\u201d Granados said of ending their care. \u201cBut it was something that needed to be followed because it\u2019s the law.\u201d",
      "The lawsuits are believed to be the first time a state has brought enforcement under laws that ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors, which Republicans have enacted in 27 states, including this month in Kansas over the Democratic governor\u2019s veto. Although those accused of violating bans face criminal charges in some states, they do not in Texas.",
      "Nationwide, doctors and hospital executives are reevaluating transgender health programs that carry a widening risk of litigation and losing federal funding. For transgender Americans, the climate has narrowed options for care and deepened fears.",
      "Trump has launched a broad charge against transgender rights quickly in his second term, signing executive orders that include barring schools from using federal education dollars to support students who are socially transitioning. Supporters say restrictions protect vulnerable children from what they see as a \u201cradical\u201d ideology about gender and making irreversible medical decisions.",
      "The Texas lawsuits were brought by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has previously gone beyond the state's borders to launch investigations into gender-affirming treatment.",
      "His office did not respond to requests for an interview. At a court hearing Wednesday involving the Dallas doctors, an attorney in Paxton\u2019s office declined to comment and referred questions to the agency\u2019s press office.",
      "\u201cI will enforce the law to the fullest extent to prevent any doctor from providing these dangerous drugs to kids,\u201d Paxton said in a statement this month.",
      "Granados is one of two pediatric endocrinologists in El Paso, a desert city of about 700,000 where mountains rise in the distance.",
      "Granados, 48, is from Ciudad Juarez, the neighboring Mexican city that sprawls out south of El Paso. He said that after attending medical school in Mexico he completed additional training in New York and Connecticut but he wanted to return to what he said is an underserved region.",
      "He opened a gender clinic at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso before starting his own practice in 2019. Before the ban, Granados said, treating transgender youth was just an extension of his practice that also treats youth with diabetes, growth problems and early puberty.",
      "He said he accepted transgender patients only if they had first received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a mental health provider.",
      "\u201cIt was not different from doing everything else that a pediatric endocrinologist does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just taking care of children who required that specific therapy.\u201d",
      "Emiliana Edwards was among them. Now 18, she called Granados an \u201camazing\u201d caregiver who carefully explained her gender-affirming treatment. But at her first appointment after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the ban in 2023, Edwards said the room felt different, \u201clike there were wires everywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt like we couldn\u2019t talk about anything really, even the most simple stuff,\u201d she said.",
      "Her mother, Lorena Edwards, said Granados put a \u201ccold stop\u201d to her daughter\u2019s care.",
      "\u201cIt was just: \u2018I don\u2019t provide that care anymore.\u2019 And it was done,\u201d she said.",
      "At the heart of Texas' lawsuits against Granados, Dr. May Lau and Dr. M. Brett Cooper are allegations of prescribing treatment to transition their patients' sex after the ban took effect.",
      "In one instance, the state accuses Granados of prescribing testosterone to a 16-year-old, alleging that although the doctor's records identify the patient as male, the teenager's sex assigned at birth is female. Granados and Lau are also accused of having instructed patients to wait until after the ban was in place to fill prescriptions.",
      "Granados does not dispute that he has continued prescribing puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy. He said those treatments are not for gender transition but for children with endocrine disorders, which occur when hormone levels are too high or too low.",
      "He said he prescribes testosterone for many reasons, including for patients whose testicles don\u2019t work or had to be removed because of cancer. Others have brain tumors, or surgery or radiation to the brain, that impact puberty. Patients with early onset puberty also need puberty blockers, he said.",
      "Attorneys for Lau said she has always complied with the law and the claims have no merit. Attorneys for Cooper did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cThis is really part of a bigger pattern of extremism within the state that even other states have shied away from replicating,\u201d said Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal for the Human Rights Campaign.",
      "Transgender adults and youth make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, according to estimates by the Williams Institute, an LGBTQ+ research center at the UCLA School of Law.",
      "Granados' trial has been set for late October; trial dates have not yet been set yet for Lau and Cooper. While the cases are pending, Lau and Cooper agreed to practice medicine only in research and academic settings and not see patients.",
      "Neither Lau or Cooper attended the Wednesday hearing in their cases by a judge who is set to decide where their trials will be held.",
      "Under Texas' ban, the state medical board is instructed to revoke the licenses of doctors who are found to have violated the law.",
      "Lorena Edwards said she watched her daughter thrive during her transition then descend into melancholy as laws targeting transgender rights gained steam.",
      "Emiliana Edwards has switched to receiving treatment in neighboring New Mexico \u2014 where gender-affirming care is legal \u2014 but she said attacks on the transgender community have taken a toll on her mental health.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re normal people, too, and we\u2019re just trying to live,\u201d she said.",

      "Not even one of Trump\u2019s most fervent fans in Greenland \u2014 who proudly wears a MAGA hat, and a T-shirt emblazoned with Trump pumping his fist and the words: \u201cAmerican Badass\u201d \u2014 wants to be American.",
      "But like other Greenlanders, he wants stronger ties to the U.S. and to open for business beyond Denmark, which colonized them 300 years ago and still exercises control over foreign and defense policy.",
      "\u201cWhen Trump came to office, he wanted to talk to Greenlanders directly without going through Denmark. He wants to negotiate with us and that\u2019s why the Danish are very afraid,\u201d said J\u00f8rgen Boassen, who has visited the White House and welcomed Donald Trump Jr. when he recently visited Nuuk.",
      "The American president's comments set off a political crisis in Denmark. The prime minister went on a tour of European capitals to garner support, saying the continent faced \u201ca more uncertain reality,\u201d while her country moved to strengthen its military presence around Greenland.",
      "For some, it\u2019s been dizzying, a rollercoaster of emotions since Trump\u2019s threats, since his son landed in Nuuk in January in a TRUMP-emblazoned plane and since his father posted on social media: \u201cMAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!\u201d with a message to Greenlanders: \u201cWe\u2019re going to treat you well.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen that was happening, I felt like I was hit in the stomach,\u201d said Qupanuk Olsen, a mining engineer and social media influencer running in the election for the Naleraq party.",
      "Around her, supporters gathered at a bay filled with giant pieces of ice in Nuuk waving the red and white national flag that represents the sun and the ice that covers most of Greenland.",
      "\u201cI could feel that the ground will no longer ever be the same again,\" she said. \"It\u2019s as if we were on sea ice and it started to break, and we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next.\u201d",
      "Journalists from afar have descended on Nuuk, asking locals what they think of Trump\u2019s words. Pro-Trump media influencers known as the Nelk Boys arrived handing out MAGA hats and $100 bills to children in Nuuk\u2019s streets.",
      "\u201cEven though there are strong feelings of sadness, despair, confusion, I think we\u2019re also stronger than ever. We\u2019re fighting it for our people and that gives me hope,\u201d said Aka Hansen, an Inuk filmmaker and writer. She is suspicious of Trump\u2019s intentions but still thanks him for turning the world\u2019s attention to her homeland.",
      "\u201cWe went through all the emotions \u2014 at first very funny, very light, then very serious,\u201d said Hansen, who worked with Conan O\u2019Brien when the comedian came to Nuuk in 2019 to shoot an episode poking fun at Trump\u2019s idea of buying Greenland. \u201cNow, with all the international press that\u2019s been here, we\u2019ve been given a voice that\u2019s being taken seriously.\u201d",
      "Like many other Greenlanders, she doesn\u2019t want to be ruled by another colonial power. But she feels Trump\u2019s rhetoric has increased the momentum for independence from Denmark.",
      "The former colonial ruler is accused of committing abuses against her island\u2019s Inuit people, including removing children from their families in the 1950s with the excuse of integrating them into Danish society and fitting women with intrauterine contraceptive devices in the 1960s and 1970s \u2014 allegedly to limit population growth in Greenland.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a historic moment for Greenland ... compared to two months ago when nobody was talking about independence,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cNow, everybody\u2019s talking about it.\"",
      "A former colony of Denmark, Greenland gained self-rule in 1979 and now runs itself through its parliament. A treaty with the United States, and a U.S. military base in Greenland, also gives Washington say over the territory\u2019s defense.",
      "Greenland is massive \u2014 about one-fifth the size of the United States or three times the size of Texas. Its land mass is in North America, and its Arctic capital city is closer to New York than to Copenhagen.",
      "\u201cDenmark is just a middle man in that whole setup. And we don\u2019t need that middle man anymore,\u201d said Juno Berthelsen, a candidate in the election for Naleraq party. He says Trump has given Greenland leverage to negotiate with Denmark. \u201cOur political goal is to have our own defense agreement, so that we connect directly with the U.S. in terms of defense and security.\u201d",
      "His party, he said, aims to invoke an article in a law that would give Greenland increased autonomy and eventually a path to full independence.",
      "Asked to describe Greenland\u2019s moment, he said: \u201cIf I had to pick one word, it would be exciting. And full of opportunities.\u201d",
      "In his first term in office, Trump began to talk about acquiring Greenland from Denmark, a longtime U.S. ally. Back in 2019, most dismissed it. But it had a ripple effect.",
      "\u201cIt was not taken that seriously back then as it is today. But it was important for Greenland because he, without wanting, did Greenlanders a favor,\u201d said Ebbe Volquardsen, a professor of cultural history at the University of Greenland. \u201cHe underlined the value of being in a union with Greenland.\u201d",
      "Greenland\u2019s economy depends on fisheries and other industries as well as on an annual grant of about $600 million from Denmark. When Trump showed interest in buying Greenland because of its strategic location and mineral resources, he highlighted that annual sum as the amount of what other nations would be willing to pay to have a military or commercial presence in Greenland, Volquardsen said. With that, he gave Greenland leverage for more autonomy and possible reparations for abuses committed by its former colonial ruler.",
      "\u201cThat was important because the narrative in Denmark until that date \u2026 had been that Greenland is receiving this funding as a kind of aid or altruistic gift,\u201d Volquardsen, said.",
      "Life in Nuuk seemed to go on as usual in mid-February, except for a \u201cheat wave.\u201d After weeks of subzero temperatures, it made the capital of Greenland several degrees hotter than Washington, D.C., the U.S. capital.",
      "Large chunks of powder blue ice were blown by winds, blocking boats on the harbor and creating a spectacle for residents who snapped photos under the pink light of a sunset. Some nights, the sky was lit up by spectacular streaks of green and other colors from the northern lights.",
      "You could almost forget that Greenland has become ground zero for a geopolitical showdown \u2014 if, that is, you ignored the front pages of local newspapers featuring images of Trump and the ticker tape in downtown with his name and the Greenlandic word \u201cAmerikamiut.\u201d",
      "On a frigid day, a group of kindergarteners in fluorescent vests walked in line behind their teacher as they crossed a road covered in ice and snow. A few blocks away, teenagers played hockey on a frozen pond.",
      "On a hill next to a statue of the Danish-Norwegian missionary who founded the city in 1721, bells tolled, and a recently married couple laughed as family members threw rice on them for good fortune outside Nuuk\u2019s wooden Lutheran cathedral. More than 90% of Greenlanders identify as Lutherans.",
      "After the wedding ceremony, guests converged at their home for a \u201cKaffemik,\u201d a traditional celebratory gathering where they share coffee and baked goods.",
      "Some Greenlanders say they felt safe while being largely unknown to the world. Now, though, that feeling has dissipated.",
      "Sitting with her husband at a dinner table filled with families chatting and laughing, Tukumminnguaq Olsen Lyberth, said the wave of attention and polarizing comments prompted some friends to delete Facebook accounts.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not use to having this big attention about us, so it\u2019s overwhelming. Before, no one knew about us. Now, it\u2019s a blitz of attention,\u201d said Olsen Lyberth, 37, a cultural history student at the University of Greenland.",
      "\u201cI feel like this is the longest January,\u201d she said jokingly \u2014 in February. \u201cIt\u2019s all of it. Everything feels too overwhelming.\"",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- The speaker of New Zealand \u2019s Parliament told lawmakers he would not consider further complaints about the use of the country\u2019s M\u0101ori name, Aotearoa, in Parliament, after one lawmaker made a bid to have it banned.",
      "\u201cAotearoa is regularly used as a name of New Zealand,\u201d Speaker Gerry Brownlee said in a ruling on Tuesday at Parliament in Wellington. \u201cIt appears on our passports and it appears on our currency.\u201d",
      "The conflict over a word increasingly prominent in New Zealand life arose last month when one lawmaker objected to another\u2019s use of the term. It reflects the way enthusiasm for the Indigenous language among New Zealanders of all ethnicities has at times prompted a backlash \u2014 including about what the country should be called.

Men\u00e9ndez March, who was born in Mexico, is a New Zealand citizen, which is a requirement for all lawmakers.",

      "The M\u0101ori language is growing in popularity, after decades of advocacy by M\u0101ori leaders reversed its fortunes. M\u0101ori \u2014 who make up close to 20% of New Zealanders \u2014 were discouraged from speaking the language after British colonization, and by the turn of the 21st century it was expected to die out completely.",

      "He had to resume using the mask on Monday after suffering two respiratory crises that required doctors to extract \u201ccopious\u201d amounts of mucus from his lungs. Doctors performed two bronchoscopies, in which a camera-tipped tube was sent into his airways with a sucker at the tip to suction out fluid.",
      "The 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, remained alert, oriented and cooperated with medical personnel, the Vatican said. The prognosis remained guarded, meaning he was not out of danger. Doctors didn\u2019t say if he remained in stable condition, though they referred to the crises in the past tense.",
      "The fact that Francis no longer needed the ventilation mask by Tuesday morning was a sign that he had stabilized some after the crises, but still within what doctors have said was a complex respiratory picture.",
      "The crises were a new setback in what has become a more than two-week battle by the frail pope to overcome a complex respiratory infection.",
      "The Vatican said the mucus that had accumulated in Francis' lungs was his body\u2019s reaction to the original pneumonia infection and not a new infection, given laboratory tests don\u2019t indicate any new bacteria.",
      "Dr. John Coleman, a pulmonary critical care doctor at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said the episodes were more concerning than the last one on Friday, in which Francis had a coughing fit, inhaled some vomit that needed to be extracted, was put on the noninvasive mechanical ventilation for a day and then didn\u2019t need it anymore.",
      "The use of bronchoscopies reflects a worrying level of mucus and phlegm in the lungs, Coleman said. \u201cThe fact that they had to go in there and remove it manually is concerning, because it means that he is not clearing the secretions on his own,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s taking little steps forward and then steps back,\u201d said Coleman, who is not involved in Francis\u2019 care.",
      "Francis, who is not physically active, uses a wheelchair and is overweight, had been undergoing respiratory physiotherapy to try to improve his lung function. But the accumulation of the secretions in his lungs was a sign that he doesn\u2019t have the muscle tone to cough vigorously enough to expel the fluid.",
      "Doctors often use noninvasive ventilation to stave off an intubation, or the use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Francis has not been intubated during this hospitalization. It\u2019s not clear if he has provided any advance directives about the limits of his care if he declines or loses consciousness.",
      "Catholic teaching holds that life must be defended from conception until natural death. It insists that chronically ill patients, including those in vegetative states, must receive \u201cordinary\u201d care such as hydration and nutrition, but \u201cextraordinary\u201d or disproportionate care can be suspended if it is no longer beneficial or is only prolonging a precarious and painful life.",
      "Francis articulated that in a 2017 speech to a meeting of the Vatican\u2019s bioethics think tank, the Pontifical Academy for Life. He said there was \u201cno obligation to have recourse in all circumstances to every possible remedy.\u201d He added: \u201cIt thus makes possible a decision that is morally qualified as withdrawal of \u2018overzealous treatment.\u2019\u201d",
      "Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, who heads the academy which helps articulate the Catholic Church\u2019s position on end-of-life care, said Francis is like any other Catholic and would follow church teaching if it came to that.",
      "\u201cToday the pope is giving us an extraordinary teaching on fragility,\u201d he told reporters Monday. \u201cToday the pope, not through words but with his body, is reminding all of us, we elderly people to begin with, that we are all fragile and therefore we need to take care of each other.\u201d",
      "Francis\u2019 hospitalization, which hits 18 nights Tuesday, is by no means reaching the papal record that was set during St. John Paul II\u2019s numerous lengthy hospitalizations over a quarter century. The longest single hospitalization occurred in 1981, when John Paul spent 55 days in Gemelli for a minor operation and then to be treated for a serious infection that followed.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- A Philippine fighter jet with two pilots on board has lost contact during a night combat assault in support of ground forces battling communist insurgents in a southern province, and an extensive search is underway, officials said Tuesday.",
      "The FA-50 jet lost communication during the mission with other air force aircraft around midnight Monday before reaching a target area. The other aircraft were able to return safely to an air base in central Cebu province after carrying out assaults, the air force said without providing other details for security reasons.",
      "A Philippine military official told The Associated Press that the incident happened in a southern province, where a counterinsurgency mission against New People's Army guerrillas was underway. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the sensitive situation publicly.",
      "\"We are hopeful of locating them and the aircraft soon and ask you to join us in prayer during this critical time,\u201d air force spokesperson Col. Ma. Consuelo Castillo said.",
      "The pilots could eject from the supersonic jets in case they encounter any problem that could lead to a crash. Rescuers could locate them if their emergency locating transmitters emitted signals.",
      "Castillo refused to say if rescuers have detected such signals but added that the military is \u201cstill very optimistic that they are safe.\u201d",
      "It was not immediately clear if the rest of the FA-50s would be grounded following the incident.",
      "The Philippines acquired 12 FA-50s multi-purpose fighter jets starting in 2015 from South Korea\u2019s Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd. The 18.9 billion peso ($331 million) contract had been the biggest under a military modernization program that has been repeatedly stalled by a lack of funds. The Philippines plans to acquire another 12 fighter jets from South Korea.",
      "The military estimates about 1,000 communist guerrillas remain after decades of battle setbacks, surrenders and factional fighting. Peace talks brokered by Norway collapsed under previous President Rodrigo Duterte after both sides accused the other of continuing deadly attacks despite the negotiations.",
      "In 2023, the government and the communist rebels agreed to resume talks aimed at ending one of Asia\u2019s longest insurgencies. But the talks still have not restarted under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.",
      "Aside from anti-insurgency operations, the jets have been used in a range of activities, from major national ceremonies to patrolling the disputed South China Sea."

      "CAIRO -- Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said Friday that Arab leaders have endorsed Egypt's postwar plan for the Gaza Strip that would allow its roughly 2 million Palestinians to remain in the territory.",
      "Meeting in Cairo on Tuesday, the leaders endorsed a counterproposal to President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to depopulate the territory and redevelop it as a beach destination. It was unclear if Israel or the United States would accept the Egyptian plan.",
      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
      "Arab leaders meeting in Cairo on Tuesday are set to endorse a counterproposal to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s call for the Gaza Strip to be depopulated and transformed into a beach destination, even as the continuation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire is uncertain.",
      "The summit hosted by Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi included the emir of Qatar, the vice president of the United Arab Emirates and the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia \u2014 countries whose support is crucial for any postwar plan. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres also attended.",
      "Israel has embraced what it says is an alternative U.S. proposal for the ceasefire itself and the release of hostages taken in Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the war. Israel has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to try to get Hamas to accept the new proposal and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting.",
      "The suspension of aid drew widespread criticism, with human rights groups saying that it violated Israel's obligations as an occupying power under international law.",
      "The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages \u2014 the militant group\u2019s main bargaining chip \u2014 in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners \u2014 a key component of the first phase.",
      "A 112-page draft of Egypt's $53 billion plan obtained by The Associated Press foresees rebuilding Gaza by 2030 without removing its population. The first phase calls for starting the removal of unexploded ordnance and clearing the more than 50 million tons of rubble left by Israel\u2019s bombardment and military offensives.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of temporary housing units would be set up where Gaza\u2019s population could live while reconstruction takes place. The rubble would be recycled, with some of it used as infill to create expanded lands on Gaza\u2019s Mediterranean coast.",
      "In the following years, the plan envisages completely reshaping the strip, building \u201csustainable, green and walkable\u201d housing and urban areas, with renewable energy. It renovates agricultural lands and creates industrial zones and large park areas.",
      "It also calls for the opening of an airport, a fishing port and a commercial port. The Oslo peace accords in the 1990s called for the opening of an airport and a commercial port in Gaza, but the projects withered as the peace process collapsed.",
      "Under the plan, Hamas would cede power to an interim administration of political independents until a reformed Palestinian Authority can assume control. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Western-backed authority and an opponent of Hamas, was attending the summit.",
      "Israel has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and, along with the United States, has demanded Hamas\u2019 disarmament. Hamas, which doesn't accept Israel's existence, has said it's willing to cede power in Gaza to other Palestinians, but won't give up its arms until there is a Palestinian state.",
      "Addressing the summit, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said that the plan \u201cpreserves the right of Palestinian people in rebuilding their nation and guarantees their existence on their land.\u201d",
      "He said there is a need for a parallel path for peace to achieve a \u201ccomprehensive, just and lasting settlement\u201d to the Palestinian cause.",
      "\u201cThere will be no true peace without the establishment of the Palestinian state,\u201d el-Sissi said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to adopt the launching of a serious and effective political path that leads to a permanent and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause according to the resolutions of international legitimacy.\u201d",
      "An early draft of the statement endorsing the plan called for a \u201cpermanent and just solution\u201d for the Palestinian cause, and for the U.N. Security Council to deploy international peacekeepers in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The mention of peacekeepers was dropped from a later draft.",
      "Israel has vowed to maintain open-ended security control over both territories, which it captured in the 1967 Mideast war and which Palestinians want for their future state. Israel\u2019s government and most of its political class are opposed to Palestinian statehood.",
      "Trump shocked the region last month when he suggested Gaza\u2019s roughly 2 million Palestinians be resettled in other countries. He said the United States would take ownership of the territory and redevelop it into a Middle Eastern \u201cRiviera.\u201d",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embraced the proposal, which was roundly rejected by Palestinians, Arab countries and human rights experts, who said it would likely violate international law.",
      "A senior European Union official attending the summit said the bloc was ready to provide \u201cconcrete support\u201d for Egypt's plan.",
      "\u201cThe European Union firmly rejects any attempt at demographic or territorial changes, in Gaza, in other parts of the world. Anywhere,\u201d Antonio Costa, president of the European Commission, told the summit.",
      "The EU, he said, is \u201ccommitted to the two-state solution, where Palestine and Israel can live side-by-side in peace and security.\u201d",
      "Riccardo Fabiani, North Africa director at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, said the summit is \u201ca key pillar in Egypt\u2019s strategy\u201d to counter Trump's plan for Gaza.",
      "\u201cEgypt is trying to present a credible alternative focused on reconstruction and an indirect consultation mechanism for Hamas that could reassure Israel and the US,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea is also to continue to frame this plan as part of a new push towards the two-state solution.\u201d",
      "Trump has suggested that Egypt and Jordan, two close American allies, could take in large numbers of Palestinian refugees from Gaza. Both countries have adamantly rejected any such plan.",
      "Meeting with Trump at the White House last month, King Abdullah II of Jordan offered to take in around 2,000 children for medical treatment. The first group of around 30 children left Gaza for Jordan on Tuesday, according to Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The children are being accompanied by up to two family members.",
      "Jordan said that the children are amputees and will return to Gaza when their treatment is complete. The kingdom has also set up field hospitals in Gaza and delivered aid by air and land.",
      "The war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 people hostage. Hamas-led militants are still holding 59 hostages, 35 of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements. Israel has rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more.",
      "Israel's 15-month offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It doesn't say how many were fighters, but the ministry says women and children made up more than half the dead. Israel says it killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The offensive destroyed large areas of Gaza, including much of its health system and other infrastructure. At its height, the war displaced about 90% of the population, mostly within the territory, where hundreds of thousands packed into squalid tent camps and schools repurposed as shelters.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly a decade after Pope Francis plucked them from a refugee camp in Greece, a Syrian couple and their child have carved out a quiet life in suburban Rome",
      "ROME -- Just before breaking the Ramadan fast on Sunday evening, Hasan Zaheda played basketball with his son in the tiny courtyard of the basement-level apartment on Rome\u2019s outskirts where the refugee family is rebuilding their lives.",
      "They have no pictures from their native Syria \u2013 they fled Damascus at the height of the civil war with only one change of clothes, diapers and milk for their toddler. But there is a framed photo of little Riad meeting Pope Francis, who brought them and two other Muslim families back with him to Italy from refugee camps in the Greek island of Lesbos almost a decade ago.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a gift from paradise,\u201d Zaheda said Sunday, chuckling. \u201cPope Francis, a gift from our God, that God sent us to save us.\u201d",
      "As the Zahedas began to observe the holy month of Ramadan, Francis, 88, entered his third week of battling pneumonia in a hospital not far away. The least they can do, the family said, is to be close to him in prayer night and day.",
      "\u201cWe look for his health bulletin every day,\u201d said the mother, Nour Essa, 39, after recalling meeting the pontiff suddenly in Lesbos. \u201cWhat shocked me the most is that the father of the church was a modest man, who didn\u2019t have prejudices, open toward other ethnicities and religion.\u201d",
      "The family journeyed on the pope\u2019s plane \u2013 one of the most visible moments of advocacy for migrants that marked Francis\u2019 papacy. The Zahedas remember how kindly Francis patted Riad\u2019s head as he passed down the aisle to speak with journalists.",
      "But \u201cmiraculous\u201d as it appeared to them, it was only the beginning of a new life in Italy to which they\u2019re still adjusting.",
      "Essa, a biologist, and Zaheda, an architect who worked as a civil servant in Damascus, decided to leave Syria in 2015 after he was drafted into the military. They sold their house to pay for a smuggler, walking through the night trying not to make a sound in the desert and at one point riding for ten hours in different trucks.",
      "After scrambling to get through ISIS-controlled territory, they made it into Turkey and then had three failed attempts to reach the Greek islands by boat before arriving in Lesbos in early 2016.",
      "\u201cI always thank God that my son was so small, and that he has no memory of all these things,\u201d Essa said as Riad watched a Syrian soap opera in the cramped living room with his grandfather, who fled about a year after them. On the walls, Hasan\u2019s haunting paintings of white faces against swirling black and red tell of the parents\u2019 all-too-vivid memories.",
      "After more than one month in a Lesbos camp, the family was approached for an interview by a stranger \u2013 Daniela Pompei, the head of migration and integration for the Catholic charity Sant\u2019Egidio.",
      "She had been tasked with finding families with appropriate paperwork that Francis could bring back to Rome with him, and asked them to make a decision on the spot. They accepted, and the charity, with Vatican funds, eventually brought more than 300 refugees from Greece and 150 from another papal trip to Cyprus in 2021.",
      "Sant\u2019Egidio\u2019s goal was to spare migrants longer journeys by sea across different routes in the Mediterranean, which have killed tens of thousands of asylum-seekers willing to \u201cdie for hope\u201d over the years, Pompei said.",
      "But the real test has been integration, from processing their asylum cases to learning Italian to school and job placement. Initiatives like the pope\u2019s make all the difference because they signal to the refugees that their new communities are willing to welcome them, despite faith differences.",
      "\u201cThe pope has long appealed to open parishes, to welcome at least one family in each parish, to push us Catholics too to counter what he called, with a very strong term in Lampedusa, \u2018the globalization of indifference,\u2019\u201d Pompei said.",
      "In the characteristic Roman accent they\u2019ve acquired, the Zaheda parents told of their challenges \u2013 having to reenroll in university so their degrees can be recognized, helping their families come to Europe, taking care of their son.",
      "Working or studying 12 hours a day, they rarely have time to socialize with other Syrian families and the migrants who comprise most of their neighbors in the modest brick-faced apartment buildings as well as most of Riad\u2019s classmates.",
      "His best friend is from Ecuador, and Riad plans to study Spanish in middle school. He\u2019s joined a local basketball team, and pictures from the court line his bedroom, where a large Syrian flag hangs by his bunkbed. He likes to read The Little Prince in English, but his Arabic is tentative, even though he spends most afternoons with his grandfather, who loves to sketch local churches.",
      "For Sunday\u2019s iftar \u2013 the meal breaking the day\u2019s fast \u2013 the family topped a little table with yogurt-and-chickpea tisiyeh salad and take-out pizza in typical Roman flavors like zucchini flowers and anchovies.",
      "As Riad packed his backpack for the school week, his parents said their future hinges on the little boy \u2013 for whom they will likely stay in Italy, instead of joining relatives in France or returning to a Syria they probably couldn\u2019t recognize.",
      "\u201cI always wish that he can build his future, that he can build a position as the son of an undocumented migrant who arrived in Italy and who wanted to leave his mark in a new country,\u201d Zaheda said.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil giant Aramco reported a $106.25 billion profit in 2024 on Tuesday, down 12% from the prior year as lower energy prices now squeeze the kingdom's multi-trillion-dollar development plans.",
      "Already, Saudi's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been digging a straight-line city in the desert for his $500 billion project at NEOM in Saudi Arabia\u2019s western desert on the Red Sea. He also will need to build tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of new stadiums and infrastructure ahead of the kingdom hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup.",
      "Meanwhile, he's also pledged potentially $600 billion in U.S. investments to President Donald Trump to entice him to the kingdom on his first foreign trip as president. Saudi Arabia is also the possible venue for a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin over Moscow's war on Ukraine.",
      "All that and OPEC+ moving toward increasing production means Saudi Arabia likely will need to take on new debt to fund the crown prince's vast ambitions.",
      "A filing on Riyadh's Tadawul stock exchange showed Aramco, formally known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., had revenues of $436 billion in 2024. That compares to $440.88 billion in 2023.",
      "Aramco reported a $121 billion annual profit in 2023, down from its 2022 record due to lower energy prices as well.",
      "\u201cThe decrease was primarily driven by lower revenue and other income related to sales, higher operating costs, as well as lower finance and other income,\u201d Aramco said in its filing.",
      "Stock in Aramco traded just over $7 a share Tuesday, down from a high over the last year of $8.71. It has fallen over the past year as oil prices have dropped. Benchmark Brent crude traded Tuesday at around $70 a barrel, down over 15% over the last year",
      "Aramco has a market value of $1.74 trillion, making it the world\u2019s sixth-most valuable company behind Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Amazon and Alphabet, which owns Google.",
      "Aramco will pay dividends of $21.36 billion for the fourth quarter, which includes a far-smaller performance dividend of $220 million. The company expects to pay dividends of $85.4 billion this year, which is far lower and will further erode cash that Saudi Arabia's monarchy can expect for the year.",
      "Speaking to analysts on a call Tuesday afternoon, Aramco CEO and President Amin H. Nasser said the company had capacity to bring online 3 million barrels of additional crude oil a day. Each additional million barrels a day would mean $12 billion in revenue a year, he said.",
      "\u201cGlobal oil inventory levels have declined to around five-year lows, which means there are potential risks related to geopolitical instability and volatility,\" Nasser said, suggesting crude prices could rise over time due to that. \"Against this backdrop, Aramco remains ready for all scenarios.\u201d",
      "The Aramco results come as OPEC+, an alliance of the oil cartel and other energy-producing states, met online Monday and agreed to proceed with an increase in oil production starting in April. It's the first oil production increase by the group since 2022 and likely will push down oil prices further. The increase slowly will add up to 2.2 million barrels of additional crude oil a day over the coming months.",
      "\u201cThis is not the opening of the floodgates,\u201d wrote Bjarne Schieldrop, the chief commodities analyst at SEB Research. \u201cIt is about lowering the oil price to a level that is acceptable for Putin, (Prince Mohammed), Trump, U.S. oil companies and the U.S. consumers.\u201d",
      "The OPEC+ decision follows criticism by Trump of the cartel as well.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s vast oil resources, located close to the surface of its desert expanse, make it one of the world\u2019s least expensive places to produce crude. For every $10 rise in the price of a barrel of oil, Saudi Arabia stands to make an additional $40 billion a year, according to the Institute of International Finance.",
      "The Saudi government owns the vast majority of the firm\u2019s shares. Saudi Aramco publicly listed a sliver of its worth back in late 2019 and has weighed offering more shares publicly."

But the removal of Castillo, Peru\u2019s first indigenous president, sparked large protests in the south of the country, i n which at least 49 people were killed in the weeks following the president\u2019s removal.",
      "Castillo was replaced by Vice President Dina Boluarte, who now leads a conservative government and has built alliances with legislators from the nation's traditional parties. The former president\u2019s trial takes place in a police base, where he has been held since he made his unsuccessful attempt to dissolve Congress and call for new elections.",
      "Prosecutors have said they are seeking a 34-year prison sentence against Castillo, a former union leader and rural school teacher who won Peru\u2019s 2021 election with a surprise victory over the nation\u2019s political establishment.",
      "Castillo had survived two impeachment votes before his unsuccessful attempt to dissolve Congress on Dec. 7, 2022.",
      "He and his supporters have argued that conservative parties in Congress were blocking his policy initiatives and making it impossible for Castillo\u2019s government to carry out efforts to increase government spending and bring education and infrastructure to neglected rural areas.",
      "Castillo\u2019s opponents have accused him of corruption and undermining democracy through attempts to dissolve Congress.",
      "A similar move to shut Congress by then-President Alberto Fujimori in the early 1990s led to several years of authoritarian rule.",
      "In a pre-trial hearing, Castillo said he was not guilty of rebellion, arguing that his decree to dissolve Congress, which he read out on national television, was never implemented.",
      "\u201cI only read out a document that had no consequences,\u201d Castillo said in May. \u201cSince when does reading a speech become rebellion? Since when is a speech the same as using ammunition?\u201d",
      "Castillo is also facing a separate investigation for corruption in which he has been accused of irregularly providing promotions to members of the military and avoiding standard procurement practices to grant a contract for a bridge."

      "French President Emmanuel Macron says he\u2019s ready to start discussions on nuclear deterrence with European allies",
      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron says that he's ready to start discussions on nuclear deterrence with European allies.",
      "Macron has hinted that France could help to protect other nations after U.S. President Donald Trump raised questions both about the trans-Atlantic alliance and the defense of Ukraine.",
      "While Macron's offering has been on the table for several years, it has gained urgency after Trump's remarks raised concerns among European NATO allies, which have for decades counted on the powerful U.S. deterrent.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at France\u2019s nuclear policy.",
      "Nuclear deterrence is a strategy based on the idea that the destructive force of nuclear weapons would prevent other nations' hostile actions, particularly nuclear attacks.",
      "During the Cold War, the U.S. nuclear umbrella was aimed at ensuring that allies, especially NATO members, would be protected by American nuclear forces in case of a threat. That\u2019s one of the reasons why many nations across the world haven't pursued their own nuclear arsenals.",
      "France is the only nuclear power in the European Union. The United Kingdom, which is no longer an EU member but is working on restoring closer ties with the 27-nation bloc and belongs to NATO, also has nuclear weapons.",
      "In the wake of Trump's push for Europe to carry the defense burden, German election winner Friedrich Merz recently called for a discussion on \u201cnuclear sharing\u201d with France.",
      "EU leaders are set to address the issue during a special summit in Brussels on Thursday, focusing on support for Ukraine and European defense. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer won't be attending the summit. The only non-EU guest is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "France\u2019s nuclear deterrence is strictly conceived as defensive. It is meant to protect the country\u2019s \u201cvital interests.\u201d",
      "Although France is a NATO member, it independently maintains its nuclear forces, cooperating with the alliance's broader deterrence strategy.",
      "Since a 2020 keynote speech, Macron has said that France's \u201cvital interests\u201d have a \u201cEuropean dimension\u201d \u2014 comments that he reiterated in recent days.",
      "\u201cWhat may be new today ... is the somewhat urgent nature of these comments and how they are perceived abroad,\" said Emmanuelle Maitre, senior research fellow at France's Foundation for Strategic Research.",
      "\u201cObviously, faced with the feeling of abandonment felt by NATO countries, there\u2019s some kind of logical search for what might enable them to keep some form of deterrence mission within Europe,\u201d Maitre said.",
      "Nuclear deterrence involves maintaining ambiguity about which circumstances would lead to the use of nuclear weapons, in order to prevent a potential aggressor from calculating risks \u2014 which is why France wouldn't provide details over how it would help in defending other European countries.",
      "France \u201clikes to remind people of its capabilities in order to be credible in its deterrence,\u201d Maitre said. \u201cBut there\u2019s also an element of ambiguity, because it\u2019s not a question of telling our adversary exactly what our red lines are. No nuclear power does this.\u201d",
      "The Federation of American Scientists, or FAS, estimates that all together, the United States and Russia possess approximately 88% of the world\u2019s total inventory of nuclear weapons. They are followed at a distance by China, and France is in fourth position with an estimated 290 nuclear warheads. The U.K. has an estimated 225, according to the federation. The FAS notes that the exact number of weapons in each country\u2019s possession is unknown because it's a closely held national secret.",
      "France\u2019s arsenal consists of ballistic missiles deployed on its nuclear-powered submarines and air-launched cruise missiles carried by long-range bombers.",
      "Maitre noted that the key for France's strategy isn\u2019t making a comparison with the U.S., but rather ensuring the capability to impose \u201can unacceptable response and damage on an adversary.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s proposal to potentially use France\u2019s nuclear arsenal to protect Europe has sparked backlash from far-right leader Marine Le Pen, whose National Rally and allies form the biggest group of lawmakers at the National Assembly since last year's legislative elections.",
      "Le Pen was quick to criticize Macron\u2019s comments, arguing during a debate on Ukraine at the National Assembly that \u201csharing (nuclear) deterrence is equivalent to abolishing it\u201d on Monday. She added: \u201cunleashing the nuclear fire cannot be separated from national and popular legitimacy,\u201d which is vested solely in the French president, elected by universal suffrage.",
      "In response, Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu said that France\u2019s nuclear deterrent would remain the prerogative of the president.",
      "\u201cWeapons production ... and use of nuclear forces are French and will stay French,\u201d Lecornu said Monday.",
      "\u201cWhile the hand on the button remains that of the head of state ... the fact remains that the way in which we contribute to the continent\u2019s global security architecture is a proper debate,\u201d Lecornu told French lawmakers. All European capitals \"are going to ask us the question, so we want to be ready to answer.\u201d"

      "China\u2019s annual major political event gets underway this week to endorse decisions already made by the all-powerful Chinese Communist Party",
      "BEIJING -- BEIJING (AP) \u2014 China\u2019s annual major political event gets underway this week, bringing together the nation\u2019s top leaders and thousands of provincial leaders to endorse decisions already made by the all-powerful Chinese Communist Party.",
      "The meetings and gathering during the National People's Congress, expected to last for about a week, are still important. The rubber-stamp parliament retains an important function: to signal the priorities of the government for the coming year and to disseminate instructions to party members and officials across the country.",
      "The messaging from leadership appears unchanged from previous years \u2014 stay the course on fostering innovation while also spurring domestic consumption.",
      "The question will be how they balance those two goals, and will it be enough to reinvigorate the economy? And to what extent will the government buffer the impact of what might be another phase in the U.S.-China trade war?",
      "This year also marks the end of China's current 5-year plan, and experts will be looking for clues on the government's priorities for the next, 2026 to 2030 plan.",
      "Here is what to watch for at this year\u2019s event:",
      "The National People\u2019s Congress kicks off on Wednesday, with Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s top economic official, announcing the economic growth target for the year.",
      "Analysts expect it to come in at around 5% \u2013 holding the same target as the previous two years, and slightly lower than the 5.5% target in 2022. This would be no small feat considering China is still grappling with a sluggish real estate sector and lackluster consumer spending.",
      "Another uncertainty is trade tensions with the U.S. under President Donald Trump, who last month slapped a 10% tariff on Chinese imports while an additional 10% comes into effect on Tuesday. Forecasters at the International Monetary Fund are projecting a lower 4.6% growth rate this year.",
      "A commentary last Friday from the official Xinhua News Agency indicated that priority would be placed on boosting domestic demand and promoting innovation in science and technology.",
      "There's also anticipation of more government support for the private sector to fuel growth.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping met in February with business leaders, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma and Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei, signaling support for the private sector at the highest level of leadership. A draft bill is also to be deliberated during the Congress over making a fairer and more equitable business environment for the private sector.",
      "China has already released a slew of measures to prop up the economy. Much of these have fallen short of hopes for a bigger stimulus, and analysts are tempering expectations on what to expect from the Congress.",
      "\u201cI would not expect anything ... to come out that will really meaningfully shift that policy away from industrial policy and towards boosting consumption in meaningful, sufficient ways,\u201d said Jacob Gunter, lead analyst for the economics research team at the Mercator Institute for China Studies.",
      "Instead, experts say leaders are staying the course on pushing for innovation that would boost China\u2019s self-reliance.",
      "The purpose of the economy is no longer to improve household incomes and expand the middle class, Gunter said.",
      "\"This is not a development-oriented economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a geopolitically oriented economy, and technology and industry are way more important for that.\u201d",
      "Li is expected to touch on foreign policy and Taiwan, but more attention will likely be on Foreign Minister Wang Yi.",
      "His annual press conference, to be held later in the week, will be closely watched to decipher China\u2019s stance on U.S.-China relations under Trump. After the first 10% tariffs in February, China retaliated with a 15% tariff on American coal and liquefied natural gas, as well as 10% on crude oil, agriculture machinery and large-engine cars.",
      "\u201cBeijing\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s initial 10% tariffs was measured \u2014 restrained enough to signal openness to negotiations yet firm enough to demonstrate its willingness to escalate if necessary,\u201d Neil Thomas and Jing Qian wrote in a report for the Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "They note that China\u2019s president might use speeches in closed-door meetings during the Congress to send signals on bilateral relations, as he did two years ago when Xi named the United States as leading \u201ccontainment encirclement and suppressions\u201d against China.",
      "Also closely watched will be China\u2019s relations with Russia and its position on the Ukraine war. At a recent Group of 20 foreign minister\u2019s meeting in South Africa, Wang said a \u201cwindow for peace is opening\u201d in Ukraine, and that China supported \u201call efforts committed to peace, including the recent consensus reached by the United States and Russia.\u201d",
      "The legislature is made up of nearly 3,000 delegates from China\u2019s provinces, ministries, People\u2019s Liberation Army, party organizations and various groups that represent workers and other interests.",
      "Their role is largely ceremonial in that the body does not have any real power to decide on legislation. Any vote is usually unanimous or near-unanimous to formalize decisions already taken by Communist Party leaders behind closed doors.",
      "Still, the Congress is a rare opportunity to see what the central government\u2019s sees as priorities and goals, and the reports and speeches during it can give indications of the future direction of government policy.",
      "An advisory body, the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, will meet at the same time. Members include business leaders, athletes, academics, religious leaders and representatives of ethnic groups. The concurrent meetings of the two bodies are known as the Two Sessions.",

      "Stocks are falling again on Wall Street as companies and investors react to President Donald Trump's decision to impose tariffs on the U.S.'s biggest trading partners",
      "NEW YORK -- Stocks tumbled on Wall Street Tuesday as a trade war between the U.S. and its key trading partners escalated, wiping out all the gains for the S&P 500 since Election Day.",
      "The tariffs between the U.S., China, Canada, and Mexico helped extend a recent slump for U.S. stocks that was prompted by signs of weakness in the economy.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 1%, with nearly every sector in the benchmark index losing ground. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 572 points, or 1.3%, as of 12:48 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "The Nasdaq composite fell 0.3%. The tech-heavy index is approaching a 10% decline from its most recent closing high, which is what the market considers a correction. Technology stocks helped drive much of the market's gains in 2024, but have been losing ground and acting as a heavy weight so far in 2025.",
      "Markets in Europe fell sharply while stocks in Asia saw more modest declines.",
      "The drops follow a steep sell-off Monday. Altogether, the decline has wiped out all of the markets\u2019 gains since President Donald Trump\u2019s election in November. That rally had been built largely on hopes for policies from Trump that would strengthen the U.S. economy and businesses. Worries about tariffs raising consumer prices and reigniting inflation have been weighing on both the economy and Wall Street.",
      "Imports from Canada and Mexico are now to be taxed at 25%, with Canadian energy products subject to 10% import duties. The 10% tariff that Trump placed on Chinese imports in February was doubled to 20%.",
      "Retaliations were swift.",
      "China responded to new U.S. tariffs by announcing it will impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on imports of key U.S. farm products, including chicken, pork, soy and beef, and expanded controls on doing business with key U.S. companies. Canada plans on slapping tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days. Mexico also plans tariffs on goods imported from the U.S.",
      "The tariffs are prompting warnings from retailers, including Target and Best Buy, as they report their latest financial results. Target slumped 4.6% despite beating Wall Street's earnings forecasts. there will be \u201cmeaningful pressure\u201d on its profits to start the year because of tariffs and other costs.",
      "Best Buy plunged 14.1% after giving investors a weaker-than-expected earnings forecast and warning about tariff impacts.",
      "\u201cInternational trade is critically important to our business and industry,\" said Best Buy CEO Corie Barry.",
      "Barry said China and Mexico are the top two sources for products that Best Buy sells and it also expects vendors to pass along tariff costs, which would make price increases for American consumers likely.",
      "The warnings are coming in as companies close out their latest round of earnings reports. Companies in the S&P 500 reported broad earnings growth of 18% in the fourth quarter. Wall Street has already trimmed expectations for the current quarter to about 7% growth from just over forecasts of 11% at the beginning of the year.",
      "Worries about profits follow a series of economic reports with worrisome signals that include U.S. households becoming more pessimistic about inflation and pulling back on spending. Consumer spending has essentially driven U.S. economic growth in the face of high interest rates.",
      "Wall Street has been hoping that the Federal Reserve will continue lowering interest rates in 2025. The central bank has signaled more caution, though, partly because of uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of tariffs. The Fed is expected to hold rates steady at its upcoming meeting later in March.",
      "The Fed raised interest rates to their highest level in two decades in order to tame inflation. It started cutting its benchmark rate in 2024 as the rate of inflation moved closer to its target of 2%. But, inflation remains stubbornly just above that target and tariffs threaten price increases that could fuel inflation.",
      "In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.17% from 4.16% late Monday. It\u2019s still down sharply from last month, when it was approaching 4.80%, as worries have grown about where the U.S. economy is heading.",

      "A Hong Kong-based conglomerate has agreed to sell its controlling stake in a subsidiary that operates ports near the Panama Canal to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control after President Donald Trump alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.",
      "In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt.",
      "The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, as well as others in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.",
      "The transaction, which must be approved by Panama's government, does not include any interest in a trust that operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China.",
      "Some 70% of the sea traffic that crosses the Panama Canal leaves or goes to U.S. ports. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter \u201cfoolishly\u201d gave the canal away.",
      "Trump and his supporters have also complained about the fees that ships are charged to use the waterway and alleged that China has been operating the canal, an assertion denied by Panama's government.",
      "In January, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports \u201cgive China ready observation posts\u201d to take action. \u201cThis situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,\u201d Cruz said.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations.",
      "Panama quit China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative following Rubio\u2019s visit, drawing condemnation from Beijing. Belt and Road is Beijing\u2019s global development strategy to build roads, ports and railways to open up new markets.",
      "But while much attention was focused on Trump\u2019s threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the ports key ports at either end of the canal.",
      "Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over.",
      "Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was \u201cthe result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,\" Sixt said.",
      "In addition to BlackRock, a New York-based global investment management company with $11.6 trillion in assets under management as of Dec. 31, the consortium includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited.",
      "BlackRock declined to comment outside of a press release touting the deal. Shares in BlackRock fell 1.5% in afternoon trading Tuesday."

    "story": [
      "China's leaders are overseeing a spell of deflation, or falling prices, that contrasts with inflationary pressures prevailing elsewhere in the world",
      "BEIJING -- When he bought an apartment near a good high school in northeast Beijing in 2020, Zhou Fujin expected that renting it out would cover most of his mortgage. But the apartment's value and the rent he is getting have plummeted in the past couple years, straining his family\u2019s finances.",
      "China is experiencing a spell of deflation, or falling prices, that contrasts with inflationary pressures prevailing elsewhere in the world. Cheaper prices can be a blessing for some, but deflation is a symptom of relatively weak demand and stalling economic growth.",
      "Such challenges are the backdrop to the annual session of China's parliament, which begins Wednesday. It's unclear what the ruling Communist Party might do to tackle the problem, though some economists expect more government spending. Observers also will be watching for changes to the annual economic growth target, which has hovered near 5% for the past two years.",
      "These are broad, long-term problems. Falling housing prices have left many families reluctant to spend, while factories keep churning out goods.",
      "Economy-wide, prices fell in 2023 and 2024, the longest bout of deflation since the 1960s. The gross domestic product deflator \u2013- the broadest measure of price changes in an economy -\u2013 dipped to -0.8% in the last three months of 2024, compared to -0.5% the quarter before, meaning that deflation has intensified.",
      "Deflation is an abstract economic concept but it reflects very concretely in Zhou\u2019s personal balance sheet, as it does for millions of others. Zhou\u2019s apartment, in Beijing\u2019s Miyun district, cost 2 million yuan ($275,000) when he bought it in 2020, and he financed it with an 800,000 yuan ($110,000) bank loan. The rent he charges has fallen from 2,300 yuan ($316) monthly to 1,700 yuan ($234). His monthly mortgage payment is more than 3,000 yuan ($413), and the apartment is now worth only about 1.4 million yuan ($193,000), he says.",
      "Around the time Zhou bought his apartment, the government began cracking down on excess borrowing by real estate developers, pushing the industry into crisis and many property companies into default. The father of two runs a real estate brokerage firm, which has been hemorrhaging money over the past four years. He has since expanded into home decoration services, helping him to break even.",
      "\u201cGiven that I work in the real estate sector, my income has been greatly affected,\u201d Zhou told The Associated Press. \u201cMy biggest spending is on bank mortgages, my car and my children's education. I've cut other expenditures such as travel. Even my children have realized that money is not easy to earn, and they are willing to spend less.\u201d",
      "Lu Wanyong, who owns a picture framing workshop in Beijing, says he gets only one or two customers a day, down from more than a dozen before the pandemic. Many now prefer to fix broken picture frames rather than buy new ones. Fewer new homeowners come in looking to decorate their apartments.",
      "Lu\u2019s family has burned through its savings and he fears that soon he won\u2019t be able to pay his shop\u2019s 6,000 yuan ($825) rent.",
      "\u201cI am considering shifting to other industries, but the problem is that I am not familiar with any of them. And as a matter of fact, which industry is easy to work in nowadays?\u201d he pondered.",
      "Deflation can be harder for governments to tackle than inflation, experts say, because that requires fixing the underlying issues behind it.",
      "In China\u2019s case, it\u2019s a combination of excess capacity \u2014 manufactured goods produced in such quantities the market cannot absorb them all -\u2013 and the reluctance of consumers to spend and businesses to invest, due to concerns about the sluggish economy. Also, the housing crisis has wiped out an estimated $18 trillion of household wealth, according to a Barclays report, on top of job losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cWhen the real estate market is booming, people believe that they are very rich,\u201d said He-Ling Shi, an associate professor of economics at Australia's Monash University. \u201cIf people believe that they\u2019re rich, they tend to spend their income on consumption. But with the decrease in the price of housing in most parts of China, people believe that they\u2019re no longer as rich as before, so \u2026 they want to increase their savings and reduce their consumption.\u201d",
      "When prices fall, companies' profits also take a hit. That can spur a so-called \u201cdeflationary spiral\u201d of layoffs that further reduce household incomes, leading to even less consumption and potentially to a recession or depression. Fitch Ratings in November warned that deflation is becoming entrenched in China and urged its leaders to adopt policies that can boost demand.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed new 20% tariffs on Chinese exports that are expected to shave up to 1.1 percentage points off China\u2019s GDP growth this year in a \u201csevere scenario\u201d where Chinese exports to the U.S. fall by half, said Erica Tay, director of macro research at Maybank Investment Banking Group.",
      "Deflation is a ticklish issue for China\u2019s leaders, who began cutting interest rates and required mortgage down-payments last fall. They have launched programs to get local governments to buy unsold apartments to rent out as affordable housing and are encouraging banks to lend more money.",
      "But top leaders tend to focus their public comments on the ruling party's accomplishments and avoid directly mentioning deflation, a thorny problem with no quick fixes.",
      "\u201cThey try to do their best to avoid the word \u2018deflation\u2019 because they believe that will make consumers even more panicked,\u201d Shi said. \u201cIf they become more panicked, they will further reduce their consumption and therefore make the situation worse.\u201d",
      "Some economists, including Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Guanghua School of Management at Peking University, say the economy can only be rebalanced if consumers gain purchasing power. That requires reducing the share of wealth going into unproductive investments.",
      "The government has sought to encourage more spending by issuing vouchers, while shying away from more fundamental economic reforms.",
      "\u201cEconomic recovery should be linked to a rise in people\u2019s incomes\u201d said Sun Lijian, professor at the School of Economics at Fudan University. \u201cThe government should provide vouchers to help people purchase what they need; this has proven to be an effective way.\u201d",
      "Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist for S&P Global Ratings, says China needs to address long-term, chronic problems including excess industrial production and inefficient state industries. Revamping health care, pensions and education systems would make people \u201cmore comfortable about their financial situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the short term, simply anything that increases household incomes will help on the consumption side,\u201d Kuijs said, \u201cbut probably more importantly is that structural reform element \u2026 and that requires beefing up of the government\u2019s role in health, education and social security.\u201d",

      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil giant Aramco has reported a $106.25 billion profit in 2024, down 12% from the prior year on lower energy prices",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil giant Aramco reported a $106.25 billion profit in 2024 on Tuesday, down 12% from the prior year as lower energy prices now squeeze the kingdom's multi-trillion-dollar development plans.",
      "Already, Saudi's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been digging a straight-line city in the desert for his $500 billion project at NEOM in Saudi Arabia\u2019s western desert on the Red Sea. He also will need to build tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of new stadiums and infrastructure ahead of the kingdom hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup.",
      "Meanwhile, he's also pledged potentially $600 billion in U.S. investments to President Donald Trump to entice him to the kingdom on his first foreign trip as president. Saudi Arabia is also the possible venue for a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin over Moscow's war on Ukraine.",
      "All that and OPEC+ moving toward increasing production means Saudi Arabia likely will need to take on new debt to fund the crown prince's vast ambitions.",
      "A filing on Riyadh's Tadawul stock exchange showed Aramco, formally known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., had revenues of $436 billion in 2024. That compares to $440.88 billion in 2023.",
      "Aramco reported a $121 billion annual profit in 2023, down from its 2022 record due to lower energy prices as well.",
      "\u201cThe decrease was primarily driven by lower revenue and other income related to sales, higher operating costs, as well as lower finance and other income,\u201d Aramco said in its filing.",
      "Stock in Aramco traded around $7.33 a share Tuesday, down from a high over the last year of $8.71. It has fallen over the past year as oil prices have dropped. Benchmark Brent crude is at $73 \u2014 down 10% this year.",
      "Aramco has a market value of $1.74 trillion, making it the world\u2019s sixth-most valuable company behind Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Amazon and Alphabet, which owns Google.",
      "Aramco will pay dividends of $21.36 billion for the fourth quarter, which includes a far-smaller performance dividend of $220 million. The company expects to pay dividends of $85.4 billion this year, which is far lower and will further erode cash that Saudi Arabia's monarchy can expect for the year.",
      "\u201cOur strong net income and increased base dividend illustrate Aramco\u2019s exceptional resilience,\" Aramco CEO and President Amin H. Nasser said in a statement.",
      "The Aramco results come as OPEC+, an alliance of the oil cartel and other energy-producing states, met online Monday and agreed to proceed with an increase in oil production starting in April. It's the first oil production increase by the group since 2022 and likely will push down oil prices further.",
      "The OPEC+ decision follows criticism by Trump of the cartel as well.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s vast oil resources, located close to the surface of its desert expanse, make it one of the world\u2019s least expensive places to produce crude. For every $10 rise in the price of a barrel of oil, Saudi Arabia stands to make an additional $40 billion a year, according to the Institute of International Finance.",
      "The Saudi government owns the vast majority of the firm\u2019s shares. Saudi Aramco publicly listed a sliver of its worth back in late 2019 and has weighed offering more shares publicly.",

      "The group, which owns the Prada and Miu Miu fashion brands along with Church\u2019s footwear, reported a 17% boost in revenues to 5.4 billion euros ($5.7 billion) last year from 4.7 billion euros in 2023. Retail sales rose 18% to 4.6 billion euros in the period.",
      "The Prada brand, which accounts for the bulk of earnings, reported sales were up a solid 4%, while they nearly doubled at younger Miu Miu. The Prada Group results are against market trends, with the luxury sector as a whole contracting last year for the first time since the Great Recession.",
      "\u201cThis success underscores the enduring relevance of our brands, which comes from an unwavering focus on product innovation, quality, craftmanship and a unique ability to read contemporaneity,\u2019\u2019 said Prada Group Chairman Patrizio Bertelli.",

      "LONDON -- The U.S. has been Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backer since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion began three years ago. The suspension of that aid by the Trump administration doesn\u2019t mean Ukraine\u2019s defenses will quickly collapse.",
      "But it's a major blow that threatens to remove some of the most formidable weapons in Ukraine\u2019s battlefield arsenal, and ratchets up pressure on Kyiv to accept a peace agreement.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the decision and its implications.",
      "The United States has given the Ukrainians more than $180 billion in assistance since Russia launched an all-out war on Feb. 24, 2022, including more than $66.5 billion in military aid.",
      "Washington provides about 20% of Ukraine\u2019s military supplies, and that fifth includes the most lethal and important equipment, including longer-range missiles and Patriot air defense systems that can shoot down the most powerful Russian projectiles.",
      "American military assistance also goes far beyond weapons and ammunition.",
      "Ukrainian troops rely on satellite communications systems supplied by Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink to communicate on the front line, and on American intelligence to track Russian troop movements and select targets for Ukrainian strikes. If the U.S. stops sharing data from satellites and other assets, it would badly affect Ukraine\u2019s capability to strike back at Russia, and Ukraine\u2019s other allies lack the resources to fill the gap.",
      "\u201cA lot will depend on what\u2019s covered by the American suspension,\u201d said Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director-general of defense think-tank RUSI. \u201cWill they suspend all technical assistance to Ukraine? That would have a more dramatic, more rapid impact than simply stopping the pipeline of arms.\u201d",
      "The White House said that the U.S. is \u201cpausing and reviewing\u201d its Ukraine aid to \u201censure that it is contributing to a solution.\u201d The order will remain in effect until Trump determines that Ukraine has demonstrated a commitment to peace negotiations with Russia.",
      "The halt came days after an explosive meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance said that Ukraine\u2019s leader hasn't expressed sufficient gratitude for American support.",
      "The U.S. move won\u2019t have an immediate impact on the battlefield, where Kyiv\u2019s forces are struggling to stem a relentless Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have slowed Russian advances along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, where Russia is slowly gaining ground at a huge human and material cost.",
      "The pause in aid will weaken air defenses and will hit Ukraine\u2019s ability to hit Russian targets far behind the front lines.",
      "Alexander Kots, a Russian war blogger, noted that while Ukraine\u2019s European allies can fill some of the gaps and provide artillery systems, they don\u2019t have alternatives to the U.S.-made Patriot and NASAMS air defense missile systems and longer-range HIMARS missile systems that can strike ground targets up to 300 kilometers (200 miles) away.",
      "Kots said that for Ukraine, \u201cthe U.S. aid suspension is unpleasant but not deadly.\u201d",
      "Ukraine has stockpiles of artillery shells and other munitions, and has ramped up domestic production of drones, which are now among the most important weapons in the war. It\u2019s estimated that just over half of the military hardware used by Ukraine is domestically produced.",
      "Chalmers, the RUSI expert, said that the Ukrainians have built up their defense production, and \u201care innovating at an incredible rate because of the pressure they\u2019re under.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think they will survive for quite some time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a material blow, and it\u2019s also a challenge to Europe.\u201d",
      "A summit in London on Sunday was aimed at getting European leaders to step up and put Ukraine in the best possible position before potential peace talks.",
      "The U.K. announced that it would use 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in export financing to supply 5,000 air defense missiles. The European Union has proposed an 800 billion-euro ($841 billion) plan to bolster the defenses of EU nations and provide Ukraine with military muscle.",
      "But Samir Puri, director of the Center for Global Governance and Security at international affairs think tank Chatham House, said that European and American aid are intertwined.",
      "\u201cThis was always a joint effort,\u201d he said. \u201cThe U.S. gives a lot, the Europeans give a lot. You take away the Americans from that joint effort and \u2026 there\u2019s just a huge component missing to the structure.\u201d"

      "North Carolina legislators appear to be closing in on legislation to provide more funds to help the mountains recover from Hurricane Helene",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina state Senate Republicans advanced a disaster recovery measure Tuesday to direct $533 million in additional spending to meet still-pressing needs from Hurricane Helene\u2019s historic flooding and destruction last fall, but it also locates more relief funding for earlier storms.",
      "The legislation that cleared the Senate's budget-writing committee is wider in scope than a $500 million relief package approved unanimously last week by the House that focused on Helene's destruction in western North Carolina.",
      "Spending provisions within the Senate proposal locates an additional $217 million to complete lingering home construction projects for victims of Hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018 in eastern North Carolina. The package also lays the groundwork to assist farmers who suffered agricultural losses last year \u2014 not just from Helene but also from drought and tornadoes.",
      "\u201cWe feel that we need to move with urgency to get this bill across the finish line,\u201d said Sen. Brent Jackson, a Senate Appropriations Committee chairman. \u201cCitizens across all our 100 counties faced disasters in 2024.\u201d",
      "A Senate floor vote on the chamber's bill was expected Wednesday. While House Republicans also are advancing agricultural assistance and Matthew and Florence relief in other measures, top House and Senate leaders later Tuesday said they believed they could agree upon a final supplemental disaster relief bill quickly \u2014 possibly by the end of the week \u2014 then send it to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein's desk.",
      "\u201cEverybody wants the same thing \u2014 to get people help,\u201d said state Rep. John Bell, who has been shepherding the House's $500 million measure.",
      "Last month, Stein offered his own $1.07 billion proposal for additional Helene relief. The amount would double the money already appropriated or made available by the General Assembly for Helene recovery activities since late last year. But GOP legislators seek to spend less now, saying they want to be careful about maximizing federal matching funds and avoiding mistakes after previous storms.",
      "North Carolina state officials reported over 100 deaths from Helene, which caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. More than five months later, over 5,700 households in western counties are still receiving temporary housing assistance and more than 200 public roads in the region remain closed or just partially opened, according to state data.",
      "Legislative leaders and Stein agree that more money will be allocated for Helene relief later this year in the state budget because the needs are so great, even with billions arriving from Washington.",
      "\u201cThe underlying message I want to leave with people is we\u2019re making progress but it\u2019s just a start,\u201d Stein said of Helene recovery at the monthly meeting of statewide elected officials earlier Tuesday. \u201cThis work is long term and it\u2019s going to be hard, and we all have to be there together.\u201d",
      "Like the House legislation, the Senate proposal emphasizes repairs for damaged homes, private bridges and roads, assistance to farmers and rebuilding infrastructure adjacent to small businesses. The Senate plan omits a House provision that would allow $15 million to go to nonprofit organizations that could then offer grants to small businesses. Stein and fellow Democrats have pleaded for direct grants to help businesses already weighed down with loans.",
      "The Senate plan does provide money \u2014 although not as much as Stein sought \u2014 for local school districts that closed for many weeks due to Helene to offer summer school instruction. The House plan left out the program.",
      "Republican lawmakers have been angry with delays in the Florence and Matthew housing reconstruction program, which was created by then-Gov. Roy Cooper's administration and funded with federal dollars.",
      "While about 3,300 home construction projects have been completed through the state Office of Recovery and Resiliency, state funds are now needed to complete another 1,000 that remain in various stages of construction. Office leaders blamed the delays on the COVID-19 pandemic, rising construction costs, labor shortages and ultimately management mistakes. The agency's chief operating officer left her job in November.",
      "Both the Senate measure and a separate House bill also approved Tuesday in another committee provides the $217 million, but each bill requires significant monitoring and oversight requirements in how it\u2019s spent. Language in both bills would ultimately shut down the Office of Recovery and Resiliency. Stein\u2019s administration is handling Helene-related home reconstruction through a new agency.",

      "The meetings come as China\u2019s economy struggles with sluggish consumption, a lengthy property crisis, ballooning government debt and a possible renewed trade war with the United States. On Tuesday, Beijing announced additional tariffs of up to 15% on imports on U.S. farm products including chicken, pork, soy and beef. The move came in retaliation for an increase in flat U.S. tariffs on Chinese products \u2013 from 10% to 20% \u2013 that came in effect at the same time.",
      "\u201cUndoubtedly, the adverse impacts brought by the external environment have deepened, and China\u2019s economy still faces some difficulties and challenges,\u201d said Lou Qinjian, spokesman for the National People\u2019s Congress in a news conference ahead of the session.",
      "\u201cInternationally, rising economic and political uncertainties make it harder to stabilize external demand. Domestically, demand is insufficient, and some enterprises are experiencing operational difficulties,\u201d he added.",
      "The government is expected to announce some measures to boost consumption such as increasing the deficit ratio from 3% to 4%, though massive stimulus is unlikely.",
      "Harnessing the power of artificial intelligence may also feature in policy announcements.",

Those took effect on Tuesday, along with 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.",
      "China\u2019s is a major importer of American farm products. Purchases dipped after Trump launched a trade war during his first term and then recovered.",
      "Now, imports of U.S.-grown chicken, wheat, corn and cotton will face an extra 15% tariff, the Chinese ministry said. Tariffs on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruit, vegetables and dairy products will be increased by 10%.",
      "The U.S. tariffs began a day before the annual session of China\u2019s parliament, which begins Wednesday and will focus in part on deflation and other issues affecting the world's second largest economy.",

      "While the tariffs on American farm products are sweeping, China held back from imposing higher ones across the board, and \u201cboth sides showed restraint,\u201d said Sun Chenghao, an international relations professor at Beijing\u2019s Tsinghua University.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. hopes to get a trade deal with China in the end,\u201d Sun said. \u201cFor the long term, it is possible that China and the U.S. will continue to negotiate, but the current atmosphere is not good.\u201d",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Sweat streamed down Talita Ferreira Sanches\u2019 face as she pushed a cart loaded with beer and water up the winding, cobblestone streets in Rio de Janeiro last month, calling out to glitter-covered revelers decked out in fishnet tights.",
      "The 22-year-old from an area outside Rio had spent the night sleeping on a street in bohemian neighborhood Santa Teresa, covering herself with just a sheet, so she could arrive in time for the early-morning Carnival party \u201cHeaven on Earth\u201d.",
      "\u201cCarnival represents a lot of joy and all the money that we make,\u201d said Ferreira Sanches, who has worked as a street vendor for the last four years. She makes around 1,500 reais ($260) a day during Carnival \u2014 about the same as the country's monthly minimum wage.",
      "\u201cEvery year, we have an objective. Last year we bought a fridge and a television, this year we want to buy a wardrobe and a stove,\u201d she said, pocketing cash with one hand while dishing out ice-cold drinks with the other.",
      "Like musicians and stilt walkers, vendors are a fixture at Rio's street parties. Known in Portuguese as \u201cambulantes\u201d or \u201ccamelos,\" they scour Instagram pages for times and locations, coordinate on WhatsApp groups, then race across parks and up hills, from Rio\u2019s downtown to Copacabana beach, all to place themselves and their carts in the thronging crush of thousands \u2014 or hundreds of thousands \u2014 of thirsty revelers.",
      "Peddlers provide much-needed party fuel and hydration, and can themselves partake in the buzzing, joyous atmosphere. More than that, though, it's an economic lifeline, allowing them to pay off debts, buy presents for their kids and set them up for the rest of the year.",
      "But as opportunity to cash in has grown, more and more vendors have joined the rush \u2014 and drawn pushback. There are nearly 500 registered street parties this year, and hundreds more unofficial ones, considerably more than the pre-pandemic era, and they all need cold beer and water.",
      "Rio\u2019s City Hall conducted a lottery for 15,000 authorized vendors at this year\u2019s Carnival \u2014 5,000 more than last year, but observers say there are far more vendors than spots.",
      "Selling without a permit renders them vulnerable to harassment, seizure of their merchandise and even violence from Rio\u2019s municipal guard, according to the United Street Vendors' Movement \u2014 known by its acronym MUCA.",
      "The ballooning number of vendors in recent years has created tensions with party organizers, said Pericles Monteiro, the director of Heaven on Earth, which he founded in 2001. Party facilitators and revelers have accused hawkers of blockading the procession by setting up shop in the middle of its path with their heavy carts.",
      "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t walk, we felt suffocated,\u201d Monteiro said of Heaven on Earth's procession two years ago. The group didn\u2019t get to the square where the show was supposed to end on time, and had to walk almost in silence until reaching the designated area. When they got there, peddlers had barbecues fired up and vans parked in the street, leaving little room for performers, musicians or revelers.",
      "\u201cWe support street vendors. People have to work and they have an important role. We are aware of that. But the way it has been done, the intensity \u2014 there really has been a serious problem hindering the party\u2019s development,\u201d Monteiro added.",
      "Vendors are aware of the grievances, and the impact on their reputation. This year, union SindInformal and other groups launched a campaign to promote respect, proper organization and security during Carnival, and recommended buying from vendors surrounding the party rather than in the middle of the mayhem.",
      "Fear of repercussions and clashes also prompted MUCA to produce a manifesto this year calling for \u201cmess with harmony.\u201d The document said criticism and attacks targeting vendors spark backlash against an already marginalized community.",
      "\u201cVendors are seen as dangerous, as tarnishing the city\u2019s reputation, as causing public disorder,\u201d said Fl\u00e1via Magalh\u00e3es, who researches street sellers at the Paulista University in Sao Paulo. \u201cBut vendors sustain a festive street culture that is very important for the city\u2019s tourism.\u201d",
      "They also face dire working conditions, struggling to access toilets, working long hours without stopping for food and struggling to find a legal place to leave their merchandise, according to a 2019 report by MUCA and Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. They often spend hours on public transport each day trekking into the city from the poor periphery.",
      "During Carnival, being based in the city center is a game-changer, said Maria de Lourdes do Carmo, 50, known as Maria of the Street Vendors.",
      "Do Carmo has been a vendor for three decades, often hawking caipirinhas to foreign tourists in Santa Teresa's cobblestone hills; the municipal guard doesn't tend to crackdown up there, she said. She ran for a city council seat in last year\u2019s election to fight for greater respect for her peers, but lost.",
      "Since last year, Rio state's public prosecutors have been leading discussions on preventing violence against itinerant workers while also trying to tackle the municipality's failure to better organize their activity, for example by providing sanctioned deposits for their goods.",
      "And City Hall this year is attending to a long-standing demand for childcare services. Authorities will provide a daycare center for vendors\u2019 children during street parties and samba schools\u2019 parades, with food, cultural activities and games, Rio\u2019s department of social assistance said in an email.",
      "For D\u00e9bora Silva Pereira, 42, enduring the long, exhausting days away from her family is worth it, firstly because Carnival buoys her family's income. On a good day, she makes 3,000 reais \u2014 what she normally earns in 10 days during the rest of the year, selling women's clothing. But she also enjoys the mixture of work and play.",

      "Chinese manufacturers reported stronger orders in February as importers rushed to beat higher U.S. tariffs",
      "BANGKOK -- Chinese manufacturers reported an uptick in orders in February as importers rushed to beat higher U.S. tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, as a Chinese state media report said that Beijing was considering ways to retaliate.",
      "Trump earlier imposed a tariff of 10% on imports from China and that will rise to 20% beginning Tuesday. He also ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d loophole that exempted imports worth less than $800 from tariffs, in a blow to companies whose online sales direct to consumers had soared in recent years.",
      "The Global Times, a newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, said Monday that Beijing was studying both tariffs and non-tariff moves to counter Trump's higher tariffs. Asked about that report, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said that \u201cChina will take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard own legitimate rights and interests.\u201d",
      "\u201cU.S. agricultural and food products will most likely be listed,\u201d it said, citing an unnamed source. Last week, Chinese Commerce Ministry officials had said the two sides were in a \u201cdialogue\u201d about trade.",
      "The stronger-than-expected data came as Chinese leaders gathered in Beijing for the annual session of the National People\u2019s Congress. Lawmakers are expected as usual to endorse policies and priorities set by the ruling Communist Party, which could include some fresh help for the economy as it slows to annual growth many economists forecast will fall to about 4.5% this year.",
      "Surveys of factory managers showed China\u2019s official purchasing managers index rose to 50.2% from 49% in January, though that was just above the 50 level that marks the break between contraction and expansion. The new orders index rose to 51.1.",
      "Steady industrial production suggests that government spending and \u201cfront running\u201d to beat the higher tariffs supported stronger business activity last month, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "\u201cBut growth still looks at risk of slowing this quarter, at least partially reversing the pick-up in Q4 (October-December). And that\u2019s before the hit from tariffs is felt in earnest,\u201d Huang wrote.",
      "Another survey released Monday, the Caixin manufacturing PMI survey, showed a similar improvement. That survey tends to show trends in smaller and export-oriented companies, Lynne Song of ING Economics said in a commentary.",
      "\u201cThis could be a valuable gauge of the impact new tariffs are having on the manufacturing sector. With an additional 10% tariff set to come into effect tomorrow, this seems likely,\u201d she said.",
      "Sudden increases in tariffs and other factors have raised uncertainty over the outlook for the world's second largest economy, which grew at a 5% annual pace last year, just meeting Beijing's official target.",
      "Premier Li Qiang will present an annual work report to the congress as it opens on Wednesday that traditionally provides the annual growth target for this year, among other policies and economic updates.",
      "2025 is the last year of leader Xi Jinping's \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d blueprint for upgrading Chinese industries to become global leaders in advanced technology. It also marks the end of China\u2019s 14th five-year plan, the party's traditional mid-term policy-setting document.",
      "A key priority is likely to be outlining ways to get Chinese consumers to spend more, a weak point in the state-dominated economy following the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government has moved to provide more support for private industry in recent months as part of that effort. Exports and targeted spending increases have also helped."

      "Doing so could potentially complicate or distort a fundamental measure of the U.S. economy's health. Government spending is traditionally included in the GDP because changes in taxes, spending, deficits and regulations by the government can impact the path of overall growth. GDP reports already include extensive details on government spending, offering a level of transparency for economists.",
      "Musk's efforts to downsize federal agencies could result in the layoffs of tens of thousands of federal workers, whose lost income could potentially reduce their spending, affecting businesses and the economy at large.",
      "The commerce secretary's remarks echoed Musk\u2019s arguments made Friday on X that government spending doesn\u2019t create value for the economy.",
      "\u201cA more accurate measure of GDP would exclude government spending,\u201d Musk wrote on his social media platform. \u201cOtherwise, you can scale GDP artificially high by spending money on things that don\u2019t make people\u2019s lives better.\u201d",
      "The argument as articulated so far by Trump administration officials appears to play down the economic benefits created by some forms of government spending that can shape an economy's trajectory.",
      "\u201cIf the government buys a tank, that\u2019s GDP,\u201d Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cBut paying 1,000 people to think about buying a tank is not GDP. That is wasted inefficiency, wasted money. And cutting that, while it shows in GDP, we\u2019re going to get rid of that.\u201d",
      "The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis published its most recent GDP report on Thursday, showing that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final three months of last year.",
      "The report makes it possible to measure the forces driving the economy, showing that the gains at the end of last year were largely driven by greater consumer spending and an upward revision to federal government spending related to defense. Still, the federal government's component of the GDP report for all of 2024 increased at 2.6%, slightly lower than overall economic growth last year of 2.8%.",
      "In the GDP report, government spending accounts for almost one-fifth of people's personal income, which totaled more than $24.6 trillion last year. This includes Social Security payments, benefits for military veterans, Medicare and Medicaid and other programs. But the report also measures the amount of people's personal incomes that are paid in taxes to the government.",
      "The government is not always a contributor to GDP growth and can subtract from it, which is what happened in 2022 as pandemic-related aid expired.",
      "Lutnick said that the Trump administration would balance the federal budget with spending cuts, saying that would help growth and reduce the interest rates paid by consumers.",
      "\u201cWhen we balance the budget of the United States of America, interest rates are going to come smashing down,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cThis is going to be the best economy anybody\u2019s ever seen. And to bet against it is foolish.\u201d"

      "Elon Musk appears be to turning off potential Tesla buyers with his embrace of far-right politicians around the world, analysts say, and the hit couldn't come at a worse time",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk's car company is required each year to report to investors all the bad things that could happen to it, and the latest version lists every imaginable threat from costly lawsuits to out-of-control battery fires to war and another epidemic.",
      "But there\u2019s barely any mention in the latest annual update of Musk\u2019s full-bore entry into right-wing politics, which some experts say is turning off potential customers who don\u2019t share his views.",
      "\u201cIt's marketing 101: Don\u2019t involve yourself in politics,\u201d said New York brand consultant Robert Passikoff. \u201cPeople will stop buying your products.\u201d",
      "It may be too late.",
      "Tesla sales plunged 45% in Europe in January, according to research firm Jato Dynamics, even as overall electric vehicle sales rose. That comes after a report of falling sales in California, its biggest U.S. market, and the first annual drop globally for the company last year.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even want to drive it,\u201d said Model 3 owner John Parnell, a Democrat from Ross, California, adding that he also is cancelling his order for the company's Cybertruck, losing a $100 deposit. \u201cHe's destroying the brand with his politics.\u201d",
      "Car industry analysts say it's too early to say for sure how much damage Musk is causing to Tesla because so many other factors could explain its current troubles. It's best selling vehicle, the Model Y, is coming out with a new version this year, leading potential Tesla buyers to hold off purchases right now. And European and Chinese manufacturers are finally catching up to the world's EV leader, offering cars with battery life and dependability that are competitive.",
      "But, if anything, that makes Musk\u2019s political comments even more reckless, auto analysts say.",
      "\u201cMusk thinks he can say anything he wants to and doesn\u2019t think Tesla will suffer any consequences,\u201c said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cTesla was in the sweet spot. Now it has competition.\u201d",
      "The sales numbers were particularly bad in Germany and France in January, down roughly 60% each, more than the average decline for the more than two-dozen European countries surveyed. Sales in France fell another 26% in February.",
      "More worrisome was the breakdown for Tesla\u2019s individual models. Sales of Tesla\u2019s Model 3 dropped 33% across all European countries even though that car is not being updated and there is no reason for buyers to wait",
      "\u201cPart of the population is not happy with his views, his political activism,\u201d said Jato senior analyst Felipe Munoz who had shrugged off the boycott threat earlier this year, but is now having second thoughts.",
      "Many Tesla buyers used to be wealthy, environmentally-conscious professionals, often liberal, who were attracted to Musk's talk about how his EVs could help save the planet from fossil-fuel destruction.",
      "Not anymore.",
      "\u201cI used to be adored by the left,\u201d Musk said in an interview with Tucker Carlson on February 18 as his stock was halfway through a nearly 30% plunge for the month. \u201cLess so these days.\u201d",
      "His decision to spend $270 million on Donald Trump's presidential campaign and publicly back him was risky enough for his business. Then he doubled down, pursuing a slash-and-burn strategy as head of Trump's government efficiency team and taking his political revolution and incendiary talk abroad.",
      "He has backed the far-right, pro-Russian, anti-Muslim party in German y, called the British p rime minister an \u201cevil tyrant\u201d who runs a \u201cpolice state,\" and stated recently about a U.S. neighbor and major Tesla market, \u201cCanada is not a real country.\"",
      "The backlash has been fierce.",
      "Tesla showrooms in the U.S. have been besieged by protesters, its vehicles vandalized and bumper stickers appearing on its cars with sayings such as, \u201cI bought it before Elon went nuts.\u201d",
      "An effigy of Musk was hung in Milan and image of him doing a straight-arm salute projected on a Tesla factory outside Berlin. In London, a bus stop poster of him above the word \u201cswasticars\u201d lit up social media. A Polish government minister called for a Tesla boycott.",
      "\u201cI will not buy a Tesla again,\" said Jens Fischer, a 50-year-old microscope salesman in Witten, Germany, who thinks Musk is \u201cdestabilizing democracy\u201d and has slapped one of those \u201cElon went nuts\u201d stickers on his Model 3. \u201cI\u2019d sell if I got a good offer.\u201d",
      "Tesla investor Ross Gerber says Musk has somehow managed to marry the world's best product with the world's worst marketing.",
      "\u201cPeople want to buy stuff that makes them feel good, you don't want politics involved,\" said Gerber, a money manager whose portfolios hold nearly $60 million in Tesla stock. \u201cIt's even worse when you have such divisive issues, whether it\u2019s firing climate scientists or taking aid away from starving African children.\u201d",
      "Boycotts have a habit of fizzling out, and Morningstar's Goldstein says that buying a car is too big a decision and costs too much to make them successful targets, anyway.",
      "One Tesla owner, Londoner Harry Chathli, is unmoved by the backlash, saying he has no intention of getting rid of his Tesla S. He has nothing but praise for Musk who he calls a visionary for transforming \"the way we think about transportation and the future of our planet.\u201d",
      "But if Tesla's stock is any indicator, the company's prospects are deteriorating, and Musk's position in the Trump administration isn't helping. As of Friday, it has dropped 37% since its Inauguration Day, a loss of $550 billion in investor wealth.",

    "story": [
      "The recently announced U.S. tariffs on steel imports mean that countries like China, which export to the U.S., will need to find new markets \u2014 and that could lead to steel dumping in places like India",
      "BENGALURU, India -- Rows of small factories line the streets of a dusty suburb in Bengaluru, where workers weld and cast Indian-made steel into everything from car parts to kitchen sinks. Here, U.S. President Trump\u2019s announcement to impose high trade tariffs on steel imports has some unexpected supporters.",
      "Many industry workers and experts expect that the result of tariffs will be that cheap steel gets dumped in places like India. That's because the announced 25% tariff will make it too expensive for many companies in countries like China and South Korea to keep exporting to the U.S.",
      "For B. Praveen of Sun Techpro Engineering, which makes products from steel metal sheets, it means his \u201cwafer-thin\u201d profit margins will probably grow as the steel he buys gets cheaper.",
      "\u201cFor thousands of companies like mine, this can be a good thing,\u201d he said. Businesses such as Praveen's employ over 200 million Indians and are key drivers of India's economy.",
      "But cheaper steel in India isn't good for everyone. In February Naveen Jindal, the president of the Indian Steel Association, which represents all India\u2019s steelmakers, said that he was \u201cdeeply concerned,\u201d especially since \u201cIndia is one of the few major markets without any trade restrictions,\u201d making it a target for potential steel dumping. And the increased competition could impact efforts by India to produce its own steel more cleanly. The current production of most Indian steel releases high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, which cause climate change. Reduction efforts could be cut in the interest of keeping profits up.",
      "India is the world\u2019s most populous nation and one of the fastest-growing major economies. Steel demand is rising rapidly due to fast-paced urbanization, infrastructure, and industrial growth, and the government expects steel production to increase from 120 million tons to 300 million tons in the next five years.",
      "Currently, up to 12% of India's greenhouse gas emissions come from steelmaking according to the Global Energy Monitor, an organization that tracks energy projects around the globe. It found this could likely double in five years if more steel is produced as per the government's plans.",
      "Henna Khadeeja, a research analyst with GEM, explained that unlike China, Europe, or the United States, Indian steelmakers still mostly use coal-based blast furnaces to make steel, which are more high-emitting. In September last year, the Indian government said it would invest $1.72 billion to help the steel industry transition to cleaner methods of steelmaking.",
      "But Khadeeja said all the new steel expansion plans that have been announced are for coal-based steel production facilities. \u201cRight now, the focus is mostly on producing as much steel as possible. The strategy is mostly to retroactively decarbonize the steel once the capacity is built in place,\" she said.",
      "Building more coal-based blast furnaces make it more difficult for India to export its steel in the future, particularly to Europe, said Easwaran Narassimhan of the New Delhi-based think tank Sustainable Futures Collective. The European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a tax on carbon emissions that Europe will begin charging for all products imported to the bloc from next year, would likely turn off any buyers from steel made with coal-based blast furnaces.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s steel production is less emissions-intensive, which means it\u2019s going to face a lesser impact from European carbon taxes,\u201d said Narassimhan. \u201cAny amount of short-term pain today is going to be worth in the long run.\"",
      "India too has ambitious climate goals and wants to produce 500 gigawatts of clean power \u2014 enough to power nearly 300 million Indian homes \u2014 by the end of this decade. The South Asian nation recently crossed the milestone of installing 100 gigawatts of solar power, most of which was installed in the last 10 years.",
      "India also aims to go net zero \u2014 that is to stop adding planet-warming gas to the atmosphere, either by preventing the emissions in the first place or removing an equivalent amount through natural or technological means \u2014 by 2070.",
      "Indian steelmakers said they recognize the need to emit less but are apprehensive about how much it'll cost them. \u201cIf you're not financially viable, you cannot exist as a business,\u201d said Prabodh Acharya, chief sustainability officer at JSW Group, one of India's biggest steel companies.",
      "\u201cSteel is essential for the growth of society and economy. We need to find the right balance between growth, economy and decarbonization,\u201d he said.",

      "TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran\u2019s parliament on Sunday impeached the country\u2019s economy minister and voted to remove him from office, amid growing concerns over the crashing rial and accusations of mismanagement.",
      "Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf announced that 182 out of 273 lawmakers voted to dismiss Abdolnasser Hemmati, just six months after President Masoud Pezeshkian\u2019s government took office.",
      "Pezeshkian, who defended Hemmati, emphasized that the government is locked in a tough battle with the West. He called for greater unity and cooperation from Parliament to face these challenges.",
      "The decision comes amid rising tensions over Iran\u2019s nuclear program and worsening relations with the West. Iran\u2019s economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, especially after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. In 2015, the rial was worth 32,000 to the dollar, but by the time Pezeshkian took office in July, it had plummeted to 584,000 to the dollar. Recently, it dropped even further, with exchange shops in Tehran trading 930,000 rials for each dollar.",
      "During the impeachment proceedings, Mohammad Qasim Osmani, a lawmaker supporting Hemmati, argued that rising inflation and exchange rates were not the fault of the current government or Parliament. He pointed to the budget deficit left by the previous administration, which he said contributed to the economic instability. Osmani also cited recent geopolitical events as factors that undermined public confidence, causing many people to convert their savings into foreign currency, which in turn further devalued the rial.",
      "Hemmati acknowledged the tough economic climate during his five months in office, including a 10% reduction in inflation. However, he acknowledged that inflation remained high, standing at 35%. He assured lawmakers that his team was working hard to address the issue, but warned that the process would take time.",
      "This latest development is another chapter in Iran\u2019s ongoing political and economic struggles as the country continues to navigate a complex relationship with both its leadership and the international community."

      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Treasury Department announced it will not enforce a Biden-era small business rule intended to curb money laundering and shell company formation.",
      "In a Sunday evening announcement, Treasury said in a news release that it will not impose penalties now or in the future if companies fail to register for the agency's beneficial ownership information database that was created during the Biden administration.",
      "Despite efforts by small businesses to undue the rule in the courts, it remains in effect.",
      "On Sunday, President Donald Trump on his Truth Social media site praised the suspension of enforcement of the rule and said the database is \u201coutrageous and invasive.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis Biden rule has been an absolute disaster for Small Businesses Nationwide,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economic menace of BOI reporting will soon be no more.\u201d",

      "The rule required most American businesses with fewer than 20 employees to register their business owners with the government as of Jan. 1, 2024. Small businesses are targeted because shell companies, often used to hide illegally obtained assets, tend to have few employees.",

      "The rule and its legislative authority \u2014 the Corporate Transparency Act, an anti-money laundering statue passed in 2021 \u2014 have been mired in litigation. In 2022, a small business lobbying group sued to block the Treasury Department\u2019s requirement that tens of millions of small businesses register with the government.

      "NEW YORK -- The Nationals and Baltimore Orioles ended a legal fight over television rights dating to 2012 when Major League Baseball announced Monday that Washington will be freed from its deal with the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network after the upcoming season.",
      "MLB said Nationals' games will be broadcast by MASN in 2025 under a new, one-year contract.",
      "\u201cAfter this term, the Nationals will be free to explore alternatives for their television rights for the 2026 season and beyond,\u201d MLB said. \u201cAs part of the settlement, all disputes related to past media rights between the Nationals, Orioles and MASN have been resolved, and all litigation will be dismissed.\u201d",
      "MASN was established in March 2005 after the Montreal Expos relocated to Washington and became the Nationals, moving into what had been Baltimore\u2019s exclusive broadcast territory since 1972. The Orioles were given a supermajority partnership interest in MASN, starting at 90%, and Washington made a $75 million payment to the network for an initial 10%.",
      "The agreement called for the Nationals\u2019 equity to increase 1% annually, starting after the 2009 season, with a cap of 33%. The network\u2019s rights payments to each team were set at $20 million apiece in 2005 and 2006, rising to $25 million in 2007, with $1 million annual increases through 2011.",
      "After that, the network was to pay fair market value and for disputes over the Nationals rights to be resolved by MLB\u2019s Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee, a group of three MLB club officials. The RSDC started to hear the case in 2012 and lawsuits over the decision were filed two years later in New York Supreme Court.",
      "Litigation over the 2012-16 fees resulted in a 2019 RSDC decision that valued them at $296.8 million. After arguments that went to the New York Court of Appeals, the sides agreed to a settlement in June 2023.",
      "A 2023 RSDC decision held Washington was owed about $304.1 million by MASN for 2017-21, after an adjustment downward of almost $45.5 million for the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. That decision was confirmed in New York Supreme Court.",
      "Another RSDC decision this past December had awarded the Nationals approximately $320.5 million for 2022-26. The rights fee was set at about $72.8 million each for 2022 and \u201923 \u2014 matching 2021 \u2014 and dropped to approximately $58.3 million annually from 2024-26, citing deteriorating economics of regional sports networks.",
      "A court hearing on that decision had been scheduled for March 13.",

      "Dallas Mavericks star Kyrie Irving has a torn ACL in his left knee and will miss the rest of the season, a person with knowledge of the injury told The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "Irving was injured in the first quarter of Dallas\u2019 122-98 loss to the Sacramento Kings on Monday night. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because an announcement hadn't been made.",
      "Following the injury, Irving made two free throws with tears rolling down his cheeks before leaving the game.",
      "The 32-year-old was fouled by DeMar DeRozan on a drive to the basket and his right foot landed on the foot of the Kings\u2019 Jonas Valanciunas. Irving lost his balance and then landed awkwardly on his left leg, and his knee appeared to hyperextend before he fell to the floor.",
      "It's the biggest setback so far this season among a slew of injuries for the Mavericks, who lost 10-time All-Star Anthony Davis to a groin injury in his Dallas debut following the seismic trade that sent Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers.",
      "The presence of Irving was the biggest reason the Mavericks felt they could proceed with the controversial Davis-for-Doncic deal, a move that infuriated the Dallas fan base.",
      "Now, Irving is out for the season, and would figure to be in the final stages of recovery when teams report for training camp for the 2025-26 season. Irving has a $44 million player option for next season.",
      "The injury could make it difficult for the defending Western Conference champions to get back to the playoffs. Dallas is 10th in the West, the final spot in the play-in tournament.",
      "Irving earned his ninth All-Star appearance as an injury replacement this season. He averaged 24.7 points and shot 40% from 3-point range.",
      "Davis, who was to be re-evaluated this week for a possible return, is one of three significant missing pieces on the Dallas front line along with centers Daniel Gafford (sprained knee) and Dereck Lively II (stress fracture in an ankle).",

      "The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the agreement hasn't been announced. FanSided first reported that Quintana was signing with the Brewers.",
      "Quintana, 36, is coming off a 2024 season in which he went 10-10 with a 3.75 ERA in 31 starts for the New York Mets. He struck out 135 and walked 63 in 170 1/3 innings. Over his last six regular-season starts, Quintana gave up four runs \u2014 three earned \u2014 in 36 1/3 innings.",
      "He started the deciding game of New York\u2019s NL Wild Card Series matchup with the Brewers and pitched six shutout innings in the Mets\u2019 4-2 victory, though he received no decision. Quintana had a total of three postseason starts, allowing six runs \u2014 five earned \u2014 over 14 1/3 innings.",
      "Quintana now will compete for a spot in a Brewers rotation that returns right-handers Freddy Peralta, Tobias Myers and Aaron Civale. The two-time defending NL Central champions also added left-hander Nestor Cortes in a trade that sent two-time NL reliever of the year Devin Williams to the New York Yankees.",
      "The Brewers could use some rotation depth as two-time All-Star Brandon Woodruff and Robert Gasser come back from injuries. Woodruff missed all of 2024 while recovering from shoulder surgery, and he won\u2019t be ready for the start of the season. Gasser, who is recovering from Tommy John surgery, isn\u2019t expected to be available until late in the season.",
      "Milwaukee got more bad news Monday night when left-hander Aaron Ashby, a candidate for a rotation spot, left his start against the Cincinnati Reds with an injury. Murphy told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Ashby appeared to have an oblique issue and would undergo an MRI.",
      "When he makes his Brewers debut, Quintana will have pitched for every team in the NL Central. He was with the Chicago Cubs from 2017-20 and split the 2022 season between the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals.",
      "Quintana owns a 102-103 record and 3.74 ERA in 359 career appearances, including 333 starts. He\u2019s also had stints with the Chicago White Sox (2012-17), Los Angeles Angels (2021), San Francisco Giants (2021) and Mets (2023-24). He was selected to the All-Star Game in 2016.",

      "The defending Western Conference champion Edmonton Oilers made their first big move ahead of the NHL trade deadline by acquiring hard-nosed forward Trent Frederic from the Boston Bruins on Tuesday.",
      "Edmonton sent a 2025 second- and a 2026 fourth-round pick and prospect Max Wanner to Boston for the 6-foot-3, 220-pounder, with the Bruins retaining half of Frederic's $2.3 million salary. The New Jersey Devils retained another quarter and received the rights to unsigned draft pick Shane Lachance from the Oilers and Petr Hauser from the Bruins in return.",
      "Trading Frederic is the first sell-off by the Bruins, who are among the teams vying for the final couple of playoff spots in the Eastern Conference. Captain Brad Marchand, like Frederic, is a pending free agent, though he has said he would like to play his entire career with Boston and also was injured last weekend and is considered week to week.",
      "Getting the 27-year-old provides Edmonton some much-needed toughness with the aim of helping Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and company make another long playoff run this spring, a year after reaching Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final and losing to Florida. In addition to adding Frederic at a bargain cap hit of $575,000 \u2014 under the league minimum \u2014 the Oilers also got depth forward Max Jones in this deal.",

      "Kevin Durant is second to James among active players with 35,191 points including playoffs \u2014 which means even if he averaged 2,000 points a season (something he's done only once in the last five years) he would still have to play into the 2032-33 season to have a shot at reaching 50,000.",

That came shortly after the ACC's Board of Directors \u2014 made up of university presidents and chancellors \u2014 gave its OK, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the league and schools had not publicly addressed the settlement at the time.",
      "Most notably, the revenue-distribution model will now incorporate TV viewership as a way for the league's top programs to generate more revenue. It also provides a clarity on the league's exit fee and grant-of-rights agreement that runs through the ACC's TV deal with ESPN through 2036.",
      "Specifically, a slideshow during a presentation to Clemson's trustees reported the exit fee would be $165 million for the 2026 fiscal year, but would descend by $18 million per year until leveling off around $75 million for the 2030-31 season. While a grant-of-rights agreement gives the league control of a school's media rights, the deal would allow a school to exit with its media rights after paying the exit fee, according to that presentation.",
      "The agreement offers a measure of stability for the league in the coming years, though with the longer-term risk of teams potentially deciding to leave in the final years of the current media deal in a time of rapid changes to the college landscape.",

They are a league-best 16-3 since Jan. 20 and went into Tuesday's games sitting in the No. 2 spot in the Western Conference, a place that until now they hadn't been since about the first week of the season.",

And now, another milestone: James is one point away from 50,000 for his career when combining regular-season and postseason games, and that bridge will almost certainly be crossed Tuesday night against New Orleans.",

      "Tadeo Allende, on the counter-attack, ran onto an arcing ball played ahead by Su\u00e1rez and outraced three defenders to the the left-center of the area before he side-netted a rising left-foot shot inside the back post to give Miami (1-0-1) a 2-0 lead in the 37th minute.",
      "Segovia, who subbed on in the 59th minute of Miami's 2-2 tie with New York City FC in the season opener and scored his first MLS goal in the 10th minute of stoppage time, scored from near the penalty spot to make it 3-0 at halftime.",
      "Su\u00e1rez cut back to evade a defender and outraced two more as he darted to the left-center of the box before he blasted a shot the deflected off goalkeeper Andrew Tarbell's hand into the net to give Miami a 4-0 lead in the 79th minute.",
      "Nico Lodeiro, who signed with Houston (0-2-0) last month, scored his first goal for the club in the 85th.",
      "Miami's Lionel Messi (rest) did not make the trip. The Dynamo gave complimentary tickets for a future Houston match to fans in attendance on Saturday.",
      "Messi recorded an assist in the season opener to became the fastest player in MLS history (26 games) to reach 40 career goal contributions in MLS regular season action (21 goals, 19 assists).",
      "Miami had lost three in a row against the Dynamo.",

      "Fans wanted to see Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter work out at two positions and how the top quarterback duel would go when the NFL scouting combine opened",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- When the NFL scouting combine opened, everyone wanted to see Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter work out at two positions and how the top quarterback duel would go.",
      "Those hopes were dashed in Indianapolis.",
      "Hunter skipped both on-field opportunities and quarterbacks Cam Ward and Shedeur Sanders joined the growing list of top prospects who opted to work out at their college pro days instead of at the combine.",
      "Fans must now wait days or weeks for the full picture to come into view, though the combine still was filled with interesting twists and intriguing plots that will be discussed between now and the draft, which begins in Green Bay on April 24.",
      "Here's a look at some of the top stories from the combine:",
      "Armand Membou, OT, Missouri. He came to Indy in the mix to be the first offensive lineman drafted this year, and after measuring in at 6-foot-4, 332 pounds he dazzled with his athleticism. Membou ran the 40-yard dash in 4.91 seconds, led all offensive linemen with a broad jump of 9 feet, 7 inches and had a 34-inch vertical jump. That should be enough to cement his status as a high first-round pick.",
      "Shemar Stewart, DE, Texas A&M. It was another big guy on the opposite side of the ball who stole the spotlight on the first night of workouts. He put up elite numbers in the 40 \u2014 a time of 4.59 and a 10-yard split of 1.58 seconds \u2014 before posting a broad jump of 10-1 to go with a 40-inch vertical jump. All four numbers were top five in his position group, and he should be moving up the rankings between now and draft day.",
      "Jaylin Noel, WR, Iowa State. The 5-foot-10, 194-pound receiver certainly appeared to have something to prove this weekend \u2014 and he did. Noel was one of the few players to participate in every test and he aced them all. He was one of a record 10 receivers with a sub-4.4 40, finishing in 4.39 with a 10-yard split of 1.51. He had the best vertical (41 1/2) and top broad jump (11-2) at his position and even did a group-best 23 reps on the bench press. His 20-yard shuttle (4.17) and three-cone drill (6.82) times also made the top five. And a strong showing catching passes made it a good weekend for Noel.",
      "Jihaad Campbell, LB, Alabama. With Jalon Walker of Georgia sitting out, Campbell quickly became the feature attraction in his position group. He didn't disappoint in the three drills he tried. Campbell's 4.52 time in the 40 was third among linebackers, just a few ticks off Kain Medrano's group-leading 4.46. Only two linebackers bettered Campbell's 10-yard split, 1.53, and he finished second in the broad jump at 10-7. He may not go ahead of Walker but his workout might help narrow the gap.",
      "Maxwell Hairston, CB, Kentucky. After missing five games with a shoulder injury last season, Hairston made a splashy entrance at Lucas Oil Stadium. On the second night of workouts, he ran the 40 in 4.28 seconds \u2014 the fastest overall time all week \u2014 and only one cornerback topped his 10-yard split of 1.5. Hairston's encore was a 39 1/2-inch vertical jump and a broad jump of 10-9, finishing second and third in those tests, respectively.",
      "Nick Emmanwori, S, South Carolina. The 220-pound safety came within a whisker of sweeping the top spot in all four drills in which he participated. He had the best 10-yard split time, 1.49, the best broad jump (11-6), the top vertical jump (43) and a 40 time of 4.38, second only to Marcus Sigle of Kansas State who ran it in 4.37. His draft stock should be soaring as the next phase of pre-draft evaluations begins.",
      "Will Campbell, OT, LSU. A strong overall workout Sunday may have solidified Campbell's spot among top tackles. But some scouts worry Campbell's arms are shorter than the preferred 33-inch length for a tackle. He can alleviate more concerns on his pro day.",
      "Kaleb Johnson, RB, Iowa. Some thought Johnson was a top-five back prior to the combine. But Johnson decided to participate in just the 40-yard dash and his time of 4.57 seconds was only better than four other running backs. A better pro day showing would help.",
      "Jalen Milroe, QB, Alabama. When last season started, some thought the athletic Crimson Tide quarterback might be a first-round pick. Instead, his stock steadily declined during the season and an uneven throwing performance in Indy may create more doubts.",
      "Mike Green, Edge, Marshall. He's believed to be a first-round talent, but the questions about Green have less to do with what he does on the field than what happened off it. Green told reporters Wednesday he transferred from Virginia after a second sexual assault allegation, something team officials probably will dig into more now \u2014 if they hadn't already.",
      "Jack Bech, WR, TCU. The player with perhaps the most inspirational story in Indy \u2014 his older brother, Tiger, was killed in the New Year's Day attack in New Orleans \u2014 didn't run the 40 but showed he was strong, tough and physical enough to warrant being drafted.",
      "Riley Leonard, QB, Notre Dame. After leading the Fighting Irish to a national runner-up finish, Leonard went to work on cleaning up his footwork and midrange and deep throws. He looked more polished in Indy. The question is whether he can demonstrate more improvement at his pro day.",
      "Harold Fannin Jr., TE/H-back, Bowling Green. Last season, he broke FBS single-season records for receptions and yards receiving by a tight end. His top regular-season games came against Texas A&M and Penn State, too. What he did Thursday was show he could run, with a time of 4.71, sixth best among tight ends.",
      "Marcus Yarns, RB, Delaware. The former FCS star proved he belonged on the big stage. The 5-11, 193-pound back had a 4.45 in the 40, a top-10 finish in the 10-yard split and vertical jump and a solid showing in the on-field position workouts.",

      "Coach Jon Scheyer described the injury as a bruised eyelid. The subject was personal for Scheyer, a Duke alum whose professional career ended overseas because of an eye injury.",
      "\u201cAs a basketball player, you don\u2019t think about injuring your eye,\u201d Scheyer said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t cross your mind. I had never seen him look scared. I thought he was scared at first, rightfully so, because you don\u2019t know how serious or permanent. \u2026 I was really nervous about him.",
      "Flagg sat out more than 11 minutes to end the half, while the team\u2019s eye doctor checked on him. He was back on the court for the first 12 minutes of the second half, finishing the game with 16 points on 5-for-9 shooting. He wasn\u2019t made available to speak to reporters after the game.",
      "\u201cHe had some vision issues in the first half and tested it out and he said he was good to go, and he was,\u201d Scheyer said. \u201c\u2026 He\u2019s so tough. His mom is yelling at him to rebound and defend if he\u2019s going back in the game, so I didn\u2019t have to say a whole lot.\u201d",
      "Classmate Kon Knueppel said he was surprised Flagg was in action for the second half.",
      "\u201cTo see him go down and stays down that worries you a little bit,\u201d Knueppel said. \u201cJust a couple of scratches on his face.\u201d",
      "For James, it was another example of the aura around Flagg.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not the craziest thing we\u2019ve seen him do all year,\u201d James said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen him do crazier things. That\u2019s what makes him who he is.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Flagg made a move toward the lane and was fouled by Florida State\u2019s Jerry Deng. Alier Maluk, a 7-foot freshman, also struck Flagg on the face during the sequence.",
      "Flagg, who\u2019s considered the potential No. 1 overall draft selection for the NBA, walked gingerly off the court with the aid of teammate Mason Gillis and trainer Jose Fonseca with 11:27 remaining. Duke led 14-11 at the time.",
      "Flagg, a 6-foot-9 phenom, had just returned to the game after being treated on the bench by Fonseca for an apparent cut on his face.",
      "Flagg exited the gym for additional evaluation before returning to the bench a few minutes later. But on the next timeout, he didn\u2019t join the rest of the Blue Devils in the huddle around Scheyer. He was cheering from the bench as the Blue Devils extended their double-digit lead. Then with about 5 1/2 minutes on the clock in the half, he exited the gym again and returned to the bench a few minutes later.",
      "Duke led 47-30 at the break.",
      "Flagg entered the game averaging 19.4 points, 7.6 rebounds and 4.1 assists.",

      "The public defender's office representing Rose declined to comment, and lawyers for Simmons didn't immediately respond Tuesday.",
      "StubHub said Tuesday that it had discovered the criminal scheme and reported it to authorities and its third-party customer service vendor.",
      "The company said it has since terminated its relationship with the vendor and strengthened its security measures. All ticket orders so far identified as impacted by the theft have also been replaced or fully refunded, according to StubHub.",

      "Originally started as a secret project within Google, Waymo has been making major inroads since its robotaxis first began charging for rides in Phoenix nearly five years ago. Waymo's robotaxis are now averaging 200,000 paid rides per week, up from about 10,000 weekly rides two years ago, according to a recent post by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, who runs the Mountain View, California, company that owns Google as well as Waymo.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts \u2014 genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.",
      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Since then, the company has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \u201cengineer them into living animals,\u201d said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you\u2019re not bringing back the ancient past,\u201d said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \u201cColossal woolly mouse.\u201d",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\u201d said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \u201cmake it a lot more efficient and easier,\u201d said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \u201cpresent already in some living mice,\u201d said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \u201cwe put them all together in a single mouse.\u201d",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \u201ca lot of processes and red tape\u201d before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \u201cde-extinction.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it\u2019s not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It\u2019s changing an Asian elephant,\u201d said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal\u2019s technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",

President Donald Trump and SpaceX's Elon Musk said at the end of January that they wanted to accelerate the astronauts' return, blaming the previous administration.",
      "But Williams, in response to a question, did take issue with Musk's recent call to dump the space station in two years, rather than waiting until NASA's projected deorbit in 2031. She noted all the scientific research being performed at the orbiting lab.",
      "\u201cThis place is ticking. It's just really amazing, so I would say we're actually in our prime right now,\u201d said Williams, a three-time space station resident. \u201cI would think that right now is probably not the right time to say quit, call it quits.\u201d",
      "Williams said she can't wait to be reunited with her Labrador retrievers. The hardest part about the unexpected extended stay, she added, was the wait by their families back home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,\" she said. \u201cWe're here. We have a mission. We're just just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we're up in space and it's a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched last June aboard Boeing\u2019s new Starliner capsule, making its crew debut after years of delay. The Starliner had so many problems getting to the space station that NASA ruled it too dangerous to carry anyone and it flew back empty.",
      "Their homecoming was further delayed by extra completion time needed for the brand new SpaceX capsule that was supposed to deliver their replacements.",
      "Last month, NASA announced the next crew would launch in a used capsule instead, pushing up liftoff to March 12. The two crews will spend about a week together aboard the space station before Wilmore and Williams depart with NASA\u2019s Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency\u2019s Alexander Gorbunov.",
      "Wilmore and Williams \u2014 retired Navy captains and repeat space fliers \u2014 have insisted over the months that they are healthy and committed to the mission as long as it takes. They took a spacewalk together in January.",
      "They will wear generic SpaceX flight suits for the ride back, not the usual custom-made outfits bearing their names because their trip home in a Dragon capsule was unplanned. That's fine with them, although Wilmore hinted he might use a pen to write his name on his suit.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just Butch and Suni,\" Williams said. \u201cEverybody knows who we are by now.\"",

    "story": [
      "Some Georgia lawmakers are trying to get rid of automated cameras that enforce school zone speed limits, saying the cameras are more about making money than the safety of children",
      "DECATUR, Ga. -- Outside Beacon Hill Middle School in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur, like along hundreds of roadsides across Georgia, the unblinking eye of a camera tickets drivers who speed through a school zone.",
      "Supporters say cameras slow down drivers and provide constant enforcement that understaffed police departments can't equal. But some state lawmakers want to ban them, saying the cameras are more about generating money for local governments and camera companies, and that some use them deceptively.",
      "More than 20 states and the District of Columbia allow automated traffic cameras to issue speeding tickets, but more than 10 other states have outlawed them. However, it would be unusual for a state to reverse its position. New Jersey had a pilot program testing cameras to enforce red lights, but pulled the plug in 2014.",
      "Georgia's fight will come to a head soon in its General Assembly, with three separate bills advancing out of committees. The state first authorized speed cameras, but only in school zones, in 2018.",
      "More than 100 representatives in Georgia's 180-member House signed on to House Bill 225, which would ban the cameras. Dale Washburn, the Macon Republican sponsoring that measure, provided a stack of emails from outraged people ticketed statewide who said lights weren't flashing, they didn't even know they were in a school zone, or the cameras were otherwise unfair.",
      "While the tickets in Georgia are civil citations and don't go on a driver\u2019s criminal record, the state does block people who don\u2019t pay from renewing their vehicle registration. Almost 125,000 unpaid violations were reported in 2024, the Georgia Department of Revenue said. The cameras generated more than $112 million in revenue in 54 Georgia cities and counties since 2019, WANF-TV found last year. Camera companies typically take a share of the revenue.",
      "\u201cThese camera companies are engaged in deceit and trickery,\u201d Washburn said. \u201cTheir goal is to write tickets, not to enhance children\u2019s safety.\"",
      "One issue with abolishing cameras is that companies have become big political donors. Two big vendors, United Kingdom-based RedSpeed and Tennessee-based Blue Line Solutions, contributed around $500,000 to Georgia campaigns in recent years, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan watchdog that tracks money in politics.",
      "Legislative leaders seem more likely to support two other bills that would keep cameras, but more closely regulate them by providing better warning signs and limiting the hours of usage.",
      "\u201cSo the objective is to alert drivers that they're entering a school zone and get them to slow down and then for them not to be cited unless they are speeding in a school zone during designated hours,\u201d said Republican Sen. Max Burns of Sylvania, who is sponsoring Senate Bill 75.",
      "An alternate House bill that is similar to Burns' would require half the money raised go to school safety.",
      "In Decatur, students surge out of Beacon Hill Middle at dismissal and walk along College Avenue, a two-lane street that's also a state highway. Unlike most places in Georgia, where most students travel home in buses or their parents' cars, a majority of Decatur's 5,300 students either walk or ride bikes home.",
      "Decatur Mayor Patti Garrett said a student at Beacon Hill was struck in a hit-and-run accident and a crossing guard elsewhere was also hit before Decatur activated its cameras last fall.",
      "\u201cWe really want to protect our most vulnerable residents, our students, and particularly when they are on foot or on a bicycle,\" Garrett said.",
      "Police Chief Scott Richards said according to a speed study conducted by the company, speeding has fallen 92%. But there are still plenty of drivers flying through the five zones where Decatur is using cameras. They issued 4,500 valid citations in January alone, he said.",
      "\u201cWe would not be able to get those reductions if it were not for the photo enforcement in school zones,\u201d Richards said.",
      "Decatur officials tout their efforts as a model, saying the city has abundant signage and only operates the cameras for a 30 minutes before and after schools begin in the morning and dismiss in the afternoon. A vehicle must be traveling 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) per hour over the speed limit to be cited.",
      "Still, Washburn and others say the amount of money involved encourages overuse and bad behavior.",
      "\u201cProfit-based law enforcement cannot be trusted,\u201d John Moore of Milledgeville wrote to Washburn in February. \u201cI hope you can convince your colleagues to vote this menace out of our state for good.\u201d"

      "\u201cMy initial shock turned to horror when I learned that the same person targeted about 80, 85 other women, most of whom live in Minnesota, some of whom I know personally, and all of them had connections in some way to the offender,\u201d Kelly said.",
      "Backed by her testimony, Minnesota is considering a new strategy for cracking down on deepfake pornography. A bill that has bipartisan support would target companies that run websites and apps allowing people to upload a photo that then would be transformed into explicit images or videos.",
      "States across the country and Congress are considering strategies for regulating artificial intelligence. Most have banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn whether they were produced with AI or not. The idea behind the Minnesota legislation is to prevent the material from ever being created \u2014 before it spreads online.",
      "Experts on AI law caution the proposal might be unconstitutional on free speech grounds.",
      "The lead author, Democratic Sen. Erin Maye Quade, said additional restrictions are necessary because AI technology has advanced so rapidly. Her bill would require the operators of \u201cnudification\u201d sites and apps to turn them off to people in Minnesota or face civil penalties up to $500,000 \u201cfor each unlawful access, download, or use.\u201d Developers would need to figure out how to exclude Minnesota users.",
      "It\u2019s not just the dissemination that\u2019s harmful to victims, she said. It\u2019s the fact that these images exist at all.",
      "Kelly told reporters last month that anyone can quickly create \u201chyper-realistic nude images or pornographic video\u201d in minutes.",
      "Most law enforcement attention so far has been focused on distribution and possession.",
      "San Francisco in August filed a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against several widely visited \u201cnudification\u201d websites, alleging they broke state laws against fraudulent business practices, nonconsensual pornography and the sexual abuse of children. That case remains pending.",
      "The U.S. Senate last month unanimously approved a bill by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Republican Ted Cruz, of Texas, to make it a federal crime to publish nonconsensual sexual imagery, including AI-generated deepfakes. Social media platforms would be required to remove them within 48 hours of notice from a victim. Melania Trump on Monday used her first solo appearance since becoming first lady again to urge passage by the Republican-controlled House, where it's pending.",
      "The Kansas House last month approved a bill that expands the definition of illegal sexual exploitation of a child to include possession of images generated with AI if they're \u201cindistinguishable from a real child, morphed from a real child\u2019s image or generated without any actual child involvement.\u201d",
      "A bill introduced in the Florida Legislature creates a new felony for people who use technology such as AI to generate nude images and criminalizes possession of child sexual abuse images generated with it. Broadly similar bills have also been introduced in Illinois, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Texas, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural.",
      "Maye Quade said she'll be sharing her proposal with legislators in other states because few are aware the technology is so readily accessible.",
      "\u201cIf we can\u2019t get Congress to act, then we can maybe get as many states as possible to take action,\u201d Maye Quade said.",
      "Sandi Johnson, senior legislative policy counsel for the victim\u2019s rights group RAINN \u2014 the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network \u2014 said the Minnesota bill would hold websites accountable.",
      "\u201cOnce the images are created, they can be posted anonymously, or rapidly widely disseminated, and become nearly impossible to remove,\u201d she testified recently.",
      "Megan Hurley also was horrified to learn someone had generated explicit images and video of her using a \u201cnudification\u201d site. She said she feels especially humiliated because she's a massage therapist, a profession that's already sexualized in some minds.",
      "\u201cIt is far too easy for one person to use their phone or computer and create convincing, synthetic, intimate imagery of you, your family, and friends, your children, your grandchildren,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cI do not understand why this technology exists and I find it abhorrent there are companies out there making money in this manner.\u201d",
      "However, two AI law experts \u2014 Wayne Unger of the Quinnipiac University School of Law and Riana Pfefferkorn of Stanford University's Institute of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence \u2014 said the Minnesota bill is too broadly constructed to survive a court challenge.",
      "Limiting the scope only to images of real children might help it withstand a First Amendment challenge since those are generally not protected, Pfefferkorn said. But she said it would still potentially conflict with a federal law that says you can't sue websites for content that users generate.",
      "\u201cIf Minnesota wants to go down this direction, they'll need to add a lot more clarity to the bill,\u201d Unger said. \u201cAnd they'll have to narrow what they mean by nudify and nudification.\u201d",
      "But Maye Quade said she thinks her legislation is on solid constitutional ground because it's regulating conduct, not speech.",

      "Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a rare U.S. species of fireflies \u2014 had its size and shape going for it. The squat four-legged lander stands 6-foot-6 (2 meters) tall and 11 feet (3.5 meters) wide, providing extra stability, according to the company.",
      "Launched in mid-January from Florida, the lander carried 10 experiments to the moon for NASA. The space agency paid $101 million for the delivery, plus $44 million for the science and tech on board. It\u2019s the third mission under NASA\u2019s commercial lunar delivery program, intended to ignite a lunar economy of competing private businesses while scouting around before astronauts show up later this decade.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Ray Allensworth said the lander skipped over hazards including boulders to land safely. Allensworth said the team continued to analyze the data to figure out the lander's exact position, but all indications suggest it landed within the 328-foot (100-meter) target zone in Mare Crisium.",
      "The demos should get two weeks of run time, before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down.",
      "It carried a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperature as deep as 10 feet (3 meters) below the surface. Also on board: a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust \u2014 a scourge for NASA\u2019s long-ago Apollo moonwalkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "On its way to the moon, Blue Ghost beamed back exquisite pictures of the home planet. The lander continued to stun once in orbit around the moon, with detailed shots of the moon's gray pockmarked surface. At the same time, an on-board receiver tracked and acquired signals from the U.S. GPS and European Galileo constellations, an encouraging step forward in navigation for future explorers.",
      "The landing set the stage for a fresh crush of visitors angling for a piece of lunar business.",
      "Another lander \u2014 a tall and skinny 15-footer (4 meters tall) built and operated by Houston-based Intuitive Machines \u2014 is due to land on the moon Thursday. It\u2019s aiming for the bottom of the moon, just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the south pole. That\u2019s closer to the pole than the company got last year with its first lander, which broke a leg and tipped over.",
      "Despite the tumble, Intuitive Machines' lander put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since NASA astronauts closed out the Apollo program in 1972.",
      "A third lander from the Japanese company ispace is still three months from landing. It shared a rocket ride with Blue Ghost from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 15, taking a longer, windier route. Like Intuitive Machines, ispace is also attempting to land on the moon for the second time. Its first lander crashed in 2023.",
      "The moon is littered with wreckage not only from ispace, but dozens of other failed attempts over the decades.",
      "NASA wants to keep up a pace of two private lunar landers a year, realizing some missions will fail, said the space agency's top science officer Nicky Fox.",
      "\u201cIt really does open up a whole new way for us to get more science to space and to the moon,\" Fox said.",
      "Unlike NASA\u2019s successful Apollo moon landings that had billions of dollars behind them and ace astronauts at the helm, private companies operate on a limited budget with robotic craft that must land on their own, said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.",
      "Kim said everything went like clockwork.",
      "\u201cWe got some moon dust on our boots,\" Kim said.",

      "LONDON -- Unwanted phone calls are out of control. Whether it's a robocall trying to sell you something or spam calls from scammers trying to rip you off, it's enough to make you want to stop answering your phone. So what can you do to stop them?",
      "The scourge of unwanted phone calls has been branded an epidemic by consumer groups, while the Federal Communications Commission says it's the top consumer complaint. The calls are a nuisance to many ordinary people, some of whom have complained to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI need help on getting spam calls to stop,\u201d one reader said in an email. She's getting up to 14 calls a day despite the countermeasures she's employed.",
      "As the name implies, robocalls are automated calls to deliver recorded messages to a large number of phones. A robocall purely to deliver a message or collect a debt is allowed under U.S. regulations, but the Federal Trade Commission says robocalls with a recorded voice trying to sell you something are illegal unless you've given explicit written permission to receive them. Many robocalls are also probably scams, the FTC warns.",

When you turn this on, any calls from numbers that you've never been in touch with and aren't saved in your contacts list will not ring through. Instead, they'll be sent to voicemail and show up in your list of recent calls.",
      "Android has a similar setting that allows you to block calls from private or unidentified numbers, although you will still receive calls from numbers that aren't stored in your contact list.",
      "Just keep in mind that you could also end up not getting important calls, which sometimes come from unknown numbers.",
      "If an unwanted call does get through, both Android and iPhone users can block the individual phone number by tapping on it in the recent callers or call history list. You can also enter numbers directly into your phone's block list.",
      "Sign up for the national Do Not Call registry, which is a list of numbers that have opted out of most telemarketing calls. The Federal Trade Commission, which runs the registry, says it only contains phone numbers and holds no other personally identifiable information, nor does the registry know whether the number is for a landline or a cellphone.",
      "The FTC says there are some exemptions, including political calls, calls from non-profit groups and charities, and legitimate survey groups that aren't selling anything. Also allowed are calls from companies up to 18 months after you've done \u2014 or sought to do \u2014 business with them.",
      "But it also warns that while having your number on the registry will cut down on unwanted sales calls, it won\u2019t stop scammers from making illegal calls.",
      "Other countries have similar registries. Canada has its own Do Not Call list while the U.K. has the Telephone Preference Service.",
      "Check whether your wireless carrier has a call-blocking service. Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T, three of the biggest U.S. networks, all have their own call filters for customers to block robocalls and report spam. There's typically a free basic version and an advanced version that requires a subscription fee.",
      "If your phone company's filters aren't good enough, try third-party apps to weed out unwanted callers.",
      "There are a host of smartphone apps available that promise to block spam calls, like Nomorobo, YouMail, Hiya, RoboKiller, TrueCaller and others.

    "story": [
      "His speech comes as he moves with lightning speed to forcibly enact his agenda.",
      "Donald Trump, six weeks into a historic comeback to the White House, on Tuesday heads to Capitol Hill to address Congress and the nation as a reinvented president relentlessly testing the limits of executive power.",
      "Trump will step up to the dais at 9 p.m. ET to lay out his goals for the next four years and tout the actions he's taken so far, many of them challenging constitutional restraints on his authority versus Congress and the courts.",
      "The president teased on Monday it would be a \"big night\" and House Speaker Mike Johnson told Fox News over the weekend to expect \"fireworks.\"",
      "The theme of his address will be the \"Renewal of the American Dream,\" a White House official told ABC News.",
      "Trump will focus, the official said, on his record thus far, the economy, border security, and what the official called the president's plans for \"peace around the globe.\"",
      "He will push Congress to pass more border security funding for deportations and the border wall, the official said, and on foreign policy, he's expected to touch on his efforts to help broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has accomplished more in one month than any president in four years \u2013 and the renewal of the American Dream is well underway,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"In his Joint Address to Congress, President Trump will celebrate his extraordinarily successful first month in office while outlining his bold, ambitious, and common sense vision for the future. President Trump\u2019s Joint Address will be MUST-SEE TV.\u201d",
      "The speech comes as Trump moves with lightning speed to enact his agenda, including an immigration crackdown and radical overhaul of the federal government -- the latter with the help of his unelected enforcer Elon Musk, who will be in the House chamber looking on.",
      "As some of the dust settles from that blitz, a 538 analysis of public opinion polls found Trump himself to be more popular than many of his administration's policies. And his approval rating, while higher than at this same point in his first term, is still underwater at 45%, according to Gallup.",
      "Trump has signed 76 executive orders since his inauguration, according to the Federal Register.",
      "Barbara Perry, co-chair of the Presidential Oral History Program at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center, said she expects Trump's speech to start off on the theme of \"promises made, promises kept.\"",
      "\"I suspect there will be some chest-pounding and drawing attention to the fact that historically, this is one of the most active and productive first 100 days and we're not even at the 100-day mark yet,\" Perry said. \"They're off the blocks really quickly.\"",
      "His executive actions include many of the culture war issues he campaigned on -- such as ending federal DEI programs, making English the country's official language, declaring the government will only recognize a person's sex assigned at birth and banning transgender athletes from participating in women's sports.",
      "On immigration, Trump could promote border crossings dropping significantly in January and the Department of Homeland Security arresting thousands of migrants illegally in the country. But his \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, has expressed frustration with the pace of deportations so far, and the administration abruptly cleared migrants from Guantanamo Bay after pledging to use the military base to house the \"worst of the worst.\" Trump's effort to end birthright citizenship, another signature 2024 pledge, has been temporarily blocked by the courts.",
      "On foreign policy, in addition to his efforts to start peace talks to end the Russia-Ukraine war, the White House official said he can be expected to talk about the Middle East, although his brazen Gaza takeover plan has little public buy-in from regional power players and the administration's reversal of American policy toward Russia and away from Ukraine has prompted concern among European allies.",
      "On the economy, Trump can be expected to highlight tariffs he'simposed against Canada and Mexico that went into place on Tuesday, as well as additional taxes against China. But inflation continues to be a persistent problem, with some economists predicting tariffs could raise prices more, and the cost of eggs have skyrocketed amid the prevalence of avian flu.",
      "But the Trump initiative that's been the most controversial is the slashing of the federal bureaucracy, which is being largely overseen by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. The dismantling of agencies like USAID, wholesale firings of federal workers and cutting of funds already appropriated by Congress is prompting widespread confusion and several legal challenges. Trump has defended Musk so far, including in his first Cabinet meeting last week where Musk spoke despite not being a Cabinet member.",
      "Trump will address Congress as Republicans hold majorities in both the House and Senate. Despite the trifecta, Trump is pushing an expansive view of executive power that questions the role of Congress and the courts to serve as a check over federal agencies.",
      "How aggressively he articulates that stance in front of the lawmakers and Supreme Court justices in attendance will be something to watch, said Philip Wallach, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.",
      "\"I think the big question is, what does he feel like he needs from Congress? The general sense of the second Trump administration has been to come out of the gates guns blaring, wanting to accomplish everything themselves,\" Wallach said. \"In some ways, it seems like they mostly want Congress to stay out of their way and to cheer them on in their effort to transform the government.\"",
      "\"But it's not clear just how far they can go without new laws from Congress, including some that go ahead and dismantle previous programs,\" Wallach noted.",
      "The first big legislative test will be the budget reconciliation bill that will fund much of Trump's agenda, though more pressing will be averting a government shutdown next week.",
      "Back in 2017, during his first-ever joint address to Congress, Trump made a pitch for unity. It was generally regarded as one of his best political speeches, said University of Michigan speech and debate expert Aaron Kall.",
      "Kall doesn't expect the same tone for Tuesday night's address, contending Trump views himself as having a \"mandate\" from voters after winning both the electoral college and popular vote (though data shows the victory isn't the total landslide Trump has often portrayed it as).",
      "\"I think it will be very totalizing, very self-assured and very partisan in tone,\" Kall said of Trump's upcoming address. \"This will be more in the ilk of a campaign speech.\"",

      "The fire chief denied Bass' allegations that she refused to conduct an investigation into the fires.",
      "\"I said that the LAFD is not capable, nor do we have the proper resources, to adequately conduct an after-action report for the Palisades Fire due to the sheer magnitude, scope and complexity of the incident. We are already understaffed, under-resourced, under-funded, and based on my knowledge of the LAFD's resources and capabilities, I recommended simply to collaborate with Gov. [Gavin] Newsom's already selected and funded agency, Fire Safety Research Institute,\" Crowley told the city council on Tuesday.",
      "Crowley also said 1,000 firefighters were sent home the morning of the fires because LAFD did not have enough apparatus for them, denying another allegation made by Bass.",
      "\"We did not have enough apparatus to put them on. Because of the budget cuts and lack of investments in our fleet maintenance, over 100 of our fire engines, fire trucks and ambulances sat broken down in our maintenance yards, unable to be used to help during one of the worst wildfire events in our history,\" she said.",
      "Crowley also denied that she did not inform the mayor of the dangerous weather event.",
      "\"The LAFD engaged in all of its standard communications, including emailing two separate media advisories, conducting multiple live and recorded media interviews about the predicted extreme weather and fire danger, and also notifying city officials about the upcoming weather events. The Emergency Management Department also plays a key role in notifying the mayor's office and city officials. And the mayor's office itself also set out multiple media messages prior to the fire's warnings,\" Crowley said.",
      "Bass said she did not know the weather forecast before leaving for Ghana for a planned diplomatic trip before the fires broke out, saying the fire chief did not call to warn her. Bass has faced backlash for not being in the city when the fires broke out.",
      "While she was removed from her position, Crowley will stay with the department, according to the LA Mayor's Office. Crowley exercised her civil service rights to stay with the department at a lower rank with duties to to be assigned by the new interim chief, the mayor's office said in a statement.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court appears likely to block a historic $10 billion lawsuit against U.S. gun makers brought by the government of Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "The justices are weighing immunity for firearm manufacturers.",
      "The Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared likely to block a historic $10 billion lawsuit against U.S. gun makers as both conservative and liberal justices raised concerns about allowing the government of Mexico to hold firearm manufacturers liable for cartel violence south of the border.",
      "Federal law grants broad immunity to the gun industry, in part to protect companies from costly litigation that could drive them out of business. Mexico alleges the law creates an exception for \"aiding and abetting\" the illicit sale and trafficking of guns, which the companies deny.",
      "Mexico has only one gun store but is awash in millions of American-made weapons, most funneled into the country by straw purchasers in the United States. The country claims the companies, including Smith & Wesson, Glock, Beretta and Colt, knowingly distribute and market their guns to be trafficked.",
      "By one estimate, at least 200,000 guns flow south of the border each year. The country is seeking $10 billion in damages and court-mandated safety requirements around the marketing and distribution of guns.",
      "\"The laws broken here are designed to keep guns out of criminals' hands. Those violations put guns in criminals' hands and those criminals harmed Mexico,\" Cate Stetson, Mexico's attorney, told the Supreme Court.",
      "\"These acts were foreseeable,\" she added. \"This court need not vouch for Mexico's allegations, but it must assume they are true. ... Mexico should be given a chance to prove its case.\"",
      "Many of the justices seemed unconvinced by Mexico's case should be allowed to move forward.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested the alleged harms from cartel violence roiling Mexico are too far removed from the manufacturers' decisions to distribute their products.",
      "\"We have repeatedly said mere knowledge is not enough [for liability],\" Sotomayor said. \"You have to aid and abet in some way. You have to intend and take affirmative action to ... participate in what they're doing.\"",
      "Justice Elena Kagan questioned what she perceived as a lack of specificity in Mexico's allegations.",
      "\"There are lots of [gun] dealers. And you're just saying [the gunmakers] know that some of them [engage in trafficking]. But which some of them? I mean, who are they aiding and abetting in this complaint?\" Kagan said.",
      "After Stetson alleged deliberate marketing of guns to cartels, Chief Justice John Roberts voiced skepticism of the claim.",
      "\"I mean, there are some people who want the experience of shooting a particular type of gun because they find it more enjoyable than using a BB gun,\" he said. \"And I just wonder exactly what the defendant, the manufacturer, is supposed to do in that situation. You say no, he shouldn't be marketing a particular legal firearm because they're going to go into Mexico at a higher percentage than others?\"",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh raised concern about the broader implications of a decision allowing Mexico's suit to go forward.",
      "\"What do you do with the suggestion on the other side ... that your theory of aiding and abetting liability would have destructive effects on the American economy in the sense that ... lots of sellers and manufacturers of ordinary products know that they're going to be misused by some subset of people?\" he asked. \"They know that to a certainty, that it's going to be pharmaceuticals, cars, what -- you can name lots of products. So that's a real concern, I think.\"",
      "Stetson replied, \"If you have a product manufacturer of a dangerous product that is alleged to have done all of the things knowing who they're selling to and what is being done with that product, then and only then, I think, that product manufacturer ... has a problem.\"",
      "More than 160,000 people in Mexico were killed by guns between 2015 and 2022, according to an analysis by Everytown for Gun Safety.",
      "A large majority of guns involved in the shootings came from U.S. border states. More than 40% of illegal guns seized in Mexico over a five-year period came from Texas, according to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report.",
      "In 2023 alone, more than 2,600 firearms were seized going south into Mexico, up 65% from the year before, according to the Department of Homeland Security, and 115,000 rounds of ammunition were captured headed the same direction, up 19% from 2022.",
      "A federal district court dismissed Mexico's case in 2022 citing immunity under federal law. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision in early 2024, saying Mexico had made a plausible case for liability under the law's exception.",
      "The Supreme Court is expected to decide by the end of June whether or not a liability case can move forward.",

    "story": [
      "Tariffs could raise prices for gasoline, avocados and iPhones.",
      "Tariffs long-promised by President Donald Trump's administration went into effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.",
      "The move impacts products from Mexico, Canada and China -- the three largest trading partners of the United States -- meaning that it could impact prices for everything from gasoline to avocados to iPhones.",
      "At the beginning of his second term, Trump set March 4 as the start date for 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariff on Chinese goods -- which, as of Tuesday, rises to 20%, per an amended executive order on Monday afternoon.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump confirmed that the tariffs would take effect the following day.",
      "The announcement sent major stock indexes plummeting on Monday. The S&P suffered its biggest loss since December, closing at 5,849.72 -- down 104.78 points or 1.76%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at\u00a043,191.24 down\u00a0649.67 points or\u00a01.48%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 2.64%.",
      "The deadline arrives roughly one month after Trump granted Mexico and Canada a reprieve from such tariffs, having reached agreements with the two countries regarding border security and drug trafficking.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the tariffs that have gone into effect.",
      "In recent days, Trump reaffirmed his commitment to placing tariffs on Canada and Mexico.",
      "On Feb. 27, Trump alleged that drugs had continued to enter the U.S. through Mexico and Canada despite agreements reached last month to address the issue.",
      "\u201cWe cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,\u201d Trump said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "Trump voiced similar concerns about Mexico and Canada ahead of the previous tariff deadline -- before ultimately pausing the measures.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Monday praised Mexico and Canada for their recent efforts to address border security, suggesting that the level of the tariffs remained uncertain.",
      "\u201c[Trump] is going to decide today \u2013 we're going to put it out tomorrow,\u201d Lutnick told CNN, describing the policymaking as a \"fluid situation.\"",
      "Trump then confirmed that the the fresh round of tariffs would take effect the following day.",
      "\"That will start,\" Trump said. \"They'll have to have tariffs.\"",
      "If the tariffs stay in place, price increases will be evident by Memorial Day, according to economist Mark Zandi, who also said that prices on food could start rising more quickly -- within weeks.",
      "Tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China could raise prices for a vast array of goods, experts previously told ABC News.",
      "Tariffs of this magnitude would likely increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers, experts said. The policy could hike prices for products ranging from tomatoes to tequila to auto parts.",
      "The Yale Budget Lab estimated in February that the tariffs could cost the average household up to $2,000 annually.",
      "Higher costs for car production could pose a challenge for U.S. automakers, many of which depend on a supply chain closely intertwined with Mexico and Canada.",
      "\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption\u00a0of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Gustavo Flores-Macias, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University, told ABC News in a statement.",
      "In a statement on Monday from the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents members like Ford and General Motors, AAPC President Matt Blunt said, \"Our American automakers, who invested billions in the U.S. to meet these requirements, should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce, while our competitors from outside of North America benefit from easy access to our home market.\u201d He called for an exemption from the tariffs for American automakers.",
      "Mexico and Canada account for 70% of U.S. crude oil imports, which make up a key input for the nation\u2019s gasoline supply, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a government agency.",
      "Trump previously said Canadian energy resources such as oil and gas would be subject to 10% tariffs, excluding the products from 25% tariffs faced by all other imports from the country.",
      "The U.S. imported $38.5 billion in agricultural goods from Mexico in 2023, making it the top recipient of such products, U.S Department of Agriculture data showed. Those imports include more than $3 billion worth of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Roughly 90% of avocados eaten in the U.S. last year originated in Mexico, USDA data showed. Other products with a high concentration of Mexican imports include tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, jalapenos, limes and mangos.",
      "The fresh tariffs may trigger retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "In anticipation of tariffs last month, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau threatened retaliatory tariffs on $155 billion worth of goods and urged Canadians to choose Canada-made products over their American counterparts. On Monday night, he reaffirmed that commitment, saying that Canada would start with \u201ctariffs on $30 billion worth of goods immediately and tariffs on the remaining $125 billion on American products in 21 days\u2019 time.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, and should U.S. tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures,\u201d Trudeau said in a statement.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Monday that imposing the tariffs would be an \"absolute disaster\" for both the U.S. and Canada. He added, in part, \u201cI don't want to respond but we will respond like they've never seen before.\"",
      "Ford warned if tariffs from the U.S. move forward, Canada will respond.",
      "\u201cWe keep the lights on in 1.5 million homes and manufacturing in New York, in Michigan and Minnesota. If he wants to destroy our economy and our families, I will shut down the electricity going down to the U.S. and I'm telling you we will do it,\u201d Ford said.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had instructed officials in her government to implement Plan B, \"which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters on Monday, Sheinbaum said recent talks between the U.S. had gone \"very well\" but that Mexico retains options if necessary.",
      "\"We are going to wait and see what happens,\" Sheinbaum said. \"In that, you need to have mettle, serenity and patience, and we have Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, Plan D, so we are going to wait for today.\"",
      "After Trump amended his executive order on Monday afternoon -- just hours before tariffs were meant to take effect -- effectively increasing China's tariffs by 10% for a total of 20%, a Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson responded with a statement calling the move a \u201ctypical unilateral and bullying behavior\u201d that will cause \u201cdamage to China-US economic and trade cooperation and the normal international trade order.\"",
      "\u201cChina hopes that the US will view and handle issues objectively and rationally and return to the right track of properly resolving differences through equal dialogue as soon as possible,\u201d the statement added.",

      "Democrats plan to counter that claim with a Democratic response from one of the Senate's newest members: Elissa Slotkin, a first-term senator from Michigan.",

      "Saying she's \"looking forward to speaking directly to the American people,\" she's promised a rebuttal to Trump's speech focused on economic and national security.",
      "\"The public expects leaders to level with them on what's actually happening in our country,\" Slotkin said in a statement announcing her speech last week. \"From our economic security to our national security, we've got to chart a way forward that actually improves people's lives in the country we all love, and I'm looking forward to laying that out.\"",
      "She is also expected to take on Trump and Elon Musk's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government. Democrats have invited a number of fired federal workers as their guests for the speech.",

      "\"You spend 10 years trying to defend your country in terms of honesty, integrity, and justice and then you come back and get copy and pasted the same email as 10,000 other people about performance,\" Lennox told ABC News.",
      "Slotkin's speech comes as Democrats look to collect themselves after a punishing 2024 campaign cycle that saw Trump handily defeat then-Vice President Kamala Harris' bid for the White House. Democrats didn't fare much better down ballot, losing control of the Senate and failing to recapture the House.",
      "As Democratic leadership tries to zero in on a new strategy to reach moderate voters, they're looking to beam the spotlight onto Slotkin, who pulled off a narrow win in purple Michigan this November, beating Republican nominee Mike Rogers, who had served seven terms in the House, in a race for the state's open Senate seat, even as Trump won Michigan by 80,000 votes.",
      "Her focus on reproductive rights and economic issues like lowering costs for families, coupled with her track record in the House, helped her eke out a narrow victory in the Senate race.

She occasionally voted across party lines and, in her earliest votes in the Senate, demonstrated a willingness to continue that bipartisan streak. She was one of 12 Democrats who voted in favor of the Republican-led Laken Riley Act earlier this year, helping to send the bill to Trump's desk.",

    "story": [
      "Experts weigh in on the scientific realities of the journey to the Red Planet.",
      "It\u2019s been a lofty goal America's leaders have set their sights on for generations, and President Donald Trump kicked off his second term by restating his goal of reaching the Red Planet.",
      "\"And we will pursue our Manifest Destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars,\" he said during his Jan. 20 inauguration speech.",
      "Elon Musk -- the CEO of space technology company SpaceX -- has the president's ear this time around, suggesting we'll see an even harder push to make the 140 million-mile journey to Mars.",
      "\"Can you imagine how awesome it will be to have American astronauts plant the flag on another planet for the first time?\" Musk said on Inauguration Day.",
      "It will take a herculean effort from NASA to make a mission to Mars a reality, experts told ABC News. It must build on the Artemis program -- which Trump established in 2017 to build a human presence on the moon -- to get people setting foot on Mars, according to NASA.",
      "\"NASA\u2019s current moon to Mars exploration approach calls for using missions on and around the moon under the Artemis campaign to prepare for future human missions to Mars,\" an agency spokesperson said in a statement sent to ABC News. \"We\u2019re looking forward to hearing more about the Trump administration's plans for our agency and expanding exploration for the benefit of all, including sending American astronauts on the first human mission to the Red Planet.\"",
      "However, the mission can't simply launch whenever the crews and technology are ready. Scott Hubbard ran the agency's Mars program from 2000 to 2001, served as director of its Ames Research Center for 4 years and was in executive management at NASA for 20 years.",
      "He noted that there are specific windows for when to launch the mission. When Earth and Mars align in their orbits around the sun, the distance and energy required for a spacecraft to travel to Mars are minimized.",
      "The next window is just a year and a half away.",
      "\"Even with the most powerful rockets we have, there is a window of 20 days every 26 months,\" he told ABC News. \"And that's it. I mean, it's literally be there or forget about it.\"",
      "Whenever the mission takes off, it will be an incredibly challenging endurance test filled with problems never encountered before, requiring a crew of astronauts daring enough to make the journey.",
      "Astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams have been getting a taste of that. The pair have been in space for nine months, with their planned 8-day trip to the International Space Station (ISS) getting an unexpected extension for safety reasons.",
      "\"So once we transitioned from not returning on our spacecraft, we transitioned into being a crew member, on the international crew, members on the International Space Station,\" Wilmore told ABC News. \"And that's what we've been doing since we've been here.\"",
      "Williams noted that this kind of flexibility will be key for anyone hoping to go to Mars.",
      "\"I'd say nothing goes as planned and be ready for that,\" she told ABC News. \"You know, a little challenge, a little adversity brings out the best in us.\"",
      "This experience may one day be useful to astronauts making the 7-month journey to Mars, their fellow ISS crew member Nick Hague told ABC News.",
      "\"You know, being up here, it's not about a singular mission. It's not about a singular trip to Mars,\" he said. \"We're part of a long legacy of exploration, of human exploration, of space, and we're doing our little part to try to advance that.\"",
      "The ISS crew is researching some of the logistical challenges that the long journey to Mars would present.",
      "\"How do we sustain ourselves? We can't pack all the resources we need on a trip to Mars and sustain a long mission,\" Hague said. \"So we're going to have to figure out how to grow the food that we're going to need.\"",
      "The astronauts would also need to be able to replace equipment that breaks during the trip.",
      "\"So you cannot take every single spare part with you,\" Wilmore said. \"You're going to have to have some way of additive manufacturing -- 3D printing.\"",
      "The trip would also expose astronauts to conditions that could lead to multiple health problems, including the potential risk of cancer and mental health issues, along with bone and muscle problems, space physiologist Rihana Bokhari told ABC News. Getting messages back to Earth could take a while as well, she noted.",
      "\"That communication delay is going to be quite large when it comes to Mars, about 20 minutes each way at the furthest,\" she said.",
      "Setting foot on the fourth planet from the sun may be the goal, but it's only half the battle. A round-trip mission would take at least three years.",
      "\"In addition to transportation, you need a habitat. We have not yet built a place for astronauts to live for the 6 or 7 months it would take to get there and have a really reliable life support,\" Hubbard, the former NASA Mars lead, told ABC News.",
      "Hubbard believes NASA should be thinking longer term for its first manned mission to Mars.",
      "\"Not all opportunities are equal,\" he said. \"And if you were to look out to 2033, you see an opportunity that comes only once every 15 years. You can get the most mass to Mars of any of these other 20-day windows.\"",
      "Considering the length of time for the window from now, Hubbard noted that the Apollo missions followed a similar timeline -- from the first tests in 1961 to Apollo 11 landing on the moon in 1969.",
      "\"And it's going to take not just technological advancement but political will,\" he said. \"It's going to take people to see that this is part of what we do as human beings.\"",

However, on Feb. 20, just five days away from his probation period ending and with a 6-month-old baby to take care of, he said he was unexpectedly fired.",
      "Over the past month, the Trump administration, through Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, has fired thousands of federal workers nationwide in the past month, in an effort, it claimed, to cut down on government waste. Among those who have lost their jobs are veterans, who make up about 28% of the federal worker labor force as of September 2024, according to federal data. As of Feb. 25, Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee said at least 6,000 veterans had been fired across the federal government.",
      "A spokesperson from the Office of Personnel Management, which has spearheaded the \"reduction in force\" effort across the government, said the \"OPM recognizes the dedication and service of all federal employees, including our veteran workforce, and remains committed to supporting them during this transition.\"",

      "\"We take good care of our veterans, so we're watching that very carefully,\" Trump said. \"We hope it's going to be a smaller number, but we are having great success in slimming down our government.\"",
      "On Tuesday, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly told ABC News, \"President Trump has consistently stood up for our brave men and women in uniform -- delivering crucial reforms that improved VA healthcare, decreased veteran homelessness and enhanced education benefits. His efforts to cut wasteful spending and make agencies more efficient will ensure our government can better serve all American families, especially our veterans.\"",
      "On Monday, Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., sent letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth requesting prioritization of veteran employment during workforce reduction.",
      "\"Many of these veterans already experience the daily challenges of transitioning to civilian life, and facing such layoffs only add to their undue burden,\" wrote Kiggans, whose district includes 196,000 veterans and 180,000 active-duty military and DOD employees.",
      "\u201cAs a former Navy helicopter pilot and a commonsense conservative, I believe we can responsibly rein in government waste while ensuring DoD personnel with prior military service remain in positions where they can continue to contribute to our national security,\" Kiggans told ABC News on Monday. \"We cannot allow much-needed reforms to the size and scope of the federal government to weaken our defense capabilities, especially as we face increasing threats around the globe from adversaries like China and Russia.\u201d",
      "An extension to their service",

      "\"It's disappointing to me that all the work we did to improve veterans' lives is being thrown down the drain,\" he said. \"As a veteran advocate who's fought for and worked to make sure I can go to a veteran in need and say, 'Here is a job for you, so you can live the American dream you fought for,' and then come to find out everything I told them was a lie -- I feel like I betrayed myself.\"",
      "D'Alatri said he was advancing greatly in the company and that he had a glowing midyear performance review. He said he was in the middle of the workday when his manager called him to tell him his name was on a list of people to be fired as a result of the federal cuts. In about an hour, following his manager's instructions, he reported to the office, turned in his equipment and was escorted out of his office building.",
      "D'Alatri said he believes he had gone above and beyond in his role. When he was given three months of parental leave when his baby was born, he said he only took one month out of concern he'd fall behind. He noted that his job loss has forced his wife to end maternity leave early and return to full-time work.",
      "\"I worked tirelessly for the past year. I never called out once. This just comes as a shock to me because the feedback I was getting from the people I worked for was great,\" he said. \"A few years back, I proved my loyalty. I love this country -- we are the backbone of this country. It's really hurtful and it's sad because I love this country so much.\"",
      "Attig said he believes the government has much to lose by firing veterans in the federal workforce.",
      "\"They lose someone who is dedicated to this country, someone who at a very young age, they raised their right hand to say, I am going to give my life for this country. When they entered the civil service after their military service, they raised their same right hand and said they're going to pledge to uphold the Constitution,\" he said.",
      "\"Most importantly, you take away someone who truly cares about their country, someone who is using their federal work as a second service,\" he added.",
      "Lyndsay Butts is a disabled veteran who served in the Air Force and was an executive assistant at the U.S. Forest Service in Cedar City, Utah. She, too, was terminated when her probation period was nearing completion -- it was set to end on March 9.",
      "'It feels like a slap in the face'",
      "\"Those of us that are veterans wrote a blank check for our lives and said, 'Use me how you can to support this country.' It feels like a slap in the face to not even have the opportunity to defend my job. It feels like a slap in the face that my brothers and sisters in arms have been treated the same way,\" she said.",
      "\"I sacrificed a part of my life and I have lasting baggage from that experience, and you're just going to get rid of me?\" she added. \"Throw me away like a piece of garbage? It hurts.\"",
      "Butts said she worries the firings in her agency will cause a huge lack of services to forests and the people who enjoy them. Everything from toilets to trails won't be adequately cleaned and maintained, firewood permits won't be sold and campgrounds may not open, she said.",
      "\"They didn't bring anyone down to ask us, 'What do you need? What don't you need?' They have no idea how we operate,\" she said. \"I just want my job back. I want my job back because my job is needed. I know my job is important.\"",
      "Bill to reinstate veterans unlikely to pass",
      "To combat the uncertainty these firings have caused veterans across the country, Rep. Derek Tran, D-Calif., an Army veteran, introduced a bill to reinstate veterans fired from the federal government under Trump. The bill, titled the Protect Veteran Jobs Act, would also require federal agencies to submit reports to Congress on the veteran dismissals and provide clear justifications for termination. D'Alatri sought help from Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., who is a co-sponsor of this bill, and he will be Courtney's special guest at Trump's joint address to Congress Tuesday night, Courtney announced.",
      "However, the bill is unlikely to pass in the Republican-led House.",
      "\"I've spoken to some Republicans on the other side of the aisle. They've shared they think it's a great bill but this is not the right time for them to jump into something like this,\" Tran told ABC News. \"Probably because of what's going on with the administration or fear of retaliation on their part, but that's me speculating.\"",
      "He said he believes the best way people can help veterans is by supporting the bill.",
      "\"Veterans bring incredible value and expertise to our federal government and provide essential services to American families and service members,\" Tran said. \"It is critical we protect the livelihoods of veterans who have served our country honorably and who continue to do so through civilian service. Our veterans have always had our backs, and now it's time we step up to have theirs.\"",
      "On Thursday, Feb. 27, Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a combat veteran who serves on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, held a town hall for veterans concerned about federal terminations.",
      "\"Let's call Trump and Musk's DOGE cuts what they are: They're a middle finger to our veterans, and they're a slap in the face to the sacrifices they've made,\" Duckworth said. \"Trump and unelected billionaire Elon Musk may not know the first thing about sacrifice and service, but our veterans sure as hell do. We will not be quiet, and I will never stop working to honor the commitment we've made to our nation's heroes.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Duckworth said the Department of Veterans Affairs was working to rehire several employees who worked on the Veterans Crisis Line after she raised concerns alongside Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.",
      "\"Now, after I raised these cases to the VA and spoke out about them, it sounds like, thankfully, at least some of these employees will be rehired,\" she added.",

    "story": [
      "Former Mesa County, Colo. clerk Tina Peters was sentenced to 9 years in prison.",
      "The Justice Department on Monday filed a highly unusual motion stating its intent to review a state-level conviction of a Trump ally who was sentenced to nine years in prison for leading a security breach of her county's elections computer system following the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Former Mesa County, Colorado, clerk Tina Peters was sentenced last October for giving an individual affiliated with MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, an ally of President Donald Trump who amplified false election claims, access to election software she used for her county. Screenshots of the software later appeared on right-wing websites that in turn used it to further promote baseless claims of voter fraud.",
      "Early last month, Peters filed a motion with the federal district court in Colorado seeking to challenge her guilty verdict.",
      "On Monday, the senior acting head of the Justice Department's Civil Division, Yaakov Roth, filed a statement of interest with the court, urging a judge to give \"prompt and careful consideration\" to concerns Peters' counsel has raised about her case.",
      "\"Reasonable concerns have been raised about various aspects of Ms. Peters\u2019 case,\" Roth said in the filing. \"Accordingly, the United States respectfully submits that the concerns raised in the Application warrant \u2013 at the very least \u2013 prompt and careful consideration by this Court (and, at the appropriate time, the Colorado appellate courts).\"",
      "The Justice Department does not have the legal authority to unilaterally overturn state-level convictions. However, some critics have expressed concerns that such intervention highlights a troubling willingness by Trump-appointed officials at the Department of Justice to aid allies of the president, while also raising the prospect of retribution against his political opponents.",
      "Roth's filing further states that Peters' case fits into a broader review underway at the Justice Department of \"cases across the nation\" that the filing argues may be \"abuses of the criminal justice process.\"",
      "\"This review will include an evaluation of the State of Colorado\u2019s prosecution of Ms. Peters and, in particular, whether the case was 'oriented more toward inflicting political pain than toward pursuing actual justice or legitimate governmental objectives,'\u201d the filing stated.",
      "\"Nothing about the prosecution of Ms. Peters was politically motivated,\" Mesa County District Attorney Daniel Rubinstein said in response to an ABC News request for comment. \"In one of the most conservative jurisdictions in Colorado, the same voters who elected Ms. Peters, also elected the Republican District Attorney who handled the prosecution, and the all-Republican Board of County Commissioners who unanimously requested the prosecution of Ms. Peters on behalf of the citizens she victimized.\"",
      "\"Ms. Peters was indicted by a grand jury of her peers, and convicted at trial by the jury of her peers that she selected,\" Rubenstein said.",

    "summary": "Small, independent businesses make up 70% of the restaurants in Texas. As tariffs on Mexico go into effect, they are among the first to shoulder the burden..",
    "story": [
      "Small, independent businesses make up 70% of the restaurants in Texas.",
      "Emily Williams Knight, president and CEO of the Texas Restaurant Association, represents 58,000 restaurants that employ 1.5 million Texans. That breaks down to 11% of the state's workforce that could potentially be impacted by the 25% tariffs on Mexican imports that just went into effect.",
      "All Tuesday morning she was on calls and in meetings, calming fears because people believe Texas will feel the brunt of this first -- And, after that, the domino effect will be fast.",
      "\"Exhausted and afraid: Those are the words I keep hearing from people,\" Williams Knight said. \"They're running out of levers to pull here, and they're afraid. If this is a sustained tariff policy -- what that will mean to their business long term? The unpredictability comes with a tremendous cost.\"",
      "One of those concerned businesses is Texas Cafe in Rio Grande City, which has been serving South Texas for more than 85 years and was recently certified as a historical landmark by the State of Texas. People travel from all over the country to try their signature dish, Envueltos: A special chile-con-carne filling rolled up in a tortilla. But don't call it an enchilada or the owner, Becky Garza, will scold you profusely.",
      "\"These are my grandfather's recipes that he invented back in 1939,\" she said. \"And when you change something, people notice. Especially Hispanic people.\"",
      "Garza is getting ready for Cuaresma, or 40 days of Lent. It is essential that she gets very specific ingredients from Mexico for this time of year or her customers will know something isn't right. Plain and simple: Her business, livelihood and family legacy depend on imports from Mexico that play an essential role in the food she serves. And now, she said, all of that is going to cost more because of the new tariffs.",
      "\"I can buy stuff from Mexico cheap and use it in my home. But I can't use any of those products from Mexico in my business unless I buy them from a store that follows FDA guidelines. I buy Mexican cokes. I get cinnamon sticks. These are a very high-price now and sometimes hard to find. I get pilonsios. Chile guajillo for menudo. And avocados from Mexico are better -- the real avocados from Mexico that you can only find in small stores. But boy, they are expensive, and it's only going to get worse,\" Garza explained, adding: \"I will not stop getting these items from Mexico, because I don't want to change the consistency or the quality.\"",
      "Garza has seen prices steadily increasing over the last few years. In 2024, she spent around $1,000 for her specialty Cuaresma items. But in 2025, she spent $1,200 -- a 20% increase that may not seem like a lot to big retail chains, but is huge for small business owners like Garza.",
      "Knight wholeheartedly agrees, saying, \"In the last four years we've seen a 35% increase in the cost of food needed in these restaurants and a 36% increase in labor. That's not even including the big swipe fees businesses are paying, plus the increases to rent and utilities.\"",
      "Over the last 30 days, TRA has worked closely with the National Restaurant Association on a strategy to help mitigate the uncertainty. They've suggested restaurants review their menus and supply chain, looking for ways to source things closer to their businesses. They've also encouraged businesses to keep pushing the value of their service and products. And, before these tariffs went into effect, they reached out to lawmakers to educate them on the impact and push for exemptions.",
      "\"It feels like we are in this very unknown space again,\" Williams Knight said.",
      "Small, independent businesses make up 70% of the restaurants in Texas.",
      "So, while both big and small establishments will be impacted, Williams Knight said she worries that this will create a ripple effect that could drive some families to close up shop.",
      "She said that some of their restaurants are already starting to get emails from suppliers about costs going up, and she compared the feeling to a few days after the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown was announced, explaining: \"You're going to see a very large number of closures and then a large number of people unemployed.\"",
      "For years, as prices have gone up, Garza has found a way to cut back and save so she doesn't have to charge customers more. In fact, she's been working a second, primary job that sustains her own day-to-day needs, opting not to take a real paycheck from Texas Cafe. But she\u2019s retiring in June and having to think about her future.And for the first time since she's taken over the restaurant, Garza made the tough decision on Tuesday to raise prices.",
      "\"I had a meeting with my waitress and we're going up on the breakfast menu due to the high price of eggs,\" Garza explained. \"I save money and I am frugal. But right now it's been getting difficult.\"",
      "Not wanting to manifest any other difficulties the restaurant may face in the future, she said that's all she's willing to do and talk about for now.",
      "However, there are indicators that the tariff policies that went into effect Tuesday may not affect small businesses as extremely as some are predicting, or their customers, for too long.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration could announce a pathway for tariff relief on Mexican and Canadian goods covered by the North America Free Trade Agreement as soon as Wednesday, according to an interview with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Fox Business on Tuesday.",

      "Republicans in Congress are taking aim at four cities over their policies limiting cooperation with immigration enforcement under Preident Donald Trump's administation",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans in Congress are taking aim at four cities \u2014 often called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d \u2014 over their policies limiting cooperation with immigration enforcement with a hearing this week that comes as President Donald Trump presses ahead with his campaign of mass deportations.",
      "Mayors Michelle Wu of Boston, Brandon Johnson of Chicago, Mike Johnston of Denver and Eric Adams of New York are set to appear Wednesday in front of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.",
      "There\u2019s no strict definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE enforces U.S. immigration laws nationwide but seeks state and local help, particularly for large-scale deportations, requesting that police and sheriffs alert them to people it wants to deport and hold them until federal officers take custody.",
      "But some cities and states say cooperating with ICE means victims of crime and witnesses who aren\u2019t in the U.S. legally won\u2019t come forward. And, to varying degrees, officials argue that they want their localities to be welcoming places for immigrants.",
      "Courts have repeatedly upheld the legality of most sanctuary laws. But Trump administration officials have targeted sanctuary policies right out of the gate in his second term, seeing them as a key impediment to deporting people in the large numbers he wants. The administration has sued Chicago and Illinois as well as New York state over various immigration laws.",
      "Here's a look at the immigration policies and migration trends of the cities whose mayors will appear Wednesday:",
      "The city's Trust Act generally restricts how much the police can cooperate with ICE, although it does allow some cooperation with a division called Homeland Security Investigations when it comes to such issues as combating human trafficking or drug and weapons trafficking.",
      "The city also must follow a 2017 ruling by the state\u2019s highest court that forbids Massachusetts authorities from holding a person otherwise entitled to release from custody based solely on a federal request.",
      "Those requests, called detainers, typically ask federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies to give at least 48 hours\u2019 notice before suspected immigrants are released from jail \u2014 or to hold them for up to 48 hours after they would normally be released so ICE can pick them up. Otherwise, ICE must go out into the community to arrest them.",
      "Trump\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan, hammered Boston\u2019s police commissioner and promised to go to Boston and \u201cbring hell\" with him.",
      "That has not sat well in Boston.",
      "Wu, a Democrat up for reelection this year, said that it was \u201cclueless\u201d and \u201cinsulting\u201d for Homan to attack the police commissioner and that she wants Boston be a welcoming place for immigrants.",
      "Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden said handing over defendants makes it harder to gain cooperation from immigrants when investigating crimes.",
      "Chicago has some of the country\u2019s strongest immigrant protections, barring cooperation between federal agents and city employees, including police.",
      "The nation\u2019s third-largest city became a sanctuary location in the 1980s and has amped up its policies multiple times since. That includes a 2012 ordinance that bars federal agents from accessing city resources in assisting with immigration operations.",
      "City officials beefed up protections after Trump first took office in 2017 and again in 2020, when it required police to document requests for assistance from federal agents. Illinois also has protections allowing anyone, regardless of immigration status, to get a driver's license.",
      "Mayor Brandon Johnson, who took office in 2023, inherited a migrant crisis his first year. Short on shelter space, Chicago\u2019s leaders used police station lobbies, airports, parked buses and hotels to house asylum-seekers.",
      "At its height, roughly 15,000 migrants lived in dozens of temporary shelters, although the city has shuttered those as the number of people arriving decreased.",
      "There have been a handful of City Council attempts to weaken Chicago\u2019s sanctuary protections, but they have been unsuccessful in the Democratic-leaning city.",
      "Johnson has defended the policies.",
      "\u201cWe welcome all individuals and families who want to work, live and thrive here in our beloved city,\u201d Johnson said in late January.",
      "Denver became a hub for immigrants coming across the U.S.-Mexico border, with the city seeing arrivals of 43,000 over the last two years.",
      "Mayor Mike Johnston struggled to cobble together the resources to house and feed them, gouging parts of the city budget and pleading with the federal government alongside other mayors for funding, which only partially came.",
      "The spotlight ratcheted up when a video of armed men in an apartment building in the Denver suburb of Aurora went viral, prompting then-candidate Trump to claim that the city of some 400,000 people was overrun by a Venezuelan gang.",
      "The idea was swiftly repudiated by local officials, but the limelight stayed on Colorado.",
      "In early February, heavily armed federal agents in masks and armored vehicles appeared across the metro area. The results of the operation are unclear, and Homan said news media leaks hindered the raids.",
      "The mayor has repeated that he wants Denver to be a welcoming place while drawing the line at those who commit violent crimes.",
      "Last month, Denver Public Schools became the first district to sue the Trump administration over its policy allowing ICE immigration agents in schools.",
      "In New York City, an estimated 231,000 immigrants have arrived since 2022 \u2014 at a cost that the city estimates to be more than $7 billion for shelters, food, security and legal support.",
      "Last month, the city sued the Trump administration over $80.6 million in reimbursements for congressionally approved immigrant aid after officials paid the money and then clawed it back.",
      "As in other cities, New York's immigrant arrivals have fallen dramatically over the past year.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams continues to voice support for policies that ensure all residents have access to social services regardless of immigration status.",
      "But Adams wants to roll back policies prohibiting city employees from working with immigration enforcement, saying he wants to \u201cremove dangerous people from our streets.\u201d He's also called on the City Council to make changes allowing New York to honor ICE detainer requests to hold people in jails beyond their release dates. And he's invited ICE agents to work out of the Rikers Island city jail.",

      "Mississippi\u2019s first Black lawmaker of the 20th century died Tuesday",
      "LEXINGTON, Miss. -- Robert G. Clark, who was elected in 1967 as Mississippi's first Black lawmaker of the 20th century and rose to the second-highest leadership role in the state House of Representatives, died Tuesday at age 96, his son said.",
      "Rep. Bryant Clark, who succeeded Robert Clark, said his father died of natural causes at home in Holmes County, north of Jackson.",
      "A teacher and descendant of slaves, Clark was ostracized during his first years at the state Capitol, relegated to sitting solo at a two-person desk in the House chamber and ignored by white colleagues at social events.",
      "By the time he left office 36 years later, he had served as chairman of both the House Ethics Committee and the powerful Education Committee. In a state where nearly 40% of residents are Black, he saw more Black candidates win seats as voting rights were enforced and more majority-Black districts were drawn, sometimes under court order.",
      "Clark also won the respect and support of colleagues, Black and white, who elected him in January 1992 to House speaker pro tempore, a position he retained until he retired in 2004.",
      "Clark was among five activists and elected officials honored in February 2018 during a black-tie-optional gala at the newly opened Mississippi Civil Rights Museum.",
      "The glitzy event was a lifetime away from Clark\u2019s hardscrabble early days, when most of his relatives worked in cotton fields on family land in Holmes County. As a small child, he would sit by the side of the field with his elderly grandfather, William Clark, who was born a slave and shared vivid memories of deprivation.",
      "\u201cHe had never owned a pair of pants or shoes until after slavery,\u201d Robert Clark told The Associated Press in a 2018 interview. \u201cTheir feed was poured over to them in a trough just like we feed hogs, and they had to get down and eat the best way they could.\u201d",
      "That grandfather's wisdom, he said, helped give him the sense of self to become a leader.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d throw a hand of corn over and the chickens would be eating. I\u2019d throw another hand of corn over there, and chickens would leave that hand of corn and run to another hand,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd I asked him, \u2018Grandpa, why them old crazy chickens got corn and just run to the other corn?\u2019 He said, \u2018Young man, they\u2019re just following the crowd.\u2019 And he said, \u2018That\u2019s something I never want you to do.\u2018",
      "\u201cAnd from feeding the chickens, that became a part of me \u2014 not just following the group.\u201d",
      "Clark went to Michigan to earn a master\u2019s degree in education, and then fulfilled a promise he had made to older relatives by returning to the family land in Mississippi. As a teacher and coach, he often went into his athletes\u2019 homes.",
      "\u201cI realized many of the parents could not help their children with the lessons,\u201d Clark said. \u201cAnd I went to the superintendent of education to ask him if he would implement an adult education program. And he told me, \u2018No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the best interest of the county to do that.\u2019\u201d",
      "After the all-white local school board denied Clark's request to start the program that would primarily help Black adults, he announced his candidacy for that board. Maneuvering to keep a Black man off the board, the local state representative got a change in state law to make that school board appointed rather than elected. Rather than accept defeat, Clark ran against that representative, and made history by winning.",
      "Because Black people were generally not accepted in the Democratic Party that controlled Mississippi, Clark\u2019s family had belonged to what they called the \u201cBlack and Tan\" segment of the Republican Party when he was a child. With allegiances flipping in the late 1960s, he ran his first legislative race as an independent. Only later would he run, and win, as a Democrat.",
      "On inauguration day in January 1968, Clark didn\u2019t know if he would be allowed to take his oath. The white candidate he defeated had filed a complaint claiming he didn't live in Holmes County, where his family had lived for generations.",
      "Clark arrived at the Capitol with his attorney, Marian Wright, who later founded the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, a national advocacy group for the poor. They were standing near a statue of the late Theodore Bilbo, an arch-segregationist who had served as Mississippi governor and U.S. senator, when they were told about 10 minutes before the ceremony that Clark would be sworn in.",
      "The ornate House chamber, with marble walls and stained-glass windows, was filled with two-person oak desks where seatmates swapped gossip and often became fast friends. In January 1968, in deeply segregated Mississippi, the senior member of Clark\u2019s local legislative delegation decreed that Clark would sit by himself.",
      "The isolation extended to group dinners for legislators: \u201cNobody would sit with me,\u201d Clark said.",
      "Sitting alone at tables set for six or eight created a dilemma, he recalled: \"I very shortly went up to 240 pounds. I didn\u2019t intend to gain weight. I just wasn\u2019t going to leave all that food on the table.\u201d",
      "Clark and his first wife, Essie, had two sons \u2014 Robert G. Clark III and Wandrick Bryant Clark. She died of cancer in 1977, and he raised their sons as a widower, homeschooling them and taking them to the state Capitol while the Legislature was in session.",
      "About 19 years after her death, Clark married Jo Ann Ross. In 2003, he chose not to seek re-election, and the seat was won by his second son. Bryant Clark also continued to practice law. Robert G. Clark III, meanwhile, served as a chancery judge in four counties.",

      "The Houthis have targeted more than 100 merchant vessels in the critical trade corridor with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023. In January, the group signaled that it will limit its attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships after a ceasefire began in the Gaza Strip but warned wider assaults could resume if needed.",
      "Trump\u2019s first Republican administration had similarly designated the Houthis in its waning days, but the designation had been revoked by President Joe Biden's Democratic administration over concerns it would badly affect the delivery of aid to Yemen, which was considered to be facing one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises.",
      "The United Nations said last month that it suspended its humanitarian operations in the stronghold of Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels after they detained eight more U.N. staffers.",
      "The rebels in recent months have detained dozens of U.N. staffers, as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the once-open U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen\u2019s capital. None of the U.N. staffers has been released.",
      "The Iranian-backed Houthis have been fighting Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they descended from their stronghold in Saada and took control of Sanaa and most of the north."

    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance says a U.S.-Ukraine critical minerals deal is a more practical deterrent against Russia than an international security force for post-war Ukraine proposed by key allies Britain and France",
      "WASHINGTON -- Vice President JD Vance is making the case that a U.S.-Ukraine critical minerals deal is a more practical deterrent against Russian President Vladimir Putin than an international security force for post-war Ukraine proposed by key allies Britain and France.",
      "Vance said in an interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s Sean Hannity aired Monday evening that the pact that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s critical minerals \u201cis a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn\u2019t fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\u201d",
      "The comments throw the spotlight again on differences between President Donald Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. The European leaders have called for a post-conflict peacekeeping force in Ukraine to prevent Russia invading again if Moscow and Kyiv reach a truce to put a stop to Russia's invasion, launched in February 2022.",
      "\u201cThe president knows that, look, if you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine,\u201d Vance added.",
      "The Republican vice president did not mention any particular country in his skeptical comments to Hannity about the effectiveness of a potential peacekeeping mission. But in a posting on X on Tuesday, Vance looked to head off any criticism by noting that Britain and France \u201chave fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years, and beyond.\u201d",
      "French troops deployed to Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. And British troops have served alongside American forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and in a U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State group.",
      "Vance's comments came in an interview recorded hours before a White House official confirmed on Monday evening that Trump directed a pause of U.S. assistance to Ukraine as he seeks to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to engage in negotiations to end the war with Russia.",
      "Trump remains frustrated with Zelenskyy. He again criticized the Ukrainian leader on Monday after Zelenskyy said that reaching an agreement with Russia to end the conflict likely \u201cis still very, very far away.\u201d",
      "Trump administration and Ukrainian officials, during Zelenskyy\u2019s White House visit last week, had been expected to sign off on a deal that would have given the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s critical minerals in part to pay back the U.S. for aid it has sent Kyiv since the start of the war.",
      "But that plan was scrapped as the visit was ended abruptly after Trump and Vance had a heated exchange with Zelenskyy during Oval Office talks at the start of the visit.",
      "Ukraine is believed to have deposits of strategically important minerals \u2014 including titanium. lithium and manganese \u2014 that could be useful for American aerospace, electric vehicle and medical manufacturing.",
      "Trump hasn't given up all hope of reaching an agreement. And the White House has billed such a pact as a way to tighten U.S.-Ukrainian relations in the long term.",
      "Trump on Monday called the proposal \u201ca great deal\u201d for the U.S. and Ukraine and signaled that he would speak to it during his Tuesday address before a joint session of Congress.",
      "Starmer says that \"a mineral deal is not enough on its own\u201d to ensure Ukraine's security. The British prime minister has no illusions about U.S. troops taking part in a potential peacekeeping mission.",
      "Starmer, who met with Trump last week, and others are trying to make the case to Trump that the plan can only work with a U.S. backstop for European forces on the ground \u2014 through U.S. aerial intelligence, surveillance and support, as well as rapid-response cover in case of breaches of a truce."

      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments in a $10 billion lawsuit Mexico filed against top U.S. firearm manufacturers, alleging their business practices have fueled cartel gun violence there",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday in a $10 billion lawsuit Mexico filed against top firearm manufacturers in the U.S., alleging their business practices have fueled cartel gun violence.",
      "The gun makers reject those claims. They appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn a ruling that let the lawsuit move forward even though U.S. law largely shields gun makers from lawsuits.",
      "Depending on how the court rules, it could also affect a narrow legal path that helped families of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School secure a $73 million settlement from the gun maker Remington.",
      "Here's what to know about the case:",
      "Mexico has strict gun laws and has just one store where people can legally buy firearms. But thousands of guns are smuggled in by the country\u2019s powerful drug cartels.",
      "The Mexican government says 70% of those weapons come from the United States. The lawsuit claims that companies knew weapons were being sold to traffickers who smuggled them into Mexico and decided to cash in on that market.",
      "The defendants include big-name manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson, Beretta, Colt and Glock. The lawsuit is still in its early stages, and if the court does side with Mexico it would still have to prove the allegations.",
      "The gun makers say there is no evidence the industry allows trafficking and they disagree with Mexico's data about how many weapons originate in the U.S. The Mexican government, not U.S. gun makers, is responsible for enforcing the laws and fighting crime, they argue.",
      "The industry is shielded from most civil lawsuits arising from crimes committed using firearms under a 20-year-old law, though Mexico has argued that it doesn't apply to crimes committed outside of the U.S.",
      "The gun companies are asking the justices to overturn an appeals court ruling that allowed the case to move forward.",
      "The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found it fell under an exception to the shield law for situations in which firearm companies are accused of knowingly violating the law.",
      "That exception has come up in other cases.",
      "The victims of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook argued it applied to their lawsuit because the gun maker had violated state law in the marketing of the AR-15 rifle used on the shooting, in which 20 first graders and six educators were killed.",
      "The Supreme Court declined to hear that case. After reaching the $73 million settlement, the families said they hoped it would lead to more safety and accountability.",
      "Depending on how the justices rules, their eventual findings could narrow or close that legal path.",

      "For the second year in a row, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg gave the most to charitable causes, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy\u2019s exclusive Philanthropy 50 list of the Americans who donated the largest sums to nonprofits last year.",
      "In 2024, he gave a total of $3.7 billion to support arts, education, the environment, public-health groups, and programs aimed at improving city governments. He gives directly to charities and through his Bloomberg Philanthropies, which last year awarded a $1 billion grant to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, to make medical school free and to provide financial aid to nursing and public health students.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never understood people who wait until they die to give away their wealth. Why deny yourself the satisfaction?\u201d he wrote in an email to the Chronicle. \u201cI\u2019ve been very lucky, and I\u2019m determined to do what I can to open doors for others and to leave a better world for my children and grandchildren.\u201d",
      "Bloomberg was one of six donors who gave $1 billion or more in 2024. The others were Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings and his wife, Patty Quillin (No. 2), Dell Technologies founder Michael Dell and his wife, Susan Dell (No. 3), investor Warren Buffett (No. 4), Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, physician Priscilla Chan (No. 5), and retired professor Ruth Gottesman (No. 6).",
      "The majority of those gifts went to foundations and donor-advised funds that support causes including education, economic mobility, social justice, and scientific research. Gottesman, like Bloomberg, gave to make medical school free. She donated $1 billion to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.",
      "Together the 50 donors on the list contributed a total of $16.2 billion to charity in 2024. The median amount they gave was $100 million.",
      "While those numbers are sizable, not all of the nation\u2019s wealthiest people appear on the list. Only 19 of the richest Americans on the Forbes 400 list donated enough to appear in the Philanthropy rankings.",
      "Among those who gave big \u2014 but are less well known:",
      "\u2014 Thomas Golisano, the billionaire founder of Paychex, is No. 8. He gave away $500 million last year. Almost $400 million of that went to 123 nonprofits in New York and Florida with no strings attached. About 90 of those gifts were $1 million to $5 million, often to small groups that rarely get contributions of that size. Many were to organizations that serve people with developmental, intellectual, and physical disabilities. The issue has great meaning to Golisano, whose son has a developmental disability.",
      "\u2014 Retired insurance executive Hyatt Brown and his wife, Cici, at No. 20, gave the Museum of Arts & Sciences, in Daytona Beach, Fla., $150 million for a new building and to turn its current home into a children\u2019s museum.",
      "\u2014 Businesswoman and venture capital investor Michele Kang, at No. 28, gave $84 million last year, including $4 million to help the USA Women\u2019s Rugby Sevens team prepare for the Olympics.",
      "Some big public debates have been swirling in the world of philanthropy. Some donors \u2014 most notably hedge-fund billionaire Bill Ackman \u2014 pushed back against the institutions they have supported, criticizing universities\u2019 responses to the October 7 attacks in Israel and campus protests against the war in Gaza; critiquing diversity, equity, and inclusion programs; demanding changes; and pledging to halt support.",
      "Some philanthropists believe that politicized public debates about giving are unhelpful noise that can get in the way of doing effective work. K. Lisa Yang (No. 34), a retired investment banker, gave $74.5 million this year, much of that to MIT and Cornell University, where she is a trustee.",
      "Over the years, Yang has given large sums to programs that help people who are physically or cognitively disabled, and she advocates for individuals with disabilities and autism-spectrum disorders.",
      "\u201cThe people who are suffering from these disorders, they don\u2019t have the luxury of time,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you have a rare disease and they do politics, to the people who are suffering from the disorder, it is totally irrelevant. They\u2019re still suffering.\u201d",
      "But some donors are loath to get ensnared in high-profile polarizing issues, says Renee Kaplan, CEO of the donor advisory firm Forward Global. As a result, she says, some donors are staying out of the fray by making anonymous gifts. Others are working together in donor collaboratives, both to boost their power and resources and to shield individual contributors from criticism.",
      "Donors are starting to say, \u201cI\u2019ll do more anonymously. I\u2019m not going to put my name on things. I\u2019m going to slow down our foundation for a while because I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll be a target,\u201d Kaplan says. \u201cI think there\u2019s genuine concern and pause and fear that\u2019s affecting donors.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s list marks the 25th anniversary of the Philanthropy 50 ranking. Buffett was the top donor over that period, with cumulative gifts totaling $49.4 billion. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates followed, with the $34 billion they gave together. (Since their divorce, both have appeared on the list individually.) Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk round out the top five.",
      "Buffett, Gates and French Gates, and Bloomberg together account for roughly one-third of the $314.5 billion in giving by Philanthropy 50 donors since 2000. The biggest gift made during that time is Buffett\u2019s 2006 pledge to the Gates Foundation, valued at the time at $36.1 billion.",

Thunderstorms and winds up to 60 mph (100 kph) are expected throughout Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. In neighboring Jefferson Parish, officials canceled parades.",
      "The city\u2019s two biggest parades \u2014 hosted by the social clubs Krewe of Zulu and Krewe of Rex \u2014 moved up their start times, shortened their routes and are going without marching bands, New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters Monday. The parades were required to wrap up by 11:30 a.m. Tuesday to avoid worsening weather.",

      "Food and Drug Administration nominee Dr. Marty Makary is known for his contrarian views and fiery criticism of traditional medical institutions",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Marty Makary rose to national attention by skewering the medical establishment in books and papers and bashing the federal response to COVID-19 on TV.",
      "Now the Johns Hopkins University surgeon and researcher has been nominated to lead the Food and Drug Administration. The agency \u2014 responsible for regulating products ranging from toothpaste to vaccines \u2014 is famously understated, issuing carefully worded statements devoid of opinion or scientific speculation.",
      "That's the opposite approach of Makary, whose sweeping rhetoric and biting criticism often veer into hyperbole, according to a review of recent speeches, interviews and podcast appearances by The Associated Press.",
      "Makary has called the U.S. food supply \u201cpoison,\u201d says the federal government is the \u201cgreatest perpetrator of misinformation\u201d about COVID-19 and regularly suggests that pesticides, fluoride and overuse of antibiotics may be to blame for rising rates of infertility, attention deficit disorder and other health conditions. He\u2019ll appear Thursday before a Senate panel considering his nomination.",
      "Makary\u2019s views align with those of the man who would be his boss: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who built a following by sowing doubts about vaccines, ultraprocessed foods and fluoride. Notably, Makary has never embraced Kennedy\u2019s discredited idea that vaccines might cause autism.",
      "Experts who have worked with Makary say his contrarian approach could be useful at FDA \u2014 but only if he\u2019s able to resist political pressure from Kennedy and others on hot-button issues like vaccines.",
      "\u201cHe has this reputation of being someone who cares about evidence and transparency,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran of Yale University, who was part of an informal research group with Makary. \u201cThe question is whether he\u2019s going to preserve and defend the integrity of the agency or is he going to fall in line with the administration.\u201d",
      "Makary did not respond to an AP interview request.",
      "Trained as a pancreatic surgeon, Makary\u2019s initial work focused on uncontroversial topics like hospital costs and surgical checklists.",
      "In 2016, he made headlines with a paper stating that medical errors were \u201cthe third leading cause of death in the U.S.\u201d That conclusion was quickly disputed by other experts, who said the paper\u2019s death estimate was ten times higher than more rigorous reviews.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary reached a much broader audience as a regular on Fox News, where he opposed vaccine mandates and called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Makary often directs his harshest criticism toward the \u201cmedical hubris\u201d of fellow doctors, as in his latest book \u201cBlind Spots,\u201d which catalogues a number of cases where experts \u201cgot the science perfectly backwards.\u201d",
      "For example, he examines early recommendations that parents delay giving babies peanut-based foods due to allergy risks. Today, pediatricians generally recommend earlier introduction to prevent food allergies.",
      "Many researchers view such examples differently.",
      "\u201cThese are cases of people doing the best they can with evolving information and needing to make decisions along the way,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School. \u201cAs commissioner, he\u2019s going to have to be OK with making decisions based on evolving evidence \u2014 and some of those decisions might be wrong.\u201d",
      "Like others in Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, Makary says many of the chronic health problems afflicting Americans may be related to food additives, pesticides and other chemicals.",
      "\u201cHow about research on the pesticides that have hormone effects in children that may explain the declining fertility and lowering age of puberty?\u201d Makary asked, in a September podcast with Dr. Drew Pinsky.",
      "New York University food researcher Marion Nestle says Makary\u2019s questions \u201care extremely difficult to settle,\u201d because there\u2019s no way to ethically do the type of research needed to reach a firm conclusion: give one group of children food with pesticides and compare them with a control group getting food not grown with pesticides.",
      "\u201cI sympathize with his frustration and think we would be much better off with a lot fewer pesticides in our food supply, but I tend to view these issues more cautiously,\u201d Nestle said.",
      "Nutrition experts also say it\u2019s overly simplistic to declare all ultraprocessed foods harmful, since the category includes an estimated 60% of U.S. foods, including granola, peanut butter and ice cream.",
      "\u201cThey are not all created equal,\u201d said Gabby Headrick of George Washington University. \u201cIt is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultraprocessed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic has been the United States government,\u201d Makary told House lawmakers during a 2023 roundtable hosted by Republicans.",
      "Among the many COVID-19 policies Makary attacked was the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. That group received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild. Complicating the issue was the fact that COVID-19 itself also caused cases of myocarditis that were usually more severe.",
      "A 2022 paper coauthored by Makary concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions.",
      "\u201cThey made mistake after mistake and every time it either minimized the vaccine\u2019s benefits or exaggerated the risks,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris of the University of Washington, who published a critique of the work. \u201cThis paper really fed the whole notion that the vaccine is worse than the disease.\u201d",
      "Makary's conclusion contradicted that of U.K. experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimated the booster prevented 114 hospitalizations for every seven it caused in young people.",
      "Despite such pushback, Makary told Congress that CDC and FDA \u201clied to the American people\u201d about the need for boosters and other COVID measures.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser, says the Biden administration made missteps in rolling out boosters, including announcing plans to make them available for all age groups before outside experts had weighed in. But, Offit said, Makary\u2019s language has damaged public trust in health institutions, including the one he\u2019s been picked to lead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rhetoric that\u2019s purposefully inflammatory to win over a certain crowd, which is part of today\u2019s zeitgeist of disdaining public health agencies,\u201d Offit said. \u201cSo he\u2019s offered the position at FDA because he has disdain for the agency.\u201d",

      "Bryan Kohberger\u2019s defense attorneys and prosecutors have made secrecy the norm rather than an exception, 4th District Judge Steven Hippler wrote in a court order on Monday.",
      "\u201cThis runs counter to the public's First Amendment rights to know what is going on in its courts,\u201d Hippler wrote. He ordered the attorneys to use the least restrictive steps necessary to protect confidential information in the case, such as redacting some lines or using initials instead of an individual's full name.",
      "Kohberger is charged with four counts of murder in the deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, students who were killed in the early morning of Nov. 13, 2022, at a rental home near their campus in Moscow, Idaho. When asked to enter a plea last year, Kohberger stood silent, prompting a judge to enter a not-guilty plea on his behalf. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted.",
      "Hippler\u2019s directive came as a flurry of new motions were filed ahead of the August trial, including a sealed defense motion to take the death penalty off the table that cited autism spectrum disorder.",
      "Other sealed motions include one on whether the terms \u201cpsychopath\u201d or \u201csociopath\u201d can be used during the trial, and one from prosecutors about the presence of immediate family members in the courtroom during the trial. Some of the currently sealed documents will be redacted and made public, and others will remain sealed, the judge ruled.",

      "WASHINGTON -- When Donald Trump started the biggest trade war since the 1930s in his first term, his impulsive combination of threats and import taxes on U.S. trading partners created chaos, generated drama -- and drew criticism from mainstream economists who favor free trade.",
      "But it didn\u2019t do much damage to the U.S. economy. Or much good. Inflation stayed under control. The economy kept growing as it had before. And America\u2019s massive trade deficits, the main target of Trump\u2019s ire, proved resistant to his rhetoric and his tariffs: Already big, they got bigger.",
      "The trade war sequel that Trump has introduced in his second term is likely to be a different matter altogether. Trump appears to have grander ambitions and is operating in a far more treacherous economic environment this time.",
      "His plans to plaster tariffs of 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada and to double a 10% levy on China Tuesday \u2013 and to follow those up by targeting other countries \u2013 would threaten growth, and push up prices in the United States, undermining his campaign pledge to eliminate the inflation that plagued President Joe Biden.",
      "The tariffs would be paid by U.S. importers, who would then try to pass along the higher costs to consumers through higher prices.",
      "Trump himself has warned of possible fallout. \u201cWILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),\u201d Trump said in a social media post last month. \u201cBUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\u201d",
      "For a while, most of the hostilities were on hold. Trump, who had said he would hit Canada and Mexico on Feb. 4, delayed imposing the tariffs for 30 days. Now they're scheduled to start Tuesday. He went ahead with 10% import taxes on Chinese goods \u2014 and Beijing promptly retaliated by hitting U.S. coal, big cars and other items \u2014 and plans to double them Tuesday.",
      "Trump views tariffs \u2013 taxes on imports \u2013 as an economic elixir that can restore factories to the American heartland, raise money for the government and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants.",
      "During his first term, Trump put tariffs on most Chinese goods and on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\u201cThat was then. This is now,\u2019\u2019 said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \u201cthat would show up on Walmart\u2019s shelves,\u201d said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\u2019\u2019",
      "This time, by contrast, the tariffs are across the board \u2013 although the tariffs Trump plans Tuesday would limit hte levy on Canadian energy to 10%, showing that he was mindful of how much Americans in northern and midwestern states depend on oil and electricity from north of the border.",
      "In Boca Raton, Florida, the toy company Basic Fun is preparing to raise prices and absorb a hit to profits when the tariffs land.",
      "Ninety percent of Basic Fun\u2019s toys come from China, including Tonka and Care Bears. CEO Jay Foreman says the price on the Tonka Classic Steel Mighty Dump Truck is likely to rise later this year from $29.99 to as much as $39.99.",
      "Five years ago, the Trump administration spared toys, exempting them from its China tariffs. This time, Foreman said, \"we are now just going to forecast a lot of money draining out of the company.''",
      "Also worrying, economists say, is a retaliation clause the Trump team inserted in the tariff orders he signed last month.",
      "If other countries retaliate against Trump\u2019s tariffs with tariffs of their own \u2013 as China did and Canada and Mexico have threatened -- Trump will lash back with still more tariffs. That risks \u201csetting off a spiraling trade war\u2019\u2019 of tit-for-tat tariffs and counter-tariffs, said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University.",
      "Economists gathered Monday at a conference of the National Association for Business Economics were generally wary of the import taxes and their impact on the economy. Michael Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, estimated that the proposed duties could drag down economic growth by as much as a half-percentage point.",
      "One big difference between Trump\u2019s first term is that he's likely to get less pushback from his own aides. \u201cThis is true religion inside the White House right now, unlike the first term, when many of the president\u2019s advisers were deeply skeptical of this policy,\u201d Strain said.",
      "Diane Swonk, chief economist at the giant accounting firm KPMG, said the impact of tariffs this time would likely be much bigger than in 2018-2019. Among other things, the president is planning to impose what he calls \"reciprocal tariffs'' \u2014 and raise U.S. import taxes to match higher tariffs charged by other countries.",
      "\u201cThe breadth and scope are different,\u201d Swonk said. \u201cThe goals are different. It\u2019s not just one country, we\u2019re talking about multiple countries at the same time. And the rest of the world is ready to retaliate.\u201d",
      "One of those goals that Trump has cited more often than last time is using tariffs to raise revenue for the government, Swonk noted. Trump and some of his officials have talked about substituting tariff revenue for income taxes. If so, that would mean keeping the tariffs in place even if countries like Canada and Mexico agreed to Trump\u2019s demands on other issues, such as immigration restrictions.",
      "Perhaps the biggest difference is the economic backdrop Trump must contend with this time.",
      "Six years ago, inflation was low \u2014 maybe even too low, the Federal Reserve fretted. Trump's first-term tariffs didn't make a dent.",
      "Inflation isn't so benign anymore. Prices surged in the unexpected boom that followed the end of COVID-19 lockdowns. Inflation has come down from the four-decade high it hit in mid-2022, but it's still stuck above the Fed's 2% target and hasn't shown much improvement since summer.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs could rekindle the inflationary trend and convince the Fed to cancel or postpone the two interest rate cuts it had anticipated this year. That would risk keeping \"interest rates at their current elevated level for a longer period in 2025. That will push up mortgage and loan borrowing rates ... and reduce real growth,\u2019\u2019 said Boston College economist Brian Bethune.",
      "Outside a Harris Teeter supermarket near downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, Jacobs Ogadi had in his shopping bag an avocado, which almost certainly came from Mexico.",
      "The 62-year-old mechanic said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist\u2019\u2019 to know that Trump\u2019s tariffs run counter to his promises to rein in inflation. \u201cIf it goes up 25%, it\u2019s not the government, it\u2019s not the Mexican people paying for it,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWho pays for it? Us.\u2019\u2019",

      "The Iditarod has begun and promises to be like none before",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The rugged Iditarod started Monday, but a dearth of snow forced the iconic dog sled race to start further north and added a new route that allows mushers to bypass barren land, while lengthening by more than 100 miles (160.93 kilometers) an unforgiving journey often measured in grit and attrition.",
      "The new course reroutes mushers and their dog teams around a difficult stretch of trail north of the Alaska Range, which is treacherous with snow and ice but mostly unpassable in dry conditions for sleds.",
      "The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race is usually billed as a 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometer) race across Alaska. The route change means it's now 1,128 miles (1,815 kilometers). Mushers began their trek to the finish line in Nome from Fairbanks, the fourth time this century the race has been forced north from the Anchorage area.",
      "A lack of snow in the Anchorage area also caused headaches for race organizers Saturday during the ceremonial start. The parade-like route in Anchorage usually has mushers taking a leisurely course over 11 miles (17.70 kilometers) of city streets and trails with an auction winner riding in their sled.",
      "However, weeks of little-to-no new snowfall and warm temperatures in Alaska\u2019s largest city forced organizers to shorten the ceremonial start to less than 2 miles (3.22 kilometers), run over snow that was trucked in to cover downtown city streets.",
      "There are 33 mushers in this year\u2019s race, tied with the 2023 race for smallest field ever. Among them are two former champions, Ryan Redington and three-time winner Mitch Seavey.",
      "Mushers and their dog teams will battle the worst of what wild Alaska can throw at them \u2014 from bad trails, mushing on frozen rivers and sea ice and possible encounters with wildlife with the winner expected in the old Gold Rush town of Nome on the Bering Sea coast in about 10 days.",
      "This year the Iditarod will honor another famous mushing event, the 1925 Serum Run, in which sled dog teams saved Nome from a deadly diphtheria outbreak."

      "WASHINGTON -- The head of a federal watchdog agency must remain in his job, a judge in Washington ruled on Saturday, saying President Donald Trump's bid to remove the special counsel was unlawful.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson sided with Hampton Dellinger, who leads the Office of Special Counsel, in a legal battle over the president's authority to oust the head of the independent agency that's likely headed back to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Dellinger sued Trump last month after he was fired, even though the law says special counsels can be removed by the president \u201conly for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d Jackson, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic president Barack Obama, quickly reinstated Dellinger in the job while he pursued his case.",
      "Jackson rejected the Trump administration's claims that the special counsel's removal protections are unconstitutional because they prevent the president from rightfully installing his preferred agency head.",
      "The judge said allowing the president to remove the special counsel at will would have a chilling effect on his crucial duties, which include guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions, such as retaliation for whistleblowing.",
      "\u201cThe Special Counsel is supposed to withstand the winds of political change and help ensure that no government servant of either party becomes the subject of prohibited employment practices or faces reprisals for calling out wrongdoing \u2014 by holdovers from a previous administration or by officials of the new one,\u201d Jackson wrote in her decision.",
      "The Justice Department quickly filed court papers indicating it will challenge the ruling to Washington's federal appeals court. The case has already gone up once to the Supreme Court, which previously temporarily allowed Dellinger to remain in his job.",
      "The ruling comes as Dellinger is challenging the removal of probationary workers who were fired as part of the Trump administration\u2019s massive overhaul of the government. A federal board on Tuesday halted the terminations of several probationary workers after Dellinger said their firings may have been unlawful.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad and grateful to see the court confirm the importance and legality of the job protections Congress afforded my position,\" Dellinger said in a statement on Saturday. \"My efforts to protect federal employees generally, and whistleblowers in particular, from unlawful treatment will continue.\u201d",
      "The judge said the special counsel has a \u201cunique status and mission,\" which requires independence from the president to ensure he can carry out his responsibilities. The office investigates whistleblower claims of reprisal, can pursue disciplinary action against employees who punish whistleblowers and provides a channel for employees to disclose government wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cIf I don\u2019t have independence, if I can be removed for no good reason, federal employees are going to have no good reason to come to me,\u201d Dellinger told reporters outside Washington\u2019s federal courthouse after a recent hearing.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers. Dellinger\u2019s firing came as Trump administration employees have touted their support on social media for his policies even though the Hatch Act is meant to restrict political advocacy while on duty.",
      "The Justice Department employed sweeping language in urging the Supreme Court last month to allow the termination of the head of an obscure federal agency with limited power. Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in court papers that the lower court had crossed \u201ca constitutional red line\u201d by blocking Dellinger\u2019s firing and stopping Trump \u201cfrom shaping the agenda of an executive-branch agency in the new administration\u2019s critical first days.\u201d",
      "Dellinger was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in 2024."

As potential jurors were questioned last week, he sporadically appeared in court, at times refusing to leave his jail cell.",
      "Authorities alleged Crimo perched on a roof and fired into crowds assembled for the annual Fourth of July parade in downtown Highland Park, 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Chicago.",
      "Prosecutors have submitted thousands of pages of evidence, as well as hours of a videotaped interrogation during which police say Crimo confessed to the shooting. But the 24-year-old has since pleaded not guilty.",
      "His defense attorneys have declined comment ahead of the trial, which is expected to last about a month.",
      "His father, Robert Crimo Jr., a onetime mayoral candidate, was charged in connection with how his son obtained a gun license. He pleaded guilty in 2023 to seven misdemeanor counts of reckless conduct and served less than two months in jail.",
      "He has attended his son\u2019s hearings, sometimes making eye contact with him during court. He declined to discuss the case in detail ahead of the trial.",
      "\u201cAs a parent, I love my son very much,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Bobby loves this country more than anyone would ever know.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors plan to call multiple law enforcement officers and survivors of the shooting to testify. They also will show videos of Crimo\u2019s statements to police. Some of the videos already have been shown in court as prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to have them thrown out.",
      "Crimo\u2019s erratic behavior has contributed to court delays.",
      "He fired his public defenders and said he would represent himself, then abruptly reversed himself. In June 2024, when he was expected to accept a plea deal and give victims and relatives a chance to address him publicly, he arrived at the court in a wheelchair and rejected the deal.",
      "Residents in the wealthy Highland Park community of roughly 30,000 set along Lake Michigan have mourned the losses deeply. Some potential jurors were excused because of their connections to the case.",
      "City leaders canceled the usual parade in 2023, opting for a \u201ccommunity walk.\u201d The parade was reinstated last year on a different route and with a memorial for the victims.",
      "\u201cOur community is once again reminded of the immense pain and trauma caused by the Highland Park shooting,\u201d Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering said in a statement ahead of jury selection. \u201cOur hearts remain with the victims, their families, and all those whose lives were forever changed by that devastating day.\u201d",
      "The victims killed in the shooting included Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; and married couple Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35.",
      "Survivors and their families have filed multiple lawsuits, including against the maker of the semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting and against authorities they accuse of negligence."

      "The comment was Adams' first public criticism of Cuomo since the former governor launched his campaign Saturday with a 17-minute video that blasted the city's leadership and described it as a threatening place where crime has spun out of control. It was also the public's first preview at how the race between the two scandal-scarred politicians may look in the months until June's Democratic primary election.",

      "Cuomo and Adams are among several candidates in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary race, which given the city's political bent, is widely viewed as the defining contest of the election. Also running in the primary is Comptroller Brad Lander, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, state Sen. Jessica Ramos, state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and former city Comptroller Scott Stringer."

      "The California Highway Patrol says drug use and excessive speed were factors in last year\u2019s fiery crash of a Tesla Cybertruck that killed three college students near San Francisco",
      "PIEDMONT, Calif. -- Drug use and excessive speed were to blame for last year's fiery crash of a Tesla Cybertruck that killed three college students near San Francisco, the California Highway Patrol said in a preliminary report.",
      "Four people were in the Cybertruck when it veered off a road, slammed into a retaining wall and burst into flames shortly after 3 a.m. on Nov. 27 in Piedmont.",
      "\u201cOfficers determined that a combination of driving under the influence of drugs and unsafe speed were the causes\u201d of the crash, the highway patrol said in a statement last week.",
      "Although police officers who responded were unable to douse the flames with their fire extinguishers, the fire department put the blaze out quickly, officials said at the time.",
      "Piedmont Fire Chief Dave Brannigan said the day after the crash that the speed in extinguishing the flames meant it was unlikely that the Cybertruck\u2019s large lithium-ion battery had caught fire. He called the incident \u201cmore along the lines of a typical car fire.\u201d",
      "Killed in the single-vehicle crash were Soren Dixon, 19, Jack Nelson, 20, and Krysta Tsukahara, 19. The fourth occupant, Jordan Miller, 20, survived after someone in another car managed to pull him out of the wreckage. All four were home from college for Thanksgiving break and graduates of Piedmont High School, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Sunday.",
      "The Chronicle cited toxicology reports that determined the three victims who died had alcohol, cocaine and other substances in their system. Their deaths were ruled an accident because they were caused by asphyxia due to inhalation of smoke from the car, and burns were a \u201csignificant\u201d factor in their deaths, the autopsy report said.",
      "The highway patrol's investigation is ongoing and a final reported is expected within months, the agency said.",
      "The Cybertruck, which has been available for purchase for more than a year, has been recalled multiple times for safety problems, including once in November because a fault in an electric inverter can cause the drive wheels to lose power. Last April, the futuristic-looking trucks were recalled to fix gas pedals that can get stuck in the interior trim."

      "Andrew Tate appeared on the PBD Podcast, hosted by Patrick Bet-David, and said DeSantis likely caved to media pressure last week when he told reporters that the Tates weren't welcome in Florida, after they landed in Fort Lauderdale on Thursday. DeSantis said Florida\u2019s attorney general was examining whether the state may have any jurisdiction over the brothers\u2019 alleged crimes, and if so, how to hold them accountable. In court documents, the Tates have said they are not and have never been Florida residents.",

As far as we\u2019re concerned, he\u2019s broken no laws,\u2019\" Tate said. \u201cInstead, what he did was say: 'We\u2019re going to get our attorney general to try and find some laws he\u2019s broken and wreck this man who\u2019s done nothing inside of the United States ever.'\"",
      "In contrast, Tate described U.S. President Donald Trump as \u201csuch a boss\u201d in his response to reporters about the Tate brothers. A reporter asked Trump if his administration had pressured the Romanian government to release the brothers, and Trump said, \u201cI know nothing about that.\u201d",
      "Andrew Tate, 38, is a former professional kickboxer and self-described misogynist who has amassed more than 10 million followers on the social platform X. He and his brother Tristan Tate, 36, are vocal supporters of Trump.",
      "Andrew reiterated on Monday that he has not been convicted of any crimes.",
      "\u201cIsn\u2019t the whole point of democracy, innocent until proven guilty?\u201d Tate said. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to even have a trial, let alone a conviction. I\u2019ve never even been tried after three years. I\u2019ve never been to trial.\u201d",
      "Andrew Tate is a hugely successful social media figure, attracting millions of followers, many of them young men and schoolchildren drawn in by the luxurious lifestyle the influencer projects online.",
      "He previously was banned from TikTok, YouTube and Facebook for hate speech and his misogynistic comments, including that women should bear responsibility for getting sexually assaulted.",
      "The Tates, who are dual U.S.-British citizens, were arrested in late 2022 and formally indicted last year on charges they participated in a criminal ring that lured women to Romania, where they were sexually exploited. Andrew Tate was also charged with rape. They deny the allegations.",
      "The Tates\u2019 departure came after Romanian Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu said this month that a Trump administration official expressed interest in the brothers\u2019 case at the recent Munich Security Conference.",
      "Just weeks ago, Andrew Tate posted on X: \u201cThe Tates will be free, Trump is the president. The good old days are back. And they will be better than ever. Hold on.\u201d",
      "The DeSantis' office didn't immediately reply to an email seeking comment about Monday's podcast with Tate."

      "Tariffs, he says is a beautiful word, signalling jobs and riches for America.",
      "However, history tells us that those firing the opening shots in a trade war also  suffer heavy casualties. Despite the president's rhetoric, American consumers are  on the front line.",
      "These extra taxes mean that Americans are facing the highest level of tariffs on goods being imported to their country since the 1930s.",
      "Vegetables from Mexico, wheat from Canada, toys and T-shirts from China are all in the firing line. Retailers of such items can have very narrow profit margins and will raise prices quickly to cover the tariffs.",
      "Consumers will notice the price rises.",
      "Groceries may be one of Trump's favourite words, but his own electorate may not appreciate the increase in bills they could face. Assuming no further tariffs, economists suggest US inflation, already higher than expected, could rise further in the second half of this year.",
      "A price worth paying \"to make America great again\"? Look no further than the laundry room for a cautionary tale.",
      "During his first-term of office in 2018, Trump imposed tariffs of up to 50% on imported washing machines after American producer Whirlpool complained about cheap South Korean competition.",
      "Those rivals - Samsung and LG - then set up in America, creating close to 2,000 jobs.",
      "But at what price? An imported washing machine cost an American shopper almost a third more at the start of 2023, just before tariffs were abolished, than five years previously.",
      "Add up the costs of tariffs and one study claims each of those jobs cost Americans the equivalent of more than $800,000 (\u00a3627,000).",
      "Those tariffs of course meant revenue for American governments and that source has increased dramatically in recent years, following the raft of tariffs Trump also imposed in his first term on China - most of which were retained under President Joe Biden.",

      "Six things that could get more expensive for Americans under Trump tariffs",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Then consider the impact on American manufacturers who have businesses spanning Canada, Mexico and perhaps even China. Overall, economists think we could be looking at a hit to US growth of up to 1% - not enough to prompt a recession, but unwelcome nonetheless.",
      "In sheer numbers terms, the hit to the Canadian economy could be greater, economists say. It sells more than $400bn worth of goods to America every year, accounting for a fifth of its income.",
      "But it has the capacity to lower interest rates, and healthy public finances, providing policy makers with scope to cushion the blow for Canadians.",
      "The damage to Mexico's national income could be less severe, but its central bank has less capacity to cut interest rates making it harder to deflect the pain.",
      "All of this will be anxiously watched by the European Union, likely next in line for those Trump tariffs. Germany, already in a fragile state, accounts for about a third of the goods sold by the EU to the US.",
      "China, despite being the target of Trump's repeated trade blows could actually be less vulnerable. Its exports to the US account for less than 3% of national income - easily made up elsewhere.",
      "Ironically, some of this resilience is down to the tariffs imposed by President Trump last time round. China simply looked for new markets.",
      "Countries like the UK could also benefit from a furthering of such trade diversion, more access to cheaper goods -  something that could  keep our own inflation down.",
      "A key point about trade wars is that there are winners as well as losers - particularly for those countries outside President Trump's firing line. Vietnam and Malaysia for example saw their exports grow rapidly during President Trump's last term as they scrambled to replace China in selling to America.",
      "If the UK continues to escape the wrath of President Trump, we could actually benefit from closer trading links with his country and indeed from greater foreign investment, if we looked to be a more certain environment than some of our competitors. But of course, our fate remains unclear.",
      "As it stands, the prospects for global growth in 2025 have dulled, but a recession appears very unlikely. However, in Trump world we have learnt very quickly to expect the unexpected - so much still depends on what happens from here.",
      "And that uncertainty itself is harming business confidence both in the US and around the world, putting off key decisions about where to invest and create jobs.",
      "Weaponising uncertainty too comes at a price - even on home soil."

      "Concerns over a rush of last-minute enquiries mean anyone who requests a call back from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) on the issue will not be regarded as having missed the 5 April deadline.",
      "People can currently make voluntary extra contributions to plug National Insurance gaps back to 2006.",
      "But, after April's deadline, this will be limited to the previous six years only.",
      "Some people may have spaces in their National Insurance record if, for example, they have lived abroad or taken time off for caring responsibilities.",
      "In general, people need 35 years of qualifying contributions to get the full state pension.",
      "Top-ups have been permitted, as part of the transition to the flat-rate state pension, which was introduced in 2016.",
      "Currently, these can go back for nearly 20 years, but are due to return to the normal six years after April.",
      "Complications",
      "Pensions experts say that extra contributions may not suit every individual in these circumstances, so it is important to check whether it is worthwhile for their finances.",

      "Anyone in this position should save a screenshot of their call-back confirmation message. A return call should come within eight weeks.",
      "Checking service",
      "A spokesman for the DWP said an online tool would mean that people would be able to make top-up payments after the 5 April deadline, provided they complete the call-back request form ahead of that date.",
      "\"This will enable us to ensure no one misses out, and to suitably manage demand as the deadline approaches,\" he said.",
      "Steve Webb, partner at consultants LCP and a former pensions minister, said: \"After the chaos in the run-up to previous deadlines, it is good that the government has planned ahead to make sure that people do not miss out simply because they cannot get through on official phonelines to discuss state pension top-ups.\"",
      "Anyone can look at their National Insurance record and obtain a state pension forecast without charge to decide if making a voluntary contribution is a good decision for them.",

      "Alan Bates led a group of 555 sub-postmasters in a landmark court case against the Post Office, which came to wider public attention after it was depicted in an ITV drama.",
      "While the cohort secured a \u00a342.5m settlement in 2019, the huge costs of going to the High Court meant each claimant received a relatively low compensation pay-out at the end of it.",

      "If they are quashed by the court, they can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme. If they are overturned under legislation - the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 which became law in May - they can go to the newer Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.",
      "ITV's drama Alan Bates vs The Post Office has introduced millions to the long-running scandal",
      "What compensation is there for people with overturned convictions?",
      "There have been 983 convictions - 700 of which were privately initiated by the Post Office - linked to the faulty Horizon IT programme.",
      "People whose convictions are quashed can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme, whether or not they are in the GLO group. It is this scheme that the government has taken over responsibility for from the Post Office.",

      "A former boss of Barclays, who was ousted from the bank over his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, will seek to clear his name in court this week.",
      "Jes Staley was forced out in November 2021 after UK regulators ruled he had failed to accurately disclose the nature and length of his relationship with Epstein to the Barclays board.",

      "Mr Staley is seeking to overturn a decision by the Financial Conduct Authority in 2023 banning him from holding a senior position in financial services.",
      "Jes Staley had been disciplined by regulators in 2018 over his attempts to unmask a whistleblower he felt was unfairly trying to smear a colleague. But the crucial blow to his position at Barclays was his insistence that his relationship with Epstein was \"not close\" and had ended before he took up the top job at the UK bank.",

      "A now infamous email thread shows Mr Staley remarking to Epstein \"that was fun, say hi to Snow White\". Epstein replies \"what character would you like next? To which Mr Staley replies \"beauty and the beast!\".",
      "There are also allegations that he and Epstein stayed in contact indirectly after he took the Barclays job. Mr Staley's lawyers insist that any such moves were initiated by Epstein and Mr Staley made no attempt to contact Epstein.",
      "All of this will be aired in a court that will call former regulators and executives as witnesses and many have questioned why Mr Staley, who is now 68 and extremely wealthy, would want this publicity all over again.",
      "Jes Staley is a tough and fiercely proud man. He enjoyed a very successful career on Wall Street and many thought he was destined to take over at the helm of his old employer JP Morgan \u2013 the biggest investment bank in the world.",
      "Internally he was popular with most of his banking colleagues. His ill-fated attempt to unmask a whistleblower he thought was smearing an old colleague, was seen by some \u2013 but not all \u2013 as evidence of fierce loyalty to his own troops.",
      "That willingness to go into battle will be on show in the coming days, but seems unlikely to restore his reputation or future position to the one he enjoyed before he was shown the door at Barclays.",

      "New leasehold flats in England and Wales are set to be banned under the latest government plans to reform home ownership.",
      "Under the current leasehold system, third-party landlords known as freeholders own the building and a leaseholder buys the right to occupy a flat within it for a fixed time period.",
      "The government says it wants to move to a system of home ownership that is more in line with the rest of the world, known as commonhold, where homeowners own a share of and have control over buildings they live in.",
      "Freeholders say leasehold is the \"most effective way of managing large complex apartment buildings\".",
      "The government has yet to set out specific plans for the conversion of current leasehold properties to commonhold, but says it is \"determined\" to make this easier.",
      "A white paper published on Monday stated the sale of new leasehold flats would be banned and commonhold \"reinvigorated\" with a new legal framework.",
      "A draft Leasehold and Commonhold Reform Bill - including the detail of how the new system would work - will be published later this year, the government has said.",
      "The new legislation would apply in England and Wales. There are an estimated five million leasehold properties in England, 70% of which are flats.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook told the BBC the current system is \"inherently unfair\" and reforms are needed to give leaseholders \"better control\" over their homes and associated costs.",
      "Existing leaseholders can feel like they have no control over costs for repairs and maintenance of the outside of their building.",
      "Around 1,000 people contacted the BBC after a BBC investigation about service charges in leasehold blocks last year.",
      "Kasia Tarker bought a one-bedroom flat in Southall, West London, in 2022.",
      "Her service charge bills have increased from roughly \u00a365 per month in 2022 to more than \u00a3200 per month this year.",
      "She said she felt helpless and could not afford the charges.",
      "\"I am going have to try and sell the flat or become homeless, I don't know what I am going to do.\"",
      "FirstPort, who took over management of Kasia's development in 2023, said the \"increases in areas such as insurance and health and safety costs\" were beyond its control.",
      "Kasia said she would like more control over her service charges but the government's commonhold proposals were for new builds, so would not help her in her current situation.",
      "Jean Hopkin, another leaseholder who got in touch with the BBC, said the service charge for her three-bedroom flat in Sheffield had increased 356% - from \u00a3106 a month to \u00a3483 in four years - and was unsellable because of the high charges.",
      "Jenny Baker in Southampton is also struggling to find buyers because of \"unjustified\" service charges that have gone up to \u00a37,200 a year.",
      "\"The state of the apartment block is just terrible. The windows don't get cleaned and there's black mould on the outside of the building - what on earth am I paying for?",
      "\"I feel stuck \u2013 I can never come out of it. I feel like I have absolutely no control, and it makes me feel really anxious.\"",
      "Rendall & Rittner, which manage Jean and Jenny's buildings, said the company did \"not profit from or mark up any costs\".",
      "According to property company Hamptons, the amount of money leaseholders pay for communal maintenance and services in their building has risen by 11% in England and Wales between 2023 and 2024 to an average of \u00a32,300.",
      "Companies responsible for managing buildings have said a rise in costs can be attributed to legitimate expenses including energy prices and higher inflation rates but many leaseholders felt the costs were unfair.",
      "Under the current system, it is the freeholder or landlord that appoints a managing agent. Under a commonhold system, residents would have more autonomy over what they pay and who they appoint to do maintenance, the government said.",
      "What is the difference between leasehold and commonhold?",
      "A leasehold property reverts to the freeholder after a fixed amount of time. A commonhold property is owned outright, like a freehold house.Under commonhold, homeowners have a say on the annual budget for their building. Under the leasehold system, a freeholder or landlord sends a bill to residents for communal costs. The residents will be able to hire and fire a managing agent.There is no ground rent charge in a commonhold property.Forfeiture is not possible under commonhold, meaning a resident cannot be threatened with losing their home.",

      "She added that a commonhold system would mean \"residents would face greater financial and legal responsibilities for block maintenance and management\".",
      "'Significant step'",
      "The National Leasehold Campaign (NLC) said it was \"delighted\" about the announcement and called today's white paper a significant step forward.",
      "But NLC founder Katie Kendrick said it was \"paramount\" that those currently living in leasehold buildings were not forgotten.",
      "She said: \"While focusing on preventing future leasehold abuses is crucial, it's equally vital to address the plight of existing leaseholders currently bound by the inequitable leasehold system.",
      "\"Commonhold conversion mechanisms are essential to offer an escape route for those trapped.\"",
      "Mr Pennycook said the government would \"continue to implement reforms to help millions of leaseholders who are currently suffering\".",
      "\"Want we don't want is a two-tier system,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"All existing leaseholders in blocks will be able to convert to commonhold,\" he said, adding the government will introduce a system that makes it \"very easy\" to do so, with a draft plan set to be outlined later this year.",
      "He acknowledged there will be a \"remnant of existing leasehold blocks\" once the ban on new leaseholds is brought in and a new system to convert existing leaseholds to commonhold is brought in, but said those remaining leaseholders will still have \"greater protections\".",
      "In 2023, Conservative housing secretary Michael Gove expressed a desire to abolish the leasehold system entirely, but later opted for reforms instead.",

      "The investigation will look into whether the companies are complying with both the UK's data protection laws, and the children's code.",

      "\"I don't want to pre-judge how we might look at the Imgur and Reddit matters, but if there are age limits for accessing services, then the platforms have to enforce those in some ways,\" the Information Commissioner told the BBC.",
      "\"There are a number of different technologies and techniques that are available, I would say, and the degree of rigor, I think, depends in part upon the kinds of risks, the likelihood that children will be accessing those sites.",
      "\"I guess a baseline would be: self-declaration is probably not going to cut it if there is content on the site or services on the site that are unsuitable for children under the age of 13.\"",
      "A Reddit spokesperson told the BBC that 95% of their users are adults but that they \"have plans to roll out changes this year that address updates to UK regulations around age assurance\".",
      "Imgur has not responded to the BBC's request for a comment.",
      "Next steps",
      "The investigations do not necessarily mean any of the three platforms have broken the law.",
      "But companies which are found to have done so can be punished with enforcement notices and fines.",
      "\"We are patrolling, and there will be consequences for breaches of the law,\" said Mr Edwards.",

      "The latest increase in rail fares in England and Wales is set to pile \"further misery on hard-pressed households\", a campaign group has said.",
      "From Sunday, regulated rail fares in England and Wales have risen by 4.6% and the price of most railcards has increased by \u00a35.",
      "The government says fares need to rise so it can invest in the rail system, but Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander acknowledged passengers were \"frustrated\" by delays and cancellations.",
      "The Campaign for Better Transport said people were being \"priced off the railways\" by fare increases.",
      "The rail fare rise for regulated tickets includes most season tickets covering commuter routes in England, which can cost thousands of pounds.",
      "Some off-peak returns on long-distance journeys, and flexible tickets for travelling in and around cities will also rise.",
      "Train operators set their own prices for unregulated fares, but these tend to increase by a similar amount to regulated fares, including on lines that have already been renationalised.",
      "About 45% of train fares are regulated in England, Wales and Scotland, but the 4.6% rise relates to travel in England and Wales only.",
      "In Scotland, rail fares are set to increase by 3.8% in April.",
      "In Northern Ireland, the nationalised Translink service said no decision had yet been taken by the Department for Infrastructure on whether rail fares will go up in 2025.",
      "The cost of most railcards has also gone up by about \u00a35, from about \u00a330, but disabled railcards remain the same price.",
      "The Campaign for Better Transport said the fare increases would add to the pressure on households, coming on top of higher food and energy costs.",
      "Michael Solomon Williams, head of campaigns at the group, said high ticket prices were the \"number one barrier to getting more people travelling by rail\", and called on the government to bring down fares as part of rail reforms.",
      "\"People are being hit hard,\" he told the BBC. \"People want to take the train and they're being priced off the railways.",
      "\"At the same time fuel duty's being frozen. Government has the choice, it can choose to intervene.\"",
      "The campaign group said out of 40 commuter routes into London, annual season tickets for three will top \u00a36,000 for the first time, with 10 others already there.",
      "Annual season tickets from Canterbury and Southampton into London will go up by more than \u00a3300 to \u00a37,100 and \u00a37,477 respectively.",
      "'Crazily expensive'",
      "Adrian Rose, 50, from Sittingbourne in Kent says hiking rail fares when they are already \"crazily expensive\" is not justifiable.",
      "For him and his wife and two daughters to drive from Kent to see relatives in Newcastle is no more than \u00a3100 in fuel for the family, whereas to go by train can cost more than \u00a3400 if booking close to the departure date.",
      "\"The cost is prohibitive,\" he says.",
      "\"I would happily take the train, but for over four times the cost? I could have a week's holiday for that money.\"",
      "But Celia Downie, who uses the train regularly for work and leisure, says she will continue to do so \"however much it costs\", because \"I can work on the train and I believe it is environmentally proper to do so\".",
      "But the 68-year-old from Bristol, who has a Senior Railcard, also believes prices are too high for families and says sometimes the experience of cramped carriages is \"absolutely appalling\".",
      "'Not fit for purpose'",
      "Heidi Alexander said she understood passenger frustration that fares keep rising \"despite unacceptable levels of delays and cancellations\".",
      "However, she said it was the lowest absolute increase in fares for three years.",
      "\"We inherited a railway that was not fit for purpose, and I know it will take time for trust to be restored, with trains turning up on time, when and where they're needed.\"",
      "Alex Robertson, chief executive of watchdog Transport Focus, said its research had found a \"a clear mismatch between ticket prices and the service people receive\".",
      "\"This needs to change,\" he added, saying that passengers \"rightly expect... to see improvements for the money they have paid\".",
      "The government plans to renationalise rail firms as operators' contracts either end or reach a break.",
      "However, although three rail operators are set to be renationalised this year - South Western Railway, C2C and Greater Anglia - this is not expected to bring ticket prices down.",
      "It is setting up a new arms-length body, Great British Railways (GBR), to take over service contracts currently held by private firms as they expire in the coming years.",
      "Conservative shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon said price increases showed that Labour's pledges to make rail fares cheaper were \"meaningless\" and commuters were instead facing \"chaos, confusion and cancellation\" on the railways.",
      "\"Labour's radical plans to hand control of the railways to the unions will only worsen services,\" he said.",
      "\"Under new leadership, the Conservatives would put passengers first, ensuring that any fare increases are fair and proportionate.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly44dknrj8o",
    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 22:25:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Protests, politicking and planning could stall the runway, despite the government being 'minded to approve' it",
    "story": [
      "Expansion at Gatwick Airport has moved a step closer after the government gave the plan its tentative backing.",
      "On the surface Gatwick's plans look relatively straightforward.",
      "In contrast to Heathrow, which wants to bulldoze houses and reroute the M25, Gatwick is proposing to shift an already existing runway just 12 metres north, and bring it into regular use.",
      "Yet it still may not happen for years, or may not happen at all.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "Gatwick officially opened as an airport in 1958. It had one runway and an additional taxi-way, that was expanded so it could be used as a back-up in case the main runway was out of action.",
      "It was never supposed to be for daily use.",
      "In fact, in 1979 Gatwick's owners signed a legally binding agreement with the local council not to build another operational runway for at least 40 years.",
      "Now, though, Gatwick is keen to increase flights in and out, especially for short-haul destinations, by putting the back-up runway into regular use.",
      "In the summer of 2023, it put in a planning application, including for additional buildings, flyovers to local roads and expanding rail links.",
      "However, the centre line of a runway that's in full operation, must be at least 210 metres from the centre line of any other runway.",
      "The back-up runway needs to shift 12 metres northwards to meet that safety rule.",
      "How long would expansion take?",
      "Just because the government has given backing in principle for the privately-funded \u00a32.2bn scheme, doesn't mean it is ready for take-off.",
      "There is strong opposition to the expansion of Gatwick among some local residents objecting to increases in traffic, noise and pollution.",
      "Climate campaigners oppose any airport expansion, pointing out that the extra flights will make it harder for the UK to meet its obligations to reduce emissions that are altering the climate.",
      "And in January MPs called on the government to delay the decision on expanding Gatwick until current noise levels were monitored adequately at the site.",
      "Gatwick has until 24 April to submit more information to support its planning application, and respond with measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport.",
      "Then there will be a fresh consultation on the plans, before the government makes a final decision on 27 October.",
      "Even if Gatwick is given the go-ahead then, it could still face further hurdles.",
      "\"There remains the possibility that the final decision could be subject to legal challenge which would lead to further delay,\" Paul Maile, head of planning and infrastructure consenting at Eversheds Sutherland, told the BBC.",
      "\"It is probable that it will still be several years before work is likely to start, at the earliest,\" he said.",
      "Will it actually happen?",
      "Gatwick has previously said it believed the new runway could be ready by the end of the decade.",
      "But there is still a reasonable chance it might not happen at all.",
      "By 2030 there will have been another general election, and a different government could overturn any previous decisions. Planning permissions and regulations may change, and climate targets could be ramped up - all of which would put the project at risk.",
      "It will also depend on what the public want, says Prof Tony Travers of the London School of Economics.",
      "Politicians are \"susceptible to public pressure\" so sometimes choose to slow or cancel infrastructure projects like this.",
      "While there are wider benefits of airport expansion, to the regional and national economy as well as the travelling public, those advantages don't usually prompt people to make placards and write to their MPs. Living under a flight path, on the other hand, does.",
      "Richard Threlfall, global head of infrastructure, government and healthcare at KPMG International, says other countries, which don't have such strong democracies as the UK, can \"just get on and do it\", when they want infrastructure built.",
      "In the UK road bypasses, rail infrastructure, housing and other projects can be slowed or completely blocked, if enough people oppose them.",
      "But this government has staked its reputation on overcoming opposition to projects that it believes will boost growth, indicating it wants to see airport expansion despite the objections.",

      "\"I had to take a month off work with stress. There's not been a day when I've not thought about cladding,\" he told the BBC.",
      "It is estimated there are 1.3 million leasehold flats in low-rise blocks, under 11m high in England, according to the End Our Cladding Scandal campaign.",

      "The invoice from his landlord was his legal share of the costs to make the building fireproof. \"I thought it was a typo to be honest,\" said Tom.",

      "\"The government says for buildings under 11m, the risk can be mitigated by other means, like using fire alarms and sprinkler systems but in my case, that's not true,\" explained Tom.",
      "\"I've had two fire assessments both saying the cladding is dangerous and needs to be removed, and the price, which they also said would be lower for smaller buildings, is extortionate. I can't pay,\" he added.",
      "After complaining to the building's owners, Tom expects the bill to be reduced but is yet to find out by how much.",
      "Tom had planned to sell the flat to buy a family home but can't. \"It's ruining my life and I'm facing bankruptcy,\" he said.",
      "The Department for Housing told the BBC that owners of buildings under 11m should not pass on the costs of fixing historical safety defects to leaseholders.",
      "But the law does not prevent people like Tom being billed for unlimited amounts of money when the developers are no longer around or landlords cannot afford the remediation costs.",
      "'Falling through the gaps'",
      "Liz Ramsden is an expert in leasehold property at Knights and told the BBC she believes the Building Safety Act was drafted too quickly.",
      "\"The intention was that no leaseholder would have to pay but in reality we are finding a lot of leaseholders are having to pay huge sums of money.",
      "\"There was very little consultation and because of that we have these gaps in the legislation and people are falling through,\" she said.",
      "Even in buildings above 11m the rules fail to protect many leaseholders.",
      "Homeowners with Islamic mortgages or three or more properties also do not benefit  from the full protections.",
      "This is something Martin Batty, who has an Islamic mortgage, only discovered when he put his one-bedroom flat up for sale.",
      "He said his lawyer explained the way Islamic home purchase plans are structured - to comply with Sharia law which does not allow paying interest - means he falls outside the scope of the act.",
      "\"It feels really unfair. I feel like I'm being discriminated against,\" he said.",
      "\"To find out that I'm a non-qualifying leaseholder just because I've got an Islamic home purchase plan is a huge kick in the teeth. It's really upsetting and is a huge let down.\"",
      "The government told the BBC Islamic interest free loans secured against properties were very rare.",
      "But Martin said he can't sell his flat because mortgage providers will not lend against it and solicitors won't advise on non-qualifying leases.",
      "Suzy Spilling and her husband Colin invested in four rental properties to fund their retirement - including two flats in Salford \"mortgaged to the hilt\".",
      "These two flats are in a building where lots of the cladding has been found to be unsafe.",

    "summary": "A deal to avoid further trade barriers appears very much on the cards, but challenges remain.",
    "story": [
      "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.",
      "It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.",
      "Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.",
      "There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.",
      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

      "In June 2021, speculation persisted that it was the beginning of the end for Skype.",
      "When Microsoft announced Windows 11, its new operating system, it stated that Microsoft Teams would be integrated by default, while Skype, for the first time in years, was not.",
      "Teams had seen a boost in popularity during the Covid pandemic as people moved their work and personal meetings online.",

    "story": [
      "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.",
      "Speaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners.",
      "The trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade.",
      "Sir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK.",
      "Receiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\".",
      "Sir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit.",
      "Having confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.",
      "King invites Trump for 'unprecedented' second state visit",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "Watch: Decoding the PM's meeting with Donald Trump",
      "The US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands.",
      "On the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal.",
      "However, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.",
      "Asked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\".",
      "He said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals.",
      "The US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\".",
      "\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said.",
      "He later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.",
      "The UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders.",
      "However, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\".",
      "The deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back.",
      "After taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\".",
      "Referring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence.",
      "\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said.",
      "He said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century.",
      "\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said.",
      "Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union.",
      "He also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.",
      "Asked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"",
      "\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.",
      "\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"",
      "In a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\".",
      "Since leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.",
      "In his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.",
      "However, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems.",
      "The head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".",
      "\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".",
      "He added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK."

    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

    "story": [
      "The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy.",
      "Despite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too.",
      "So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity.",
      "In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists.",
      "Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.",
      "Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.",
      "Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.",
      "But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.",
      "Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.",
      "\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"",
      "What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.",
      "\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"",
      "Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.",
      "But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.",
      "A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.",
      "They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.",
      "Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.",
      "More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.",
      "And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".",
      "Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.",
      "And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.",
      "By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.",
      "The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"",
      "The required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.",
      "Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".",
      "Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.",
      "Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".",
      "The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"",
      "Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".",
      "But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".",
      "In more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.",
      "And, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"",
      "And while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

    "summary": "Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?",
    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",
      "When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to \"be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,\" he says.",

      "This includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.",
      "It is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries.",
      "Other elements found in Ukraine include beryllium and uranium, which are both crucial for nuclear weapons and reactors.",
      "Deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt and manganese are also significant.",
      "Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.",
      "Some of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.",
      "Dr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access to revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.",

      "Additionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.",
      "In December, China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.",
      "How would a deal help Kyiv exploit its minerals?",
      "Some commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\", but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.",
      "According to the World Economic Forum, Ukraine has about 20,000 mineral deposits covering 116 types, but only about 15% of sites were being actively exploited at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "For instance, the country's sizeable lithium deposits are still largely untapped. Likewise, rare earth deposits are known to exist, but none of them have yet been mined, because of a lack of investment.",
      "Developing these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine.",
      "She argues that if Ukraine can attract US investors to help develop its natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.",
      "\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"",
      "Trump has also suggested the presence of US contractors in Ukraine would act as a security guarantee to deter Russian aggression in the future, but Ukraine and European leaders have insisted that would not be enough."

      "In a new report, the education committee has told the government it should use the bill to remove the requirement to apply for free school meals for eligible children from low-income families.",

      "The total number of children registered for free school meals in England is about 2.1 million, or 24.6% of the total pupil population.",
      "However, an estimated one in 10 eligible children miss out on the meals, according to experts who gave evidence to MPs scrutinising the bill.",
      "Kate Antsey, of the Child Poverty Action Group, told MPs that it was often because of language barriers or difficulty with the administrative process experienced by their parents.",
      "Another estimate published in April 2024 by the think tank Policy in Practice put the number of children needlessly missing out on free school meals at 471,000.",
      "The cross-party education committee said the government should change the current rules using the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill - which is currently making its way through Parliament - to remove the need for manual enrolment.",
      "Failing to address the issue would be a \"missed opportunity\" to feed hungry children at school, the report concluded.",
      "It added that low uptake of free school meals contributes to hunger at school for children living with deprivation.",

      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has called it a \"landmark\" bill to \"seek to keep children safe\".",
      "It includes plans for all children to have a unique identifier number, a bit like a National Insurance number, for safeguarding purposes.",
      "It also includes other wide-ranging proposals, such as universal free breakfast clubs in all primary schools, and changes to academy schools' powers.",
      "Some of its proposals - particularly around academies - have been criticised, including by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who called it educational \"vandalism\".",
      "Paul Whiteman, general secretary at school leaders' union NAHT, agreed with the committee's calls for auto-enrolment for free school meals, adding: \"Too often social stigma means parents do not register.",
      "\"Crucially, enrolment for free school meals also unlocks pupil premium money for pupils, so without registration they also miss out on this vital additional support.\"",
      "Campaigners say automatic enrolment would also bring in millions in extra funding for schools via pupil premium grants.",
      "The government pays schools \u00a31,455 per primary pupil on free school meals or \u00a31,035 per secondary pupil, per year, for at least six years.",
      "Other recommendations in the report include ensuring that children with special educational needs and disabilities can access universal free breakfast clubs, strengthening the access of children in care to mental health support, and developing a national care offer.",
      "Education committee chairwoman Helen Hayes said: \"The committee has made recommendations designed to strengthen support for the most vulnerable children in society, based on compelling evidence from experts and from young people who shared with us their deeply moving experiences of life in care.\"",
      "The committee called on the government to develop a consistent national offer for care leavers across the country, to support vulnerable young people with things like transport costs and access to apprenticeships.",
      "The DfE said the \"landmark\" schools bill would break the \"unfair link between background and opportunity\".",

    "story": [
      "A 14-year-old boy has lost a court case he brought against his own parents after they moved him from London to Ghana to go to boarding school.",
      "The boy, described in court as shy, articulate, a keen cook and footballer, said his parents had tricked him into going to Africa, saying it was to visit a sick relative.",
      "He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school \"there would have been no way I would have agreed to it\".",
      "But the High Court in London also heard his parents were worried he was being \"groomed\" into criminal activity.",
      "In a written statement to the court, he said: \"I feel like I am living in hell. I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible.\"",
      "In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that \"this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion.\"",
      "He said that he was satisfied that the parents' wish for their son to move to Ghana was \"driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love\".",
      "The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said.",
      "He said that the boy's parents believe \"and in my judgement with reason\" that their son has \"at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives\".",
      "The boy's father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be \"yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London.\"",
      "The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was \"mocked\" and \"never settled in\" at the school in Ghana.",
      "He said he \"could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights\".",
      "The boy wrote that he was \"so scared and desperate\" that he emailed the British High Commission in Accra as well as contacting the charity Children and Family Across Borders, who it is believed put him in touch with lawyers at the International Family Law Group.",
      "\"I am from London, England, and I want to go back home,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he had been \"mistreated\" at the school, adding: \"I'm begging to go back to my old school.\"",
      "However the High Court heard that the boy's parents had sent him because they feared for his safety in London.",
      "In a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was \"not a punishment but a measure to protect him\".",
      "She referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was \"every parent's worst nightmare\", she said.",
      "She said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her son's \"destruction\".",
      "Rebecca Foulkes, representing the boy's father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the children's charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited.",
      "That included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons.",
      "She said it was not only the parents who were worried.",
      "His school claimed it had \"suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities\" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones.",
      "The boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor \"involved in gangs in any way\". He said he \"does not know anyone involved in a gang\" and he does not carry a knife.",
      "He acknowledged in his statements that \"my behaviour wasn't the best\" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa.",
      "The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent.",
      "In a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: \"This has been a really difficult time for us all.\"",
      "They added: \"Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family.\"",
      "James Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgment had been a \"real shock\" to the teenager.",
      "\"He was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully.\"",
      "'I want to have an education'",
      "The boy's barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction.",
      "The boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online.",
      "He wrote: \"I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than.\"",
      "The boy's father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well.",
      "He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place.",
      "The father said they were both very impressed.",
      "However, questioned by Ms Fottrell, he acknowledged there was no place in that school until September, and that his son had not said he wanted to go there.",
      "The boy's solicitor said he had recently seen a rise in similar cases where teenagers were trying to return to the UK.",
      "\"Teenagers are often placed in exceptionally challenging or vulnerable situations, and are now beginning to turn to the court for protection,\" Mr Netto said.",
      "He said he had seen cases where \"in their parents' eyes\" young people were \"falling in with the wrong crowd or are adopting what their parents see as unorthodox or challenging behaviours\".",

      "It depicts the Fife-born artist's best known work, The Singing Butler, which features a couple dancing on a storm-swept beach accompanied by their butler and maid, but with two figures in yellow hazmat suits disposing of an oil drum in the background.",
      "The sale to a private collector at Sotheby's in London on Tuesday evening came just days after Vettriano was found dead aged 73 at his apartment in France.",
      "The work was initially projected to fetch between \u00a33m and \u00a35m in the sale.",
      "The entirely hand-painted work, created using oil and spray paints, was first exhibited in 2005.",

      "The couple will also donate some of the proceeds to the California Fire Foundation following the devastating wildfires which destroyed parts of the city earlier this year.",
      "Hoppus said: \"We loved this painting since the moment we saw it. Unmistakably Banksy, but different. We bought it because we loved it. It's borne witness to our family over these past dozen years.",
      "\"It hung over the table in London where we ate breakfast and our son did his homework. It hung in our living room in Los Angeles. It's seen laughter and tears and parties and arguments. Our son has grown up in front of it.",
      "\"This painting has meant so much to us and been such an amazing part of our lives, and now I'm excited for it to be out there in the world, seen by as many as possible.\"",
      "Vettriano was found dead at his apartment in Nice on Saturday. His publicist confirmed his death on Monday.",
      "There were no suspicious circumstances around his death, police in Southern France said.",
      "The artist was self-taught after being gifted watercolour paints for his 21st birthday.",
      "His breakthrough came in 1989 when he submitted two paintings to the Royal Scottish Academy's annual show and both sold on the first day, inspiring him to become a full-time artist.",
      "His works later garnered international acclaim, leading to exhibitions in cities including London, Hong Kong, Johannesburg and New York."

      "Dean, who was famously private throughout his nearly 60-year marriage to Parton, died in Nashville, Tennessee, according to a statement she posted on social media.",
      "\"Carl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can't do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy,\" the statement read.",

      "Parton, 79, recalled their first meeting, saying, \"I was surprised and delighted that while he talked to me, he looked at my face (a rare thing for me). He seemed to be genuinely interested in finding out who I was and what I was about.\"",

      "She told US media in 2008 that the song was about a bank teller who developed a crush on Dean.",
      "\"She got this terrible crush on my husband,\" Parton said. \"And he just loved going to the bank because she paid him so much attention. It was kinda like a running joke between us\u2014when I was saying, 'Hell, you're spending a lot of time at the bank. I don't believe we've got that kind of money.' So it's really an innocent song all around, but sounds like a dreadful one.\"",
      "Parton and Dean's relationship remained such a mystery that rumours started that he did not exist - but Parton joked about that.",
      "\"A lot of people say there's no Carl Dean, that he's just somebody I made up to keep other people off me,\" she said to the Associated Press in 1984.",
      "Parton and Dean had no children together.",
      "He is survived by his siblings, Sandra and Donnie, Parton's statement said."

    "story": [
      "Nudity, swearing, petulance, club anthems, more nudity and a woman dressed as a horse - the 2025 Brit Awards had it all.",
      "Charli XCX was the big winner, taking home five prizes in all - including best artist, best album and song of the year.",
      "US star - and the BBC's Sound of 2025 - Chappell Roan picked up two awards; while Ezra Collective, The Last Dinner Party, Fontaines DC and Stormzy got one apiece.",
      "But no-one's only interested in all that. Here's what really went down at the 2025 ceremony at London's O2 Arena.",
      "Most predictable winner: Charli XCX",
      "Listen, this was never going to be anything other than Charli's night.",
      "The pop star's seventh album, Brat, captured the cultural zeitgeist in a way that few artists ever manage.",
      "Released in June, the record combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork; as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she's accumulated along the way, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.",
      "In the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",
      "Just as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.",
      "Critics called it \"pop music for the future\" and praised the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's coming of age.",
      "Knowingly trashy, yet surprisingly deep, it was easily the best British album of the last 12 months - and one that proved Charli's detractors wrong.",
      "\"I feel like dance music, electronic music, gets a really bad rep because everyone is like, 'It's not that deep, is it? And I kind of feel it is,\" she said after collecting her second award.",
      "\"This genre of music, for me, is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"",
      "Best visual pun: This coat",
      "Teddy Swims, swimming in teddy bears. We see what he did there.",
      "Least practical dress: Jade Thirlwall",
      "Jade Thirlwall was the last of the Little Mix crew to launch a solo career, but she's been giving it her all.",
      "As well as winning best pop artist at Saturday's ceremony, she put on one of the night's highest-concept performances - a five-act melodrama about the cruelty of the music industry and her creative rebirth.",
      "Over the course of the night, she wore six different outfits. But she chose the wrong one for climbing the stairs to pick up her trophy. Thank goodness the Sugababes were there to help.",
      "Sneakiest host: Jack Whitehall",
      "Jack Whitehall made a welcome return as the ceremony's host, after four years away.",
      "As ever, his jokes were close to the bone... including a passing reference to allegations surrounding some presenters on Brits broadcaster ITV.",
      "\"ITV had so many of its presenters cancelled this year that they had to come crawling back to an ex, and what an honour it is to be hosting again the biggest night in British music,\" he joked.",
      "Later, he described Youtuber-turned-musician KSI as \"an inspiration\".",
      "\"Because you listen to Kendrick Lamar and you're like, 'I couldn't do that in a million years'. Then I listen to your song and I'm like, 'Oh, I could do this'.\"",
      "Speaking before the show, Whitehall revealed a sneaky secret: He uses a fake script during rehearsals.",
      "\"Previously I used to do the actual script in rehearsal, and then you'd have an hour of people from record labels and publishers coming and knocking on the dressing room door going, 'You can't say this, you can't say that',\" he told Heart radio.",
      "\"So now I just do this fake script, which if you heard it, you'd be like, 'This is the lamest script ever', because it's all me just complimenting everyone and going, 'Oh, our next award is the best musician I've ever heard. They're great.'\"",

      "The prize was originally created in 2013 to recognise British acts who had sold millions of records and concert tickets abroad. The previous recipients were One Direction (2013-14), Sam Smith (2015), Adele (2016-17) and Ed Sheeran (2018-19).",
      "Six years ago it was abandoned altogether... until they needed something to honour Sabrina.",

      "In a recording of the 911 call obtained by the BBC, the emotional caller can be heard telling a dispatcher how he found the two bodies.",
      "Hackman, 95, was discovered in a side room near the kitchen while Arakawa, 65, was found in a bathroom, at the property on Old Sunset Trail in Hyde Park.",

    "story": [
      "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.",
      "But he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.",
      "Miranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.",
      "\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"",
      "She told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.",
      "That film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.",
      "It's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who plays a New York stripper.",

      "Anora star: Oscar talk is 'overwhelming and amazing'",
      "Madison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.",
      "When she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.",
      "\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.",
      "They \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.",
      "We've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.",
      "Some praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".",
      "'I debated not showing up'",
      "Edie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.",
      "Turquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.",
      "She got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.",
      "\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.",
      "\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"",
      "Turquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.",
      "\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"",
      "But when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.",
      "\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"",
      "Baker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.",
      "She says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.",
      "They connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.",
      "'I taught Mikey stripper slang'",
      "In the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.",
      "Miranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.",
      "\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.",
      "One of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"",
      "Rejection, heartbreak, and Tupperware boxes",
      "This section contains spoilers for Anora",
      "Miranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.",
      "\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.",
      "\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"",
      "Turquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.",
      "\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.",
      "\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"",
      "But overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.",
      "\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.",
      "\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"",
      "She said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".",
      "\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"",
      "\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"",
      "For Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.",
      "\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\"",
      "For Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.",
      "In the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.",
      "We also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.",
      "\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.",
      "\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"",
      "Oscar hopes",
      "When Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.",
      "Footage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.",
      "\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.",
      "Now, all eyes are on the Oscars.",
      "Miranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.",
      "\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"",
      "She said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.",
      "\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.",

    "summary": "The Monster Hunter series exploded in popularity globally after years of success in Japan. How did they do it?",
    "story": [
      "The latest release in one of Japan's most popular video game series has had one of the most successful debuts of all time.",
      "More than one million players have logged on to the PC version of Monster Hunter Wilds within hours of its launch, according to figures from online store Steam.",
      "There have been complaints from the first wave of players on Steam about the game's performance on computers, but its critical response has been positive.",
      "BBC Newsbeat spoke to director Yuya Tokuda and producer Ryozo Tsujimoto prior to the release of Wilds about turning the game into a global hit.",
      "Monster Hunter first launched on the PlayStation 2 in 2004.",
      "As the title suggests, players spend the game navigating an area known as The Forbidden Lands capturing and battling a cast of increasingly fearsome beasts.",
      "Long-time fans of the series are drawn in by its challenging, complex systems and option to play co-operatively, teaming up with friends to take down massive foes.",
      "Breakout 2018 hit Monster Hunter World has has sold 21.3 million copies, according to publisher Capcom, rising to 28.1 million when sales of an upgraded 2019 edition are included.",
      "Producer Mr Tsujimoto told BBC Newsbeat the game was a culmination of all the work and lessons learned from previous titles on the series.",
      "\"Anything that we hadn't been doing we really tried to do with Monster Hunter World to get everything ready so that the game was ready to break through,\" he said.",
      "Games industry layoffs and studio closures in the West and Europe have led to fears of \"brain drain\" - a loss of knowledge as people leave companies or even look for work in different fields.",
      "Japan, where employment protections for workers are much stronger, has not been as badly affected and developers often stay with the same company for a long time.",
      "Monster Hunter director Mr Tokuda says he's worked on the series for 20 years and it's fed into his work on Wilds.",
      "\"It's the groundwork that you create with your previous titles that you hope can inform the success of later ones,\" he says.",
      "\"We have the ability to take data from past titles like Monster Hunter World and analyse that data in order to understand what players were enjoying and what we could improve.\"",
      "Other Japanese studios are known for taking this iterative approach and building on what has come before.",
      "Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the makers of the popular Yakuza series and its Like a Dragon spin-offs, have put out a new game more or less every year since 2020.",
      "The company's boss Masayoshi Yokoyama has spoken openly about how the team is happy to revisit previous locations and reuse elements from earlier games rather doing a \"fresh reboot\" each time.",
      "This can help to lower development costs and reduce the time it takes to make new titles.",
      "'We're working in our own lanes'",
      "The Japanese games industry was a dominant force from the 1980s until the early 2000s, but a power shift saw Western developers begin to lead the way.",
      "More recently, the country has been behind some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful titles released.",
      "At last year's Game Awards - described by some as the industry's answer to The Oscars - Japanese-made games occupied four of the six Game of the Year nominations.",
      "Mr Tsujimoto says he can't pinpoint a specific reason for this, but says the Monster Hunter team has learned there are certain things needed to make a \"triple-A success in today's market\".",
      "That includes translating games into various languages so they can be released simultaneously in different countries, and being mindful of growing your audience.",
      "\"We're always careful to design the experience so new players can get into the game,\" he adds.",

      "Mr Tsujimoto says generational leaps \"push the industry forward\", bringing \"new opportunities and new complexities\".",
      "\"I don't think it's necessarily the most difficult it's ever been but there are always new challenges whenever technology leaps forward.\"",
      "The games industry is also more competitive than ever - more video games are being released, and players are tending to stick with the same ones for longer periods.",
      "It leaves publishers of new releases fighting over a much smaller share of players' free time and 2025 has already been packed with big new releases.",
      "Mr Tsujimoto insists they haven't paid too much attention to that while working on Monster Hunter Wilds.",
      "\"It looks like a big year for everyone but we're really all just working in our own lanes,\" he says.",
      "\"We happened to have this launch window that's on the verge of some other big releases but we don't have access to that information before the general public.\"",
      "For an established series that suddenly explodes in popularity, Mr Tokuda says a big challenge is pleasing old and new fans.",
      "\"You always have in your mind that there's people waiting for your next creation and they're the players you want to satisfy,\" he says.",
      "\"But you also have your own creative idea and want to follow that through.\"",

      "A 1999 Northamptonshire Health Authority study found no unusual cluster of birth defects.",
      "However, solicitor Des Collins, after reading about the cases, conducted his own investigation, revealing birth defects in Corby were three times higher than in the surrounding area.",

    "story": [
      "An autistic woman with a learning disability was wrongly locked up in a mental health hospital for 45 years, starting when she was just seven years old, the BBC has learned.",
      "The woman, who is believed to be originally from Sierra Leone, and who was given the name Kasibba by the local authority to protect her identity, was also held on her own in long-term segregation for 25 years.",
      "Kasibba is non-verbal and had no family to speak up for her. A clinical psychologist told File on 4 Investigates how she had begun a nine-year battle to release her.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was unacceptable that so many disabled people were still being held in mental health hospitals and said it hoped reforms to the Mental Health Act would prevent inappropriate detention.",
      "More than 2,000 autistic people and people with learning disabilities are still detained in mental health hospitals in England - including about 200 children. For years, the government has pledged to move many of them into community care, because they do not have any mental illness.",
      "The government promised to take action after a BBC undercover investigation in 2011 exposed the criminal abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol.",
      "But all key targets in England have been missed. In the past few weeks, in its plan for 2025-26, NHS England said it aimed to reduce the reliance on mental health inpatient care for people with a learning disability and autistic people, delivering a minimum 10% reduction.",
      "However, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Mencap, is not impressed. \"Hundreds of people are still languishing, detained, who should have been freed and should be supported in the community, because we haven't seen the progress that was promised,\" he told us.",
      "Dr Patsie Staite learned of Kasibba's incarceration in 2013 when she was a rookie clinical psychologist carrying out a routine review of her care. But it would take nine years to free her.",
      "\"I hadn't ever seen anyone living in the situation that she was living in. And I think what was really shocking was it was all legitimised,\" Dr Staite told the BBC. She said the apparently legitimate hospital setting masked the reality that Kasibba \"was locked up for sometimes more than 23 hours a day\".",
      "Returning to the site of the hospital - which cannot be named to help protect Kasibba's identity - Dr Staite pointed out a hole in the fence. It had been cut out, she said, so Kasibba could watch people walking by from the outside space of the locked annex where she was held.",
      "It is thought Kasibba, who is now in her 50s, was trafficked from Sierra Leone before the age of five. She lived in a children's home for a while, but that placement broke down and, by the age of seven, she was moved into the long-stay hospital.",
      "Dr Staite said that staff had described Kasibba as \"dangerous\" and an \"eye-gouger\".",
      "She discovered a single incident in the records which appeared to have led to these accusations of violence. Decades earlier, when Kasibba was 19 and before she was placed in long-term segregation, a fire alarm had gone off and the locked ward was being evacuated.",
      "Kasibba was distressed and, in the confusion, she was approached by another patient. She scratched her, causing a cut to the other patient's eye.",
      "\"That was how the incident was talked about ever since, 'she's an eye gouger and she caused so much harm to this other person',\" said Dr Staite. But \"it just didn't ring true\", she said, that a middle-aged woman with a learning disability who had lived in the hospital for decades could be that dangerous.",
      "After months of work, Dr Staite submitted a 50-page report to Camden Council - the local authority in north London which had originally placed Kasibba in the hospital. Dr Staite said it had already been accepted that Kasibba did not have a mental illness and her report concluded she was not dangerous and was safe to live in the community.",
      "A team of health and social care professionals was then set up in 2016, calling themselves \"the escape committee\". Their mission was to free Kasibba.",
      "Lucy Dunstan, from disability rights organisation Changing Our Lives, was appointed to be Kasibba's independent advocate and to build a compelling case for why it was safe for her to leave the hospital.",
      "But Kasibba's release could only be signed off by the Court of Protection, which makes decisions for people who do not have the mental capacity to make their own.",
      "Ms Dunstan said when she first met Kasibba, hospital staff simply introduced her as \"the eye-gouger\".",
      "She said she recalls looking at Kasibba through a small window in the door that kept her locked in. \"She was just lying on the the settee. It was a very empty room. Her life was completely impoverished,\" she said.",
      "It would be six years from first having met Kasibba before Ms Dunstan got a call to tell her that the Court of Protection had ruled she could leave hospital. \"I cried. Joy. Relief. Admiration for her. Pride,\" she said. \"It's not about me and what we did, but that she did it and she showed them.\"",
      "Now Kasibba lives in the community with the help of support workers, who engage with her and communicate with gentle touches, gestures and clear language. Her care manager said she loved fashion, was proud of her home and enjoyed social interaction.",
      "\"She has the most amazing sense of humour. She's a beautiful human being,\" the manager said. \"After about two weeks of working here she actually came up and gave me a hug. This is not an eye-gouger, you know.\"",
      "The Mental Health Bill going through parliament will mean autistic people and those with learning disabilities in England and Wales, who do not have a mental health condition, will no longer be able to be detained for treatment.",
      "But the government has said it will not bring in any changes until it is satisfied there is sufficient alternative support in the community. And it will still allow people to be detained in hospital legally for up to 28 days for assessment.",
      "Jess McGregor, executive director of adults and health at Camden Council, said it was a \"tragedy\" that Kasibba had spent most of her life held in hospital. \"I'm personally sorry,\" she said. \"She shouldn't have experienced what she did.\"",
      "The NHS mental health trust, which cannot be named to protect Kasibba's identity, said at no point had the care it delivered been brought into question and the service was rated as outstanding by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The trust told File on 4 Investigates that anyone assessed as needing long-term segregation had a self-contained property with their own bedroom, bathroom, living room and garden.",
      "The trust said from 2010 it had been working with local authorities to put plans in place to support the discharge of all long-term residents to more appropriate care, where possible within the community, but said they were prevented from doing so by a legal case brought by the families of other patients.",
      "It said its staff had then worked tirelessly for years supporting local authorities to put the necessary support in place in the community and they were able to successfully close the service in 2023."

      "Instead her main focus is on the approach of ministers and the government, she added.",

      "VIP lane",
      "PPE Medpro was one of dozens of companies which won government contracts after being referred through the \"VIP lane\" - officially known as the high-priority lane.",
      "Introduced in April 2020, the idea was to fast-track offers to supply PPE if they came with a recommendation from ministers, MPs, members of the House of Lords or other senior officials.",
      "At the time the government said there was a \"desperate need\" to protect health and social care staff, and it was argued swift action was required to secure PPE.",
      "New research for the Covid inquiry found almost a third of government contracts to buy masks, gowns and other equipment had gone through the VIP lane.",
      "Data showed that, of the 430 offers made in that way, 115 were successful. Those firms were 17 times more likely to win a contract than those outside the VIP lane system.",
      "Peter Munro, policy manager at the UK Anti-Corruption Coalition, a group made up of procurement, transparency and contract specialists, said the latest data \"confirmed some of our worst fears\".",
      "\"PPE procured through the high priority lane was 80% more expensive than PPE procured through other channels, and half if it was unfit for purpose,\" he said."

      "Netflix's new drama Toxic Town revisits one of the UK's biggest environmental scandals: the Corby toxic waste case.",
      "The series tells the story of families fighting for justice after children in the Northamptonshire town were born with birth defects, believed to be caused by industrial pollution.",
      "Corby's steel and iron industry expanded rapidly in the 1930s with the construction of Stewarts and Lloyds steelworks.",
      "By the 1970s, half the town worked in the mills, but when the steelworks closed in the 1980s, toxic waste from the demolition process was mishandled, leading to widespread contamination.",
      "In 2009, after a long legal battle, the High Court ruled Corby Borough Council was negligent in managing the waste.",
      "Families affected won an undisclosed financial settlement in 2010, held in trust until the children turned 18.",
      "Alongside the drama, a BBC Radio Northampton podcast series offers a deeper look into the real-life events, using original court transcripts and newly uncovered documents.",
      "Introducing... The Toxic Waste Scandal",
      "Hosted by George Taylor, 32, who was born with an upper limb defect linked to the case, the podcast features testimony and interviews with those directly impacted.",
      "Here are some of the key voices behind the story.",
      "'The first person you are going to blame is yourself'",
      "George Angus Taylor was born on 11 March 1992 to parents Fiona and Brian, in Corby.",
      "Brian had worked at Stewart and Lloyds, a job that left him covered in dust and debris at the end of each shift.",
      "Fiona, a former Boots No7 beauty consultant, vividly remembers George's birth, an event that would change their lives forever.",
      "Born \"navy blue\" as a result of pre-foetal circulation issues, he was immediately ventilated and placed in intensive care.",
      "It was then Fiona noticed something unusual.",
      "\"I remember just seeing his little hand; his pinkie ring finger and middle finger,\" she says.",
      "\"It was like a fist; you know how babies make a fist? Then his index finger; his thumb was sticking out.",
      "\"I just kept thinking, 'He's here because of me,' and you just look for blame. You look, and the first person you are going to blame is yourself.\"",
      "At 14, doctors discovered a tumour in George's hand so large that amputation became a real possibility.",
      "The surgery, experimental at the time, was gruelling. \"When I woke up, I was so full of morphine,\" he remembers.",
      "\"They said it was like climbing Everest with no practice \u2013 my body just shut down.\"",
      "The experience, particularly the smell, left lasting memories. \"They burn flesh as they [operate]: very quiet sizzling, like sausages in a pan. And that's the smell that still comes to you from time to time.\"",
      "Despite everything, George was determined to move forward. \"The first time I saw my hand, I wasn't shocked. I wasn't sad. It was better than before.\"",
      "But George was not alone. Other children in Corby were born with similar conditions.",
      "'Did I do this?'",
      "Lisa Atkinson was a security guard at the Corby steel mills, where her duties involved outside patrols, checking parking permits, and often having to move dust that had settled over everything.",
      "On 27 June 1989, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, at Kettering General Hospital.",
      "Simone was born with three fingers on each hand.",
      "Doctors reassured Lisa, saying the only thing she would not be able to do was play the piano.",
      "Just as Fiona Taylor did with George, Lisa initially questioned whether she was responsible for her daughter's condition.",
      "\"There was probably part of me that sat there and went, 'What did I do? Did I do this?'\" she says.",
      "\"Because I've had a couple of miscarriages before Simone... I always thought maybe I was lucky; maybe I was given Simone... but she wasn't quite perfect. But I was lucky to have had that baby and not the two previous ones.\"",
      "Despite her initial self-doubt, Lisa \"knew\" she had done nothing wrong, as she had neither drunk nor smoked during pregnancy.",
      "She recalls the lack of follow-up care or investigation into her daughter's condition.",
      "\"You're let out into the world with a child that's a little bit different,\" she says.",
      "\"But there was nowhere to go. There was no follow-up or anything, no 'We're going to look into it.' So you just deal with it. And you did, because you had to.\"",
      "Lisa quickly adjusted to life with Simone's condition, saying: \"It shocked other people more than it shocked me. I got used to it really, really quickly.\"",
      "Winning the subsequent legal case against the borough council brought with it overwhelming attention.",
      "\"I'm not famous, but I feel like that's how famous people must feel... It was crazy.\"",
      "Growing up, Simone, now 35, faced relentless bullying.",
      "\"I had a great family and friends... but [school] was hard. I wasn't a very confident child, and I was an easy target,\" she remembers.",
      "Simone coped by using humour. She would joke that her mum had chopped off her fingers or that she was part alien, turning her differences into something entertaining.",
      "\"It was a bit of a front, because if I make a joke about myself, nobody else can. Just accept that's who you are; it's not going to change.\"",
      "At 18, she was offered surgery to reshape her hands, but declined.",
      "\"They admitted they didn't really know if it would help. By then, I'd adapted. I live with daily pain, but I didn't want to risk making things worse.\"",
      "Meeting her now-husband, she initially hid her hands, subtly positioning herself to avoid detection.",
      "Eventually, she told him - through a long message and sending him a link to the 2020 Horizon documentary about the case.",
      "His response? \"It's really not a big deal.\"",
      "Today, she is grateful for the legal battle her family fought. \"It set me up for life,\" she says.",
      "\"I was able to start my own life, and I went to university. I've got my own house and my daughter had the best start in life.\"",
      "'It felt like we were an inconvenience'",
      "Lewis Waterfield was born in 1994 with deformities to both hands.",
      "His father worked near the contaminated site as a roofer, and his pregnant mother often visited him there.",
      "\"My dad noticed something wasn't right straight away,\" Lewis recalls.",
      "As a child, he endured disruptive hospital stays, including an unsuccessful attempt to graft a toe on to his hand to create a functioning finger.",
      "\"I've had extensive surgery, but there are limits to what can be done.\"",
      "During the legal battle, Lewis's parents fought to prove a link between industrial pollution and birth defects.",
      "\"The council, I remember, was dismissive. It felt like we were an inconvenience to them.\"",
      "Now a senior lecturer in public health at the University of Northampton, Lewis acknowledges how his experiences shaped him.",
      "\"Every now and then, someone asks about my hands, and it takes me right back.\" he says.",
      "\"But I don't mind. It's part of who I am.\"",
      "Corby Borough Council ceased to exist in 2021 when it merged with other authorities to become North Northamptonshire Council.",
      "In 2010, its then chief executive, Chris Mallender, issued a formal apology over the scandal.",
      "\"The council extends its deepest sympathy to the children and their families,\" it said.",
      "\"Although I accept that money cannot properly compensate these young people for their disabilities and for all that they've suffered to date and their problems in the future, the council sincerely hopes that this apology, coupled with today's agreement, will mean they can now put their legal battle behind them and proceed with their lives with a greater degree of financial certainty.\"",

    "story": [
      "The UK death rate reached a record low last year, according to exclusive analysis carried out for BBC News.",
      "Mortality experts looked at death certificates registered in 2024 and found that deaths per head of the population had returned to pre-pandemic levels and were slightly below the previous record in 2019.",
      "However, the new figure puts the UK back on its long-term trend of only gradual improvement.",
      "The research was carried out by analysts from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.",
      "What's been happening to death rates?",
      "\"This is five years of basically flat mortality improvement, it's pretty poor by historical standards,\" said Stuart McDonald from the CMI.",
      "There was also a \"concerning\" rise in the death rate at young working ages, he said.",
      "A Department of Health spokesperson said the government was \"shifting focus from sickness to prevention\".",
      "The registered death rate in the UK steadily halved from 1974 to 2011 largely driven by improvements in tackling heart disease, including smoking prevention and medical advances.",
      "From 2011 to 2019 the improvements drastically slowed, then changed direction during Covid as thousands more people died than normal. The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw high numbers of extra deaths.",
      "To calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK.",
      "\"Clearly, it's very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was,\" says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank The King's Fund. \"But if you look at the broader canvas then it's not so good.\"",
      "Although similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UK's has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the \"bottom of the pack of comparable countries,\" she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.",
      "Causes and risk factors",
      "Researchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the \"low hanging fruit\" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.",
      "At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.",
      "Some academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say it's not possible to prove this directly.",
      "Dementia and Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the latest official figures. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years.",
      "\"Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK,\" said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.",
      "\"The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse by the impact of the pandemic on an already overstretched health service.\"",
      "He added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for \"urgent government action\" in its prevention, detection and treatment.",
      "Deaths at younger ages",
      "Overall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.",
      "So the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.",
      "But the CMI found \"really significant differences\" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a \"concerning\" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.",
      "\"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic. If we go back to 2011 we can see a slight increase in death rates year-on-year.\"",
      "UK men and women can expect to live longer, data show",
      "Life expectancy is down but what does this mean?",
      "UK life expectancy progress 'has stopped'",
      "Death numbers among this age group are much lower than at older ages and the causes tend to be different. Fewer than 20,000 people aged 20-44 die in the UK each year, about 3% of all deaths.",
      "\"External and substance-related causes are most important because often that's what people die of in this age group,\" says Antonino Polizzi, researcher at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"Things like drug overdoses, alcohol-related deaths, accidents, homicides and suicides.\"",
      "The UK, particularly Scotland, has seen a rise in drug-related death rates, he says.",
      "\"These causes are usually improving for other Western European countries so we are seeing a divergent effect.\"",
      "Commenting on the overall trends at all age groups, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We inherited an NHS that was broken and we are determined to fix it.",
      "\"Through our Plan for Change we are shifting focus from sickness to prevention and targeting the drivers of ill health and catching the biggest killers earlier.",
      "\"We are creating the first smoke free generation, stopping junk food ads being targeted at children and improving detection of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.\"",
      "About the data",

      "The rate is age-standardised, which means that you can make comparisons with other years even though the UK population as a whole is getting older.",
      "Changes to the death registration process may mean that more 2024 deaths are registered in 2025 than was the case for the previous year, but the CMI says this is not the main explanation for the return to the pre-pandemic trend.",

      "President Trump's decision to pause military aid to Ukraine may well prove to be one of the most significant moments in the conflict since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion.",
      "As far as the UK is concerned, it will not change Sir Keir Starmer's approach, but makes the issues he has been focusing on for the past few days more acute and more urgent.",
      "The prime minister still views his core tasks as finding a way to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together, and drawing up the foundations of a workable peace deal that can be presented to the US.",
      "As we saw in the House of Commons on Monday, where MPs from different parties lined up to laud the prime minister for his sure-footed diplomacy, it is a strategy with broad support across the political spectrum.",
      "But how deep is that support? We may be about to find out.",
      "UK won't be derailed by Ukraine aid freeze - Rayner",
      "Ukraine's shock over US military aid pause",
      "It is one thing for the prime minister to vow to do all he can to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together.",
      "But to be a bridge between both countries, Sir Keir will in time need evidence that he has influence on both sides of that bridge.",
      "Towards the end of his statement in the Commons, the prime minister was asked about US media reports that Trump was considering withdrawing military aid.",
      "He replied that this was not his understanding of the US position. Evidently, this shortly turned out to be wrong.",
      "We now know that at some point later on Monday, Starmer and Trump spoke on the phone - their third phone call in four days.",
      "But we do not know whether Trump gave Starmer prior warning of his decision on military aid or not.",
      "It may be that Starmer tried to persuade Trump not to go ahead and failed. Or it may be that Trump did not tell Starmer what he was about to do.",
      "Neither of those scenarios would be especially positive for the prime minister.",
      "Vance comments row",
      "As it is, it seems Downing Street is still waiting on full details of the US administration's decision and how it will work.",
      "And it is worth stressing that this is a temporary pause in aid, not a permanent cessation. It may simply be another attempt by Trump to pressure Zelensky. The aid may resume.",
      "Or, this may be the clearest example that  - despite the unquestionable warmth Starmer has managed to foster with the US president - the fundamental frames through which they view this conflict and the western alliance more generally are irreconcilably different.",
      "Into this increasingly fraught transatlantic environment has come JD Vance, the US vice-president, scoffing at the idea Ukraine could be protected by \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".",
      "So far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any potential peace deal in Ukraine, and his comments were interpreted by many as having been a jibe at both countries.",
      "Vance has now insisted he was talking about other, unnamed countries - confining the diplomatic fallout for the time being.",
      "Yet even if Vance was referring to other countries which might be willing to take on some of the military burden of protecting Ukraine, it is hardly encouraging for the UK in its convening role in Europe if the response of the US vice-president is to mock their capabilities.",
      "Perhaps that is merely a more blunt-speaking approach from a new US administration determined to do away with niceties.",
      "After all, most European countries are now admitting themselves that their defence spending has been far too low for far too long.",
      "But all the signs suggest that before long, questions about Sir Keir Starmer's approach to Ukraine may give way to much more fundamental questions about Britain's place in a profoundly changed world."

      "In a statement, a UK government spokesperson said that \"no further payments in relation to this policy will be made and Rwanda has waived any additional payments\".",

    "story": [
      "Before he came to the throne, the then Prince Charles had been challenged over whether he could avoid meddling and stay out of politics when he became King.",
      "Now King Charles seems to be in demand as never before to help out the politicians and to get involved, playing an unexpectedly pivotal role in dramatic times for international diplomacy.",
      "He met Canada's PM on Monday in the latest phase of this mixture of bridge building and fire-fighting.",
      "Last week an invitation from the King for a second state visit was offered to President Trump, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer presenting it, with no shortage of flattery, as an \"unprecedented\" sign of friendship and respect.",
      "Then in the fallout of the disastrous Trump meeting with Zelensky in the White House, it was the King, as well as Sir Keir, who embraced the Ukrainian leader and offered a visible image of support for his embattled country.",
      "It was a vital element in the diplomatic balancing act taking place, as the UK government tries to shore up Western support for Ukraine, without alienating and aggravating the Trump administration in the US.",
      "It's placed the double act of King Charles and Sir Keir Starmer at the centre of some huge shifts in international relations.",
      "The King greeting President Zelensky so warmly and publicly, on a visit to Sandringham, was an important message of solidarity that he had not been abandoned and that there was still support for Ukraine, three years after it was invaded by Russia.",
      "With Trump's enthusiasm for the royals, and his evident keenness for a state visit, it provides a diplomatic bridge, with the King keeping open friendly channels with both Trump and Zelensky.",
      "Trump described the King as a \"beautiful man\", as he looked forward to the opulence of a state visit, with its carriage ride up the Mall and glittering banquet. Invitations for such visits are sent by the monarch, but the decisions on who gets invited are made in government.",
      "The King has decades of experience of getting along with people from remarkably different backgrounds and viewpoints. He seems to enjoy chatting to people, asking them about themselves, while saying little about his own views. He's also known generations of previous US leaders, all the way back to visiting Nixon in the White House and meeting Eisenhower at Balmoral.",
      "For King Charles, there has also been a very personal sense of support for Ukraine, he's been outspoken in a way that is unusual. He has attacked the \"indescribable aggression\" against Ukraine, in what he called an \"unprovoked attack on their land\".",
      "Soon after the invasion he went to see refugees arriving in Romania. On visits to France and Germany he singled out the importance of Western allies standing firm with Ukraine to protect democratic values.",
      "He's made repeated visits to meet the Ukrainian community in the UK and last month went to see a project providing medical assistance for injured Ukrainian military personnel.",
      "But these are complicated times for the monarch, not least because as well as being the UK's head of state, King Charles is also the head of state of Canada - and on Monday he faced a different set of agendas when he met Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "The words exchanged in those meetings are not revealed - but as well as discussing Ukraine, there would be no need to guess the other topic of conversation.",
      "\"Nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation,\" said Trudeau ahead of the meeting.",
      "Canada is facing President Trump's calls for his northern neighbour, and longstanding Nato ally, to become the 51st state of the US. This unsurprisingly has deeply angered and offended many Canadians.",
      "They might look to King Charles as their head of state, and head of the Commonwealth too, to strongly speak up for them and to rebuff such expansionist claims from the US president.",
      "Except that from a UK perspective, the King is being deployed to keep President Trump on board and to keep alive the \"special relationship\" between the US and UK. So there will be no appetite for a royal denunciation over Canada.",

      "Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind",
      "Blue and yellow flowers as Queen meets Trudeau",

      "\"I am a 73-year-old proud Canadian and loyal royal supporter. Should the King choose a relationship with Trump over support of Canada, I will be changing my support to withdrawing from the Commonwealth,\" emailed Peggy.",
      "\"I realise the Royal Family don't usually get involved in politics, but this is different and at the moment many here are wondering why we have a King as head of state at all,\" Ann said in an email to the newsletter.",
      "\u200cIt won't be an easy balancing act, when so much of the King's diplomacy has to be in symbols as much as words. He has to speak on the advice of ministers, in Canada and the UK.",
      "It seems like a long time since one of the famous moments of unspoken royal commentary, when the late Queen Elizabeth II stood in front of a big bunch of flowers in the Ukrainian colours of blue and yellow, in the weeks after the Russian invasion.",
      "And who was she meeting? A popular young Canadian prime minister called Justin Trudeau. It was seen as a sign of Western solidarity to support Ukraine.",

      "Attacking the Tories and Plaid Cymru, Drakeford told the Senedd: \"There is no other budget that can be endorsed here this afternoon.\"",

      "The government says it wants to move to a system of home ownership that is more in line with the rest of the world, known as commonhold, where homeowners own a share of and have control over buildings they live in.",
      "Freeholders say leasehold is the \"most effective way of managing large complex apartment buildings\".",
      "The government has yet to set out specific plans for the conversion of current leasehold properties to commonhold, but says it is \"determined\" to make this easier.",
      "A white paper published on Monday stated the sale of new leasehold flats would be banned and commonhold \"reinvigorated\" with a new legal framework.",
      "A draft Leasehold and Commonhold Reform Bill - including the detail of how the new system would work - will be published later this year, the government has said.",
      "The new legislation would apply in England and Wales. There are an estimated five million leasehold properties in England, 70% of which are flats.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook told the BBC the current system is \"inherently unfair\" and reforms are needed to give leaseholders \"better control\" over their homes and associated costs.",
      "Existing leaseholders can feel like they have no control over costs for repairs and maintenance of the outside of their building.",

      "Kasia said she would like more control over her service charges but the government's commonhold proposals were for new builds, so would not help her in her current situation.",
      "Jean Hopkin, another leaseholder who got in touch with the BBC, said the service charge for her three-bedroom flat in Sheffield had increased 356% - from \u00a3106 a month to \u00a3483 in four years - and was unsellable because of the high charges.",

      "Companies responsible for managing buildings have said a rise in costs can be attributed to legitimate expenses including energy prices and higher inflation rates but many leaseholders felt the costs were unfair.",

    "story": [
      "Keir Starmer has lost four senior ministers since coming to power last July.",
      "Although she was not a high profile minister, the departure of Anneliese Dodds is the most significant so far.",
      "She is the first to resign over policy.",
      "Although she says she will support the PM from the backbenches, her letter of resignation delivered a coruscating critique.",
      "She - along with most Labour MPs \u2013 recognises defence spending needs to rise, but she disagrees with how it is being funded.",
      "She suggests that Britain's reputation will be damaged - but she is also denting her leader's.",
      "In effect, she is saying he is being misleading over the effect of the cuts, which will \"remove food and healthcare from desperate people\".",
      "And that while he has made a tactical decision \u2013 essentially, using a defence spending hike to grease the wheels of his meeting with President Trump - she maintains that the PM has made a strategic error which could bolster Russia and China's global influence.",
      "Minister Anneliese Dodds quits over aid cuts",
      "Starmer cuts aid to fund increase in defence spending",
      "This is significant because Dodds is not a usual suspect when it comes to rebelling.",
      "She was initially appointed as Keir Starmer's shadow chancellor when he won the Labour leadership in 2020.",
      "At the time, she would have been something of a political soulmate, backing the policy positions he professed in the leadership contest.",
      "But she remained on the party's so-called 'soft Left' while Sir Keir moved away and strongly backed the approach of his next shadow chancellor \u2013 Rachel Reeves \u2013 and her \"iron clad\" fiscal rules.",
      "Tax and spending",
      "One of the least dramatically-phrased - but potentially most significant - lines in Dodds's resignation letter is when she suggests how more defence spending could be paid for.",
      "She called for a discussion on \"our fiscal rules and approach to taxation\" \u2013 in other words, a debate on tax and borrowing.",
      "Labour MPs have been remarkably disciplined in not publicly opposing policies which privately make them queasy, but there are fears of over forthcoming welfare cuts and there has been discontent over the winter fuel allowance, the two child benefit cap, and lack of compensation for Waspi women.",
      "So will Anneliese Dodds's resignation loosen the tongues of other discontented MPs?",
      "While it was widely expected that Keir Starmer would move robustly away from the politics and poses of the Corbyn years, some of the current contingent of MPs are concerned that he is moving away from commitments made by his predecessors  Tony Blair and Gordon Brown too.",
      "It was Blair who announced the move to the aid target of 0.7% of GDP \u2013 a commitment subsequently delivered by David Cameron despite an era of austerity.",
      "It was Brown who introduced a universal winter fuel payment for pensioners.",
      "For those Labour MPs who have the phrase \"I didn't come into politics to do this\" nagging sotto voce at their conscience, then Tory leader Kemi Badenoch's strong praise for their leader's aid cuts won't have made life any easier.",
      "But the prime minister has inherited a less benign economy than the last Labour government  \u2013 and arguably a more malign world, with 'peace dividends' firmly thrown into  the dustbin of history.",
      "In Keir Starmer's letter responding to Anneliese Dodds's resignation, the PM states that he made \"a difficult and painful decision\" and not one he took lightly.",
      "But it worth noting that it is a decision which is far from universally unpopular in Labour's ranks.",
      "Polling suggests that there is strong support amongst the wider electorate both for a rise in defence spending AND a cut in overseas aid.",
      "Many of the MPs in the so-called Red Wall - those seats lost to the Conservatives in the Midlands and Northern England in 2019 and regained in 2024 \u2013 have seen an increasing challenge from Nigel Farage's Reform UK.",
      "They want to see a greater emphasis on patriotism and a tougher line on immigration.",
      "So apparently putting Britain first \u2013 more spent on defence here, less spending overseas \u2013 will be seen by some as a way of inoculating themselves against the growing threat of Reform.",
      "But with more tough decisions ahead, the remarkable coalition assembled by Labour at the last general election will come under increasing pressure.",
      "Anneliese Dodds was the first to walk away from the top table over policy.",

      "Through cutting what the government describes as \"box-ticking targets\", ministers say GPs will be freed up to take the first steps towards ending the \"8am scramble\" for an appointment.",
      "Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting says that these are the first steps in fixing what he describes as \"a broken NHS\".",
      "\"Over the past decade, funding for GPs has been cut relative to the rest of the NHS, while the number of targets for GPs has soared,\" he said.",
      "\"That's why patients are struggling to get an appointment.",
      "\"This government is cutting the red tape that ties up GPs' time and backing them with an extra \u00a3889m next year.",
      "\"In return, more patients will be able to request appointments online and see their regular doctor for each appointment.\"",
      "Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, who chairs the BMA GPs' committee, says this contract is a good start, but more work is needed.",
      "\"We have shown that we want to work in good faith with this government and build on this new beginning \u2013 what we now need is certainty about our collective future.",
      "\"We know the Treasury will be announcing its funding plans for this Parliament this spring, and we need to see a new substantive GP practice contract for England in the upcoming comprehensive spending review.\"",
      "Dr Bramall-Stainer told BBC Breakfast general practice had been pushed to \"desperation point\" over the last 15 years - with \"thousands\" of GPs leaving.",
      "She explained the \"first signs of green shoots\" patients might see following the new agreed measures would include being able to get to know their doctor and local staff and surgeries advertising for more staff.",
      "She indicated patients would \"potentially\" begin to notice a difference in six to 12 months but insisted that, although a step in the right direction, these new measures are \"nowhere near a solution\".",
      "Dr Steve Taylor, a locum GP in Manchester and spokesperson from the lobbying group Doctors' Association UK, said he fears much of the extra money will have to go towards national insurance contributions, staff and running costs.",
      "Dr Taylor said: \"The new GP contract goes a small way to fix some of the significant issues for GP practices, in that it prevents further declines in funding with a small percentage increase.\"",
      "But  a much larger investment will be needed to build for the future, he added.",
      "Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster and ex-executive member of the doctors' union, the BMA, said he was disappointed with the new contract.",
      "\"There is little in this contract that is going to help patients access care quicker than they do already because it hasn't managed to address the underlying issue of national insurance contributions and the vast sums of money that will need to go towards that,\" he added.",
      "Meanwhile, Azeem Majeed, London GP and professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, said overall, the contract was a positive development.",
      "\"It is good that an agreement has been reached. But a lot of work still needs to be done to improve the lives of patients, GPs and other primary care staff.",
      "\"The priority should be recruiting more nurses and GPs to help increase appointments,\" he said.",
      "\"But it will take some time for people to see improvements from this investment.\""

      "But there was a cloud hanging over the summit amid the gilt-edged grandeur of the former royal townhouse in central London.",
      "It came in the form of a question - was it all worth it? Was this gathering of European powers enough to shift the diplomatic dial? Or had the United States made up its mind to go it alone on finding a ceasefire in Ukraine?",
      "The prime minister's answer was very much that Europe still had a role to play. He said the UK, France and others would work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting and then discuss that plan with the US.",
      "He said Europe would keep military aid flowing now and, in the event of a peace deal, it would boost Ukraine's own defensive capabilities, building up the country's \"armed forces and border defences\" to ensure that \"Ukraine can draw on munitions, finance and equipment to defend itself,\" according to the official conclusions of the summit.",
      "And Sir Keir said there would be a \"coalition of the willing\" to defend Ukraine and guarantee peace.",
      "Who or what that would involve is not yet clear. The prime minister merely said that there would be \"a force consisting of European and other partners\".",
      "The UK and France have already said they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help deter Russian aggression.",
      "The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said the purpose was to turn Ukraine into a \"steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders\".",
      "The aim, it would appear, is to beef up the European offer for post-war security guarantees for Ukraine in an attempt to convince Donald Trump to promise a US military backstop.",
      "The president has thus far been reluctant to go down that route, suggesting the presence of US mining firms on the ground in Ukraine would be enough to keep the peace.",
      "Sir Keir does not share this view, saying explicitly \"to support peace on our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong US backing\".",
      "This summit was in many ways an attempt by Europe to take some ownership of the diplomacy. In recent weeks, efforts to end fighting in Ukraine have been led by Trump speaking to Russian's President Vladimir Putin and at his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky.",

    "summary": "A deal to avoid further trade barriers appears very much on the cards, but challenges remain.",
    "story": [
      "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.",
      "It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.",
      "Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.",
      "There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.",
      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

      "UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House.",
      "Here are some of the key moments as the pair took questions from reporters before and after the talks.",
      "1. A surprise letter to Trump from King Charles",
      "Sir Keir did not turn up to the meeting empty-handed.",
      "Part-way through their opening remarks, the prime minister reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles III - an invitation for a second state visit.",
      "Trump appeared to be genuinely taken back for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"",
      "After taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invitation and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.",
      "He added that King Charles was a \"beautiful man, a wonderful man\".",
      "Follow updates on the Starmer-Trump meeting",

      "Sir Keir said Thursday's invitation to host Trump once more for a second full state visit was \"unprecedented\".",
      "2. Trump wanted to take charge",
      "While cordial, the initial meeting in the Oval Office between Sir Keir and Trump left no doubt that the US president hoped to be firmly in charge.",
      "The meeting was a pattern we've now seen six times with foreign leaders at the Trump White House, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week: Trump taking control of the room and using the opportunity to get his own messages, both domestic and international, across to the reporters there.",
      "Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait",
      "Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait",
      "During their half-hour session, Trump leaned forward and slightly towards Sir Keir - wearing a nearly identical, but slightly different coloured tie to Trump's -  dominating the conversation and taking charge of calling on reporters.",
      "A joint afternoon news conference later began with a slightly more diplomatic and matter-of-fact tone, with both Trump and Sir Keir standing at their respective lecterns and going to considerable lengths to lavish praise on the other.",
      "Trump joked he would have been president 20 years ago with Sir Keir's \"beautiful\" accent.",
      "At one point, Sir Keir was asked about Trump's controversial call to make Canada \u2013 a member of the Commonwealth \u2013 the 51st state of the US.",
      "\"I think you're trying to find a divide that doesn't exist,\" Sir Keir replied.",
      "Trump interjected quickly with the words \"that's enough\" before moving on \u2013 again taking control of the room as he stood next to a visibly surprised Sir Keir.",
      "3. The similarities between Starmer and Trump",
      "To put it gently, Sir Keir and Trump are from different schools of politics - both in their style and substance.",
      "But asked to name their similarities Trump said: \"He loves his country, and so do I.\"",
      "What else do they share? Trump said: \"We like each other, frankly, and we like each other's country.\"",
      "But the \"common thread\" between the two men was that \"we love our country\", Trump said.",
      "4. Starmer a 'tough negotiator'",
      "Sir Keir had a number of tricky topics to raise with Trump - from trade to US security guarantees for Ukraine - and at the beginning of their news conference the president called his counterpart \"a very tough negotiator\".",
      "Asked if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said \"he tried\", adding: \"He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.\"",
      "But he has said there was \"a very good chance\" of a trade deal \"where tariffs wouldn't be necessary\".",
      "Such a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".",
      "Sir Keir spoke of a \"new economic deal with advanced technology at its core\".",
      "5. Trump 'minded' to accept UK's Chagos deal",
      "Trump said he was \"inclined to go along with\" the UK's Chagos Islands deal.",
      "The UK is in talks with Mauritius about handing over the territory but continuing to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase.",
      "The agreement has been mired in uncertainty after Trump's re-election as US president, given several US Republicans have argued it could deliver a potential security boost to China.",
      "But during the meeting, Trump said he had a \"feeling\" the deal was going to \"work out very well\".",
      "6. 'Did I say that?' Trump walks back comments on Zelensky",
      "Last week, Trump made headlines by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator\" in a social media post, echoing Russian claims about Kyiv's cancelled elections.",
      "An election was scheduled for May 2024, but it was suspended because Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia began its full-scale invasion.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason about his use of the word \"dictator\", Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"",
      "In the news conference later, Trump also appeared to have softened his attitude to Zelensky, praising him as \"very brave\" and saying the pair got on \"really well\".",
      "Talking about the potential for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Trump said \"progress towards peace\" would continue when Zelensky visits the White House on Friday. The two are expected to sign a major minerals deal.",
      "7. Starmer hits back at free speech criticism",
      "At the Munich Security Conference last week, US Vice President JD Vance attacked the UK and other European democracies, warning that \"free speech is in retreat.\"",
      "Asked about the comments, Trump called on his deputy to defend himself. Vance argued \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British\" but also \"American technology companies and by extension, American citizens\".",
      "That led to Sir Keir cutting in, saying \"we've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom - and it will last for a very, very long time\".",
      "He rejected Vance's claim, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\".",

      "Andrew Tate rose to fame after appearing on the UK reality show Big Brother, and later making a series of extreme and controversial statements about women and politics on social media.",
      "The pair ran a webcam business and were charged with human trafficking and rape along with two Romanian female suspects in June 2023.",
      "They also face separate, unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking in the UK, and civil suits in the US and UK. They deny all the allegations, which their US lawyer calls \"defamatory and unequivocally false\".",

      "Ingrassia did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.",
      "The Tates have also been talked about by several people in Trump's orbit, including Donald Trump Jr and Elon Musk.",
      "Trump Jr once called Tate's detention in Romania \"absolute insanity\".",
      "Musk reinstated Andrew Tate's account, which had been banned on X, and suggested, perhaps in jest, that Tate would make a good UK prime minister.",
      "Joseph McBride, a lawyer representing the Tates in a defamation case they have filed against several of their accusers in Florida, said in a statement: \"They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president.\"",

      "It's a sprawling scene that includes men who reject the company of women entirely, a \"pick-up artist\" scene filled with tips on how to find casual hookups, and plenty of mainstream podcasts and YouTube channels filled with bro-type humour.",
      "The president's advisers targeted the same audiences during last year's election campaign, when Trump, JD Vance and others in his orbit went on podcasts and did interviews with new media outlets.",
      "The views of the Tate brothers lie at one of the manosphere's extreme edges. Andrew Tate himself has made no secret of his self-described misogynist \u2013 women-hating \u2013 and sexist views.",

    "story": [
      "A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.",
      "A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, \"Where you from, ma'am?\"",
      "\"England.\"",
      "\"Hope you enjoy Estelle,\" he says.",
      "\"Do you?\" I ask.",
      "\"A lot better than where I was before.\"",
      "Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.",
      "Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.",
      "The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.",
      "Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.",
      "Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.",
      "No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.",
      "Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.",
      "He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.",
      "\"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,\" he says. \"If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.\"",
      "Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.",
      "The \"good time credit\" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.",
      "Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.",
      "Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.",
      "\"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,\" he says. \"I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.\"",
      "The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).",
      "The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.",
      "\"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,\" Ms Mahmood says. \"They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.\"",
      "She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. \"It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.\"",
      "The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.",
      "\"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,\" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. \"And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.\"",
      "What would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: \"To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community.\"",
      "As well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of \"diversion programmes\" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.",
      "Violence, overcrowding, self-harm: BBC goes inside one of Britain\u2019s most dangerous prisons",
      "Prison gangs: \u2018I've chopped people,  attacked staff, hidden drugs\u2019",
      "Prison officers deal drugs and ask inmates for sex, BBC told",
      "More people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book.",
      "Even so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle.",
      "\"I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,\" Ms Mahmood says.",
      "It's a plan with \"huge potential in the UK\" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive.",
      "\"It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,\" he says.",
      "But not everyone agrees with incentivising convicted criminals to work towards an early release from prison.",
      "Samantha Nicholls' son was murdered in 2018. Twenty-two year old Joe Pooley was thrown into a river in Ipswich and held under the water. Three people were jailed for his murder in 2021. Joe's mother believes inmates should never be released before their sentence is complete.",
      "\"Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,\" she says. \"It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong.\"",
      "It's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding \u2013 and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers?",
      "The challenge for ministers and the criminal justice system is how to stop the revolving doors on the UK's prisons - the reoffending and lack of prospects facing those who are released which draws them back into crime.",

      "Those are the startling claims being made by a US company that said on Tuesday it had created mice with \"mammoth-like traits\". Colossal Biosciences' eventual goal is to engineer mammoth-like creatures that could help stop arctic permafrost from melting.",
      "Criticism has flooded in, including that engineering mammoth-like creatures is a big stretch from making mice hairier, as well as being unethical, and that the whole project is a publicity stunt.",
      "But the company says it has been misjudged and that the mouse is an important tool on the path to restoring Earth's depleted nature.",
      "Colossal Biosciences says that the experiments with hairy mice was a step towards genetically modifying elephants to be hairy and better able to withstand the cold.",
      "Its stated goal is to create herds of what it calls mammoth-like creatures to live in the arctic tundra. The company says the creatures' grazing habits would encourage grasslands to flourish and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide being released from melting permafrost.",
      "Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which is one of the main drivers of global warming.",
      "But critics say there are significant scientific challenges to overcome before these changes in mice can be tried out on elephants.",
      "Colossal's co-founder and CEO, Ben Lam, told BBC News that the woolly mice marked a big step forward.",
      "\"We are on track to have the first cold adapted elephant by 2028 and that would mean having the first embryos by the end of 2026,\" he said.",
      "\"Over time we are going to have this entire lineage of cold adapted elephants that we can put back into the wild that can interbreed\"",
      "The woolly mice had eight of their genes modified: seven were adapted mice genes related to hair growth and the eighth was a mammoth gene related to increasing body fat.",
      "The researchers found that the animals had longer, curlier hair, but no evidence that the mammoth's fat-increasing gene had an effect.",
      "Colossal Biosciences work has been met with scepticism from scientists not employed by the company. Their concerns include:",

      "In response, the Colossal researchers say they feel misjudged. Their mouse is a tool, they say, with which to test whether different genetic alterations they have planned are effective and safe before they try them out on elephants.",
      "\"Validation that this works is really exciting for this project,\" says the firm's chief science officer, Prof Beth Shapiro.",
      "She adds that the firm has other research programmes running in parallel, such as studying embryo development and creating artificial wombs for the genetically modified elephants to grow in, and which the company says will ensure that they achieve their target of creating cold adapted elephants in a few years.",
      "Prof Shapiro firmly disputes the allegation that the work is pointless. She says that the firm's plan to reintroduce extinct species, such as the Dodo and Tasmanian Tiger, as well as the mammoth, will fill ecological niches that have been lost, and so restore biodiversity and benefit the environment.",
      "The genetic tools it is developing in the meantime are already helping species at risk of extinction, she adds. These include developing a vaccine for elephants against a deadly virus; the creation of genetically modified marsupials in Australia known as quoll to be resistant to neurotoxins produced by the cane toad; and reintroducing genetic diversity in the pink pigeon in Mauritius.",
      "And Prof Shapiro says that elephants won't suffer. The team is developing techniques to screen only viable embryos, and she believes that they won't be treated as outcasts either.",
      "\"We really are only going to be changing a few letters in their DNA code. The elephants will be born to mothers who are not going to see them as freaks because they are going to be very much the same as them, just a lot more hair and can survive colder climates\".",

      "The world's largest iceberg has run aground in shallow waters off the remote British island of South Georgia, home to millions of penguins and seals.",
      "The iceberg, which is about twice the size of Greater London, appears to be stuck and should start breaking up on the island's south-west shores.",
      "Fishermen fear they will be forced to battle with vast chunks of ice, and it could affect some macaroni penguins feeding in the area.",
      "But scientists in Antarctica say that huge amounts of nutrients are locked inside the ice, and that as it melts, it could create an explosion of life in the ocean.",
      "\"It's like dropping a nutrient bomb into the middle of an empty desert,\" says Prof Nadine Johnston from British Antarctic Survey.",
      "Ecologist Mark Belchier who advises the South Georgia government said: \"If it breaks up, the resulting icebergs are likely to present a hazard to vessels as they move in the local currents and could restrict vessels' access to local fishing grounds.\"",
      "The stranding is the latest twist in an almost 40-year story that began when the mega chunk of ice broke off the Filchner\u2013Ronne Ice Shelf in 1986.",
      "We have tracked its route on satellite pictures since December when it finally broke free after being trapped in an ocean vortex.",
      "As it moved north through warmer waters nicknamed iceberg alley, it remained remarkably intact. For a few days, it even appeared to spin on the spot, before speeding up in mid-February travelling at about 20 miles (30km) a day.",
      "\"The future of all icebergs is that they will die. It's very surprising to see that A23a has lasted this long and only lost about a quarter of its area,\" said Prof Huw Griffiths, speaking to BBC News from the Sir David Attenborough polar research ship currently in Antarctica.",
      "On Saturday the 300m tall ice colossus struck the shallow continental shelf about 50 miles (80km) from land and now appears to be firmly lodged.",
      "\"It's probably going to stay more or less where it is, until chunks break off,\" says Prof Andrew Meijers from British Antarctic Survey.",
      "It is showing advancing signs of decay. Once 3,900 sq km (1,500 sq miles) in size, it has been steadily shrinking, shedding huge amounts of water as it moves into warmer seas. It is now an estimated 3,234 sq km.",
      "\"Instead of a big, sheer pristine box of ice, you can see caverns under the edges,\" Prof Meijers says.",
      "Tides will now be lifting it up and down, and where it is touching the continental shelf, it will grind backwards and forwards, eroding the rock and ice.",
      "\"If the ice underneath is rotten - eroded by salt - it'll crumble away under stress and maybe drift somewhere more shallow,\" says Prof Meijers.",
      "But where the ice is touching the shelf, there are thousands of tiny creatures like coral, sea slugs and sponge.",
      "\"Their entire universe is being bulldozed by a massive slab of ice scraping along the sea floor,\" says Prof Griffiths.",
      "That is catastrophic in the short-term for these species, but he says that it is a natural part of the life cycle in the region.",
      "\"Where it is destroying something in one place, it's providing nutrients and food in other places,\" he adds.",
      "There had been fears for the islands' larger creatures. In 2004 an iceberg in a different area called the Ross Sea affected the breeding success of penguins, leading to a spike in deaths.",
      "But experts now think that most of South Georgia's birds and animals will escape that fate.",
      "Some Macaroni penguins that forage on the shelf where the iceberg is stuck could be affected, says Peter Fretwell at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "The iceberg melts freshwater into salt water, reducing the amount of food including krill (a small crustacean) that penguins eat.",
      "The birds could move to other feeding grounds, he explains, but that would put them in competition with other creatures.",
      "The ice could block harbours or disrupt sailing when the fishing season starts in April.",

      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

    "summary": "How a new atomic clock might be the way to tackle attacks on plane GPS systems",
    "story": [
      "As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion.",
      "The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by \"GPS signal interference\".",
      "This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank \u2013 though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory.",
      "The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill.",
      "To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are.",
      "Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks.",
      "The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at \u00a31.4bn each day \u2013 no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats.",
      "With this in mind, a group of British scientists \u2013 dubbed the \"Time Lords\" \u2013 has been asked to come up with a solution.",
      "The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself \u2013 all within a few years.",
      "In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking \u2013 and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent.",
      "A new way of measuring time",
      "The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration.",
      "Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem \u2013 and the impact could be at least as transformative.",
      "\"History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,\" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London.",
      "In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation.",
      "The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation.",
      "The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison.",
      "But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices.",
      "\"We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,\" he says. \"So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced.\"",
      "The 'Time Lords'",
      "Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the \"Time Lords\" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium.",
      "GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab.",
      "The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves.",
      "When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis.",
      "\"The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time.",
      "Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over \u2013 though that would take longer. \"To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. \"The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,\" he says. \"There is no guarantee GPS \u2026 will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it.\"",
      "While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as \"further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum\". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and \"the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged\".",
      "By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming.",
      "But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes.",
      "Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, \"where there's a bit more space\".",
      "Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around \u00a3100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems.",
      "GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons.",
      "\"We are harnessing atoms,\" she points out.",
      "\"You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed\".",
      "Atomic clocks in our pockets",
      "The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones.",
      "This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going.",
      "QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone.",
      "That process isn't going to happen soon, though. \"This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship \u2013 his greatest difficulty was to make it small.",

      "But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea.",
      "\"Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,\" says another DSTL scientist.",
      "\"As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity.\"",
      "Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong.",
      "Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough?",
      "One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy \u2013 transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.",

      "But now Agne\u0300s Pannier-Runacher, the French ecology minister, said she would speak to colleagues in Spain, Italy and Greece about creating a different sanctuary together. However, her proposal has few other details and has been criticised.",

      "Loro Parque, a marine zoo in Spain that wants to receive the killer whales from Marineland, told the BBC this week the current proposal was \"wholly unsuitable\" and that they were best positioned to care for them.",
      "Christoph Kiessling, vice-president of the facility in Tenerife, said whale sanctuaries were \"currently unable to meet the complex physiological, social and environmental needs\" of killer whales.",

      "Managers at the marine zoo said scientific examination of those orcas by the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria showed the deaths were unavoidable.",

      "Katheryn Wise, from the charity World Animal Protection, said Loro Parque was ultimately an entertainment business that used orcas to make money.",
      "She added: \"Morgan's pregnancy underlines the fact that Loro Parque could never be a suitable option for Wikie and Keijo and should be removed as an option.\"",
      "Marineland, who are still paying to look after the orcas, said a move to Loro Parque as soon as possible was in the best interests of the animals' welfare. They have asked the ecology ministry to approve the transfer.",

      "The whale sanctuary in Canada applied to the French government to take in the orcas last year but their bid was rejected in January.",

      "They wrote a letter to her in which they cited Dr David Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n, a diplomate at the European College of Zoological Medicine, who said: \"Wikie and Keijo's origin is Iceland. These two orcas do not belong to the ecotypes seen in the Mediterranean.\"",
      "He added: \"The possibility of building a sanctuary for them in the Mediterranean is probably the worst of the possible options.\"",
      "The directors also said, unlike the European proposal, their sanctuary was ready to begin construction as the design had already been finalised.",

      "Beavers will be released into the wild in England after the government approved their reintroduction.",
      "The decision follows years of trials and will see beavers make an officially approved return to waterways.",
      "Hunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.",
      "But some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.",
      "It's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.",
      "Conservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream.",
      "\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon.",
      "\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.",
      "The beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England.",
      "It says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure.",
      "That's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.",
      "NFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\".",
      "\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"",
      "We met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".",
      "Since then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.",
      "\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.",
      "\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"",
      "Along the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.",
      "Not everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.",
      "Clinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.",
      "\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.",
      "\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"",
      "Scotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.",
      "The first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly 2,000 years after a young man died in the Vesuvius volcanic eruption, scientists have discovered that his brain was preserved when it turned to glass in an extremely hot cloud of ash.",
      "Researchers found the glass in 2020 and speculated that it was a fossilised brain but did not know how it had formed.",
      "The pea-sized chunks of black glass were found inside the skull of the victim, aged about 20, who died when the volcano erupted in 79 AD near modern-day Naples.",
      "Scientists now believe a cloud of ash as hot as 510C enveloped the brain then very quickly cooled down, transforming the organ into glass.",
      "It is the only known case of human tissue - or any organic material - turning to glass naturally.",
      "\"We believe that the very specific conditions that we have reconstructed for the vitrification [the process of something turning into glass] of the brain make it very difficult for there to be other similar remains, although it is not impossible,\" Prof Guido Giordano from Universit\u00e0 Roma Tre told BBC News.",
      "\"This is a unique finding,\" he said.",
      "The brain belonged to a man killed in his bed inside a building called the Collegium on the main street of the Roman city Herculaneum.",
      "The fragments of glass found by the scientists range from 1-2 cm to just few millimetres in size.",
      "The massive eruption of Vesuvius engulfed Herculaneum and nearby Pompeii where up to 20,000 people lived. The remains of about 1,500 people have been found.",
      "Scientists now think the hot ash cloud descended from Vesuvius first, probably causing most of the deaths.",
      "A fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter, also called a pyroclastic flow, followed, burying the area.",
      "Experts believe the ash cloud turned the man's brain into glass because the pyroclastic flow would not have reached high enough temperatures or cooled quickly enough.",
      "The process of glass formation requires very specific temperature conditions and rarely occurs naturally.",
      "For a substance to turn to glass, there must be a huge temperature difference between the substance and its surrounding.",
      "Its liquid form has to cool fast enough not to crystallise when it becomes solid, and it must be at a much higher temperature than its surroundings.",
      "The team used imaging with x-rays and electron microscopy to conclude that the brain must have been heated to at least 510C before cooling rapidly.",
      "No other parts of the man's body are believed to have turned to glass.",
      "Only material containing some liquid can turn to glass, meaning that the bones could not have vitrified.",
      "Other soft tissues, like organs, were likely destroyed by the heat before they could cool down enough to turn to glass.",

    "story": [
      "Skype, the video-calling service that had hundreds of millions of users, is closing in May, its owner Microsoft has said.",
      "It was once one of the world's most popular websites and allowed people to make voice calls via their computers to friends and family all over the globe for free.",
      "Skype was not the first or only company offering this service but by allowing the public to make computer-to-computer calls free, it helped popularise the concept.",
      "In an announcement on X, Skype said users can sign in to Microsoft Teams with their account to stay connected with all their chats and contacts.",
      "Microsoft made no immediate comment when contacted by BBC News.",
      "First released in 2003, Skype was bought by the tech giant in 2011 for $8.5bn (\u00a36.1bn) - its biggest-ever acquisition at the time.",
      "As Microsoft once outlined, Skype became integrated with the company's other products such as Xbox and Windows devices.",

      "\"My best friend and I share many good memories on Skype,\" one X user said. \"This is a sad day and almost a feeling of losing yet another fragment of my adolescence.\"",
      "Another early user of Skype called Louise told the BBC she and her partner used the service to chat when they \"embarked on a transatlantic relationship\".",
      "\"Skype was such an exciting invention at the time - before smartphones and WhatsApp calls,\" she said.",
      "\"It's so easy to assume that we've always been able to freely talk to people across the world but that's such a recent development really.\"",
      "Anna Simpson, from digital marketing firm Cedarwood Digital, posted on LinkedIn that she would video-call her grandparents on Skype after they moved to France nearly 20 years ago.",
      "\"Back then, it felt like magic,\" she wrote. \"There were no dodgy international call charges, just a quick dial-up and some pixelated faces keeping us connected.",
      "\"Skype led the way for video calls. But now it's officially done. Microsoft is pulling the plug, but honestly... it's been on life support for years.\"",
      "So what happened?",
      "When Microsoft bought Skype, the company was buying into an app that had been downloaded one billion times and had hundreds of millions of users.",
      "\"Together we will create the future of real-time communications,\" Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer said at the time.",
      "But as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger grew in popularity, Skype was waning.",
      "In 2017, Microsoft redesigned Skype, with some features looking very much like rival Snapchat. Users were not happy.",
      "At the time, Rachel Kaser, a reporter at The Next Web, said: \"People are annoyed by this update to the Skype app because it's fixing something that was never broken to begin with.\"",
      "In June 2021, speculation persisted that it was the beginning of the end for Skype.",
      "When Microsoft announced Windows 11, its new operating system, it stated that Microsoft Teams would be integrated by default, while Skype, for the first time in years, was not.",
      "Teams had seen a boost in popularity during the Covid pandemic as people moved their work and personal meetings online.",
      "As the news of Skype's closure was announced, Microsoft published a blog post from Jeff Teper, the company's president of collaborative apps and platforms.",
      "In it, he said the company wants to streamline its free services to focus on Teams.",
      "\"With Teams, users have access to many of the same core features they use in Skype, such as one-on-one calls and group calls, messaging, and file sharing,\" he said.",
      "\"Additionally, Teams offers enhanced features like hosting meetings, managing calendars, and building and joining communities for free.\"",
      "Skype users now have a choice \u2013 move over to Microsoft Teams or export their Skype data including chats, contacts and call history, the post added.",
      "For Skype customers who pay for some features, Microsoft said they will be able to use their service up until their next renewal period."

    "summary": "The prototype chip it dubs Ocelot follows similar announcements by Microsoft and Google",
    "story": [
      "Amazon has become the third tech giant in as many months to announce a breakthrough in quantum computing - a technology that promises vast processing power but is beset by technical difficulties.",
      "The firm has unveiled Ocelot a prototype chip built on \"cat qubit\" technology - an approach that derives its name from the famous \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment.",
      "The chip seeks to address one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the development of quantum computers - making them error free.",
      "Amazon says, taken alongside other recent breakthroughs in the industry, its work means useful quantum computers are likely to be with us sooner than previously thought.",
      "But how quickly these machines will be powerful enough to be practically useful for a range of commercial applications is a matter of debate among experts.",
      "Oskar Painter of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, where the work was carried out, told the BBC that recent progress meant an \"aggressive date\" of a decade was now \"looking more and more realistic\".",
      "\"Five years ago I would have said maybe 20 or 30 years\", he said but added \"this timeline's come in quite a bit.\"",
      "Ultimately AWS, which provides cloud computing services, would like to offer quantum computing services to its customers, but Mr Painter also said he believed the advanced machines could eventually help optimise the vast global logistics of Amazon's retail business.",
      "\"You know, a company like Amazon, you make a one percent improvement in that and you're talking large dollars right? Quantum computers could enable you to do that more effectively, more real time - and that's the real value there,\" he explained.",
      "What is a cat qubit?",
      "Quantum computers solve problems by exploiting the strange properties of matter and energy at very small scales, as described by the science of quantum physics.",
      "Quantum computers won't replace so-called \"classical\" computers, but promise to be able to solve problems even the most powerful modern computers cannot - yielding new discoveries such as better batteries and new medicines.",
      "But that potential is being held up by the problem of errors.",
      "Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise in their environment - vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference from mobile phones and WIFI networks, or even cosmic rays and radiation from outer space can all cause them to make errors, which then need to be corrected.",
      "Cat qubits are one attempt at solving this problem by engineering error resistance into the design of the qubits it uses.",
      "Qubits are the fundamental elements of quantum computers, the equivalent of bits in the computers most of us use today.",
      "Cat qubits are named in honour of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, whose cat-in-a-box question in 1935 helped illuminate some of the thinking behind quantum theory.",
      "Amazon believes the new chip, which has just five cat qubits out of a total of 14 key components, could reduce the costs of correcting quantum errors by up to 90%, compared to current approaches.",
      "The technology of cat qubits isn't exclusive to Amazon, a French company named Alice & Bob carried out pioneering work on the tech and continues to evolve the technology.",
      "Mazyar Mirrahimi director of research at the French national technology research institute, Inria said Ocelot was \"an important step forward towards hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation\".",
      "Amazon believes the new chip offers a path to scaling up to more powerful machines with this type of error proofing built in, but researchers admit there are many challenges ahead.",
      "Michael Cuthbert director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre welcomed the progress Amazon had made but told the BBC it remained to be seen the effect it would have on the speed with which the industry is able to develop really useful quantum computers:",
      "\"Error correction is a vital step necessary in the long-term development of quantum computing. It is the crucial step that turns quantum computing into a practical and commercial tool we can use to solve complex problems in chemistry, materials science, medicine, logistics and energy.\"",
      "\"Part of the challenge is how to scale the revolutionary technology efficiently \u2013 mechanisms that enable error correction without huge overheads in chip size, energy consumption and systems complexity are really welcome.\"",

      "Pivot point",
      "Amazon joins Microsoft and Google in announcing a new experimental chip. But is this flurry of announcements the result of clever research or clever PR? Or is it  coincidence, the tech equivalent of the saying buses always come in threes?",
      "Heather West follows the quantum computing industry as a research manager for the International Data Corporation and was briefed on the new chip by Amazon in advance of publication.",
      "She describes Amazon's results as an \"advancement\" rather than a breakthrough.",
      "All three recent announcements have focused on reducing errors, and she tells me the industry is \"pivoting\" from a focus on the number of qubits to a focus the \"ability to use these these systems at scale to solve real world life problems. And by doing so we need to be able to solve the error correction within the quantum systems\".",

    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",

This is widely seen by Arab states, and many others, as the only lasting solution to this perpetual conflict, but it is firmly ruled out by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies.",
      "This new plan proposes that Gaza would be run, temporarily, by a \"Gaza management committee under the umbrella of the Palestinian government\" comprised of qualified technocrats.",
      "It glosses over the issue of what role, if any, Hamas, will play. There is a vague reference to the \"obstacle\" of militant groups and said this issue would be resolved if the causes of the conflict with Israel were removed.",
      "Some Arab states are known to be calling for the complete dismantling of Hamas; others believe those decisions should be left up to the Palestinians. Hamas is said to have accepted it will not play a role in running Gaza but has made it clear that disarming is a red line.",
      "Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has described President Trump's plan as \"visionary\", has repeatedly ruled out any future role for Hamas, but also for the Palestinian Authority.",
      "The other sensitive issue of security was dealt with by calling on the UN Security Council to deploy international peacekeepers.",

      "Wealthy Gulf states appear willing to foot some of the colossal bill. But no one is ready to invest unless they are absolutely convinced buildings won't come crashing down in another war.",
      "A fragile ceasefire which now seems to be on the brink of collapse will only amplify that hesitation.",
      "This new Arab plan to rebuild Gaza would unfold in three phases including an initial period of about six months, called the early recovery stage, to start clearing the massive amounts of rubble as well as unexploded ordinance. Two subsequent stages would last several years.",
      "During this time displaced Palestinians, said to number 1.5 million, would be housed in temporary containers. Photographs in the glossy brochure present them as well-built and designed housing units set in pretty landscaped areas.",

      "The US President deepened the shock and anger around his ideas when he posted an AI-generated video of a golden Gaza on his Truth Social account which featured a shimmering statue of himself, his close ally Elon Musk enjoying snacks on the beach, and he and the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu sunning themselves, shirtless. All to a catchy tune, with lines like \"Trump Gaza is finally here\".",
      "\"They had President Trump in mind,\" remarked one Western diplomat who attended a briefing about Egypt's plan at the foreign ministry in Cairo. \"It's very glossy and very well-prepared.\"",

      "Unicef has been providing safe spaces for children through a network of local activists who have set up what are known as Emergency Response Rooms to deal with the crises in their communities.",

      "Congress finally approved the \u00a360bn aid package in the spring of 2024. It was just in time - Ukraine was struggling to fend off a renewed Russian offensive in Kharkiv. The arrival of the delayed US weapons helped turn the tide.",
      "As in 2024, it may be months before the effects of cutting off US aid are felt  \u2013 at least in terms of ammunition and hardware. European nations have slowly ramped up their production of artillery shells. Overall Europe now provides Ukraine with 60 percent of its aid \u2013 more than the US.",
      "However, US military support is still vital to Ukraine. One Western official recently described it as  \"the cream\" in terms of weapons.",
      "Ukraine's ability to protect its people and cities has heavily relied on sophisticated US air defence systems \u2013 such as Patriot batteries and NASAMS \u2013 jointly developed with Norway.",

      "Doctors in Gaza had urged the family to agree to have both of his legs amputated. But his eight-year-old brother, Abdul Salam, had already lost his lower right leg due to his injuries and their mother, Islam, begged the surgeons to save Rami's limbs.",

      "They're grateful for their treatment, but both he and his mother want to return home as soon as they can.",
      "\"Gaza is beautiful,\" Rami told me. \"In Gaza before the war, we used to have medical treatment, but then the aid stopped.\"",
      "With the facilities and expertise at the MSF hospital, he's now making quick progress.",
      "\"He arrived in a wheelchair,\" says his physiotherapist, Zaid Alqaisi, who has formed a strong bond with Rami while helping him to walk again.",

      "He also wants to swim again in the sea in Gaza.",
      "But many more operations lie ahead, and Rami and his mother have no idea when they will return home.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:01:51 GMT",
    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

    "story": [
      "From dazzling costumes to exuberant parties, Trinidad's carnival is often dubbed \"the greatest show on Earth\".",
      "But some of its elements are not exactly eco-friendly and the festivities are estimated to produce 3.4 tonnes of waste every year according to Carnicycle, a local initiative aiming to make festivities more sustainable.",
      "Danii McLetchie, who co-founded Carnicycle in 2018, says that while carnival \"is a big part of our culture\" it also has a very negative environmental impact \"from the events, to the textiles, to costumes\" used by the masqueraders, spectators and vendors taking part in the annual parade on the two days preceding Ash Wednesday.",
      "Producing and transporting just a single carnival costume bra can generate approximately 37.68kg (83lb) of CO2 emissions, Carnicycle estimates based on calculations made using an online tool provided by Swedish tech company Doconomy.",
      "Danii and her team are working to have that estimate verified by a third party, but with tens of thousands of masqueraders parading every year, she says the amount of emissions is cause for concern.",
      "To reduce those emissions, Carnicycle has started a recycling programme, collecting unused costumes that would have been dumped or burned by masquerade bands, which use new costume designs every year.",
      "Carnicycle also puts up collection bins at hotels and other venues so discarded costumes can be reused.",
      "\"Up until last year we collected around 10,000 pieces of costume materials,\" Danii told the BBC, describing the arduous task of completely stripping down truckloads of costumes to preserve feathers, beads and other materials for future use.",
      "The salvaged materials are sold to costume designers, ravers, and people in the burlesque industry, who save by buying second hand.",
      "Carnicycle also rents out the large backpack pieces which are a popular part of the costumes worn at Trinidad's carnival. Their price can run up to $700 (\u00a3550), depending on size.",
      "Danii explains that they came up with the idea after hearing revellers complain not just about the expense but also about the weight of the backpack pieces. \"'I'm paying this much money but then it's heavy and by the time it's lunch I just want to throw it away',\" Danni recalls people saying.",
      "Carnicycle rents the backpacks to masqueraders long enough so that they can pose for photos, but are freed from carrying their load during the parade.",
      "Danii and Carnicycle's co-founder Luke Harris \u2013 who both hold down full-time jobs in addition to their environmental initiative - are not the only ones dedicating their spare time to making Trinidad's carnival both fun and eco-friendly",
      "Lawyer Aliyah Clarke and fashion designer Kaleen Sanois started a side business called 2nd Closet - a pop-up thrift shop where people can buy and sell pre-owned clothing.",
      "The two have also been making video tutorials with tips on how to transform costumes into beachwear and outfits for other occasions.",
      "Aliya told the BBC it was something she first did for herself: \"After I was finished with my costume I would rip it apart, literally down to the wire, and figure out how to make this into something else to wear outside of carnival.\"",
      "Now she is sharing her ideas in a video segment the two millennials have dubbed \"Tipsy Tuesday\".",
      "They also offer a closet-sorting service, which involves coming to a person's home and sorting through unwanted clothing, to rescue items fit for sale at their pop-up thrift shop.",
      "In what Kaleen believes is a testament to the work they have been doing, they were asked to sort the sprawling closet of Machel Montano, a musician known as the \"King of Soca\" and a superstar in the carnival world.",
      "\"Clothes are personal things, especially for somebody like Machel who has so many big moments tied to his pieces,\" Kaleen explains.",
      "After sorting through Machel's shoes and clothes, 2nd Closet organised a two-day pop-up shop, giving people a chance to buy items worn by Machel on stage and in his music videos.",
      "\"People came with pictures, and were like 'I'm looking for this piece',\" Aliyah recalls of fans' enthusiasm for the second-hand items.",
      "But costumes and outfits are not the only items being recycled to make Trinidad's festivities more environmentally friendly.",
      "At Fete with the Saints, a party many regard as one of the best of Trinidad's carnival, food is eaten with biodegradable wooden cutlery and the drinks are poured into reusable cups.",
      "The organisers of the fete -  a fundraiser for one of Trinidad and Tobago's top secondary schools \u2013 also hire \"bin detectives\" to ensure patrons properly sort and dispose their rubbish for recycling.",
      "It is estimated that this year the bin detectives helped to more than double the amount of recyclables captured, compared with the two previous years combined.",
      "\"Over the past three years we've actually prevented over one million single-use plastics from entering the landfill, I think maybe over five tonnes of glass,\" says Vandana Mangroo, co-founder of Close the Loop Caribbean, a company which started working with the organisers of Fete with the Saints in 2023 to make the event more sustainable.",
      "Joseph Hadad, co-chairman of the party's organising committee, says that those behind the event knew that their efforts to make it greener would \"add some layer of costs and more labour\". But he is adamant \"it worked\" and insists that the party spirit has not been dampened.",

    "summary": "India faces a crucial choice in modernising its air force. But is a cutting-edge US fighter jet the answer?",
    "story": [
      "India faces a crucial choice in modernising its air force - but is a cutting-edge American fighter jet the answer?",
      "During his Washington visit last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met US President Donald Trump, who announced they were \"paving the way\" for India to acquire F-35s, a jet primarily sold to close allies and partners.",
      "The F-35 is a \"fifth-generation\" multi-role fighter jet with advanced sensors, AI-driven combat systems and seamless data-sharing capabilities. Built to evade radar, it's the most sophisticated jet in the skies - but at $80m a pop, also one of the most expensive. (Stealth is a key characteristic of a \"fifth-generation\" fighter.)",
      "Many believe that with its fighter squadrons dwindling and China's military growing, India faces a high-stakes choice: splurge on the state-of-the-art but costly F-35 from the US or strengthen defence ties with Russia through local production of its most advanced stealth fighter jet Sukhoi Su-57.",
      "Experts believe the reality is more nuanced, with the US-Russia \"dogfight\" largely a media hype \u2013 fuelled more recently by the appearance of both jets at Asia's biggest air show, Aero India, in the southern city of Bengaluru last month.",
      "Trump's F-35 offer seems more \"symbolic\" than practical, driven by his push to sell US weapons, according to Ashley J Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "Integrating a \"fifth generation\" aircraft into the India air force (IAF) plans - centred on the homegrown Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) and more Rafales - would be challenging, especially without co-production rights. Being developed by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the AMCA is India's own stealth fighter.",
      "\"It is unlikely that the F-35 will be offered for co-production to India - any acquisition will likely be a straightforward sale. This is unlikely, among other things, to sit well with Modi's emphasis on making in India and the significant end-user monitoring in the event of an F-35 sale will likely not be welcomed by India either,\" Mr Tellis told me.",
      "India's challenges with the F-35 are its steep cost, heavy maintenance and operational issues - the jet's availability is around 51% for the US Air Force, according to  security expert Stephen Bryen, author of a Substack column, Weapons and Strategy. \"The question is whether India is willing to invest billions of rupees in the F-35, knowing it could do better buying the Russian jet.\"",
      "But many dismiss the Su-57 as a real contender, noting that India exited the decade-long programme to co-produce the jet with Russia in 2018 over disputes on technology transfer, cost-sharing and specifications.",
      "To be sure, India's air force is ageing and short on fighter jets.",
      "It operates 31 fighter and combat squadrons - mostly Russian and Soviet-era aircraft - far below the sanctioned 42. A key challenge is finding a long-term replacement for the Sukhoi-30, the IAF's versatile workhorse from Russia.",
      "Christopher Clary, a political scientist at the University of Albany, recently pointed to unsettling data from the ISS Military Balance for India: between 2014 and 2024, China added 435 fighter and ground attack aircraft, Pakistan gained 31, while India's fleet shrank by 151.",
      "India's planned fighter jet expansion is largely homegrown, with plans to acquire over 500 jets, mostly light combat aircraft.",
      "Orders for 83 Tejas Mark 1A - an agile multirole homegrown fighter - are confirmed, with another 97 expected to be ordered shortly. Meanwhile, the heavier, more advanced Mark 2 is in development. The homegrown stealth jet remains at least a decade away.",
      "India also has plans to buy 114 multirole fighter jets under the IAF's $20bn Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA) programme requiring foreign jets to be built in India under a transfer of technology deal - its biggest hurdle.",
      "Stalled since 2019, the Indian government is looking at a transparent and non-controversial procurement process after it faced criticism over the acquisition of 36 Rafales in a government-to-government deal. Five jets are in contention, with Rafale leading as it is already in service with the IAF.",
      "Experts say India's air force modernisation faces three key hurdles: funding, delays and dependence on foreign jets.",
      "Defence spending has shrunk in real terms. The foreign fighter jets programme risks a drawn-out fate. While India prioritises home-made, DRDO's delays force stopgap foreign purchases, creating a repeating cycle. Breaking it requires delivering a capable homegrown jet on time. Deliveries are also delayed due to a holdup in supplies of General Electric's F-404 engines for the jets.",
      "A key challenge is the mismatch between the defence ministry's vision and the IAF's needs, says Rahul Bhatia, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting firm.",
      "The Tejas Mark 1 faced early scepticism from the air force, leading to upgrades like the Mark 1A and Mark 2. \"But the decades-long development cycles frustrate the armed forces, especially as their requirements keep evolving as newer technologies become available, which in turn contributes to further delays,\" Mr Bhatia told me.",
      "Even the Indian Air Force chief AP Singh has made no secret of his frustration over delays.",
      "\"I can take a vow that I will not buy anything from outside or I will wait for whatever is developed in India, but it may not be possible if it does not come at that pace [on time],\" Air Marshall Singh told a seminar recently.",
      "\"At the moment, we all know that we are very badly off when it comes to numbers [of fighters]. And the numbers which were promised are also coming a little slow. So, there will be a requirement to go and look for something which can quickly fill up these voids,\" he said, referring to the delayed Tejas Mark 1A deliveries, which were supposed to begin last February but have yet to start.",
      "India's clear priority is a homegrown stealth fighter, with more than $1bn already committed to its development. \"A foreign stealth jet would only be considered if India's immediate threat perception shifts,\" says Mr Bhatia. China has two so-called stealth fighters - the J-20 and J-35 - but they likely fall short of US standards.",
      "Most experts believe India will choose neither the American nor Russian fighters. \"In the short term, as seen in past conflicts, emergency buys may fill gaps. The medium-term focus is co-production, but the long game is clear - building its own,\" says Mr Bhatia.",
      "For India, the future of airpower isn't just about buying jets - it's about building them, ideally with a strong Western partner. But for that vision to succeed, India must deliver its homegrown fighters on time."

At least 20% of those deported from Islamabad and Rawalpindi had documentation from the UN Refugee Agency, meaning they were recognised as people in need of international protection.",
      "But Pakistan is not a party to the Refugee Convention and has previously said it does not recognise Afghans living in the country as refugees. The government has said its policies are aimed at all illegal foreign nationals and a deadline for them to leave is looming. That date has fluctuated but is now set to 31 March for those without valid visas, and 30 June for those with resettlement letters.",
      "Many Afghans are terrified amid the confusion. They also say the visa process can be difficult to navigate. Nabila's family believes they have only one option: to hide. Her father Hamid served in the Afghan military, before the Taliban takeover in 2021. He broke down in tears describing his sleepless nights.",
      "\"I have served my country and now I'm useless. That job has doomed me,\" he said.",
      "His family are without visas, and are not on a resettlement list. They tell us their phone calls to the UN's refugee agency go unanswered.",
      "The BBC has reached out to the agency for comment.",
      "The Taliban government has previously told the BBC all Afghans should return because they could \"live in the country without any fear\". It claims these refugees are \"economic migrants\".",
      "But a UN report in 2023 cast doubt on assurances from the Taliban government. It found hundreds of former government officials and armed forces members were allegedly killed despite a general amnesty.",
      "The Taliban government's guarantees are of little reassurance to Nabila's family so they choose to run when authorities are nearby. Neighbours offer each other shelter, as they all try to avoid retuning to Afghanistan.",
      "The UN counted 1,245 Afghans being arrested or detained in January across Pakistan, more than double the same period last year.",
      "Nabila says Afghans shouldn't be forced out. \"Don't kick Afghans out of their homes - we're not here by choice, we are forced to be here.\"",
      "There is a feeling of sadness and loneliness in their home. \"I had a friend who was here and then was deported to Afghanistan,\" Nabila's mother Maryam says.",
      "\"She was like a sister, a mother. The day we were separated was a difficult day.\"",
      "I ask Nabila what she wants to do when she's older. \"Modelling,\" she says, giving me a serious look. Everyone in the room smiles. The tension thaws.",
      "Her mother whispers to her there are plenty of other things she could be, an engineer or a lawyer. Nabila's dream of modelling is one she could never pursue under the Taliban government. With their restrictions on girls' education, her mother's suggestions would also prove impossible.",
      "A new phase",
      "Pakistan has a long record of taking in Afghan refugees. But cross-border attacks have surged and stoked tension between the two neighbours. Pakistan blames them on militants based in Afghanistan, which the Taliban government denies. Since September 2023, the year Pakistan launched its \"Illegal Foreigners' Repatriation Plan,\" 836,238 individuals have now been returned to Afghanistan.",
      "Amidst this current phase of deportations, some Afghans are being held in the Haji camp in Islamabad. Ahmad was in the final stages of the United States' resettlement programme. He tells us when President Donald Trump suspended it for review, he extinguished Ahmad's \"last hope\". The BBC has seen what appears to be his employment letter by a Western, Christian non-profit group in Afghanistan.",
      "A few weeks ago, when he was out shopping, he received a call. His three-year-old daughter was on the line. \"My baby called, come baba police is here, police come to our door,\" he says. His wife's visa extension was still pending, and she was busy pleading with the police.",
      "Ahmad ran home. \"I couldn't leave them behind.\" He says he sat in a van and waited hours as police continued their raids. The wives and children of his neighbours continued trickling into the vehicle. Ahmad began receiving calls from their husbands, begging him to take care of them. They had already escaped into the woods.",
      "His family was held for three days in \"unimaginable conditions\", says Ahmad, who claims they were only given one blanket per family, and one piece of bread per day, and that their phones were confiscated.  The Pakistani government says it ensures \"no one is mistreated or harassed during the repatriation process\".",
      "We attempt to visit inside Haji camp to verify Ahmad's account but are denied entry by authorities. The BBC approached the Pakistani government and the police for an interview or statement, but no one was made available.",
      "Scared of being detained or deported, some families have chosen to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Others tell us they simply can't afford to.",
      "One woman claims she was in the final stages of the US resettlement scheme and decided to move with her two daughters to Attock, 80km (50 miles) west of Islamabad. \"I can barely afford bread,\" she says.",
      "The BBC has seen a document confirming she had an interview with the IOM in early January. She claims her family is still witnessing almost daily raids in her neighbourhood.",
      "A spokesman for the US embassy in Islamabad has said it is in \"close communication\" with Pakistan's government \"on the status of Afghan nationals in the US resettlement pathways\".",
      "Outside Haji camp's gates, a woman is waiting. She tells us she has a valid visa but her sister's has expired. Her sister is now being held inside the camp, along with her children. The officers would not let her visit her family, and she is terrified they will be deported. She begins weeping, \"If my country was safe, why would I come here to Pakistan? And even here we cannot live peacefully.\"",
      "She points to her own daughter who is sitting in their car. She was a singer in Afghanistan, where a law states women cannot be heard speaking outside their home, let alone singing. I turn to her daughter and ask if she still sings. She stares. \"No.\""

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 00:39:34 GMT",
    "summary": "How a new atomic clock might be the way to tackle attacks on plane GPS systems",
    "story": [
      "As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion.",
      "The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by \"GPS signal interference\".",
      "This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank \u2013 though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory.",
      "The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill.",
      "To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are.",
      "Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks.",
      "The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at \u00a31.4bn each day \u2013 no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats.",
      "With this in mind, a group of British scientists \u2013 dubbed the \"Time Lords\" \u2013 has been asked to come up with a solution.",
      "The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself \u2013 all within a few years.",
      "In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking \u2013 and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent.",
      "A new way of measuring time",
      "The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration.",
      "Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem \u2013 and the impact could be at least as transformative.",
      "\"History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,\" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London.",
      "In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation.",
      "The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation.",
      "The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison.",
      "But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices.",
      "\"We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,\" he says. \"So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced.\"",
      "The 'Time Lords'",
      "Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the \"Time Lords\" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium.",
      "GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab.",
      "The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves.",
      "When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis.",
      "\"The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time.",
      "Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over \u2013 though that would take longer. \"To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. \"The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,\" he says. \"There is no guarantee GPS \u2026 will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it.\"",
      "While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as \"further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum\". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and \"the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged\".",
      "By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming.",
      "But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes.",
      "Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, \"where there's a bit more space\".",
      "Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around \u00a3100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems.",
      "GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons.",
      "\"We are harnessing atoms,\" she points out.",
      "\"You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed\".",
      "Atomic clocks in our pockets",
      "The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones.",
      "This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going.",
      "QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone.",
      "That process isn't going to happen soon, though. \"This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship \u2013 his greatest difficulty was to make it small.",
      "Generation K: The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people",
      "Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Race policies or Israel - what's really driving Trump's fury with South Africa?",
      "But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea.",
      "\"Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,\" says another DSTL scientist.",
      "\"As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity.\"",
      "Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong.",
      "Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough?",
      "One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy \u2013 transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.",

    "summary": "Switzerland's already upmarket tourism sector is trying to attract more high rollers.",
    "story": [
      "The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy.",
      "Despite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too.",
      "So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity.",
      "In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists.",
      "Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.",
      "Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.",
      "Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.",
      "But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.",
      "Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.",
      "\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"",
      "What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.",
      "\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"",
      "Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.",
      "But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.",
      "A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.",
      "They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.",
      "Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.",
      "More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.",
      "And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".",
      "Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.",
      "And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.",
      "By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.",
      "The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"",
      "The required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.",
      "Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".",
      "Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.",
      "Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".",
      "The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"",
      "Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".",
      "But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".",
      "In more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.",
      "And, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"",
      "And while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

    "story": [
      "Actor Ione Skye, known for her breakout role in the 1989 film \"Say Anything,\" is giving fans a look behind her glamorous but tumultuous Hollywood life in a new memoir titled \"Say Everything.\"",
      "In her memoir, the 54-year-old actress reflects on a journey that began when she was just 15, starring alongside Keanu Reeves in \"River's Edge\" before sharing the screen with River Phoenix, Matthew Perry and John Cusack in the films that would cement her status as a teen idol.",
      "\"When I look back on the pictures, I almost can't take in how young I look,\" Skye said.",
      "The memoir also details her relationship with Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis, which began when she was 16 and he was 24.",
      "\"I liked the idea of this dangerous dark prince of a rock n' roller,\" she writes, though her perspective has shifted with time.",
      "\"It shocks me. And I also feel bad for myself,\" Skye said. \"I'm happy I knew Anthony Kiedis and \u00a0[Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist] Flea, but I wish I'd met them ten years later and never dated them.\"",
      "Kiedis struggled with heroin addiction during their relationship. When asked why she stayed, Skye said: \"I thought I had to save him.\"",
      "The actress later married Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys at age 21, a relationship that lasted seven years before ending due to affairs Skye had with women. The end of this relationship in particular, Skye said, is difficult to look back on \u2013 even more than 25 years later.",
      "\"I discovered writing this book, it was very clear that I'm not good with grief. I'm not good with loss at all,\" she said. \"I still find it painful. I can't even listen to a Beastie Boys song. It feels like a death to me.\"",
      "She said she feels the pain comes from not only hurting a \"sweet person\" but also hurting herself.",
      "Much of Skye's memoir explores how her relationships were shaped by the absence of her father, Scottish singer Donovan Leitch, who left when she was born.",
      "\"Hearing his beautiful music was very painful sometimes because it's hard to see someone do beautiful art and think, 'Where is that for me?,\" she said.",
      "The book reveals a disturbing chapter when Leitch's attorney sent a letter requesting a paternity test when Skye was already a successful actress.",
      "\"I couldn't believe it,\" she said.",
      "Ultimately, Skye decided against taking the paternity test. Skye says she didn't meet her father until just before her 18th birthday.",
      "\"It was strange. I was really self-conscious in thinking we're touching right now for the first time and hugging,\" she recalled. \"The sad thing is I wanted more. Yeah, I just, and I still do. I wanted to just see him again.\"",
      "Skye would have another revelation when she was pregnant and splitting up with her fianc\u00e9, designer David Netto.",
      "\"I was in the shower, pregnant and sobbing because it was so stressful. And then I thought my mother probably was pregnant with me in a shower in 1969,\" she said. \"That's a very direct repeat of a pattern.\"",
      "Now living in Australia with her husband, musician Ben Lee, and their family, Skye says they share the same unique experience of early fame.",
      "\"Our careers were really big when we were teenagers and we've both had to deal with the ups and downs of keeping our careers going,\" she said.",
      "Five years ago, Skye took her family to visit her father and stepmother in Ireland, a trip she describes as healing. She also found connection with her father through her role in the film \"Zodiac,\" which featured one of his songs.",
      "Reflecting on completing her memoir, Skye called it \"an act of self-forgiveness.\"",
      "\"I felt very proud. I felt like I learned a lot about myself,\" she said. \"I felt like it's a bit of whiplash for a long time, but I do settle in a nice place.\"",

    "story": [
      "At the\u00a097th annual Academy Awards, presented on March 2, \"Anora\" won five Oscars, including for best picture. Watch scenes from \"Anora\" and the other nominated movies below, along with interviews with the filmmakers.",
      "\"Anora\"",
      "Sean Baker's Cinderella story \"Anora\" was a surprise winner of the top prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival \u2014 a sly and at times uproarious comic-drama of a Brooklyn sex worker who marries the young, na\u00efve son of Russian oligarchs who decide the marriage must be broken up at all costs.",
      "The film brings a humanity to the strivings of Anora (who favors the name Ani), a young woman who realizes too late that virtually no one around her has her best interests at heart \u2014 not even her newly-hitched husband.",
      "In this scene, Ani takes a stand about the working conditions at her club \u2014 she will not countenance rudeness from the DJ! (Note: Graphic language):",
      "A former NYU film student, Sean Baker had not slipped into the Hollywood industry like some of his classmates, including Todd Phillips (\"Joker\"), instead making small independent features (\"The Florida Project,\" \"Tangerine,\" \"Red Rocket\") that focused on people living on the margins of mainstream society, cast with both professional actors and non-actors.",
      "After contemplating \"a bro movie with Russian gangsters,\" he switched to a story of a sex worker in Brooklyn's Brighton Beach. He and his wife, producer Samantha Quan, moved there to absorb the atmosphere. \"We don't like to go to a place and say we're just going to get a surface view,\" Baker told the Associated Press. \"We really embed ourselves in that place. We talk to people. We get to know everyone. The research is us being there and soaking things up.\"",
      "Baker, who won the Directors Guild of America Award for \"Anora,\" based the film on research he did into the lives of sex workers. \"I don't want to say in any way that I ever faced the hardships of an undocumented immigrant or a marginalized sex worker,\" he said. \"But being an independent filmmaker for 30 years, there was a hustle. Up until fairly recently, I was struggling to pay rent.\"",
      "Madison told \"CBS Mornings\" that she \"absolutely fell in love\" with Ani when she read the character. \"She's such a complicated woman. There's so much nuance to who she is. She's so vulnerable on the inside, but she presents herself as this very fierce, tough person. And she has such a fighting spirit, and I was excited to explore all the different parts of what that would be.\"",
      "Heavily influenced by 1970s New York films like \"The French Connection\" and \"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,\" Baker shot \"Anora\" on 35mm. \"We're living in a day and age where the technology, analog meeting digital right now, actually opens up so many doors to the artists,\" Baker told Forbes. \"I mean, you can shoot on film and capture your images on this gorgeous medium, but then you have the digital tools to help clean up and perfect. We're living in a great time. I wish more filmmakers would appreciate the fact that using tools from both sides of years of technology is a wonderful thing.\"",
      "\"Anora,\" a Neon release, won best film at the Producers Guild of America Awards and at the Spirit Awards. It is now playing in theaters and is available via VOD.",
      "UPDATE: \"Anora\" won five Academy Awards on Sunday, four of which went to Baker, for best original screenplay, best editing, best director and best picture. He was the first person to ever win four Oscars for the same film.\u00a0 Mikey Madison also won for best actress.",
      "In one of his many acceptance speeches, Baker called out for preserving the theater-going movie experience, as cinemas are struggling to survive: \"In a time in which the world can feel very divided, this is more important than ever,\" he said. \"It's a communal experience you simply don't get at home. If we don't reverse this trend, we'll be losing a vital part of our culture. This is my battle cry.\"",

      "\"The Brutalist\"",
      "In director Brady Corbet's period drama \"The Brutalist,\" Hungarian architect L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th (best actor nominee Adrien Brody) emigrates from post-war Europe to the United States to revive his career, and finds both opportunity and friction as he tries to pursue his artistic inclinations.",
      "In the film's stirring opening scene, T\u00f3th arrives in New York Harbor, with a skewed view of the Statue of Liberty that portends an unequal assimilation into the promise of America. (Cinematography by Lol Crawley. Music by Daniel Blumberg.)",
      "Brody, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of a musician struggling to survive during the Nazi occupation of Poland in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist,\" is nominated for his performance as T\u00f3th, who is hired by a wealthy Pennsylvania industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2014 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete. But Toth's ambitions clash with his patron, who seeks in T\u00f3th a talent he wishes to dominate.",
      "In this extended interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Brody described his performance as T\u00f3th and the influence of his mother, the acclaimed photographer Sylvia Plachy: \"I've had a lifetime of influences and preparation so to speak to portray L\u00e1szl\u00f3 in this movie. It's a character that I relate to many things, and I see a lot of parallels in my own yearnings as an artist and in the yearnings of the people that I collaborate with. I can relate to how the struggles my mother has had to overcome in fleeing Hungary with her parents, my grandparents, in 1956 during the revolution and her journey coming to America and the sense of loss as a young girl and starting again. It's really shaped \u2014 I think she's an empathetic person by nature, but she has certain sensitivity and eye for others and those who are vulnerable, or outsiders, and captures that quite beautifully.\"",
      "Brody believes that empathy helped shape his own choices as an actor, \"trying to find films that have social relevance, or to represent people who don't have a voice and to give them that through me in some respect.\"",
      "Corbet's monumental post-war drama (which he co-wrote with his wife Mona Fastvold) is a challenging and invigorating epic, a three-and-a-half hour tale of an artist striving to create in the face of terrible external pressures \u2014 commercial, societal, marital. Though set for the most part in Pennsylvania, much of the picture was shot in Hungary, on a tiny budget (approximately $10 million), employing the rarely-used VistaVision process to blow up to 70mm. \"We cut every corner we could to make sure that every single cent was on screen,\" Corbet told Variety. \"It was a Herculean effort, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because it was just years and years of essentially working for free.\"",
      "\"It helped that the film was set in an earlier period, because there were places in Hungary that looked sort of lost in the past,\" Oscar-nominated\u00a0production designer Judy Becker told Variety. \"For example, the industrial area in Budapest looked very similar to the industrial area of Philadelphia in the 1950s.\"",
      "But despite the tight budget, Corbet was not sorry he didn't have more money: \"I never thought, 'I wish I had $30 million more,'\" he told Variety. \"There's a lot of strings that come with that kind of money. It invites lots of opinions. You have all these executives who don't trust the director and bury them in notes. What you get is something antiseptic that lacks a signature. It's the difference between a bowl from Crate & Barrel and a wabi-sabi ceramic.\"",
      "At a press conference at the Venice Film Festival, where the film was hailed as a \"masterpiece,\" Corbet remarked on questions about its length: \"This film does everything that we are told we are not allowed to do. I think it's quite silly, actually, to have a conversation about run time, because that's like criticizing a book for being 700 pages versus 100 pages.\"",
      "At the end of \"The Brutalist,\" T\u00f3th is quoted as saying, \"No matter what the others try and sell you, it is the destination, not the journey.\" \"I don't think that that sentiment applies to my journey at all,\" Brody told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"but I do find it very beautiful and telling to the storytelling of the film. You have to be very present and embrace the journey, because that is all you've got while you're here. I mean, a part of me would love to be proud of the body of work that I leave behind, but I won't be around to look back at it, so hopefully I bring more good than bad and negativity into this world, and that's what I strive for.\"",
      "Brody won the New York Film Critics Circle Award, Golden Globe, and BAFTA awards for his performance, while \"The Brutalist\" won the Golden Globe for best motion picture drama and best director. The film received 10 Academy Award nominations, including best picture and best director.",

      "\"A Complete Unknown\"",
      "James Mangold's biopic expertly dramatizes the rise of Bob Dylan as a mythic figure in the folk music scene, and his transformation into a singer-songwriter who blurred genres and confounded commercial expectations. The film, nominated for 8 Academy Awards, is grounded by best actor nominee Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who won the Screen Actors Guild Award for his acutely-attuned performance as Dylan.",
      "In this scene, Dylan visits an infirm Woody Guthrie (Scoot McNairy) in a New Jersey hospital, being tended to by friend Pete Seeger (best supporting actor nominee Edward Norton):",
      "That meeting leads to Dylan's first appearance at New York's Folk City, where he is introduced by Seeger. The club's audience, including Joan Baez (played by best supporting actress nominee Monica Barbaro), is enraptured by Dylan's \"I Was Young When I Left Home\":",
      "Jay Cocks, the screenwriter of \"The Age of Innocence\" and \"Gangs of New York,\" had penned a screenplay based on the 2015 Elijah Wald book \"Dylan Goes Electric.\" Mangold (whose films include \"Walk the Line,\" \"3:10 to Yuma\" and \"Logan\") worked on revising the script, which expanded the characters of Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, and Sylvie Russo (a fictionalization of Dylan's then-girlfriend, Suze Rotolo).",
      "Mangold described to the Hollywood Reporter his initial meeting with Dylan to discuss the film: \"He said: 'So what's this movie about?' And I thought very carefully, because I knew he didn't want a 20-minute answer. I said: 'It's about a young guy in Minnesota who's suffocating and feeling desperate and who leaves everything \u2014 friends, family \u2014 behind and, with just a few dollars in his pocket, makes his way across the country and creates a new identity and makes new friends, finds a new family and blossoms, becomes successful, then starts to suffocate again and runs away.' And he smiled and that was all. Like, he didn't have anything more to say, but I knew that meant, to me, that he didn't take issue.\"",
      "The film gets a lot right in terms of the period, the feel of Greenwich Village at its height in the folk music world, and the sense of shifting sands in commercial music. Production designer Fran\u00e7ois Audouy transformed downtown Jersey City into early 1960s MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village. He also recreated Dylan's apartment based on hundreds of previously-unpublished photographs \u2014 from the exact chair Dylan had, to his Decca record player, his 1954 Olivetti Lettera 22 typewriter, art on the walls, books and records. \"It was like stepping into a time machine,\" Audouy told Indiewire of the apartment set.",
      "Arianne Phillips, nominated for best costume design (she'd previously been nominated for \"Walk the Line,\" \"W.E.,\" and \"Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood\"), told The Art of Costume, \"Unlike typical biopics that span decades, this film focuses on just four years. That precision was both a challenge and an opportunity for the costumes. \u2026 The film moves through a variety of locations and scenarios, but the time period remains consistent. There's no dramatic shift in technology, architecture, or cars. Instead, the focus is on Bob's evolution \u2014 his character arc.\"",
      "The film's wardrobe was broken down into three styles: his arrival in New York in 1961, the time around the release of his 1963 album \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,\" and the more mod figure he cut in 1965. \"Chalamet had about 67 costume changes,\" Phillips said, \"and we had over 120 speaking roles with principal characters averaging anywhere from 8 to 30 changes each.\"",
      "Though much dramatized in the film did happen \u2014 including a fistfight that broke out when Dylan plugged in an electric guitar at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival \u2014 there were some liberties taken. \"Dylan Goes Electric\" author Elijah Wald told the Guardian, \"The movie is full of things that didn't happen, but the way they happen in those scenes feels right to me. If Pete Seeger had been at Woody Guthrie's bedside when Dylan arrived and sung him a song, then said he didn't have a place to sleep, Pete would have brought him home for the night. None of that happened, but it's all true to the characters.\"",
      "Because of COVID, Hollywood strikes, and other commitments, Chalamet ended up waiting five years before \"A Complete Unknown\" could go before the cameras. He used that time to further study Dylan (whom he had never met) and his music. In addition to learning how to play the guitar and the harmonica, Chalamet mastered about 40 Bob Dylan songs \u2014 far more than were originally called for in the script \u2014 determined, like the young Dylan, to make it great.",
      "\"I give 170% in everything I'm doing,\" the actor told \"60 Minutes.\" \"I'm giving it my all. Something like the Dylan project, these aren't watered-down experiences. I'm going Daniel Day-Lewis on all of them. I'm not saying in process, but I'm saying a level of commitment.\"",
      "He says he wasn't merely trying to imitate Dylan: \"No, totally that was the tension, for me, in doing a biopic on somebody so beloved and so well-known was \u2026 where does my heart and where does my soul fit into this? Can it fit into this, particularly with someone who was so masked?\"",

      "Edward Berger's filming of the Robert Harris thriller, about the political machinations within the Vatican as the College of Cardinals meets to elect a new pope, is an engrossing tale of intrigue in which Cardinal Thomas Lawrence (best actor nominee Ralph Fiennes) tries to get to the bottom of various mysteries, all while corralling the disparate cardinals, each with their own political and ideological predilections, towards naming a successor and guiding the Church into the future.",

      "In this scene, Lawrence gives a sermon to the cardinals about the value of uncertainty, little knowing that, for much of the film, he will be on a quest for understanding \u2014 questioning his own doubt \u2014 to attain a kind of certainty that, for Lawrence, may represent truth.",
      "\"I like characters that have contradictions inside them,\" Fiennes told \"Sunday Morning.\" His reaction to reading the part of Lawrence was, \"Oh, I love this. This is a human. He's not a saint. He's a good man trying to find his way.",
      "\"I was brought up a Catholic and then rebelled when I was 13,\" Fiennes said. \"My mother was a committed Catholic. So, 'God questions' have been in my family since I was a child.\"",
      "And did he come away with any answers to his own questions? \"No, I came away with more questions,\" he said.",
      "Berger talked with the Hollywood Reporter about the film's themes: \"It is a wonderful topic for a political thriller, not [just] for a religious thriller,\" he said. \"This could take place anywhere. It could take place in Washington, D.C., or Downing Street, or a big corporation where the CEO job is vacant. So, I think that's interesting on the surface, but on a much deeper level, I really connected with what [Lawrence] is going through. He says, 'I have difficulty with prayer.' \u2026 To overcome that and go through this crisis and refine the belief in what you do, [to believe] it has some purpose, I think a lot of us go through it at some point or another in our life. To refine the purity of your job, and refine the purity of your purpose, is a constant struggle. It's an interesting path to keep recalibrating. And it's actually a very healthy path to keep recalibrating. \u2026",
      "\"What the film really deals with is doubt and certainty \u2026 It doesn't mean that every cardinal, every character in the movie, acts to the best of their conscience. But they are certain in their beliefs, or they believe that what they think is right. Bellini has a certainty that this guy is wrong and that is a certainty as well. And I always think that, in a way, certainty creates antagonism and that's just going to make the other side stronger.\"",

      "Part One of \"Dune,\" released in 2021, was a masterful evocation of Frank Herbert's classic sci-fi novels, in which the desert world of Arrakis becomes the focal point of a galactic war over a unique, invaluable commodity: spice, a psychoactive chemical necessary for interplanetary travel (and domination). Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the movie was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, and won six.",
      "The sequel follows the ascension of Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) as a leader of the Indigenous Fremen tribes in combatting the forces of the ruling House Harkonnen.",
      "In this scene, Paul and Chani (Zendaya) engage in a Fremen attack on a Harkonnen spice harvester. The fast-moving action showcases how Villeneuve's staging, photography and pacing expertly define cinematic geography, as well as the limitations of technology \u2014 and the power of daredevil heroics:",
      "In this technical featurette from Variety, Academy Award-nominated cinematographer Greig Fraser (who won the Oscar for \"Part One\") discusses how camera movement, lenses, and shooting in natural light (as well as the combination of digital and film emulsions) mirror the emotions and journey of the characters, such as when Paul Atreides rides the giant sandworm.",
      "Fraser noted, \"The biggest challenge is, worms don't exist.\" Well, yeah, that is a problem! Thankfully, the film's visual effects team (also nominated) provided the solution. You can watch the sandworm sequence below \u2014 a scene of remarkable anticipation, drama, and visual and sonic splendor for which Imax was created, as Paul's feat appears to satisfy a Fremen prophecy of a messianic figure. It's not for nothing that director Steven Spielberg, in a Directors Guild of America podcast, told Villeneuve that this sequence was \"one of the greatest things I have ever seen. Ever!\"",

      "What Juan \"Manitas\" Del Monte leaves behind when he transitions is a wife and children, who are relocated to Europe for their protection. Jessi (Selena Gomez) mourns the death of her husband, but after moving back to Mexico she meets up with a former lover \u2014 and is also introduced to a distant cousin, Emilia P\u00e9rez (best actress nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n), not knowing Emilia is Jessi's former husband.",
      "In this scene Gomez performs the Oscar-nominated song \"Mi Camino\" (by Cl\u00e9ment Ducol and Camille Dalmais), in which Jessie evokes the vulnerability of her character. \"It was actually so therapeutic for me to sing,\" Gomez told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in this extended interview. \"It's basically in English translated to, you know, 'If I fall off this hill it's my hill; if I decide to do this with my life it's my decision,' and embracing womanhood if you will. And I really appreciated that.\"",
      "In this profile for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Gomez said shooting \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" left her \"a little sore from the dance numbers.\" So, why did she want to do it? \"I found it incredibly compelling,\" she said. \"To be honest, I've never really seen a movie like this before. I don't think I've ever been this proud of something in the acting field.\"",
      "In her extended interview, Gomez described the experience of shooting the film as transformative: \"The people I was around, I couldn't have been luckier with their support and their wisdom. It just felt so right,\" she said. \"The story is original, but it's also a story that a lot of people walk through. So, the way it was told was artistic and audacious and beautiful, but it is a true element where people crave and have a desire to live their life authentically, and whatever that looks like to them should never be judged. I thought that we did a good job encompassing that.\"",
      "\"Also, when I read the script, my character came across quite harsh in the beginning. Jacques was really wonderful with collaborating with me because I felt like adding a bit of softness to her would help.

      "After Rubens' disappearance, Eunice, a mother of five, continued her husband's legacy by becoming a lawyer, and leading efforts to support civil rights and protect the Amazonian rain forest. Her tragic but inspiring story was recounted in her son Marcelo Rubens Palva's 2015 book, \"I'm Still Here.\"",
      "Brazilian filmmaker Walter Salles' previous films include 1998's \"Central Station\" (an Oscar-winner for best foreign language film), and \"The Motorcycle Diaries.\" At last year's New York Film Festival, Salles said that the story of \"I'm Still Here\" was very personal to him because of his own history. The son of a diplomat, Salles returned to Brazil in 1969 after living abroad for five years: \"The country I came back to was very different from the country I had left, because it was now under military dictatorship, and I was personally pretty much at loss, really at loss, until I met this family of five kids, and it was Marcelo's family. Became really good friends with his sister Nalu, and I got embraced by this family.",
      "\"I've been in that house, you know, for almost two years on a constant level,\" Salles said. \"We drifted to that house because in it you could hear the political discussions that didn't exist anymore in the exterior of that place. You could hear the music that was forbidden. \u2026 And there were no barriers between, you know, adults, adolescents, kids. This was completely different from my house. So, I was very informed by that. The moment where this was broken up was for all of us who were in that house at some moment kind of severed a line. It stipulated a before and an after, which obviously has to do with the moment when an authoritarian state invades the heart of a family. And that stayed with me for years and years and years.\"",
      "\"I'm Still Here\" has tapped into the public conscience in Brazil, where the collective memory about the nation's suffering under military rule across two decades is being revived through the story of Eunice and her family. It became the fifth highest-grossing film in Brazil last year (behind Hollywood fare like \"Inside Out 2,\" \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" \"Moana 2\" and \"Despicable Me 4\"). The film won three awards at the Venice Film Festival, including for its director.",

      "\"Nickel Boys\"",
      "Colson Whitehead, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2017 for his novel \"The Underground Railroad,\" based his next novel, \"The Nickel Boys,\" on the tragedy of the Dozier School, a Florida reform school for boys in the Jim Crow South, which became notorious for its institutional abuse, torture and deaths of youth. Following an investigation, the school was closed in 2011; subsequent diggings unearthed unmarked graves, which revealed even greater evidence of the staff's cruelties.",
      "In this extended interview from 2019, Whitehead told \"Sunday Morning\" that his book's main characters, Elwood and Turner, represented different sides of himself: \"I have an optimistic part of me that thinks that things are getting better. We are making progress as a country, in terms of race and other things,\" Whitehead said. \"And then there's a pessimistic, or realistic, part of me that says, no, things never change, and we make some progress and then we slide back. And so, Elwood and Turner in their initial incarnation represented different sides of me.",
      "\"Elwood is 16, he's a straight-A student, he's been inspired by Martin Luther King, the civil rights marches. Every week, he reads Life magazine and sees the picture of his heroes. \u2026 And he sees himself as part of the new generation that can change the old order. And then there's Turner, who is an orphan. And he's been sent to [Nickel] 'cause there's nowhere else for him to go. And he lives by his wits. He's a survivor. And he sees the system as it actually is, unchanging, casually cruel, callous. And he doesn't believe in the same sort of enlightened goals of Elwood. [He believes in] making his way through the obstacle course, getting through a day without getting beaten, and then getting out of school where he can find some other survival tactic that works in the outside world. And so, they meet, and they have to survive but also consider each other's philosophies \u2014 what works, what doesn't, and how do you maybe perhaps integrate them.\"",
      "What makes the film adaptation of \"Nickel Boys\" unique is that director and co-writer RaMell Ross, a visual arts professor at Brown University who earned an Oscar nomination for the 2018 documentary \"Hale County This Morning, This Evening,\" employs a first-person perspective for most of the film; the camera serves as the eyes of Elwood, or Turner, throughout the story, so the audience directly experiences the sensations of the characters, which can be especially disturbing when they become victims of abuse.",
      "In this trailer for the film, we experience life from the perspective of the protagonists:",
      "In this scene, Hattie (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor), unable to see her grandson Elwood, approaches Turner (voice of Brandon Wilson) for help:",
      "In a New York Film Festival panel discussion, Ross, who had always wanted to make a POV film, said reading Whitehead's book was profound for him: \"And in the process of reading, it was the process of being allowed to imagine in a way that I think a lot of American writers aren't focused on.",
      "\"The way that Coulson wrote was, like, concise and spare, [he] didn't over-describe, so it allowed me to imagine myself as Elwood and truly be visual in the world,\" Ross said. \"And so, that process led to the POV notion, and ideas around at what point in time did Elwood realize that he was raced, that he realized he was Black? Which is something that I would argue all people of color go through. It's a visual thing, it's a perceptual thing, and what a devastating thing in his life as you can see in the film juxtaposed against being a sentient-innocent child and being in awe of what it means to be embodied, and then to go out into the world and to be forced to adhere by this manufactured law. It's devastating.\"",
      "Shot with Sony's Venice (a full-frame digital camera not much larger than a DSLR still camera), to allow movement through tight spaces, the camera was worn on various rigs (chest mounts, helmets, SnorriCams), as well as handhelds. In many instances, the actors wore the cameras themselves.",
      "Cinematographer Jomo Fray, who won the American Society of Cinematographers' Spotlight Award, told the New York Film Festival audience that he did not think \"POV\" was adequate as shorthand to describe its effect: \"I don't think it was about being in the point of view, but it was actually creating an image that is at one point immersive \u2014 it brings us in as an audience into the world. At a second point, it is implicative \u2014 it implicates us in the world that the image itself is seeing. And as a third point, it's an image that has a physical danger to it, that the image itself is navigating, trying to go through spaces that are naturally hostile to it. So, we wanted to shoot these scenes not from outside but be inside of the scene. \u2026 It was fundamentally, totally different than anything I've ever shot before, conceptually and otherwise.\"",
      "Brandon Wilson, who plays Turner, told CBS station KCAL in Los Angeles, \"I think this movie offers a beautiful invitation for people to let go of their own subjective points of view and step into the shoes of another person, and step into their eyes. I just hope they accept that invitation and allow themselves to be pulled into this world and release their own conditional point of view for a moment.\"",

      "\"The Substance\"",
      "Coralie Fargeat's body horror film \"The Substance\" stars best actress nominee Demi Moore as Elisabeth Sparkle, an aging TV star who discovers a sinister-looking potion that can give her a younger, more perfect version of herself, but at a terrible price.",
      "In this early scene, following a devastating career downturn and a car accident, Elisabeth breaks down under the watch of an ER doctor (Tom Morton), but then finds herself the focus of a sinister male nurse (Robin Greer). Why does he refer to her as \"a good candidate\"? And what is that strange birthmark on his forearm?",
      "The upshot? Elisabeth is offered access to a radical potion, a.k.a. The Substance, that promises \"a better version of yourself.\" What that entails, once a yellow liquid is injected into one's veins, is the creation of a new, younger duplicate of the person, ready to take their place. [Warning: There is a regimented schedule for injections; don't deviate!]",
      "Fargeat, a French filmmaker whose credits include \"Revenge\" and the TV series \"The Sandman,\" told Vogue magazine that the stylized horror was purposefully made to look unreal: \"From the start I knew I wasn't interested in depicting the real Hollywood but rather what it's about. It's about beauty. It's about success. Taking it out of reality was a way to make it timeless and thus universal, like the story could happen today, yesterday, or tomorrow \u2014 as well as anywhere.\"",
      "In a Hollywood Reporter roundtable, Gargeat said that she would not call \"The Substance\" a horror film. \"I would call it more of a genre film, which is to me very wide \u2026 going from sci-fi to action to everything that is not grounded into reality. Basically that's how I grew up loving films, everything that [would] allow me to escape real life, which I hated, which I felt totally unadapted to, and very bored [with].",
      "\"So, especially for that film and the previous one, that's really where I found my freedom and where I felt powerful and where I felt fully capable to express myself in a way that there are no boundaries. Also, where I love to go very much into the excess and kind of touch my part of, yeah, craziness \u2026 it felt totally relevant for it to be as excessive as what I wanted to say, and make the audience feel that excess and feel that craziness.",
      "\"So, that's it's even not a question where that I choose; it's just what I do,\" she said.",
      "The film has been recognized as an indictment of sexism and ageism, in a popular culture that denigrates women who have the temerity to get older. In an extended interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Moore referred to a line by Dennis Quaid's character making reference to a woman's fertility being tied to their value, and to their desirability. \"There's an aspect that [and I would say up until now] kind of put women at a certain age or time in their life as, 'Well, you're now relegated to this corral because you can't be that.' And I just don't think it's the truth. I don't think that is the truth of who we are as women as we get older. And I think again, like the film, there's a part of that that we as women have bought into, and so if we want to change this, then we have to change how we're looking at it, how we're holding it, and how we see ourselves. We can't wait for it to change on the outside; we have to be that change.\"",
      "Fargeat told the Associated Press that her film was a response to the limits of female representation. \"Our society, you know, has been built on 2,000 years of being kind of one way. And to make a real sense, it's still too tiny to me. That's why I also wanted my movie to be so excessive, you know, because I think this is what we need. We can't be shy with those issue because the weight of everything is huge. The weight of all that still creates so much inequality and so much violence. So, that's why also I wanted to make the movie that way.\"",
      "Moore won both the Golden Globe and the Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance, and was nominated for a BAFTA. The film is up for a total of five Academy Awards, including best picture. Coralie Fargeat received two nominations for best director and best original screenplay, and a third as producer.",

Chu. \"It was the whole reason I did the movie,\" Chu told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"It's all about striving for that dream and being able to fight through the uncomfortable things to get there.\"",

Joe: Retaliation,\" \"Now You See Me 2\"), Chu said his view of \"The Wizard of Oz\" \u2014 which, when he was a child, represented a dream of another, better place \u2014 has changed since he was a kid. \"I think that that Yellow Brick Road is no longer the path that you just keep following, because there is no wizard there that's gonna give you your heart's desire,\" he said. \"Life is a series of walking adventures. And as you're walking, smell the flowers and feel the air. And maybe you'll realize you're actually flying.\"",
      "The show \"Wicked,\" with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, and based on Gregory Maguire's novel about the backstory of the Wicked Witch of the West, opened on Broadway in 2003. It won three Tony Awards. For the film adaptation, the show has been split in half (Part Two opens this November). Far from the candy-colored vaudevillian Oz that the 1939 classic projected, \"Wicked\" has a darker subtext about tyranny and civil rights. A rebellion builds against the Wizard and the increasingly autocratic rule coming from the Emerald City, which draws Elphaba (best actress nominee Cynthia Erivo) to become a resistance figure; her empathy leads to her becoming an outcast.",
      "At the center of the narrative is the connection between Elphaba and Glinda (best supporting actress nominee Ariana Grande). Their frenemy relationship begins at Shiz University, but evolves as they compete for the attention of the dean of sorcery (Michelle Yeoh), and of a hunk (Jonathan Bailey), and then join as friends to meet the Wizard.",
      "In this scene, the hunk, Fiyero, a transfer student at Shiz University, makes his case for living less studiously, especially as it affords more chances to engage in a rapturous dance number in the school's library:",
      "This behind-the-scenes featurette shows how Erivo performed her flying stunts while singing \"Defying Gravity.\" \u00a0And yes, the \"Wicked\" cast were not performing to pre-recorded vocal tracks; for most of the film, Grande, Erivo, et al, were recorded singing on set by live sound mixer Simon Hayes (an Oscar-winner for \"Les Miserables\"). While it's as impressive as Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet singing live on set for \"A Complete Unknown,\" Bob Dylan wasn't dangling in the air from a broomstick.",
      "Hayes told Playbill.com, \"There's something within the breath and the cadence of the way that the lips are moving, the breath that you're hearing as someone's walking and singing live, that just sounds real \u2014 because it is real. There's also something within the acoustic of the voice that matches the set we see, because it's a real acoustic. It's not synthetic rebuilt digital acoustic.\" Hayes is part of the sound recording and mixing team nominated for an Oscar.",
      "Watch this featurette giving a more detailed look at how the sound of \"Wicked\" was captured:",
      "Speaking of the film adaptation, Maguire told CBS Boston, \"The fact that the story of 'Wicked' continues to be pertinent 30 years after it was first published shocks me, saddens me a little bit, because it's about social ills and political stress, but also encourages me because it means we're still looking for guidance and for comfort.\"",

Baker distinguished himself by winning all four awards for the same movie, while Disney won for four different projects at the 1954 ceremony.

Her Oscar campaign, however, was marred by controversy after offensive posts she made on social media surfaced. The award for best actress ultimately went to Mikey Madison, who played the title role in \"Anora.\"",
      "Zoe Salda\u00f1a \u2014 who became the first American of Dominican descent to win an Oscar \u2014 won best supporting actress, one of just two wins for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" on Sunday night.",

      "The Oscars ceremony was broadcast on ABC on Sunday night from the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Hollywood, in Los Angeles. \"Anora\" went home with five awards, including best picture. See the full list of winners here.",
      "Who is Conan O'Brien?",
      "Conan O'Brien is best known for hosting the late-night talk shows \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien,\" \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" and \"Conan.\"",
      "O'Brien, now 61, spent nearly three decades as a late-night host. In 2015, he became the \"longest-working current late night talk show host\" in the U.S., following David Letterman's retirement, according to TBS.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:58:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Has the rise of streaming services, and the ability to watch movies on mobile phones, changed what we expect, or want, movies to be? A leading filmmaker, critic, and movie executives discuss the evolution of Hollywood's \"Dream Factory.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",
      "His advice? \"Tighten up your boots and climb.\"",

    "summary": "As host of \"The Tonight Show\" for 30 years, Johnny Carson was the king of late-night TV. But the public rarely saw his private side. A new biography, \"Carson the Magnificent,\" examines the late-night host's enduring impact, and his difficulties off-camera.",
    "story": [
      "It may not look like much now, but once upon a time, Stage 1 at the Burbank Studios was where the king of comedy held court, addressing his subjects at the end of each day. Johnny Carson presided over not just late night, but American popular culture.",
      "\"Johnny Carson was the biggest star in America,\" said writer Mike Thomas. \"Movie stars, rock stars, I don't think anybody was bigger than Johnny, because he was on night after night after night.\"",
      "Thomas' new book is \"Carson the Magnificent,\" a biography of Carson his late friend Bill Zehme started.",
      "Everybody who was anybody appeared on \"The Tonight Show,\" and 17 million Americans tuned in \u2013 many from their beds. It was Johnny Carson vs. sleep, and sleep usually lost. \"It did!\" said Thomas. \"I think Johnny brought a lot of people peace at the end of the day. People love to laugh, but I think he gave them hope that the world would go on the next day no matter what was happening.\"",
      "His audience \u2013 more than triple the size of all three current network late-night shows combined \u2013 made him the national agenda setter of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s.\u00a0 \"Johnny would say things and do things that became water cooler conversation the next morning,\" said Thomas.",
      "It also made Johnny the pre-eminent Hollywood talent broker for several generations. Fifty-seven years after comedian Robert Klein made the first of his 97 appearances on \"The Tonight Show,\" he's still grateful for the rocket fuel career boost that Carson's imprimatur provided. \"He's one of the most important people in my life, and we were not personal friends,\" Klein said.",
      "For his career, Klein said Carson was the most important: \"Appearances on that show were everything. I am a creature of 'The Tonight Show.' That was the vertebra of my career.\"",
      "Comedian George Wallace knew what was on the line when he did Carson: an invitation to \"The Tonight Show\" was a necessary bullet point on his resume \u2013 and each appearance was a climb up comedy's Everest. And then, when the routine would end, comedians would look nervously at the desk, waiting to see if Carson gave then the OK. \"Always got that,\" said Wallace.",
      "I asked, \"Were you looking for it?\"",
      "\"Hell, yeah. I was looking for it!\" he said.",
      "But what he was also looking for was a gesture from Carson to come over to the couch. \"I didn't get that,\" he said.",
      "Forty years later, this big-time comedy headliner still feels he didn't make the \"Tonight Show\" summit. I asked, \"What did that mean to get called over?\"",
      "\"That meant that you're in,\" said Wallace. \"You got called over, you're in the club.\" He said the fact that he did get that \"kinda hurts today.\"",
      "All that power, rested in the hands of a complicated man: master connector at work, cold and aloof at home. \"I think there were two Johnnys to a certain degree,\" said Thomas. \"On screen, impossibly cool guy. But there was also the side of Johnny that was introverted off-screen. I think some of the aloofness may have been introversion.\"",
      "In Mike Wallace's classic \"60 minutes\" profile in 1979, Carson acknowledged the dichotomy. He said, \"If I pulled out my old high school annual book and read some of the things, people might say, 'Oh he's conceited, he's aloof.' Actually that was more shy. See, when I'm in front of an audience, it's a different thing.\"",
      "Life with no audience was challenging for Carson. He was married four times. \"Johnny needed to be married for some reason; he needed to be with someone,\" said Thomas. \"He didn't need to stay married. They would fall out. Johnny's behavior would pry them apart. They just never lasted.\"",
      "But actress Dyan Cannon has a different story to tell. \"Aloof and cold? Never.\" She described him as \"Warm, open, willing. I've never known anyone like him. I've never known anyone like Johnny.\"",
      "And this from a woman who was married to Cary Grant. \"Cary was more of an enigma,\" said Cannon. \"Much more of a, 'Can I approach him or can't I?'\u00a0 But people would approach Johnny as if he were family.\"",
      "\"So, it was a different kind of star?\" I asked.",
      "\"There was nobody as big a star as Johnny.\"",
      "In a \"Tonight Show\" episode from October 1985, where Cannon and Carson are chatting, she flustered the normally unflappable Carson as she held his hand. \"Hi, sweetheart,\" she said.",
      "\"We've gone out a couple of times, right?\" he said.",
      "Cannon erupted in laughter \u2013 as did Cannon today, re-watching the video. \"He still makes me laugh,\" she said.",
      "Asked what exactly was going on there, Cannon laughed again: \"Well, you will never know! You will never, never know!\"",
      "\"You gotta give me a little somethin' here.\"",
      "\"Oh, no, I don't!\" she laughed.",
      "To hear her tell it, this was not a man who had trouble understanding women. \"How do I describe a relationship where you're so intimate with somebody, and yet, you haven't been intimate physically? We were closer than that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you describe it as a love affair?\"",
      "\"Yes, absolutely, a love affair,\" Cannon said. \"Absolutely. Real love. Physically, we were never together. But spiritually, we were.\"",
      "\"In some ways, it sounds like you're describing the love of your life?\"",
      "\"Isn't that interesting?\" said Cannon. \"Wow. Hope you're hearing this, Johnny!\"",
      "Maybe Carson was just like so many of us, full of contradictions \u2026 only ours aren't examined by millions under the brightest lights our culture has to offer. Whoever Johnny Carson was, safe to say, in our deeply fragmented culture, there will never be another.",
      "As Mike Thomas put it, \"We're all siloed. We're all watching things that either confirm our own biases or that are attuned to our own specific sense of humor. There will never be that communal experience again where people watch the show at the same time and then talk about the show the next day. It was a communal experience. That was part of the magic of Carson: community.\"",

    "summary": "Many actors have launched their careers in horror movies. But two of our most acclaimed stars are now headlining a low-budget horror film: \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" about a psychopath terrorizing his fellow nursing home residents with a sinister doll puppet.",
    "story": [
      "It might be known as winter elsewhere, but in Hollywood, they call it \"awards season\" \u2026 and just about everyone's in town for tonight's grand finale. One of the stars of \"Conclave,\" John Lithgow, is looking forward to it. \"Yes, I haven't been to the Oscars in years.\"",
      "Lithgow says he really likes playing the bad guy.",
      "\"Everything you do seems like it's a lot of fun for you,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I try to find things that are fun,\" Lithgow said. \"I don't go looking for them. They come to me. By now, I'm on a short list of actors, who is well known for being ready, willing, and able to do just about anything. So, wild roles come my way. Nothing normal!\"",
      "Also in town: esteemed actor Geoffrey Rush. He might live Down Under, but he's picked up a few awards up here, including a Tony, an Oscar, and an Emmy, or as he puts it, \"a TOE.\"",
      "We got both Rush and Lithgow in the same room to talk about something they've done together. In \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" Rush plays a wheelchair-bound stroke patient recovering in a nursing home, and Lithgow is the merciless bully who terrorizes his fellow residents, often with a sinister doll puppet, named Jenny Pen.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" click on the video player below:",
      "If it looks like a low-budget horror film, that's because it is!",
      "\"Lot of times, this is how people get their start in the business \u2013 they do a low-budget horror movie,\" I said.",
      "\"This is where we ended up!\" said Rush.",
      "\"Geoffrey's just one of the great actors,\" said Lithgow. \"And you just read the script and said, 'This is a hell of a double act.'\"",
      "\"I thought I was reading for the doll!\" said Rush.",
      "Lithgow's character starts out as merely sinister, and quickly graduates to terrifying. It's the classic horror film villain, and for Lithgow, a role with teeth.",
      "Rush said, \"Typical John, he said, 'I've had some teeth made.' And I thought, 'You're my kind of actor,' because really, the first time I saw the face, I just went, 'This guy is creepy.'\"",
      "\"Look, we're in the impact business,\" Lithgow said. \"You're after making people laugh, cry, or scream out in terror. And this was scream-out-in-terror time, with deep feeling sort of invested in it.\"",
      "Lithgow's been evoking deep feelings for more than half a century. But before he was the acclaimed movie star. He was the acclaimed stage actor, the guy in David Storey's play \"The Changing Room\" who made winning a Tony look easy, picking up the award just two weeks after making his first appearance on a Broadway stage. \"I think I must have the record for the quickest win sprint from Broadway debut to a Tony Award,\" he said.",
      "Rush has a similar story: He also won a Tony for his Broadway debut, 2009's \"Exit the King.\" And the movie \"Shine,\" about real-life pianist David Helfgott, was only his second feature film. He still can't believe he took home the Oscar for best actor. \"It still doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "But it was hardly beginner's luck. Both Rush and Lithgow have had once-in-a-lifetime roles \u2026. again and again.",
      "I asked, \"Has there ever been a role that the guy sitting next to you had that you looked at and said either, 'Wow. That was perfect,' or, 'Ooh, I wish I could have played that'?\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"I don't know. I defer to an actor who does a much better job than I could possibly do in that role. I was the second choice for Hannibal Lecter. If Tony Hopkins had turned it down, it was coming to me. And there's no way I could have played that part as well as he did.\"",
      "\"Wow, that's a bold statement,\" said Rush.",
      "\"It's true! And I feel that way about Geoffrey in 'Shine.' That was his role. It belonged to him. And there's no point being \u2026\"",
      "\"What John doesn't know is that I got offered most of the roles that he's got first!\" Rush laughed.",
      "Truth is, just about any role they play is iconic. And with director James Ashcroft's \"Jenny Pen,\" they get to do something extra-special: act their age.",
      "Rush recalled, \"I said to James Ashcroft, 'How old is this judge in the film?' He said, 'How old are you now?' I said, 'I'm 73.' He said, 'Let's make him 73.' And that's the first time I've played my own age.\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"Geoffrey and I have the great advantage of having grown to a certain age where we are each other's only competition. You get the great old man roles dealing with big issues like mortality and facing the loss of your own viability and the loss of your own cognition. It's been a blessing. I mean, my career has sort of aged along with me. And who would have believed I would still be going strong at this point?\"",

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. accused his department's top communications official of quitting to avoid being fired.",
    "story": [
      "The top communications official under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly resigned last week, just two weeks after being sworn in to be the department's assistant secretary for public affairs.",
      "The resignation of Thomas Corry, a Trump administration appointee, was first reported by Politico. Corry did not respond to multiple requests from CBS News for comment.",
      "Corry's departure came just days after Kennedy faced criticism for how he handled a question about the growing measles outbreak in Texas at a White House Cabinet meeting, calling it \"not unusual\" and misstating the number of deaths reported in the state.",
      "A former HHS official and a person familiar with Corry's thinking said that he had voiced disappointment with how Kennedy handled the question. It was a missed opportunity, making headlines for appearing indifferent to the deadly outbreak.",
      "But Corry's frustrations extended beyond that, as his office triaged a deluge of inquiries on agency actions ranging from canceled vaccines meetings to stalled research funding.",
      "Unlike previous officials in the role, who usually closely work with the secretary, Corry had been cut off from Kennedy, one former HHS official said. Federal officials said they were unsure if Corry had the trust of Kennedy or his inner circle, undermining his authority.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, Kennedy claimed he never met Corry and did not know much about his former top spokesperson.",
      "\"I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news,\" Kennedy said.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not comment, when asked about Kennedy's remarks. Instead, Nixon re-sent a previous statement attributed to principal deputy chief of staff Stefanie Spear about Kennedy making measles a \"top priority\" for his team.",
      "Spear is one of a handful of aides now at HHS to have worked for Kennedy during his longshot presidential campaign. Many others were hired from the ranks of Trump supporters and alumni of other federal agencies.",
      "This includes Nixon, who previously handled press for Trump's campaign. Nixon had reported to Corry alongside Michael Brady, a former top Army public affairs official.",
      "Corry previously served as a communications official for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the COVID-19 pandemic, under the first Trump administration.",
      "Multiple current CMS officials praised Corry as highly competent, trusted and well-liked among career federal health officials, as well as by Trump aides.",
      "Spear, who also has the title of a senior counselor to Kennedy, has been tightly controlling communications across the department, multiple officials said.",
      "Before Kennedy's confirmation, Spear ordered the unprecedented department-wide communications \"pause\" that froze the release of information across HHS.",
      "Other factors have contributed to challenges within the communications shop, including a shortfall in staffing, a former HHS official said.",
      "During the Biden administration, when top-ranking civil servants within the communications office retired in recent years, they were replaced by political appointees, not career executives who would stay on after the White House changed hands.",
      "That complicated the transition and left the incoming Trump administration with a deficit of institutional knowledge.",
      "More changes could be coming soon to the communications officials who remain. A current HHS official said staff within the team were asked to provide explanations of their \"roles and responsibilities\" by noon on Tuesday.",

      "Measles outbreaks across North America are threatening the region's status of having officially eliminated the virus, officials from the Pan-American Health Organization warned, potentially undoing a hard-fought victory to wipe out community transmission.",
      "The U.N. agency pointed to a 4.5-times increase in reported measles cases this year across North and South America, compared to the same period last year.",
      "More than 97% of cases across the region so far this year have been in the U.S. or Canada. Cases have also been reported in Mexico and Argentina.",
      "\"The risk of outbreaks has increased, given the increase in measles cases worldwide, coupled with factors such as low coverage of the first and second doses of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine,\" PAHO, the World Health Organization's regional office for the Americas, said in a report published last week.",
      "Other factors driving spread that were cited by PAHO include increased movement of people around the Americas and an uptick in dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection that can mask the spread of measles due to similar symptoms.",
      "What is measles elimination?",
      "The U.S. achieved measles elimination in 2000, after documenting a year of no endemic spread of the virus. WHO officials declared North and South America free of measles in 2016, making the Americas the first region to reach this milestone in the world.",
      "Health officials define \"measles elimination\" as proof of no endemic spread of the highly contagious virus within an area for at least 12 months. A continuous chain of transmission persisting for at least a year would reverse that goal.",
      "While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention usually reports hundreds of measles cases every year around the U.S., many are from short-lived outbreaks linked to unvaccinated young children who were recently outside the U.S.",
      "The last large outbreak of the virus in the U.S. was in Illinois last year. It was largely confined to migrant shelters in Chicago.",
      "CDC officials warned in 2019 that the country was at risk of losing measles elimination status, after outbreaks spread for several months around undervaccinated communities in the New York area. However, the U.S. ultimately kept its status.",
      "Outbreaks in Texas and Canada",
      "Authorities have been grappling with a growing measles outbreak linked to unvaccinated communities across northwest Texas. At least 158 cases have been confirmed, state officials said Monday.",
      "A child died last month from the outbreak. The CDC's death certificates data suggest the most recent reported U.S. death from measles before that was in 2019.",
      "The Trump administration has ramped up its messaging about the outbreak in recent days, including through an op-ed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and offers of support for Texas officials.",
      "\"The CDC is actively supporting Texas state health officials and will be on the ground Tuesday working with the frontline health care providers,\" HHS Principal Deputy Chief of Staff Stefanie Spear said in a statement Monday.",
      "In Canada, officials have also been grappling with a months-long outbreak that spread between two of the country's provinces.",

      "James Harrison, a retired state railway department clerk, died in a nursing home on the central coast of New South Wales state on Feb. 17, according to his grandson, Jarrod Mellowship.",
      "Harrison's plasma contained a rare antibody known as anti-D. It's used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman's immune system attacks her fetus' red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh-negative blood type and her baby's is Rh-positive.",
      "Australia has only 200 anti-D donors. They help 45,000 mothers and their babies annually.",
      "Despite an aversion to needles, Harrison made 1,173 donations after he turned 18 in 1954 until he was forced to retire in 2018, at the age of 81.",
      "\"He did it for the right reasons. As humble as he was, he did like the attention. But he would never do it for the attention,\" Mellowship said, adding his grandfather had been surprised to be recognized by Guinness World Records in 2005 as the person who had donated the most blood plasma in the world.",

      "\"It was James' belief that his donations were no more important than any other donors' and that everyone can be special in the same way that he was,\" Cornelissen added.",
      "Lifeblood said that, \"It's with enormous gratitude that we acknowledge the generous life of James Harrison. ... We thank James for the incredible contribution he made and the millions of lives he has saved.\"",

      "Jarrod Mellowship said his own wife, Rebecca, also needed the treatment when three of their four children were born.",
      "How James Harrison's blood might have acquired its unique feature",
      "There is speculation that Harrison developed high concentrations of anti-D as a result of his own blood transfusions during major lung surgery when he was 14.",
      "\"After the surgery, his dad, Reg, told grandad you're only really alive because people donated blood,\" Jarrod Mellowship said. \"The day he turned 18, he started donating.\"",

      "A recent Harvard Business Review\u00a0article identified a phenomenon called \"meeting hangovers\" which new research shows can derail productivity well beyond the meeting itself.",
      "A survey conducted by University of North Carolina Charlotte and other institutions found that more than 90% of employees occasionally experience these \"meeting hangovers,\" with over half reporting that these negative effects hurt their overall workflow and productivity.",
      "\"A meeting hangover is the idea that when we have a bad meeting, we just don't leave it at the door. It sticks with us and it negatively affects our productivity,\" said Steven Rogelberg, a professor at UNC Charlotte and author of \"The Surprising Science of Meetings.\"",
      "The study found that employees often ruminate about bad meetings and feel compelled to share their frustrations with colleagues, creating what Rogelberg terms \"co-rumination\" that can spread negative impacts throughout an organization.",
      "Common factors contributing to negative meeting experiences include unnecessary meetings that could have been emails, irrelevant agenda topics, poor facilitation, too many attendees, excessive length, domination by a few participants, and unclear decisions.",
      "Rogelberg recommends several strategies to prevent meeting hangovers:",
      "\"Keep the attendee list as small as possible,\" Rogelberg said. \"Remember that the more the leader talks, the lower the rating of effectiveness. Thus, the meeting leader needs to talk less and facilitate more.\"",
      "Rather than organizing agendas as topics to be discussed, Rogelberg suggests structuring them as questions to be answered.",
      "\"By framing agenda items as questions, you have a better sense of who really has to be invited to the meeting,\" he said. \"You know when to end the meeting and if the meeting has been successful \u2014 the questions have been answered.\"",
      "This question-based approach creates an engaging challenge that draws people in, he said, adding that \"if you just can't think of any questions, it likely means you don't need to create a meeting.\"",
      "For employees already suffering from meeting hangovers, Rogelberg suggests venting but centering on problem-focused conversations with colleagues.",
      "\"Chatting with your colleague about how to deal with the situation for the future, getting their thoughts, engaging in sense-making where you're trying to understand, taking different perspectives on what just happened \u2014 those types of conversations increase your skills and your resilience when you do have a bad meeting,\" Rogelberg said.",

    "story": [
      "This season's influenza vaccines may have been less effective against emergency room visits for some kids compared to last year, a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests, though effectiveness was still high against hospitalization.",
      "So far this season, the vaccine's protection against flu hospitalization was at least 63% for children and at least 41% for adults. These estimates of effectiveness against hospitalization, released Thursday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, are considered high for flu vaccines.",
      "But another metric of the shot's effectiveness, looking at protection against infections that result in outpatient visits to places like urgent care clinics or emergency rooms, was worse. Effectiveness was 32% for children and adolescents, from the CDC's U.S. Flu VE network of health care systems. That's down from 67% in last year's estimates.",
      "Those figures are lower than from another network of outpatient providers in the report. The study's authors suspect the decline is because of a difference in how many kids were infected in each by a strain of the flu virus called H3N2.",
      "\"The U.S. Flu VE network did not find statistically significant VE against influenza A(H3N2) in the outpatient setting among child and adolescent patients or among adult patients,\" the study's authors wrote.",
      "Earlier data reported by the CDC suggested that this season's flu vaccines might be poorly matched against many H3N2 strains this season. Around half of infections this past fall and winter were H3N2.",
      "Scientists say that the protection offered by flu shots varies widely based on several drivers, not just how well-matched the shots are to what strains are circulating. A major factor is what kind of immunity people have from previous infections and vaccinations.",

      "The 25% tax on imports from Canada and Mexico, plus an additional 10% tax on imports from China, will drive up the costs of an array of consumer goods, from groceries to automobiles, and could cause more financial strain for inflation-weary consumers, experts say.",
      "Because importers pay the tariffs \u2014 such as Walmart, which imports goods from China and other nations \u2014 U.S. businesses will shoulder the added costs. While some companies may opt to swallow all or part of the expense, some of the costs are likely to be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices, economists say.",

      "What will cost more with tariffs?",
      "Products imported directly from Canada, Mexico and China could see price hikes as businesses pass along the tariff costs, either in full or in part, to consumers.

      "The S&P 500 shed 72 points, or 1.2%, to 5,778 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 670 points, or 1.6%, The Nasdaq slipped 0.4% despite a rebound in big tech stocks such as Nvidia. The burgeoning trade war between the U.S., China, Canada and Mexico is helping to extend a recent slump for U.S. stocks.",
      "Tuesday's declines add to a\u00a0big sell-off Monday\u00a0after President Trump said he had\u00a0decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports, with Wall Street concerned that the import duties could threaten U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "\"The market finally took the Trump administration at its word, and the realization that the tariff talk wasn't just a negotiating tactic is starting to sink in,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management in a note yesterday. The market's trajectory could continue downward, he added, depending on how long the tariffs remain in effect.",
      "The burgeoning trade war between the U.S., China, Canada and Mexico is helping to extend a recent slump for U.S. stocks that was prompted by signs of weakness in the economy. Shares of Target and Best Buy fell on Tuesday after the retailers warned of higher prices for consumers due to tariffs.",
      "Markets in Europe fell sharply while stocks in Asia saw more modest declines.",
      "\"Last month's reprieve was just a temporary break in the downward trend, because a trade war is something the market didn't believe was possible, so as one (or many) start to unfold, the market will begin pricing in the inevitable damage that will be done to our economy,\" Zaccarelli said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed the market rout on Fox News, saying that the Trump administration is \"focused on Main Street.\"",
      "\"Wall Street's done great, Wall Street can continue to do fine. But we have a focus on small business and consumers,\" he said.",
      "A \"lose-lose situation\"",
      "China's retaliatory tariffs on American beef, corn, soy and other farm products announced Tuesday expanded the potential impact of Mr. Trump's trade tactics, said Francis Lun, CEO of Geo Securities in Hong Kong.",
      "\"I don't think China will buy any more U.S. farm products. The orders will go to South America,\" Lun said. \"I think all in all, it's a lose-lose situation. Nobody gains anything.\"",
      "Anxiety over tariffs is also bleeding into the corporate side of the economic equation. Target reported Tuesday that sales and profit in the crucial holiday quarter both fell from a year ago, though they were better than expected. The Minnesota retailer said there will be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year because of tariffs and other costs.",
      "Shares of Target and Best Buy fell after the retailers warned of pressure on sales and higher prices for consumers. Target shares tumbled $3.62, or 3.0%, to $117.14.",
      "Many had hoped Mr. Trump would choose a less painful path on global trade. Monday's loss shaved the S&P 500's gain since Election Day down to just over 1% from a peak of more than 6%. That rally had been built largely on hopes for policies from Mr. Trump that would strengthen the U.S. economy and businesses.",
      "After the S&P 500 set a record  last month following a parade of fatter-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies, the market began diving following weaker-than-expected reports  on the U.S. economy, including a couple showing U.S. households are getting much more pessimistic  about inflation because of the threat of tariffs. Such pessimism is not unwarranted, according to analysts.",
      "\"Inflation is set to surge as the cost of everyday goods rises, squeezing corporate margins and reshaping supply chains across industries,\" warns Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm\u00a0deVere Group which forecasts that inflation in the US could rise by as much as 2.1%, \"putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to maintain a more hawkish stance for longer than markets had anticipated,\" as a result of tariffs.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's imposition of blanket 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico drew swift vows of retaliation from the United States' immediate neighbors on Tuesday. China, which was hit with a second 10% tariff on U.S. exports since Mr. Trump took office, bringing the total levy to 20%, immediately announced its own reciprocal measures \u2014 deliberately targeting America's agricultural sector.",
      "Below is a look at the measures being imposed or planned by Canada, China and Mexico, and the rhetoric coming from officials in those countries as Mr. Trump ramps up his trade war against one of America's biggest adversaries, and its two closest neighbors.",
      "Canada announces reciprocal tariffs; Trudeau calls Trump's move \"a very dumb thing to do\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced immediate retaliation to the new U.S. tariffs in a statement late Monday evening. He said Canada would impose a $30 billion counter-tariff on goods imported from the U.S. immediately, escalating to $155 billion worth of American products within the next 21 days. Trudeau has said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances, along with Florida orange juice, with its measures.",
      "\"Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\" Trudeau said, adding that he was already discussing with Canada's provincial leaders various non-tariff measures that could be imposed if the Trump administration doesn't lift its tariffs.",
      "\"Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term,\" Trudeau said.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Trudeau lashed out at President Trump's decision.",
      "\"We should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity for North Americans in a very uncertain and challenging world,\" he said. \"Now, it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\"",
      "\"Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\" said Trudeau. \"We two friends fighting is exactly what our opponents around the world want to see.\"",
      "Trudeau also said Canada will challenge the U.S. action by filing dispute resolution claims at the World Trade Organization and through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal that replaced NAFTA.",
      "Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media threatening to raise tariffs further: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"",
      "Some of Canada's governors have pushed for a tougher response.",
      "\"If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I'm encouraging every other province to do the same; Quebec, Manitoba, BC [British Columbia], we all have to act in unison,\" Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said at an industrial convention on Monday. \"They rely on our energy. They need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard. We're going to come back twice as hard.\"",
      "Ford said retaliatory measures that Canada could consider going forward included halting shipments of critical minerals such as uranium, potash and nickel, in addition to cutting the energy supply, which he said could leave 1.5 million people without power in New York, Michigan and Minnesota, potentially causing significant disruptions to the U.S. economy.",
      "He said he had also asked officials in his province to end billions of dollars in contracts with the U.S. and to stop the import of American alcohol to Ontario.",
      "\"It's going to be an absolute disaster for both countries,\" he acknowledged in a separate interview with NBC News. \"I don't want to respond, but I will respond like they have never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has framed his tariffs on Canada as a response to what he says is the country's failure to stem the flow of both undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across the northern U.S. border \u2014 though very little of the drug enters that way, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
      "In a message posted to his own Truth social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump also took issue with Canadian banking regulations, saying the country \"doesn't allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market,\" but providing no further context.",
      "\"I heard he talked about banking again this morning,\" Trudeau said during his Tuesday news conference, \"which doesn't make any sense, because American banks \u2014 of 16 American banks currently active in Canada \u2014 holding about $113 billion worth of assets in this country. So the American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an example of not really being able to see what it is that he [Trump] wants, because even the excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false. So we actually have to fall back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Canada should become a U.S. \"51st state.\"",
      "Trudeau defended Canada's actions on border control and the illegal flow of fentanyl on Monday, saying that between December 2024 and January 2025, seizures of the drug from Canada by U.S. authorities dropped 97%, to just 0.03 pounds. That drop came, he said, after Canada implemented a $1.3 billion plan to deploy more helicopters and more boots on the ground, and to appoint a \"Fentanyl Czar.\"",
      "China announces tariffs, warns against \"maximum pressure\" tactic",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused China of giving its manufacturers and other businesses an unfair advantage in trade with the U.S. and vowed to balance the extremely lopsided flow of goods. But he has framed his latest round of tariffs on the country as punishment for what he claims is a Chinese refusal to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it to the U.S.",
      "China's government has refused to back down in the face of the escalating trade war with the Trump administration, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that the \"Chinese people cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, and bullying tactics are not the right way to deal with China.\"",
      "\"Attempting to exert maximum pressure on China is targeting the wrong opponent and is a misreading of the situation. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the fentanyl issue, it should engage in consultation with China built on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" he said, according to China's official media.",
      "\"If the U.S. has other intentions and is committed to waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will respond in kind,\" Lin said, adding a call for the White House \"to abandon its bullying tactics and return to the necessary track of dialogue and cooperation at an early date.\"",
      "China retaliated immediately, announcing its own 10-15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products and foods, from wheat, corn and cotton to soybeans, beef, chicken and dairy. Beijing also placed 25 U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions, citing what it said were national security concerns.",
      "Veteran Chinese analyst Victor Gao told CBS News that while China's counter-tariffs will impact U.S. farmers \u2014 perceived by Beijing to be among Mr. Trump's support base \u2014 he believes Beijing is being measured in its response and that it doesn't want to inflame the situation.",
      "Gao, who has worked with the country's leadership and is now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said China is better prepared for a trade war with the U.S. than it was during Mr. Trump's first term, as it has diversified into other, non-U.S. markets.",
      "He said if President Xi Jinping really wanted to step up Beijing's retaliation, it could halt imports of U.S. gas and oil, but he warned against the implications for both nations if the trade war continues to escalate, saying at best, it would end in a \"bloody tie.\"",
      "But Gao said he believed talks were still going on behind the scenes between U.S and Chinese officials, and that both countries likely have little interest in a deteriorating, tit-for-tat tariffs battle.",
      "Mexican president vows retaliation to \"inconceivable\" tariffs",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country would respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with its own retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures, but held off announcing exactly what those would be, promising a statement on Sunday in Mexico City's main square. She said she was scheduled to have a call with Mr. Trump this week, probably on Thursday.",
      "She said the reciprocal measures Mexico would take were \"not in any way or with the purpose of starting an economic or commercial confrontation that unfortunately and regrettably is the opposite of what we must be doing.\"",
      "\"It's inconceivable that they don't think about the damage this is going to cause to United States citizens and businesses with the increase in prices for things produced in our country,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Also, the damage it will cause by stopping job creation in both countries. No one wins with this decision.\"",
      "Sheinbaum stressed how Mexico had been working alongside the U.S. to respond to requests by Mr. Trump to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to reinforce the U.S.-Mexico border to curb migration.",
      "\"We collaborate to avoid illegal drug trafficking to the United States, but as we have said on multiple occasions, that country's government must take responsibility, too, for the crisis of opioid consumption that has caused so many deaths in the United States,\" the Mexican leader said.",
      "\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" added Sheinbaum.",

After rising to $90,000 Monday morning, bitcoin fell to roughly $87,000, or 7.3%, by Monday afternoon. Ethereum tumbled 14.6% to $2,153. Massive price spikes in XRP, solana and cardano also fizzled, dropping 12.1%, 13% and 12.3%, respectively.",
      "Nic Puckrin, financial analyst, investor and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note that the cause of the temporary price boost was most likely a \"combination of 'hopium' with a classic short squeeze,\" adding that more concrete information on the crypto reserve plan is needed to reassure investors of its worth.",
      "\"While the crypto reserve announcement was a bullish catalyst for crypto prices in the short term, its long-term impact remains questionable. For one thing, no actual details have been disclosed yet,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That said, the creation of digital currency reserve is a milestone moment for bitcoin and blockchain technology.",
      "\"The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government's engagement with the crypto industry,\" said Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at 21Shares, in an analyst note. \"This initiative not only reinforces Bitcoin's role as a maturing store of value but also highlights the importance of blockchain networks like ethereum, solana, XRP and cardano in financial infrastructure, payments and decentralized finance.\"",
      "What is a crypto strategic reserve?",
      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",
      "The crash of meme coins linked to First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei, along with a massive hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange that the FBI has said was undertaken by North Korea, have also dimmed enthusiasm for crypto.",

    "summary": "Here's how new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China could impact car prices for consumers, according to a new analysis.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's tariffs on three key U.S. trade partners, which are set to go into effect\u00a0Tuesday, could drive up automobile costs for U.S. consumers by thousands of dollars and put a dent in U.S. car sales, industry analysts and U.S.-based automakers say.",
      "The 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them.\"",
      "Some product lines and equipment combination could become uneconomical for automakers to continue producing, he noted. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Which vehicles could see the greatest price increases?",
      "The range of added costs on vehicles could run from $4,000 to $10,000, with the cost of producing some electric vehicles that rely heavily on components from China rising by as much as $12,200, according to AEG's analysis.",
      "Here are the projected impacts of the tariffs on some types of popular vehicles, according to the study:",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200Full-size SUV: $9,000Pickup truck: $8,000Small car: $6,200",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200",
      "Full-size SUV: $9,000",
      "Pickup truck: $8,000",
      "Small car: $6,200",
      "Tariff-driven cost increases may lead to a \"potential loss of sales\" for domestic automakers, given that consumers might turn to the used car market, or seek out automobiles assembled in Japan, for example, for cheaper alternatives, Anderson added.",
      "\"Or, they could decide simply not to buy one at all,\" he said.",
      "Automobile supply chains are complex because they involve numerous parts, some of which can cross borders more than once over the course of the assembly process. With tariffs added to the equation, costs could quickly escalate for automakers.",
      "\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Cornell University professor of government and public policy Gustavo Flores-Macias said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dan Hearsch, Americas leader of the automotive & industrial practice at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm, said the tariffs will present at least a momentary advantage for manufacturers that assemble vehicles in Japan, Korea or Europe, for example.",
      "\"For automakers that don't import from Canada or Mexico, they'll end up with a little bit of an advantage, because they won't be hit with this brand-new tariff,\" he said. \"So for some period of time, vehicles coming in that aren't subject to additional tariffs will have a big advantage over domestic companies, or those that are producing in Canada, Mexico or the U.S.\"",
      "He added, \"It's basically penalizing companies relative to those that are importing vehicles from other places, for now.\"",
      "Ford CEO says tariffs would have \"huge impact\"",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on last month, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, by contrast, insisted in a\u00a0post on social media that such tariffs would be a \"win\" for American industry by driving \"massive amounts of auto manufacturing\" to Michigan, for one.",

    "story": [
      "Stocks fell sharply on Monday after President Trump said he has decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, with Wall Street concerned that the import duties could threaten U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "The broad-based S&P 500 index tumbled 105 points, or 1.8%, to 5,850, marking its biggest one-day decline so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index shed 2.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%.",
      "Additionally, new data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is forecasting an economic contraction in the first quarter, with gross domestic product projected to\u00a0decline an annualized 2.8% in the current quarter \u2014 a reversal from growth of almost 3% that was forecast as recently as early February.",
      "Economists are sounding alarms about growing economic uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, which could push up prices in the U.S. and undermine the president's pledge to eliminate the inflation that ate into consumers' purchasing power during the Biden administration. At the same time, recent economic data is showing some cracks in the financial health of U.S. households, with consumer confidence dropping in February to its lowest in four years.",
      "\"We expect that inflation in the U.S. will be stoked by between 1.1% and 1.4% from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with another 0.7% coming from those slapped on China,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, in an email. \"The economic implications are vast: the price of everyday goods will rise, corporate profits will feel the squeeze and consumers will ultimately foot the bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Americans say their outlook for the next year is mixed, with more people likely to say the economy is getting worse than better, according to CBS News polling. Consumers say they believe the economy and inflation should be Mr. Trump's top issues, but most say they see the president prioritizing other issues, such as downsizing the federal workforce, another CBS News poll found.",
      "The push behind Mr. Trump's tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump views tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 as an economic elixir that can restore factories to the American heartland, raise money for the government and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump put tariffs on most Chinese goods and on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\"That was then. This is now,'' said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \"that would show up on Walmart's shelves,\" said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession, said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco.",
      "Because U.S. businesses must bear the added costs from tariffs, they largely pass on the costs to American consumers. That, in turn, could weigh on consumer spending at a time when households are still grappling with the fallout from post-pandemic inflation.",
      "The Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through widespread job cuts, could have a ripple effect, curtailing spending by U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Monday that a leading Taiwanese semiconductor chip company plans to invest $100 billion in new manufacturing plants in the U.S.",
      "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor chips, and plans to make the major investment over the next several years. Mr. Trump made the announcement in the White House Roosevelt Room alongside the company's CEO, C.C. Wei.",
      "\"Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think mostly it's going to be in Arizona which is what I understand, which is a great state. I like it because I won it.\"",
      "The president called TSMC the \"most powerful company in the world,\" and said the economic development announcement is a \"matter of economic security\" and a \"matter of national security for us.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report the investment pledge. TSMC was promised $6.6 billion in funding under the Biden-era CHIPS and SCIENCE Act of 2022, and announced plans for its first U.S. plant in Arizona.",
      "The anticipated announcement comes amid Mr. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on semiconductor chip imports, which TSMC could avoid by manufacturing the chips in the U.S. The president has also floated expedited permits for companies that invest at least $1 billion in the U.S. Mr. Trump noted Monday that if Wei's company made the chips in Taiwan and exported them to the U.S., they'd face 25% tariffs.",
      "Speaking at the White House, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick credited the tariffs with the TSMC announcement.",
      "\"Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So America gave TSMC 10% of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency,\" Lutnick said. \"TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with a hundred-billion-dollar investment, and of course that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\"",
      "Semiconductor chips are small but critical components for today's technology, with small pieces of silicone that contain electronic circuits. Semiconductor chips are found in everything from iPhones to cars, and demand has boomed in recent years thanks to the explosion in artificial intelligence, which requires an enormous amount of computing power.",
      "\"Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"And really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy, powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.\"",
      "The vast majority of semiconductor chips are manufactured in Asian countries, with Taiwan at the top, and the Trump administration is hoping to draw more manufacturing to the U.S. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have viewed increasing U.S. chip manufacturing a matter of national security.",
      "\"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And that's exactly what we're doing. As you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.\"",

      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",
      "His advice? \"Tighten up your boots and climb.\"",

    "story": [
      "The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure,\u00a0rose\u00a02.5% in January on an annual basis, matching economists' expectations and providing some reassurance on the heels of hotter-than-expected inflation data earlier this month.",
      "The PCE index and other inflation yardsticks, such as the Consumer Price Index, measure the change in prices over time of a typical basket of goods and services.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The January numbers match forecasts that the PCE rose 2.5% on an annual basis, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "While inflation has plunged from its recent peak of about 9% in June 2022, it still remains higher than the Fed's goal of driving it to an annual rate of 2%. Today's PCE data follows on the heels of the most recent CPI report, which showed that inflation accelerated in January to 3% on an annual basis.",
      "What economists say",
      "The PCE report shows that inflation \"rose at a mild pace in January, which offers some relief after a string of economic reports suggesting that inflation is heating up again,\" said Key Wealth managing director of fixed income investments Rajeev Sharma in an email.",
      "The recent sticky CPI report had reinforced the Fed's decision in January to\u00a0pause\u00a0on additional rate cuts, but today's data suggests that the central bank could still introduce more reductions this year. That said, \"thoughts of multiple rate cuts for 2025 may be overly optimistic based on today's data,\" Sharma added.",
      "Many consumers are also expressing their concerns about stubborn inflation, with a large majority of Americans telling CBS News polling that their incomes aren't keeping pace with inflation. Some are expressing concern about their ability to save or buy extras, the poll found.",
      "Consumer sentiment is souring amid stubborn inflation and other headwinds, according to some recent measures. \"The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment for Democratic-leaning consumers plunged to the lowest since the economic collapse of 2008 in February,\" noted Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, in an email.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 17:41:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump officials remain on course to hit Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs on March 4, with a wave of other levies ready to roll.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are expressing concern that steep new U.S. tariffs primed to take effect on March 4, along with planned levies on other trading partners, could fan inflation and slow the nation's growth \u2014 an economic malaise known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "President Trump on Thursday said on social media that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which had been delayed for a month while the sides negotiated, will now roll out\u00a0next week as scheduled. He also this week announced an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, on top of those already in place, set to kick in next week, while\u00a025% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are lined up for March 12. Sweeping reciprocal tariffs and levies on\u00a0automobile imports\u00a0may be deployed as soon as early April, while Mr. Trump has threatened to hit imports from the European Union with 25% duties.",
      "Mounting uncertainty about the scale and potential impact of such tariffs, including the \"somewhat abrupt and arbitrary way\" in which they've been announced, risks throttling spending by consumers and businesses, said Marcus Noland, director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "\"Normally I'd say tariffs alone would damage the economy, but won't send the U.S. into recession,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What gives me pause about that now is the unsettling way that that the administration is going about its business and general confusion about tariffs. It's not so much the actual tariffs but confusion about them that's causing an increase in uncertainty and is really pushing down investment.\"",
      "EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said the Trump tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession. U.S. businesses would bear the added costs from taxes on imports and mostly pass them along to American consumers, which would weigh on spending.",
      "A recent survey from EY-Parthenon found that 50% of business executives said they would pass on two-thirds or more of any increased costs they incur from tariffs to consumers.",
      "\"In a world where your imports cost 25% more, or even 10% more, there is going to be a notable impact on prices and inflation,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That will lead to demand destruction, so if the administration presses too hard on the tariff front there is a negative effect on our import prices and on inflation.\"",
      "Fears of a trade war are raising concerns among businesses and consumers, he added. U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in what was the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a sign that growing uncertainty over Mr. Trump's policies is taking a toll, the Conference Board said this week.",
      "\"They are fearful of incoming inflation so if anything, the policies put in place have the tendency to be inflationary, and there is not only a risk of a recession, but stagnation,\" Daco said, referring to the periods intense economic distress in the 1970s marked by stagnant economic growth and high inflation.",
      "U.S. consumer spending fell in January compared to the previous month, dropping for the first time in nearly two years, according to data from the Commerce Department. The 0.5% slump was partly attributed to weather, but was also \"another illustration that President Trump's tariff threats are not sitting well with households,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "Another potential drag on the economy, according to economists: the Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through mass job cuts. That will have a spillover effect and could limit spending at U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

    "summary": "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\"one Social Security Administration employee said of the agency's plans to slash its workforce.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security Administration workers are warning that the Trump administration's plan to significantly shrink the agency could cause chaos and hinder their ability to provide service to the millions of retirees, disabled people and other Americans who rely on the program.",
      "The SSA's restructuring comes after President Trump vowed on the campaign trail not to touch the old-age and disability insurance program, which provides monthly financial payments to almost 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans. At the same time, Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla who is serving as a close adviser to the president, are vowing to cut what they say is fraud and abuse across federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "But current Social Security employees caution that cutting the already strained Social Security workforce could impact beneficiaries in numerous ways, such as longer waits to qualify for disability benefits and for assistance on customer service issues.",
      "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\" said one current Social Security Administration employee, an attorney who works on disability applications and who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his job at the agency.",
      "\"Right now we are working on applications generally from 2023-ish,\" he noted. But, he added, a significant workforce reduction could mean that \"easily the wait times will be extended by one year.\"",
      "Each year, thousands of people awaiting disability decisions die before they receive their benefits, with former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O'Malley telling Nextgov/FCW in 2024 that about 30,000 people died while awaiting their determinations during fiscal 2023.",
      "Most workers qualify for Social Security disability coverage through their payroll taxes, which provides a backstop in case you get injured and aren't able to continue working, the Social Security worker noted. But cutting agency staff likely means it could become even more difficult for many disabled workers to get their benefits approved, he added.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Cuts come amid boomers turning \"peak 65\"",
      "The SSA on Thursday sent an email to all employees stating that the agency would soon undergo a restructuring, including \"significant workforce reductions.\" On Friday, the agency said it plans to trim staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers.",
      "The agency is also offering financial incentives ranging as high as $25,000 to some employees who choose to voluntarily resign.",
      "The agency's workforce cuts come as the ranks of Americans receiving Social Security benefits have swelled to an all-time high, largely due to the aging baby boomer population. An average of about 11,000 boomers are set to turn 65 each day this year through 2027, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the Alliance for Lifetime Income.",
      "That demographic change, called \"peak 65,\" is causing major economic and societal changes, with Social Security on the receiving end. Since 2014, the number of retired workers and their dependents receiving Social Security payments has surged by almost 30%, reaching 54 million people as of last year, according to agency data.",
      "At the same time, the number of full-time workers at the Social Security Administration has declined almost 10% from about 63,000 employees in 2014 to about 57,000 workers in 2022, agency data\u00a0shows.",
      "Even before these pending cuts, some recipients were struggling with service issues at the Social Security Administration, Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've got wait times, you have phone calls that get dropped, you get put on hold for hours \u2014 and this will make it so much worse,\" she said.",
      "Long wait times for callers seeking help from the Social Security Administration's workforce was identified as a trouble spot in the agency's most recent\u00a0annual performance report. Its goal: To shave an average 34-minute on-hold wait time to 12 minutes, although the agency said it was evaluating that \"aspirational goal\" as it was unable to hire additional workers last year.",
      "Workers taking buyouts",
      "Some Social Security employees are already opting for the buyouts, which could lead to a brain drain at the administration, another agency employee told CBS MoneyWatch. The employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his job safety, noted that several people in his group told him they planned to accept buyout offers.",
      "Because Social Security workers with 25 years of experience are eligible for the buyouts, the agency will lose some of its most experienced workers, he added.",
      "\"You are going to see a slowdown in everything,\" he said.",
      "Morale at the agency is at \"an all-time low,\" a third Social Security employee said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as she is still employed at the agency.",
      "Employees were also distressed by Acting Social Security Commissioner Lee Dudek's response to Elon Musk's demand that workers detail five recent work accomplishments. In an email sent to staff, Dudek singled out firing probationary workers as one of his personal achievements. \"It left a very bad taste in our mouths,\" the employee said.",
      "Many agency workers receive modest salaries, the third Social Security worker added. All the Social Security employees who spoke with CBS MoneyWatch said they were drawn to the agency because they wanted to help people.",
      "About 80% of Social Security workers earn somewhere between Grades 5 to 12 on the federal general schedule pay scale, which includes a starting pay range between about $33,000 to $74,000 a year, agency data shows.",
      "Americans fund the Social Security Administration's services through their payroll taxes, or FICA contributions, noted Rich Couture, the spokesman for the Social Security General Committee of the American Federation of Government Employees.",
      "\"The public paid for access to services with their FICA contributions,\" Couture said. \"We're at a 50-year staffing low in the midst of a customer service crisis \u2014 now is the time for us to invest in Social Security with proper staffing to make further improvements.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 15:45:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The man who launched the Economic Blackout said he is \"trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians,  to stand for the people.\"",
    "story": [
      "After years of railing against corporate greed on social media, John Schwarz had an idea that suddenly caught fire: an \"economic blackout\" aimed at resisting what he maintains is an alliance between corporations and politicians to rig the system against ordinary Americans.",
      "The 57-year-old Chicago resident, founder of the People's Union USA, the fledgling advocacy group leading the campaign, expresses surprise at suddenly finding himself and his movement in the spotlight. Yet while he initially found the attention overwhelming, Schwarz said that in other ways it's a moment he's been preparing for all of his life.",
      "\"I've been online for 10 years trying to do this in kind of a nice way, not really speaking as bluntly on specific topics,\" Schwarz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And then after that, I said, no, this is great because this is exactly what I wanted to do. And I just dove in head first and we're not stopping.\"",
      "Schwartz, a father of three and meditation teacher, said the idea for a blackout came to him while recording the latest in a series of videos posted on social media in which he presents himself as a common man who is also president of the United States.",
      "\"When I was into about the third or fourth one of those, I said even a president should be calling for an economic blackout and to unionize citizens. And when I kind of said that, it sparked that idea in me. And I said, you know what, as a matter of fact let's do this. Let's do an economic blackout \u2014 get a bunch of people together for one day, if they want to take part and start something, and try to work on unionizing the people.\"",
      "Over the past month, word has spread quickly of the Feb. 28 Economic Blackout, which urges Americans to refrain from spending any money at any major retailer for 24 hours. The People's Union says it is apolitical and that its call for a boycott \u2014 communicated by punchy posts on Instagram and TikTok set to music, as well by text an email \u2014 is meant to fire a shot across the bow of corporate giants from Amazon to McDonald's.",
      "\"Mega corporations have driven up prices, underpaid their workers and outsourced jobs while raking in record profits,\" the group said on its website. \"Banks and financial institutions have trapped generations in debt, inflating interest rates and making homeownership nearly impossible. Politicians 'both left and right' have accepted corporate bribes, passed laws that serve billionaires and ignored the needs of the people they claim to represent.\"",
      "Schwarz said he grew up in the 1970s and '80s \"in the projects,\" referring to the subsidized housing where he was raised in Queens, New York. He describes that neighborhood as a melting pot of Jewish, Black, Polish, Russian and other families.",
      "\"We didn't walk around going, 'Oh, you're white, you're black, you're Russian.' It was just, we were all from the neighborhood,\" he said. \"I think there's a way to kind of get to that feeling with everyone in this country, because we're so divided today. We're more divided today on more subjects than any other time in history.\"",
      "Schwarz underlines that the goal of reunifying Americans is fundamental to him and the People's Union. His idols include Muhammad Ali, Martin Luther King Jr., social activist Abbie Hoffman, and politician and civil rights leader Harvey Milk, individuals he said he admires for dedicating their lives to speaking out 'for the people.' \"",
      "What does the People's Union USA stand for?",
      "Schwarz founded the People's Union USA only in February, and as a grassroots organization the group is still in the process of setting up its structure and registering as a legal entity. To cover the costs, Schwarz has set up a GoFundMe page with the goal of raising $100,000, and as of Friday has raised more than $90,000.",
      "Schwarz sees the blackout as a way for Americans to use their economic might in the form of their purchasing power to fight corporate greed and corrupt politicians.",
      "\"What we're doing here is trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians, to stand for the people. I think people may be able to at some point begin to kind of realize those things they're letting divide us don't really exist,\" he said.",
      "Another goal for The People's Union is abolishing federal income\u00a0taxes for average Americans, which Schwarz said can be achieved by requiring large businesses to pay \"their fair share.\"",
      "Added Schwarz, \"And even, you know, the administration is just putting their foot in their mouth with wanting to do, you know, gold card visas for $5 million. So they're talking about bringing in more money, all the more reason we shouldn't have to pay federal taxes.\"",
      "Schwarz also favors imposing a government cap on corporate profits. \"Companies need to prove what their expenses are in comparison to their profits. And there has to be a reasonable cap.\"",
      "More broadly, Schwarz underlines the importance of Americans gaining a measure of freedom from an economic system that he believes normalizes financial struggle and traps people in a perpetual cycle of debt.",

    "story": [
      "Microsoft is pulling the plug on Skype, the pioneering Internet telecommunications and video call platform it bought\u00a0nearly 14 years ago for $8.5 billion.",
      "\"We will be retiring Skype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern communications and collaboration hub,\" already used by hundreds of millions of people at work, school and home,\" Jeff Teper, president of collaborative apps and platforms at the Redmond, Washington-based software company,\u00a0said on Friday in a statement.",
      "Microsoft in late 2012\u00a0scrapped its own instant-messaging\u00a0tool, Messenger, after buying Skype the prior year. But in the more than decade since, services including FaceTime, Messenger and WhatsApp have let people connect in ways that made it difficult for Skype to compete.",
      "The difficulties were illustrated in particular during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw people\u00a0stuck at home flocking to Zoom. Microsoft launched Teams for consumers in 2020, while saying at the time it remained committed to Skype.",
      "Skype was launched in 2003 by entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, with the company's name combining \"Sky\" with a reference to peer-to-peer networks, the technology that during the dotcom boom became an important new way for sharing online files and data.",
      "The company's founders first sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion. Microsoft's acquisition in May of 2011, at the time the biggest ever purchase for the software maker, gave it access to a user base of about 170 million people who logged in to Skype each month. That count morphed to more than 300 million monthly users by 2016, but had shriveled to 36 million in 2023, Microsoft said.",
      "Those now using Skype will have time to log in to the Microsoft Teams app and have their message history, group chats and contacts available without having to create an additional account, according to Microsoft. Users can also opt to export their data to another app.",
      "Skype will be available until May 5, giving users about two months to decide which option they want to take.",

    "story": [
      "It's not only the surging cost of eggs that is making breakfast pricier these days \u2014 the price of coffee is also spiking because of a confluence of factors.",
      "The cost of wholesale arabica beans \u2014 the most popular on the planet \u2014 surpassed $4 a pound for the first time this month and have doubled over the past year, running up from less than two bucks a pound in January 2024 to a record $4.30 a pound on February 13, 2025, according\u00a0to\u00a0futures contracts traded in New York.",
      "For consumers still grappling with high food costs, that means soaring prices in the grocery aisle. The retail price of ground coffee hit an all-time high of $7 a pound in January, up 75% from $4 in January 2020, government data\u00a0shows.",
      "Coffee drinkers are likely to see even steeper prices over the next three or four months, with Andrea Illy, chairman of Italian roaster and global retailer Illycaff\u00e8, recently\u00a0predicting\u00a0that bean prices could climb 25% this year.",
      "Unlike some products, coffee is viewed as essential by many consumers, making them more willing to pay up for their java fixes. Without a direct substitute for coffee, retailers and suppliers generally have greater room to raise their prices.",
      "\"Coffee, as we all know, it's a pass-through category,\" J.M. Smucker CEO Mark Smucker said in an earnings\u00a0call in November. \"We've been very pleased with our performance in the quarter, despite the fact that we continue to see significant inflation,\" said the executive, whose company's brands include Folgers and Cafe Bustelo.",
      "Cost of climate change",
      "As with the cost of other global commodities, supply and demand are a large part of the equation. Getting caffeinated is likely to become an ever-costlier proposition because of rising temperatures, droughts and excessive rains striking Brazil and Vietnam, the world's two biggest producers.",
      "The 2024 coffee growing season saw a drought followed by August frost in Brazil, and flooding in October came in the wake of a drought in Vietnam. Brazil's coffee exports during the month were down 7.4% year-over-year and Vietnam's December export fell nearly 40%, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from the International Coffee Organization.",
      "\"When the crop in Brazil does not produce as much coffee as expected in the year, that causes the prices to shoot up,\" Gregory Zomfotis, founder and CEO of Gregorys Coffee, told CBS News.",
      "\"Some of the major producers have really not seen the production levels that were expected and quite far from it, so that's caused a severe spike in the price of coffee,\" added Zomfotis, whose company operates more than 50 stores nationwide and expect to purchase up to 700,000 pounds of coffee this year.",
      "Amid those supply constraints, global demand for coffee in growing. For example, consumption is up 150% over 10 years in China \u2014 the world's most populous country, according\u00a0to\u00a0the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Other factors also are contributing to the pricing pressures, including politics. President Trump on Tuesday vowed to proceed next week with his previous threats of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. A levy on Mexico, whose largest coffee export market is the U.S., would likely push prices up further.",
      "Separately, a new European Union law that is now set to take effect in December prohibits the sale of products, including coffee, if companies can't show they are not linked to deforestation\u00a0 \u2014 a bid to lessen greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. That effort to address the climate crisis could further tighten supplies of coffee beans.",
      "Geopolitical conflicts are also a factor in rising coffee costs. Fighting between Israel and Hamas has caused havoc in the Red Sea, which carries 30% of the world's container traffic, including coffee from Vietnam. Slowdowns in the Red Sea and the Suez Canal meant as many as 5 billion bags of coffee had not yet arrived in Europe, the International Coffee Organization reported in December.",

      "The FAA has faced a longstanding shortage of air traffic controllers, while the agency's oversight of the skies has recently faced heightened scrutiny following a\u00a0string of recent aviation incidents. Currently, more than 90% of U.S. airport towers are understaffed, and do not meet standards set by a working group that includes the FAA and the controllers' union, according to a CBS News analysis of FAA data.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Thursday announced an effort to \"supercharge\" the hiring of air traffic controllers following a visit to an FAA training institute in Oklahoma, according to a release from the U.S. Department of Transportation.",
      "\"I witnessed firsthand the dedication, skill and rigor that our future air traffic controllers bring to their training and the urgent need to do all that we can to recruit more people to join in our shared mission of safety in our skies,\" Duffy said in a statement. \"This staffing shortage has been a known challenge for over a decade, and this administration is committed to solving it.\"",
      "The FAA announced an air traffic controller hiring window between Feb. 27 and Mar. 17. It said the hiring process will be more efficient by becoming a five-step, rather than an eight-step process. Starting salaries for candidates are also being by 30%; the average certified professional controller makes over $160,000 per year, the FAA noted.",
      "There are approximately 10,800 air traffic controllers working across U.S. airports, which the NATCA says is about 3,600 fewer than \"what is needed to fully staff the National Airspace System.\"",
      "While several hundred probationary workers at the FAA were\u00a0recently fired by the Trump administration through late night emails sent on Feb. 14, \"Zero air traffic controllers and critical safety personnel\" were among those let go according to Duffy in a Feb. 17\u00a0post on X.",
      "Duffy has said he wants to extend a waiver to the current controllers who are near retirement age to help expand the workfroce.",
      "Earlier this month, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing air traffic controllers, told CBS the proposal is not \"an effective solution to addressing the chronic air traffic controller staffing crisis. \"In the next 12 months, we anticipate 49 ATCs across 35 facilities will reach age 56.\u00a0This is not enough to address the nationwide staffing shortage,\" the union added.",
      "\"The solution to the ATC staffing crisis is a long-term commitment to hiring and training and the retention of the experience of all the highly skilled, highly trained air traffic controllers,\" it added.",
      "Shortage goes back to pandemic",

    "story": [
      "With tax season well underway, early data on the average tax refund shows that Americans are receiving about one-third less than they did a year earlier.",
      "The average refund check in 2025 stood at $2,169 as of Feb. 14, about 32% below the average $3,207 refund issued at the same time last year, the IRS said in its most recent tax update. The agency began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15 except for taxpayers who request an extension.",
      "Those numbers don't necessarily mean that individual taxpayers will get a smaller refund, experts note. Refunds are typically smaller at the start of the tax season because low- and middle-income workers with simpler tax returns are often the first to file, while higher-income Americans or people with more complicated taxes tend to wait until closer to the April 15 deadline to file their returns.",
      "\"Many employees, all they have is a W2 \u2014 they have smaller refunds or smaller amounts to pay because they have withholding through their jobs,\" Keith Hall, CEO of the National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE) and a certified CPA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "At the same time, Hall said some small business owners are reporting receiving financial tax forms, such as dividend or brokerage account statements, later than in past years. That often leads businesses to hold off on filing with the IRS until they've gathered all their tax documents.",
      "So far, fewer Americans have filed their taxes in the season's opening weeks when compared with 2024, the IRS data shows. About 33 million returns had been submitted through through Feb. 14, a 5% decline from the same period a year ago.",
      "The IRS also noted that tax data tends to \"even out as more tax returns come in.\" In its most recent data release, the agency said it expects tax return filings to \"level out in future weeks as the April filing deadline approaches.\"",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "Taxpayers should file as soon as possible because that will enable them to get their refund faster, Hall said. Other tax experts are also urging consumers to file quickly because of concerns that IRS job cuts ordered by the Trump administration could add to challenges in getting tax returns processed this year.",
      "Most refunds are issued in fewer than 21 calendar days if you file your taxes electronically, according to the IRS. Taxes filed on paper require more time because human IRS agents must process those returns, which can add weeks to getting a refund.",
      "Taxpayers can monitor the status of their 2025 refund using the IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund?\u00a0tool, with e-filers able to check on their return 24 hours after filing. People who file on paper won't be able to see their refund status for four weeks after they mail their return to the IRS, the agency says.",
      "About half of Americans intend to file their taxes by the end of February, with the other half planning to finish their returns in March and April, according to the National Retail Federation's annual tax return survey. About half of taxpayers say they expect a refund this year, it found.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 19:12:48 -0500",
    "summary": "With members of the presidential line of succession in the Capitol for President Trump's speech to the joint session of Congress, a designated survivor will be named to stay away in case of a catastrophic event.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's speech Tuesday night will take place in front of members of both Houses of Congress and the entire presidential line of succession \u2014 with one notable exception. Each year, one Cabinet member is chosen as the \"designated survivor\" who will sit out the speech in case of a catastrophic event.",
      "The name of the designated survivor is not usually revealed to the public until shortly before the speech starts \u2014 or even sometimes after it starts.",
      "What is a designated survivor?",
      "The designated survivor is the informal name used for the person in the line of succession who does not attend the joint session of Congress so that there would be a leader available to step up in case of a catastrophic event.",
      "The line of succession was first determined by Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, but the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 set the modern line of succession if something should happen to the president and he or she cannot undertake his or her duties. First in line for the presidency is Vice President JD Vance. Second in line after the vice president is House Speaker Mike Johnson, third in line is Senate pro tempore Chuck Grassley, fourth in line is Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and fifth in line is Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The line continues through other members of the Cabinet, in the order their departments were created, with the secretary of Homeland Security \u2014 currently\u00a0Kristi Noem \u2014 at 18th in line.",
      "Since all of those people would normally be in attendance at the joint session of Congress, a designated survivor is chosen to stay away.",
      "Why does the practice of choosing a designated survivor exist?",
      "Unlike the line of succession, the designated survivor is not something determined by the Constitution. The practice is believed to have started during the Cold War in the 1950s, but it was not until 1981 that the first official designated survivor was named as then-Education Secretary Terrel Bell.",
      "How do they choose the designated survivor?",
      "It's not clear how the administration chooses a designated survivor since the process is classified. The person must be eligible to serve as president, so they must be a native-born American citizen and at least 35 years old. There have been several Cabinet members over the years who did not fit those criteria, including former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright, who was born in what is now the Czech Republic, and German-born Henry Kissinger.",
      "Former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, who was named as designated survivor by President Bill Clinton in 1996, told ABC News in 2014 that she was shown the Situation Room and the White House staff \"talked seriously about the responsibility of the designated survivor.\"",
      "What does the designated survivor do during the speech?",
      "There have been a few designated survivors who have been willing to discuss what they did during the speech. Then-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who was tapped by Clinton to be designated survivor in 2000, told ABC News in 2014 that he watched the speech from a friend's house in Sherwood, Maryland, about 90 miles outside Washington.",
      "\"It's fun. You're sitting there, you're being watched. You got security. And there are a few thrills,\" he told ABC News. \"My wife and my friends were impressed the fire trucks were there.\"",
      "Former Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman wrote an essay in 2017 in Politico about his own experience after being chosen. According to Glickman, he was taken a secure location outside Washington (in his case, his daughter's New York apartment), where he writes that he was \"accompanied by key military staff and Secret Service, including a military officer carrying what I presumed to be the nuclear football \u2014 a black, leather-encased aluminum briefcase that would be used to authenticate the person ordering a nuclear strike.\"",
      "\"I don't recall getting any specific instructions on what to do if the doomsday scenario happened,\" Glickman wrote. \"All I knew is that if necessary, I could turn to that military officer accompanying me, holding that 45-pound bag, and trigger a military response, including a nuclear strike.\"",
      "Shalala, meanwhile, told ABC News that she stayed in Washington, waited it out at the White House and ordered pizza for her staff",
      "\"I saw the president when he left and when he came back,\" Shalala said. \"He said, 'Don't do anything I wouldn't do.'\"",
      "Who has been named designated survivor in the past?",
      "The designated survivor is usually a member of the Cabinet, although the Secretaries of State, Defense and Treasury have never been chosen. There was\u00a0no designated survivor in 2021, since only 200 members of Congress attended the joint session of Congress amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Here are the last few designated survivors and the positions they held at the time:",

    "summary": "President Trump will address a joint session of Congress tonight, marking his first speech to both chambers since he returned to office. Here's how to watch his 2025 address.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0President Trump will address a joint session of Congress tonight, marking the first time he will speak before both chambers since he returned to office six weeks ago.",
      "Presidents typically address a joint session of Congress early in their tenure to outline a vision or agenda. The first speech before lawmakers is not technically a State of the Union, but rather an Address to a Joint Session of Congress.",
      "As is customary, House Speaker Mike Johnson in January invited Mr. Trump to address Congress and \"share his America First vision for our future.\" In a letter to the president, the speaker wrote that the Trump administration and the Republican majorities in Congress will \"have the chance to make these next four years some of the most consequential in our nation's history.\"",
      "\"America's Golden Age has begun,\" Johnson said in the letter, echoing a line from Mr. Trump's inaugural address, while touting a \"resurgence of patriotism, unity, and hope for the future.\"",
      "What time will Trump's speech start and end?",
      "The president's address is set to begin shortly after 9 p.m. ET. Its running time remains to be seen. During his first term, Mr. Trump's 2017\u00a0joint address to Congress ran about one hour. Over the next three years, his State of the Union addresses averaged 80 minutes, according to the American Presidency Project.",
      "The theme of Mr. Trump's address is \"The Renewal of the American Dream,\" according to a White House official. The president is expected in the speech to highlight what his administration has done so far, its economic policy, border security and foreign policy plans. The president said in a post on Truth Social late Monday that he will \"TELL IT LIKE IT IS!\"",
      "The president's speech will be followed by the official Democratic response, delivered by Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.",
      "How to watch Trump's speech on cable",
      "CBS News will carry the president's address and the Democratic response live in a primetime special beginning at 9 p.m. ET. Find your local CBS station here.",
      "Where to stream Trump's speech without cable",
      "Stream CBS News' coverage for free on CBS News 24/7, available on CBSNews.com, the CBS News app and Paramount+.",
      "Context to know for Trump's address to Congress",
      "Mr. Trump's address to Congress comes six weeks after he returned to office for a second term. So far, Americans agree that he is making major changes to how the government works, though there's a divide on whether they view the changes as better or worse, according to CBS News polling released Sunday.",
      "The president has pursued a dramatic overhaul of the federal bureaucracy and a cost-cutting effort alongside Elon Musk, who he's tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. DOGE has been working with Cabinet department and agency heads to shrink the government workforce, while halting swaths of government spending. A number of Democrats are bringing former government employees fired as a result of the DOGE cuts as their guests to Tuesday's address to highlight the individuals personally impacted.",
      "The Trump administration in its first six weeks has also worked to bolster border security with a government-wide immigration crackdown, and illegal border crossings were significantly down during Mr. Trump's first month in office. Still, the administration has faced obstacles in its efforts to conduct what it's billed as the largest deportation operation in American history in the U.S. interior. Top Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have been reassigned in recent weeks amid frustrations that the agency has not carried out sufficient arrests and deportations. ICE's detention capacity has also been stretched thin, with detention centers recently filled at levels above 110%.",
      "While Mr. Trump's approach to immigration has received support in recent\u00a0polling, Americans overwhelmingly say he should prioritize inflation and the economy. At the same time, the president has pursued tariffs that have prompted fears of a trade war among businesses and consumers. On Tuesday, 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and higher levies on goods from China took effect, prompting retaliatory actions in response.",
      "Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have been pursuing legislation to support Mr. Trump's agenda, facing headwinds with a narrow majority in the House and differing views on the path forward. Last week, the House adopted a budget resolution that paves the way for implementing the president's agenda on border security, defense and energy priorities, while extending the 2017 tax cuts. But it's not yet clear how the budget blueprint will fare in the Senate, where lawmakers have pursued a different approach.",
      "Mr. Trump's return to the White House has also had serious implications on the world stage even in the first six weeks. Last week, a meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy devolved into a feud with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and Zelenskyy was ultimately asked to leave the White House without signing a critical multibillion-dollar rare earth minerals deal. On Monday, the White House said it was pausing military aid to Ukraine.",
      "The contentious meeting came after Mr. Trump had appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with billions in weapons since the Russian invasion three years ago, and a split with Zelenskyy may have major implications for its ability to defend itself.",

    "summary": "Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say they'll watch President Trump's joint address to Congress.",
    "story": [
      "Looking ahead to President Trump's address to Congress, here's what's on Americans' minds and what they want to hear from the president, with context from recent CBS News polling.",
      "What do people want to hear about?",
      "Inflation. More think it's important for Mr. Trump to talk about his plans for lowering prices than any other item tested. It's the top issue for both Republicans and Democrats.",
      "Inflation is an issue (along with the economy) that a big majority of Americans think should be a high priority for the president but don't think he is prioritizing it a lot.",
      "Seventy-seven percent of Americans say their incomes are not keeping up with inflation.",
      "Many also want to hear about plans for Medicare and Medicaid, the federal budget and cutting taxes.",
      "Americans are less likely to think it's important to hear the president talk about things like reductions in the federal workforce, what Congress should do, and the events of Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Who plans to watch the speech?",
      "Mainly Republicans. Mr. Trump's address to Congress will likely have a relatively friendly audience consisting primarily of Republicans. Historically, those in the president's own party have been more inclined to watch an address like this or a State of the Union speech.",
      "In keeping with this, Americans who plan to tune in to tonight's speech are more likely to be Republicans than Democrats or independents. Most of those potential watchers who voted in the 2024 presidential election cast their ballot for Mr. Trump.",
      "(During Joe Biden's presidency, the audience who watched his speeches to a joint Congress had more Democrats than Republicans.)",
      "Three in four of those who say they'll watch the speech approve of the overall job Mr. Trump is doing as president.",
      "We gave people a list of things the government funds. None of them registered a majority wanting cuts, except foreign aid.",
      "While many Americans think cutting government spending in principle should be a high priority, most do not want cuts to federal spending on Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, education, defense, or border enforcement. This is also true among Republicans.",
      "Congress and the president",
      "There's still a general view that the president's party in Congress, the Republicans, should push back on the president when they disagree. This includes most of the nation's rank-and-file Republicans who say so.",
      "MAGA Republicans, though, are more likely than Republicans as a whole to say congressional Republicans should do what Mr. Trump wants.",
      "Most Democrats would look for their congressional delegation to oppose Mr. Trump as much as possible.",
      "Americans' views on key issues",
      "Reviewing the tariff issue in the news: Tariffs on countries like Mexico and Canada aren't popular with most Americans (there's more support for tariffs on China), according to polling we did in February, prior to the implementation of the tariffs. One reason: nearly three in four thought new tariffs on imported goods generally would lead to price increases.",
      "This is important because Americans for years have told us that prices are a top reason they don't think the economy is good and told us they don't feel their incomes are keeping up with inflation.",
      "Taxes. Many want to hear the president talk about cutting taxes, and there is majority support for Congress to extend the 2017 tax cuts, even among more than a third of Democrats.",
      "Deportation policy. During the 2024 campaign most voters \u2014 and overwhelmingly, Trump voters \u2014 supported the idea of his new mass deportation program. Today, a majority of Americans approve of the Trump administration's current deportation policy.",
      "Russia-Ukraine. Prior to the Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the pause in U.S. aid to Ukraine, the country continued to divide along partisan lines over military aid to Ukraine.",
      "This analysis is based on CBS News/YouGov surveys conducted with nationally representative samples of U.S. adults. Each sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 18:23:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Starliner commander Barry Wilmore offered an even-handed response to questions about the intrusion of politics into his ISS mission.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"",
      "Wilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.",
      "\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station\u00a0on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.",
      "The Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.",
      "In mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",
      "\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"",
      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",
      "Given that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"",
      "If all goes well, Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov will blast off and head for the space station on March 12.",

      "The tariffs went into effect at 12:01 a.m., hours before President Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress of his second term.",
      "The U.S. also imposed 10% tariffs on imports from China on top of those already in place, bringing them to 20%.",
      "The tariffs come as more U.S. households are showing signs of economic strain, with retailers such as Target and Walmart recently warning that inflation-weary consumers are cutting back on spending. Mr. Trump's tariffs could push up prices on everything from avocados imported from Mexico to gasoline prices, potentially undermining the president's pledge to eradicate inflation.",

He had said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances and Florida orange juice.",

Sheinbaum said she will announce the products Mexico will target on Sunday in a public event in Mexico City's central plaza, perhaps indicating Mexico still hopes to de-escalate the trade war set off by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Did Canada have tariffs on U.S. products before?",
      "Canada had imposed some limited tariffs on U.S. products before 2025, and vice versa. Under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement, which was signed by President Trump in 2020, the countries had negotiated a complex set of rules aimed at promoting trade.",
      "One of the biggest changes in the USMCA pact was providing American farmers greater access to Canada's dairy markets. That included a plan\u00a0eliminating existing Canadian-imposed tariffs on some U.S. dairy products over a number of years, including whey and margarine.",
      "The U.S. has also previously imposed tariffs on some Canadian products, including duties placed by the first Trump administration on imported softwood lumber. Under the Biden administration, the tariffs on Canadian lumber rose from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",

      "\"It's a very powerful weapon that politicians haven't used because they were either dishonest, stupid, or paid off in some other form,\" he said at the White House Monday after announcing a $100 billion investment by a Taiwanese semiconductor company. \"And now we're using them.\"",
      "The tariffs are in response to what Mr. Trump views as Mexico and Canada's irresponsible handling of the southern and northern borders, including\u00a0fentanyl entering the United States.

      "Counselor to the president Alina Habba on Tuesday said veterans who were let go from their federal jobs \"perhaps\" are \"not fit to have a job at this moment or are not willing to come to work.\"",
      "Habba, who served as President Trump's personal attorney during his court cases and now works as a top adviser in the White House, made the comments during an exchange with reporters on the White House lawn Tuesday morning.",
      "A reporter pointed out that some Democrats are bringing ousted federal workers to the president's joint address to Congress Tuesday night, including veterans who were let go from their jobs. The reporter asked if Mr. Trump is considering what the administration can do to help those veterans salvage their lives.",
      "\"Well, as you know, we care about veterans tremendously,\" Habba responded. \"I mean, that's something the president has always cared about. Anybody in blue, anybody that serves this country. But at the same time, we have taxpayer dollars, we have a fiscal responsibility to use taxpayer dollars to pay people that actually work.\"",
      "\"That doesn't mean that we forget our veterans, by any means,\" Habba continued. \"We are going to care for them in the right way.

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 17:32:01 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court will consider a dispute over the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's license allowing thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste to be stored in West Texas.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court will convene Wednesday to weigh in on a decades-long dispute over what to do with thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste, specifically a plan to store it above one of the world's most productive oil fields, the Permian Basin in Texas.",
      "The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the company Interim Storage Partners are facing off against the state of Texas and Fasken Land and Minerals Ltd., which owns land in the Permian Basin, in the fight over what to do with the spent fuel generated at nuclear reactor sites. The waste can remain radioactive and pose health risks for thousands of years, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "How to address the problem of nuclear waste has been complicated by politics since the advent of nuclear power last century. In 1982, Congress\u00a0 enacted a federal law that required the government to establish a permanent facility to house spent fuel, later determined to be Yucca Mountain in Nevada. But the site has yet to be established amid pushback from the state, and funding from Congress dried up years ago. The project was halted during the Obama administration.",
      "The issue of where to store the growing amount of spent fuel remains. Roughly 91,000 metric tons of nuclear waste from commercial power plants are currently in private storage, both at or away from nuclear reactor sites, according to the U.S. government. And with nearly 20% of the nation's electricity supplied by nuclear energy, plants are generating an additional 2,000 metric tons of spent fuel each year, the Energy Department estimates.",
      "The Supreme Court case",
      "The legal battle before the justices Wednesday involves a license the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued in September 2021 to a company called Interim Storage Partners allowing it to house 5,000 metric tons \u2014 and up to 40,000 metric tons \u2014 of spent fuel in dry-cask, above-ground storage for up to 40 years.",
      "The facility would be constructed in Andrews County, Texas, which is west of Dallas and less than a mile from the state's border with New Mexico. There is already a disposal site in the county for low-level radioactive waste.",
      "Before the commission granted the license, the state submitted comments opposing the site and warning it was dangerous to store nuclear waste anywhere besides a deep geological repository like Yucca Mountain. Texas officials cautioned against housing the spent fuel on a \"concrete pad\" above the state's Permian Basin, where 250,000 active oil and gas wells capture 40% of the country's oil reserves.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality did not seek to intervene in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's proceedings. But several groups did try to object, including Fasken Land and Minerals. Their request, however, was denied by the commission.",
      "Still, the state and land owners asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to review the license to Interim Storage Partners. Two other federal appeals courts considered cases relating to the company's license, but only the 5th Circuit allowed the dispute to move forward.",
      "The 5th Circuit first found that Texas and the landowners could seek review of a final order from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding the license because it acted beyond its authority. The court also ruled that provisions of the 1954 Atomic Energy Act do not support licenses like the one issued to Interim Storage Partners, which allows for the offsite storage of spent fuel. Instead, the 5th Circuit also said a 1982 law intends for nuclear waste to be stored at the site of nuclear reactors or in a federal facility until there is a permanent place for it.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed to take up the case in October and will consider two issues. The first is whether Texas and the landowners could challenge the commission's decision to issue the license to Interim Storage Partners. The second is whether federal law allows the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license private companies to temporarily house spent fuel away from nuclear-reactor sites.",
      "In filings with the high court, lawyers for the government argued that Texas didn't become a party to the commission's licensing adjudication simply by submitting comments during proceedings. They also said that Fasken Land and Minerals' unsuccessful attempt to intervene didn't make it a party for the purposes of challenging the commission's decision to grant the license.",
      "If the Supreme Court were to accept the 5th Circuit's finding that Texas and Fasken could seek review of the licensing decision, it would encourage \"litigants to skip the administrative proceeding and then ambush the agency by calling its authority into question once that proceeding is over,\" the Justice Department wrote.",
      "As to the second question, on whether the commission could grant licenses for temporary, offsite storage, the Justice Department argued that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has exercised that authority for decades.",
      "In 1971, for example, the commission's predecessor issued a license to General Electric Company to store nuclear waste at a standalone facility. In 1989, its Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Board recognized when licensing a nuclear power plant that spent fuel could be stored in offsite facilities owned by private entities, government lawyers argued.",
      "\"Storage of spent nuclear fuel lies at the heart of the commission's expertise and congressionally assigned role, and the commission has clear power to issue licenses for temporary storage of spent fuel at the site of a nuclear reactor,\" they wrote.",
      "According to the Congressional Research Service, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued three licenses for the temporary storage of spent fuel at privately owned facilities away from reactors: The first, issued in 2006 for a project in Utah, was terminated by the license-holder, Private Fuel Storage; the second is to Interim Storage Partners; and the third, granted to Holtec International for the facility in Lea County, New Mexico, is tied up in court proceedings.",
      "But officials for the state of Texas said that Yucca Mountain is the government's plan for dealing with the thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste that continue to pile up, and they accused the federal government of engaging in a \"policy workaround\" by licensing private entities to store nuclear waste at facilities away from reactors.",
      "\"Nothing about this license is lawful,\" they wrote in Supreme Court filings. \"Congress has already legislated a solution to the nation's nuclear-waste problem: permanent storage in Yucca Mountain. No statute mentions, let alone authorizes, private interim offsite storage.\"",
      "The state invoked what is called the major questions doctrine, which says that Congress must give clear authorization for a federal agency to decide an issue of major political or economic significance.",
      "Congress, Texas officials wrote, has determined that where to store spent nuclear fuel is a major problem of public concern, and the solution is Yucca Mountain. Additionally, Congress mandated that the waste should be stored temporarily at either the reactor site or a facility that is operated by the federal government, the state argued.",
      "\"Congress answered that 'major' question, both as to interim offsite storage and permanent disposal,\" lawyers for Texas wrote. \"Congress's clear answer was Yucca Mountain or interim federal facilities \u2014 not a private facility in Texas.\"",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June.",

      "Corry's departure came just days after Kennedy faced criticism for how he handled a question about the growing measles outbreak in Texas at a White House Cabinet meeting, calling it \"not unusual\" and misstating the number of deaths reported in the state.",
      "A former HHS official and a person familiar with Corry's thinking said that he had voiced disappointment with how Kennedy handled the question. It was a missed opportunity, making headlines for appearing indifferent to the deadly outbreak.",
      "But Corry's frustrations extended beyond that, as his office triaged a deluge of inquiries on agency actions ranging from canceled vaccines meetings to stalled research funding.",
      "Unlike previous officials in the role, who usually closely work with the secretary, Corry had been cut off from Kennedy, one former HHS official said. Federal officials said they were unsure if Corry had the trust of Kennedy or his inner circle, undermining his authority.",

The two units hold 80% of the Hutchison Ports group that operates 43 ports in 23 countries, including two of the four major ports that exist along the Panama Canal.

      "The revised memo from Charles Ezell, the acting director of OPM, comes after a federal judge ruled last week that the Trump administration's mass firings of probationary workers, who generally have been in their jobs for less than one year, were likely illegal.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup found that \"OPM did not have the authority to direct the firing of employees, probationary or otherwise, in any other federal agency.\"",
      "The latest guidance from OPM revises a Jan. 20 memo from Ezell that required agencies to identify all employees still in their probationary periods and send a report to the agency listing all those workers. The memo instructed department heads to \"promptly determine whether those employees should be retained at the agency.\"",
      "But the revised memo includes a new paragraph that states that \"by this memorandum, OPM is not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees. Agencies have ultimate decision-making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions.\"",

      "After Ezell directed agency heads to identify probationary employees, Mr. Trump issued an executive order that instructed agency heads to \"promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "The mass firings were a drastic move by Mr. Trump in his effort to cut the size of the federal government. The president established the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to lead the efforts to shrink the government, and workers for the task force has fanned out across federal agencies. OPM also gave federal workers the option to participate in a deferred resignation program, which gave them the option to resign their positions but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The White House said roughly 75,000 employees accepted the offer to leave their government jobs, far fewer than the 200,000 it expected to take the so-called buyout.",
      "The Trump administration has also targeted specific agencies, namely the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the U.S. Agency for International Development, in its cost-cutting efforts. Mr. Trump's overhaul of the agencies, though, is being challenged in federal court."

    "story": [
      "A divided Supreme Court on Tuesday made it harder for environmental regulators to limit water pollution, ruling for San Francisco in a case about the discharge of raw sewage that sometimes occurs during heavy rains.",
      "By a 5-4 vote, the court's conservative majority ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped its authority under the Clean Water Act with water pollution permits that contain vague requirements for maintaining water quality.",
      "The decision is the latest in which conservative justices have reined in pollution control efforts.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the court that the EPA can set specific limits that tell cities and counties what can be discharged. But the agency lacks the authority \"to include 'end-result' provisions,\" Alito wrote, that make cities and counties responsible for maintaining the quality of the water, the Pacific Ocean in this case, into which wastewater is discharged.",
      "\"When a permit contains such requirements, a permittee that punctiliously follows every specific requirement in its permit may nevertheless face crushing penalties if the quality of the water in its receiving waters falls below the applicable standards,\" he wrote.",
      "One conservative justice, Amy Coney Barrett, joined the court's three liberals in dissent. Limits on discharges sometimes still don't insure water quality standards are met, Barrett wrote.",
      "\"The concern that the technology-based effluent limitations may fall short is on display in this case,\" Barrett wrote, adding that \"discharges from components of San Francisco's sewer system have allegedly led to serious breaches of the water quality standards, such as 'discoloration, scum, and floating material, including toilet paper, in Mission Creek.'\"",
      "The case produced an unusual alliance of the liberal northern California city, energy companies and business groups.",
      "The EPA has issued thousands of the permits, known as narrative permits, over several decades, former acting general counsel Kevin Minoli said.",
      "The narrative permits have operated almost as a backstop in case permits that quantify what can be discharged still result in unacceptable water quality, Minoli said.",
      "With the new restrictions imposed by the court, \"the question is what comes in place of those limits,\" Minoli said.",
      "Alito downplayed the impact of the decision, writing that the agency has \"the tools needed\" to insure water quality standards are met.",
      "In response to the decision, the Sierra Club, a grassroots environmental organization headquartered in Oakland, California, released a statement.",
      "The decision \"ignores the basic reality of how water bodies and water pollution works, and could stymie the ability of the EPA to implement the Clean Water Act, a bedrock environmental law that has kept water safe for the last 50 years,\" Sanjay Narayan, chief appellate counsel at the Sierra Club's environmental law program, said.",
      "\"Because the EPA is not allowed to include health-based standards when regulating water pollution, it'll need to know everything about what might be discharged before a clean-water permit can be issued \u2014 making the permitting process delayed and incredibly expensive,\" Narayan said. \"The result is likely to be a new system where the public is regularly subjected to unsafe water quality.\"",
      "San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu and San Francisco Public Utilities Commission General Manager Dennis Herrera said in a statement that the decision \"makes clear that permitholders like San Francisco are responsible for what they discharge, and the EPA has the tools at its disposal to ensure water quality. But it's not lawful to punish permitholders for things outside of their control, such as the end-result water quality of a shared body of water, where many other factors affect water quality.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's imposition of blanket 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico drew swift vows of retaliation from the United States' immediate neighbors on Tuesday. China, which was hit with a second 10% tariff on U.S. exports since Mr. Trump took office, bringing the total levy to 20%, immediately announced its own reciprocal measures \u2014 deliberately targeting America's agricultural sector.",
      "Below is a look at the measures being imposed or planned by Canada, China and Mexico, and the rhetoric coming from officials in those countries as Mr. Trump ramps up his trade war against one of America's biggest adversaries, and its two closest neighbors.",
      "Canada announces reciprocal tariffs; Trudeau calls Trump's move \"a very dumb thing to do\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced immediate retaliation to the new U.S. tariffs in a statement late Monday evening. He said Canada would impose a $30 billion counter-tariff on goods imported from the U.S. immediately, escalating to $155 billion worth of American products within the next 21 days. Trudeau has said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances, along with Florida orange juice, with its measures.",
      "\"Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\" Trudeau said, adding that he was already discussing with Canada's provincial leaders various non-tariff measures that could be imposed if the Trump administration doesn't lift its tariffs.",
      "\"Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term,\" Trudeau said.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Trudeau lashed out at President Trump's decision.",
      "\"We should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity for North Americans in a very uncertain and challenging world,\" he said. \"Now, it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\"",
      "\"Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\" said Trudeau. \"We two friends fighting is exactly what our opponents around the world want to see.\"",
      "Trudeau also said Canada will challenge the U.S. action by filing dispute resolution claims at the World Trade Organization and through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal that replaced NAFTA.",
      "Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media threatening to raise tariffs further: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"",
      "Some of Canada's governors have pushed for a tougher response.",
      "\"If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I'm encouraging every other province to do the same; Quebec, Manitoba, BC [British Columbia], we all have to act in unison,\" Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said at an industrial convention on Monday. \"They rely on our energy. They need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard. We're going to come back twice as hard.\"",
      "Ford said retaliatory measures that Canada could consider going forward included halting shipments of critical minerals such as uranium, potash and nickel, in addition to cutting the energy supply, which he said could leave 1.5 million people without power in New York, Michigan and Minnesota, potentially causing significant disruptions to the U.S. economy.",
      "He said he had also asked officials in his province to end billions of dollars in contracts with the U.S. and to stop the import of American alcohol to Ontario.",
      "\"It's going to be an absolute disaster for both countries,\" he acknowledged in a separate interview with NBC News. \"I don't want to respond, but I will respond like they have never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has framed his tariffs on Canada as a response to what he says is the country's failure to stem the flow of both undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across the northern U.S. border \u2014 though very little of the drug enters that way, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
      "In a message posted to his own Truth social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump also took issue with Canadian banking regulations, saying the country \"doesn't allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market,\" but providing no further context.",
      "\"I heard he talked about banking again this morning,\" Trudeau said during his Tuesday news conference, \"which doesn't make any sense, because American banks \u2014 of 16 American banks currently active in Canada \u2014 holding about $113 billion worth of assets in this country. So the American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an example of not really being able to see what it is that he [Trump] wants, because even the excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false. So we actually have to fall back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Canada should become a U.S. \"51st state.\"",
      "Trudeau defended Canada's actions on border control and the illegal flow of fentanyl on Monday, saying that between December 2024 and January 2025, seizures of the drug from Canada by U.S. authorities dropped 97%, to just 0.03 pounds. That drop came, he said, after Canada implemented a $1.3 billion plan to deploy more helicopters and more boots on the ground, and to appoint a \"Fentanyl Czar.\"",
      "China announces tariffs, warns against \"maximum pressure\" tactic",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused China of giving its manufacturers and other businesses an unfair advantage in trade with the U.S. and vowed to balance the extremely lopsided flow of goods. But he has framed his latest round of tariffs on the country as punishment for what he claims is a Chinese refusal to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it to the U.S.",
      "China's government has refused to back down in the face of the escalating trade war with the Trump administration, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that the \"Chinese people cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, and bullying tactics are not the right way to deal with China.\"",
      "\"Attempting to exert maximum pressure on China is targeting the wrong opponent and is a misreading of the situation. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the fentanyl issue, it should engage in consultation with China built on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" he said, according to China's official media.",
      "\"If the U.S. has other intentions and is committed to waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will respond in kind,\" Lin said, adding a call for the White House \"to abandon its bullying tactics and return to the necessary track of dialogue and cooperation at an early date.\"",
      "China retaliated immediately, announcing its own 10-15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products and foods, from wheat, corn and cotton to soybeans, beef, chicken and dairy. Beijing also placed 25 U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions, citing what it said were national security concerns.",
      "Veteran Chinese analyst Victor Gao told CBS News that while China's counter-tariffs will impact U.S. farmers \u2014 perceived by Beijing to be among Mr. Trump's support base \u2014 he believes Beijing is being measured in its response and that it doesn't want to inflame the situation.",
      "Gao, who has worked with the country's leadership and is now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said China is better prepared for a trade war with the U.S. than it was during Mr. Trump's first term, as it has diversified into other, non-U.S. markets.",
      "He said if President Xi Jinping really wanted to step up Beijing's retaliation, it could halt imports of U.S. gas and oil, but he warned against the implications for both nations if the trade war continues to escalate, saying at best, it would end in a \"bloody tie.\"",
      "But Gao said he believed talks were still going on behind the scenes between U.S and Chinese officials, and that both countries likely have little interest in a deteriorating, tit-for-tat tariffs battle.",
      "Mexican president vows retaliation to \"inconceivable\" tariffs",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country would respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with its own retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures, but held off announcing exactly what those would be, promising a statement on Sunday in Mexico City's main square. She said she was scheduled to have a call with Mr. Trump this week, probably on Thursday.",
      "She said the reciprocal measures Mexico would take were \"not in any way or with the purpose of starting an economic or commercial confrontation that unfortunately and regrettably is the opposite of what we must be doing.\"",
      "\"It's inconceivable that they don't think about the damage this is going to cause to United States citizens and businesses with the increase in prices for things produced in our country,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Also, the damage it will cause by stopping job creation in both countries. No one wins with this decision.\"",
      "Sheinbaum stressed how Mexico had been working alongside the U.S. to respond to requests by Mr. Trump to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to reinforce the U.S.-Mexico border to curb migration.",
      "\"We collaborate to avoid illegal drug trafficking to the United States, but as we have said on multiple occasions, that country's government must take responsibility, too, for the crisis of opioid consumption that has caused so many deaths in the United States,\" the Mexican leader said.",
      "\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" added Sheinbaum.",
      "The Mexican peso slumped against the U.S. dollar as Sheinbaum delivered her remarks on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg.",

      "McMahon will face the competing tasks of winding down the Education Department while also escalating efforts to achieve Mr. Trump's agenda. Already the president has signed sweeping orders to rid America's schools of diversity programs and accommodations for transgender students while also calling for expanded school choice programs.",
      "At the same time, Mr. Trump has promised to shut down the department and said he wants McMahon \"to put herself out of a job.\"",
      "The Senate voted 51-45 to confirm McMahon. The vote was along party lines, with all Republicans present voting for her and all Democrats against, although there were a few senators not voting \u2014 Republican Sens. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia as well as Democratic Sens. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Peter Welch of Vermont.",
      "Shortly after being confirmed on Monday night, McMahon sent a letter to the Department of Education with the subject line \"Our Department's Final Mission.\"",
      "\"The reality of our education system is stark, and the American people have elected President Trump to make significant changes in Washington,\" McMahon wrote. \"Our job is to respect the will of the American people and the President they elected, who has tasked us with accomplishing the elimination of bureaucratic bloat here at the Department of Education \u2014 a momentous final mission \u2014 quickly and responsibly.\"",
      "McMahon concluded the letter saying \"this is our opportunity to perform one final, unforgettable public service to future generations of students. I hope you will join me in ensuring that when our final mission is complete; we will be able to say that we left American education freer, stronger, and with more hope for the future.\"",
      "A billionaire and former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, McMahon, 76, is an unconventional pick for the role. She spent a year on Connecticut's state board of education and is a longtime trustee at Sacred Heart University but otherwise has little traditional education leadership.",
      "McMahon's supporters see her as a skilled executive who will reform a department that Republicans say has failed to improve American education. Opponents say she's unqualified and fear her budget cuts will be felt by students nationwide.",
      "\"Americans believe in public education,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said before the confirmation vote. \"They don't want to see the Department of Education abolished. If the Trump administration follows through on cuts to education, schools will lose billions in funding.\"",
      "At her confirmation hearing, McMahon distanced herself from Mr. Trump's blistering rhetoric. She said the goal is to make the Education Department \"operate more efficiently,\" not to defund programs.",
      "She acknowledged that only Congress has the power to close the department, and she pledged to preserve Title I money for low-income schools, Pell grants for low-income college students, and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Yet she suggested some operations could move to other departments, saying Health and Human Services might be better suited to enforce disability rights laws.",
      "Weeks before McMahon's confirmation hearing, the White House was considering an executive order that would direct the education secretary to cut the agency as much as legally possible while asking Congress to shut it down completely. Some of McMahon's allies pressed the White House to hold the order until after her confirmation to avoid potential backlash.",
      "Created by Congress in 1979, the Education Department's primary role is to disburse money to the nation's schools and colleges. It sends billions of dollars a year to K-12 schools and oversees a $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.",
      "Mr. Trump argues the department has been overtaken by liberals who press their ideology on America's schools.",
      "Schools and colleges have been navigating a demand to eliminate diversity programs or risk having their federal funding pulled. The Trump administration gave them a Feb. 28 deadline to comply. The Education Department addressed questions about its guidance in a document released Saturday, saying in part that changing program names that reference \"diversity\" or \"equity\" alone is not enough if they treat students differently by race.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has paused U.S. military aid to Ukraine, the White House confirmed Monday. It's the latest fallout days after a contentious meeting between President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House erupted into an open dispute in front of TV cameras.",
      "\"The president has been clear that he is focused on peace,\" a White House official told CBS News. \"We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.\"",
      "The U.S. has been a key supplier of weapons for Ukraine as it continues to fend off Russian troops\u00a0three years after Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion three years ago. But Mr. Trump's return to office has brought a marked shift in U.S. policy toward the conflict, with the president blaming Ukraine for the war Russia started.",
      "Friday's meeting, which was meant to precede the signing of an economic and minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, devolved into a confrontation.",
      "Mr. Trump told Zelenskyy to reach a ceasefire agreement with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" after he challenged the vice president's assertion that the war had dragged on because of a lack of diplomacy from Ukraine and the Biden administration. The meeting abruptly ended without signing the rare earth minerals deal, and several White House officials told CBS News that the future of military aid for Ukraine was in doubt.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office in January, $3.85 billion has been available in drawdown authority for weaponry that can be pulled from existing U.S. stockpiles and sent to Ukraine, U.S. officials previously told CBS News. But the Trump administration has not packaged any of that aid for a single shipment since Jan. 21, a diplomatic source told CBS News Monday. Still, there have been shipments of weapons sent to Ukraine since Jan. 20 that were promised by the Biden administration in earlier drawdowns, according to defense officials.",
      "The $3.85 billion is spending authority, not congressionally appropriated funds, which means it's up to the White House to determine whether to release the aid. It is also not considered \"real money,\" meaning it cannot be spent elsewhere.",
      "Separately, the State Department also has about $1.5 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine that is under a policy review by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. So far, the Trump State Department has only given Egypt and Israel waivers for FMF assistance.",
      "After Friday's meeting, Zelenskyy traveled to London for a summit with European and Canadian leaders, where he stressed the importance of Western security guarantees as part of any agreement that would bring the war to an end. He said in Ukrainian that peace with Russia was \"still very, very far away,\" but he thought that Ukraine-U.S. relations would hold.",
      "Mr. Trump later posted a link to an Associated Press story covering Zelenskyy's comments and wrote, \"This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\"",
      "\"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. - Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Mr. Trump's hardened stance on Ukraine has rankled some GOP lawmakers.",
      "Republican Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, said Monday, \"I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It's the Ukrainians who are shedding blood. It is Putin who launched an unprovoked and unjustified attack on a free, democratic and sovereign country. And I am not backing off my support for Ukraine.\"",
      "Before the Trump administration's announcement Monday, Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota who serves on the Armed Services Committee, said of Ukraine, \"I'll simply say that we've got to get back on track again.\"",
      "\"It's critical that we get a minerals agreement put together and that we work on getting a security agreement with Ukraine,\" Rounds told reporters at the Capitol. \"They have been attacked. Russia is in the wrong, but we want to find a pathway to peace, and that means somebody has got to be the intermediary. I don't know if the president wants to be that. We need to give him the opportunity, but Russia is the aggressor, and we have to recognize that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said last month that he had a \"lengthy and highly productive phone call\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has also directed Rubio and other members of his national security team to \"immediately\" begin negotiations aimed at ending Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "But Rubio said in February there was \"a long ways to go\" before peace talks could begin.",
      "Delegations led by Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, shortly after those comments, without Ukrainian officials present. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said after the meeting that Rubio and Lavrov had agreed to appoint \"high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible in a way that is enduring, sustainable, and acceptable to all sides.\"",

    "story": [
      "Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ed Martin uses the nickname \"The Eagle\" on the job. He has been posting on social media about crime in Washington, D.C., using the hashtag #MarchBadness. Martin, whose nomination for the permanent post of U.S. attorney for D.C. is being considered by the Senate, has been attracting attention with his social media posts, as well as some of his actions in his capacity as acting U.S. attorney.",
      "In one on Saturday, Martin wrote, \"Hey, thugs with guns, you hear that? Yup, we comin.'\"",
      "He was likely referring to a memo circulated Monday to his staff, in which Martin said over a dozen agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would be dispatched to help with an \"amazing opportunity\" to help initiatives to reduce violent crime in the nation's capital.",
      "Martin's new initiative seeks more federal district court prosecutions of Washington, D.C., gun crimes. His memo, obtained by CBS News, said his office is \"kicking off the Make DC Safe Again initiative,\" which echoes the Make America Great Again slogan invoked by Trump.",
      "\"We are following the direction of President Trump and (Attorney) General Bondi in the recent executive orders and memoranda. We will flood the federal district court with cases\u2014to make our city safe,\" the memo said. This has been attempted before. In February 2019, a Trump-appointed federal prosecutor announced a project to seek higher-level charges for gun cases in the District of Columbia.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for D.C. and the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives D.C. field office declined requests for comment.",
      "While he waits for his confirmation vote, Martin has continued to court controversy with provocative social posts.",
      "In a social media post Saturday, Martin wrote that his predecessor was a \"Biden prosecutor\" who \"upped political prosecutions, he steered resources to a now-debunked legal theory that targeted American citizens, and gun prosecutions went down. Literally. Let me be clear: he used our $ to chase political hoaxes while the people of DC were terrorized by thugs with guns.\"",
      "The U.S. attorney for the D.C. has a unique ability to handle federal crimes in the nation's capital, including those involving federal officials and facilities. As U.S. attorney for D.C., Martin days ago demoted a group of top senior prosecutors in the office to entry level positions, including those who helped with the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection prosecutions. Now, at least some are being assigned to handle misdemeanor cases",
      "His demotions have caused internal dissension, according to multiple sources who spoke with CBS News.",
      "Martin has filed a series of court motions to help promptly close out many of the pending Capitol riot prosecutions. Before his appointment, Martin served as a defense attorney for Capitol riot defendants and was an active member of the \"Stop the Steal\" movement, which promoted baseless claims of election fraud in 2020.",
      "Last month, Martin instructed his staff to respond to surveys, seeking information about \"five things\" they'd accomplished that week, from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Martin also instructed staff to respond to the second survey that was emailed over the weekend.",
      "Martin is also under new scrutiny by congressional Democrats after writing a social media post last month in which he referred to U.S. attorneys as \"Trump's lawyers,\" who are \"vigilant in standing against entities like the [Associated Press] that refuse to put America first.\"",
      "But U.S. attorneys are not the president's lawyers. Their mission is to ensure that federal laws are enforced. In their districts, they're also involved in civil litigations where the U.S. is a party.",
      "Martin also posted a note to the law firm Covington & Burling and former special counsel Jack Smith to \"save your receipts\" and promised, \"We'll be in touch soon.\" The message included a link to a story noting the firm was defending Smith pro bono. Smith indicted President Trump in two separate cases.",
      "House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer praised Martin in a statement, saying, \"By nominating Ed Martin to be the next U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, President Donald Trump wasted no time delivering on his promise to restore law and order in our capital city.\"",
      "But Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat who is the ranking member on the committee, has launched an investigation into Martin's initiatives and actions as acting U.S. attorney. He wrote a letter to Martin questioning his public statements which, he said, \"are directed exclusively at opponents of and express support for the Trump Administration, explicitly criticize the Biden Administration, publicize pending investigative activity by your office, and make assertions of fact for which there exists no evidence.\"",
      "Martin's statements \"raise serious concerns that your new initiative is a pretext for misusing your office for political ends, threatening and intimidating critics of the Administration, and chilling constitutionally protected speech,\" Connolly added.",
      "A spokesperson for Martin declined to comment.",
      "The House Oversight Committee Democrats' inquiry ordered Martin to submit responses by March 11 about how the office would seek to protect the safety of Capitol police officers and federal prosecutors who were part of the Jan. 6 prosecutions. The inquiry also asks Martin to \"confirm your belief that the Department of Justice represents the United States of America and its citizens, and not the personal and individual political or business interests of the President.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:57:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A spike in cryptocurrency prices Monday morning after President Donald Trump's surprise Sunday announcement quickly fizzled by Monday afternoon.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin and ethereum, along with lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",
      "The announcement helped crypto prices rebound after recent sell-offs, but only for a few hours. After rising to $90,000 Monday morning, bitcoin fell to roughly $87,000, or 7.3%, by Monday afternoon. Ethereum tumbled 14.6% to $2,153. Massive price spikes in XRP, solana and cardano also fizzled, dropping 12.1%, 13% and 12.3%, respectively.",
      "Nic Puckrin, financial analyst, investor and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note that the cause of the temporary price boost was most likely a \"combination of 'hopium' with a classic short squeeze,\" adding that more concrete information on the crypto reserve plan is needed to reassure investors of its worth.",
      "\"While the crypto reserve announcement was a bullish catalyst for crypto prices in the short term, its long-term impact remains questionable. For one thing, no actual details have been disclosed yet,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That said, the creation of digital currency reserve is a milestone moment for bitcoin and blockchain technology.",
      "\"The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government's engagement with the crypto industry,\" said Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at 21Shares, in an analyst note. \"This initiative not only reinforces Bitcoin's role as a maturing store of value but also highlights the importance of blockchain networks like ethereum, solana, XRP and cardano in financial infrastructure, payments and decentralized finance.\"",
      "What is a crypto strategic reserve?",
      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",
      "The crash of meme coins linked to First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei, along with a massive hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange that the FBI has said was undertaken by North Korea, have also dimmed enthusiasm for crypto.",

    "summary": "Churchill, Manitoba, a small village on the Hudson Bay, is known as the polar bear capital of the world.",
    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

    "story": [
      "Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts\u00a0\u2014 genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.",
      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Just last year, the company said they made a breakthrough in efforts to bring back the extinct Tasmanian tiger.",
      "Colossal has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \"engineer them into living animals,\" said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "In a 2023 interview, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti told Lamm, \"I hear mammoth and dodo in the same sentence and, you know, it's science fiction to me.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it is,\" said Lamm, \"until it's not.\"",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\"You're not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you're not bringing back the ancient past,\" said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\" said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \"make it a lot more efficient and easier,\" said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance - a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Independent experts skeptical of \"de-extinction\"",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \"a lot of processes and red tape\" before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "\"We are in the world of synthetic biology. These tools exist. It's hard to put the genie back in the bottle. We need to be really thoughtful about the intended and unintended consequences of our actions,\" Lamm told CBS News Boston in 2022.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \"de-extinction.\"",
      "\"You might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it's not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It's changing an Asian elephant,\" said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal's technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",
      "\"It's part of how we monetize our business,\" said Lamm.",
      "Ben Mezrich, who authored the book, \"Woolly: The True Story of the Quest to Revive One of History's Most Iconic Extinct Creatures,\" told CBS News in 2017 that reviving woolly mammoths could potentially facilitate medical breakthroughs.",
      "\"I mean, elephants don't get cancer, which is very strange,\" he told CBS News. \"Elephants have thousands and thousands of more cells than us. And why they don't get cancer is in their genes. If we can figure that out, we can use this genetic engineering to solve cancer.\"",

      "The image released Monday shows the XB-1 aircraft, which Boom Supersonic said is the \"first civil supersonic jet made in America,\" during its second supersonic flight on Feb. 10. The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",

    "summary": "Starliner commander Barry Wilmore offered an even-handed response to questions about the intrusion of politics into his ISS mission.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"",
      "Wilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.",
      "\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station\u00a0on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.",
      "The Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.",
      "In mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",
      "\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"",
      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",
      "Given that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"",
      "If all goes well, Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov will blast off and head for the space station on March 12.",

      "Firefly Aerospace's \"Blue Ghost\" lander dropped out of lunar orbit and swooped to a rocket-powered touchdown early Sunday, pulling off the first fully successful moon landing by a commercially-built and operated robotic spacecraft.",
      "Flying above the far side of the moon in a circular 62-mile-high orbit, the squat lander fired its main engine at 2:31 a.m. EST, kicking off a white-knuckle 63-minute descent to the landing site in Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crises \u2014 in the northeast quadrant of the moon as viewed from Earth.",
      "The 6.6-foot-tall lander coasted for the next 52 minutes before using its main engine and eight smaller reaction control system, or RCS, thrusters to reduce its velocity from about 3,800 mph to just 90 mph as it moved into position above the landing site.",
      "After autonomously analyzing the terrain below for boulders, slopes, and other hazards, Blue Ghost descended using the power of its eight reaction control system jets. The jets pulsed as needed to control velocity and orientation before slowing the craft to just 2.2 mph for the last 30 feet or so of the descent.",
      "Firefly Aerospace employees and family members, known collectively as \"Fireflies,\" watched telemetry stream in on a large monitor near the company's Austin, Texas, headquarters and mission control center, no doubt on the edges of their seats as the 11.5-foot-wide spacecraft neared the surface.",
      "\"Eleven meters up,\" a flight controller said on the Firefly mission control audio loop. A moment later, the thrusters shut down and surface contact sensors on Blue Ghost's shock-absorbing landing legs indicated they were on the lunar surface.",
      "\"Engine shutdown confirmed,\" a flight controller verified.",
      "\"Power is nominal, vehicle is charging (with its solar cells),\" someone else chimed in.",
      "\"IMU (inertial measurement unit) reports lunar gravity, and it is stable,\" another controller reported, prompting the start of applause from onlookers.",
      "Will Coogan, the chief engineer, then came on the line with the official results: \"You all stuck the landing! We're on the moon!\"",
      "The assembled Fireflies instantly burst into cheers, hugs and raucous applause. A few minutes later, \"Make Space Great Again\" hats were handed out.",
      "\"Firefly successfully touched down on the moon in an upright, stable condition, becoming the first commercial company to complete a fully successful moon landing,\" said Brigette Oakes, Firefly vice president of engineering.",
      "Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin said in a post on the social media platform X: \"'Contact light, engine stop!' Congratulations FireFly Aerospace for Blue Ghost's Mission 1 successful Moon landing today! It also marks a new milestone in the collaborations between NASA and private Space companies.\"",
      "Launched on Jan. 15, the landing was timed to coincide with the start of a two-week-long lunar day. The solar-powered Blue Ghost will operate 10 NASA-sponsored experiments while sunlight is available and, if all goes well, for a few hours into the lunar night using stored battery power. After that, it will fall silent.",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long-time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CBS News in a pre-launch interview.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "For Ray Allensworth, spacecraft program director at Firefly, the moon will never look the same.",
      "\"We were all dreaming up until now that you look up at the (moon) and you just imagine, like, that's where it's gonna be,\" she said. \"But now, you know it's there, and that's a totally different feeling.

      "Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Uranus could all be visible with clear skies, but not all can be seen by the naked eye, according to Space.com and other sites that track celestial events.",
      "For the best chances, spectators should look at the sky as soon as the sun sets. That's when the planets will make a brief appearance.",
      "Tokyo started seeing the parade first, on Feb. 22, according to Star Walk, a sky-gazing app. New York was expected to have the best view of the event on Feb. 25, Star Walk said. In other parts of the world, the phenomenon will be best visible in early March.",
      "How to watch the planetary parade",
      "Five planets are visible to the naked eye, according to NASA: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.",
      "Mars will appear reddish and high in the sky, near the Gemini constellation, Star Walk said. Jupiter will be a bit lower in the sky, near Taurus. Venus will appear as the brightest planet in the sky, near the Pisces constellation.",
      "Mercury will be in the constellation Aquarius, near the sun and just above the western horizon. Saturn will also be near the sun and low in the horizon, making it harder to spot, Star Walk said.",
      "To see Uranus and Neptune, you'll need a telescope, NASA said. Uranus will appear in the Aries constellation, and Neptune will be in Pisces, Star Walk said.",
      "The display will only be visible for a few minutes after sunset, because the planets near the horizon \u2014 Saturn and Mercury \u2014 will be setting. Once they drop below the horizon, they will no longer be visible, but the other planets will linger in the night sky.",
      "For the best view, head to a location with minimal light pollution and a clear view of the horizon. Clear skies will also be necessary to see all the planets.",
      "How do planetary alignments work?",
      "The planets in the solar system orbit the sun, just as Earth does. Every planet orbits at a different speed and distance.",
      "During these alignments, the planets appear to be lined up from Earth's perspective, creating the visual display, NASA said. In reality, the planets are extremely far from each other.",
      "The planets also move very slowly, causing the multi-day timeline of the planetary parades.",
      "When will the next planetary alignment be?",
      "Lineups of four or five planets occur every few years, according to NASA. In late August 2025, four planets will be visible before sunrise, and in late October 2028, five planets will be visible at once before sunrise. Another five-planet alignment will occur in late February 2034, with the planets visible after sunset.",
      "\"In summary, while they aren't once-in-a-lifetime events, planetary parades afford an uncommon opportunity to look up and appreciate our place in our solar system, with diverse worlds arrayed across the sky before our very eyes,\" NASA says on its website.",
      "Outside of the planetary alignments, it's possible to spot other planets individually. Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are frequently seen in the night sky, according to NASA.",

Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0President Trump will address a joint session of Congress tonight, marking the first time he will speak before both chambers since he returned to office six weeks ago.",
      "Presidents typically address a joint session of Congress early in their tenure to outline a vision or agenda. The first speech before lawmakers is not technically a State of the Union, but rather an Address to a Joint Session of Congress.",
      "As is customary, House Speaker Mike Johnson in January invited Mr. Trump to address Congress and \"share his America First vision for our future.\" In a letter to the president, the speaker wrote that the Trump administration and the Republican majorities in Congress will \"have the chance to make these next four years some of the most consequential in our nation's history.\"",
      "\"America's Golden Age has begun,\" Johnson said in the letter, echoing a line from Mr. Trump's inaugural address, while touting a \"resurgence of patriotism, unity, and hope for the future.\"",
      "What time will Trump's speech start and end?",
      "The president's address is set to begin shortly after 9 p.m. ET. Its running time remains to be seen. During his first term, Mr. Trump's 2017\u00a0joint address to Congress ran about one hour. Over the next three years, his State of the Union addresses averaged 80 minutes, according to the American Presidency Project.",
      "The theme of Mr. Trump's address is \"The Renewal of the American Dream,\" according to a White House official. The president is expected in the speech to highlight what his administration has done so far, its economic policy, border security and foreign policy plans. The president said in a post on Truth Social late Monday that he will \"TELL IT LIKE IT IS!\"",
      "The president's speech will be followed by the official Democratic response, delivered by Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.",
      "How to watch Trump's speech on cable",
      "CBS News will carry the president's address and the Democratic response live in a primetime special beginning at 9 p.m. ET. Find your local CBS station here.",

      "Context to know for Trump's address to Congress",
      "Mr. Trump's address to Congress comes six weeks after he returned to office for a second term. So far, Americans agree that he is making major changes to how the government works, though there's a divide on whether they view the changes as better or worse, according to CBS News polling released Sunday.",
      "The president has pursued a dramatic overhaul of the federal bureaucracy and a cost-cutting effort alongside Elon Musk, who he's tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. DOGE has been working with Cabinet department and agency heads to shrink the government workforce, while halting swaths of government spending. A number of Democrats are bringing former government employees fired as a result of the DOGE cuts as their guests to Tuesday's address to highlight the individuals personally impacted.",
      "The Trump administration in its first six weeks has also worked to bolster border security with a government-wide immigration crackdown, and illegal border crossings were significantly down during Mr. Trump's first month in office. Still, the administration has faced obstacles in its efforts to conduct what it's billed as the largest deportation operation in American history in the U.S. interior. Top Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have been reassigned in recent weeks amid frustrations that the agency has not carried out sufficient arrests and deportations. ICE's detention capacity has also been stretched thin, with detention centers recently filled at levels above 110%.",
      "While Mr. Trump's approach to immigration has received support in recent\u00a0polling, Americans overwhelmingly say he should prioritize inflation and the economy. At the same time, the president has pursued tariffs that have prompted fears of a trade war among businesses and consumers. On Tuesday, 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and higher levies on goods from China took effect, prompting retaliatory actions in response.",
      "Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have been pursuing legislation to support Mr. Trump's agenda, facing headwinds with a narrow majority in the House and differing views on the path forward. Last week, the House adopted a budget resolution that paves the way for implementing the president's agenda on border security, defense and energy priorities, while extending the 2017 tax cuts. But it's not yet clear how the budget blueprint will fare in the Senate, where lawmakers have pursued a different approach.",
      "Mr. Trump's return to the White House has also had serious implications on the world stage even in the first six weeks. Last week, a meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy devolved into a feud with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and Zelenskyy was ultimately asked to leave the White House without signing a critical multibillion-dollar rare earth minerals deal. On Monday, the White House said it was pausing military aid to Ukraine.",
      "The contentious meeting came after Mr. Trump had appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. has provided Ukraine with billions in weapons since the Russian invasion three years ago, and a split with Zelenskyy may have major implications for its ability to defend itself.",

    "story": [
      "Looking ahead to President Trump's address to Congress, here's what's on Americans' minds and what they want to hear from the president, with context from recent CBS News polling.",
      "What do people want to hear about?",
      "Inflation. More think it's important for Mr. Trump to talk about his plans for lowering prices than any other item tested. It's the top issue for both Republicans and Democrats.",
      "Inflation is an issue (along with the economy) that a big majority of Americans think should be a high priority for the president but don't think he is prioritizing it a lot.",
      "Seventy-seven percent of Americans say their incomes are not keeping up with inflation.",
      "Many also want to hear about plans for Medicare and Medicaid, the federal budget and cutting taxes.",
      "Americans are less likely to think it's important to hear the president talk about things like reductions in the federal workforce, what Congress should do, and the events of Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Who plans to watch the speech?",
      "Mainly Republicans. Mr. Trump's address to Congress will likely have a relatively friendly audience consisting primarily of Republicans. Historically, those in the president's own party have been more inclined to watch an address like this or a State of the Union speech.",
      "In keeping with this, Americans who plan to tune in to tonight's speech are more likely to be Republicans than Democrats or independents. Most of those potential watchers who voted in the 2024 presidential election cast their ballot for Mr. Trump.",
      "(During Joe Biden's presidency, the audience who watched his speeches to a joint Congress had more Democrats than Republicans.)",
      "Three in four of those who say they'll watch the speech approve of the overall job Mr. Trump is doing as president.",
      "We gave people a list of things the government funds. None of them registered a majority wanting cuts, except foreign aid.",
      "While many Americans think cutting government spending in principle should be a high priority, most do not want cuts to federal spending on Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, education, defense, or border enforcement. This is also true among Republicans.",
      "Congress and the president",
      "There's still a general view that the president's party in Congress, the Republicans, should push back on the president when they disagree. This includes most of the nation's rank-and-file Republicans who say so.",
      "MAGA Republicans, though, are more likely than Republicans as a whole to say congressional Republicans should do what Mr. Trump wants.",
      "Most Democrats would look for their congressional delegation to oppose Mr. Trump as much as possible.",
      "Americans' views on key issues",
      "Reviewing the tariff issue in the news: Tariffs on countries like Mexico and Canada aren't popular with most Americans (there's more support for tariffs on China), according to polling we did in February, prior to the implementation of the tariffs. One reason: nearly three in four thought new tariffs on imported goods generally would lead to price increases.",
      "This is important because Americans for years have told us that prices are a top reason they don't think the economy is good and told us they don't feel their incomes are keeping up with inflation.",
      "Taxes. Many want to hear the president talk about cutting taxes, and there is majority support for Congress to extend the 2017 tax cuts, even among more than a third of Democrats.",
      "Deportation policy. During the 2024 campaign most voters \u2014 and overwhelmingly, Trump voters \u2014 supported the idea of his new mass deportation program. Today, a majority of Americans approve of the Trump administration's current deportation policy.",
      "Russia-Ukraine. Prior to the Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the pause in U.S. aid to Ukraine, the country continued to divide along partisan lines over military aid to Ukraine.",
      "This analysis is based on CBS News/YouGov surveys conducted with nationally representative samples of U.S. adults.

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 18:23:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Starliner commander Barry Wilmore offered an even-handed response to questions about the intrusion of politics into his ISS mission.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"",
      "Wilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.",
      "\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station\u00a0on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.",
      "The Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.",
      "In mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",
      "\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"",
      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",
      "Given that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"",
      "If all goes well, Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov will blast off and head for the space station on March 12.",
      "Once on board, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams will help their replacements settle in before undocking and returning to Earth around March 19.",

      "The SSA said it is continuing to pay the retroactive benefits to eligible Social Security beneficiaries, whose monthly payments will increase beginning in April, reflecting March's benefit.",
      "The monthly benefit adjustment and retroactive payments are due to a law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, who said it would mean an average monthly increase of $360 for more than 2.5 million Social Security recipients.",
      "What is the average Social Security retroactive payment?",
      "The retroactive payments are due to the law's elimination of two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",

      "The 25% tax on imports from Canada and Mexico, plus an additional 10% tax on imports from China, will drive up the costs of an array of consumer goods, from groceries to automobiles, and could cause more financial strain for inflation-weary consumers, experts say.",
      "Because importers pay the tariffs \u2014 such as Walmart, which imports goods from China and other nations \u2014 U.S. businesses will shoulder the added costs. While some companies may opt to swallow all or part of the expense, some of the costs are likely to be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices, economists say.",
      "\"If there is a significant increase in tariffs ... those costs will likely be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses,\" Brian Peck, executive director of University of Southern California's Center for Transnational Law and Business, told CBS Los Angeles.",

      "What will cost more with tariffs?",
      "Products imported directly from Canada, Mexico and China could see price hikes as businesses pass along the tariff costs, either in full or in part, to consumers. But some products that are made in the U.S. but which use imported materials could also see higher prices, such as automobiles that are manufactured domestically but rely on parts imported from Canada, Mexico or China.",
      "Consumers could start seeing higher prices for some products fairly quickly, such as gasoline, with some regions expected to see gas prices jump as much as 40 cents per gallon within days, according to GasBuddy energy analyst Patrick De Haan.",
      "But other goods, such as cars, might not reflect higher prices for several months, experts say.",
      "Vegetables, fruit, beef, beer and spirits",

      "At the same time, the U.S. imported roughly $40 billion worth of Canadian agricultural products, including beef, pork, grains, potatoes and canola oil, the USDA notes.",
      "Subject to 25% tariffs, prices on such products could rise substantially, depending on how much of the cost increase businesses pass along to shoppers. Fresh produce prices could increase by about 3%, while food prices overall may increase by 2%, according to a new analysis from Democrats on Congress' Joint Economic Committee.",
      "According to the\u00a0Atlanta Fed, the tariffs on three key U.S. trading partners would bring up prices on everyday purchases, including food and beverages, by as much as 1.63%, if businesses pass along anywhere from half to all of the added costs to consumers.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will consider a dispute over the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's license allowing thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste to be stored in West Texas.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court will convene Wednesday to weigh in on a decades-long dispute over what to do with thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste, specifically a plan to store it above one of the world's most productive oil fields, the Permian Basin in Texas.",
      "The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the company Interim Storage Partners are facing off against the state of Texas and Fasken Land and Minerals Ltd., which owns land in the Permian Basin, in the fight over what to do with the spent fuel generated at nuclear reactor sites. The waste can remain radioactive and pose health risks for thousands of years, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "How to address the problem of nuclear waste has been complicated by politics since the advent of nuclear power last century. In 1982, Congress\u00a0 enacted a federal law that required the government to establish a permanent facility to house spent fuel, later determined to be Yucca Mountain in Nevada. But the site has yet to be established amid pushback from the state, and funding from Congress dried up years ago. The project was halted during the Obama administration.",
      "The issue of where to store the growing amount of spent fuel remains. Roughly 91,000 metric tons of nuclear waste from commercial power plants are currently in private storage, both at or away from nuclear reactor sites, according to the U.S. government. And with nearly 20% of the nation's electricity supplied by nuclear energy, plants are generating an additional 2,000 metric tons of spent fuel each year, the Energy Department estimates.",
      "The Supreme Court case",
      "The legal battle before the justices Wednesday involves a license the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued in September 2021 to a company called Interim Storage Partners allowing it to house 5,000 metric tons \u2014 and up to 40,000 metric tons \u2014 of spent fuel in dry-cask, above-ground storage for up to 40 years.",
      "The facility would be constructed in Andrews County, Texas, which is west of Dallas and less than a mile from the state's border with New Mexico. There is already a disposal site in the county for low-level radioactive waste.",
      "Before the commission granted the license, the state submitted comments opposing the site and warning it was dangerous to store nuclear waste anywhere besides a deep geological repository like Yucca Mountain. Texas officials cautioned against housing the spent fuel on a \"concrete pad\" above the state's Permian Basin, where 250,000 active oil and gas wells capture 40% of the country's oil reserves.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality did not seek to intervene in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's proceedings. But several groups did try to object, including Fasken Land and Minerals. Their request, however, was denied by the commission.",
      "Still, the state and land owners asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to review the license to Interim Storage Partners. Two other federal appeals courts considered cases relating to the company's license, but only the 5th Circuit allowed the dispute to move forward.",
      "The 5th Circuit first found that Texas and the landowners could seek review of a final order from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding the license because it acted beyond its authority. The court also ruled that provisions of the 1954 Atomic Energy Act do not support licenses like the one issued to Interim Storage Partners, which allows for the offsite storage of spent fuel. Instead, the 5th Circuit also said a 1982 law intends for nuclear waste to be stored at the site of nuclear reactors or in a federal facility until there is a permanent place for it.",
      "The Supreme Court agreed to take up the case in October and will consider two issues. The first is whether Texas and the landowners could challenge the commission's decision to issue the license to Interim Storage Partners. The second is whether federal law allows the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license private companies to temporarily house spent fuel away from nuclear-reactor sites.",
      "In filings with the high court, lawyers for the government argued that Texas didn't become a party to the commission's licensing adjudication simply by submitting comments during proceedings. They also said that Fasken Land and Minerals' unsuccessful attempt to intervene didn't make it a party for the purposes of challenging the commission's decision to grant the license.",
      "If the Supreme Court were to accept the 5th Circuit's finding that Texas and Fasken could seek review of the licensing decision, it would encourage \"litigants to skip the administrative proceeding and then ambush the agency by calling its authority into question once that proceeding is over,\" the Justice Department wrote.",
      "As to the second question, on whether the commission could grant licenses for temporary, offsite storage, the Justice Department argued that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has exercised that authority for decades.",
      "In 1971, for example, the commission's predecessor issued a license to General Electric Company to store nuclear waste at a standalone facility. In 1989, its Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Board recognized when licensing a nuclear power plant that spent fuel could be stored in offsite facilities owned by private entities, government lawyers argued.",
      "\"Storage of spent nuclear fuel lies at the heart of the commission's expertise and congressionally assigned role, and the commission has clear power to issue licenses for temporary storage of spent fuel at the site of a nuclear reactor,\" they wrote.",
      "According to the Congressional Research Service, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued three licenses for the temporary storage of spent fuel at privately owned facilities away from reactors: The first, issued in 2006 for a project in Utah, was terminated by the license-holder, Private Fuel Storage; the second is to Interim Storage Partners; and the third, granted to Holtec International for the facility in Lea County, New Mexico, is tied up in court proceedings.",
      "But officials for the state of Texas said that Yucca Mountain is the government's plan for dealing with the thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste that continue to pile up, and they accused the federal government of engaging in a \"policy workaround\" by licensing private entities to store nuclear waste at facilities away from reactors.",
      "\"Nothing about this license is lawful,\" they wrote in Supreme Court filings. \"Congress has already legislated a solution to the nation's nuclear-waste problem: permanent storage in Yucca Mountain. No statute mentions, let alone authorizes, private interim offsite storage.\"",
      "The state invoked what is called the major questions doctrine, which says that Congress must give clear authorization for a federal agency to decide an issue of major political or economic significance.",
      "Congress, Texas officials wrote, has determined that where to store spent nuclear fuel is a major problem of public concern, and the solution is Yucca Mountain. Additionally, Congress mandated that the waste should be stored temporarily at either the reactor site or a facility that is operated by the federal government, the state argued.",
      "\"Congress answered that 'major' question, both as to interim offsite storage and permanent disposal,\" lawyers for Texas wrote. \"Congress's clear answer was Yucca Mountain or interim federal facilities \u2014 not a private facility in Texas.\"",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June.",

    "story": [
      "The top communications official under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly resigned last week, just two weeks after being sworn in to be the department's assistant secretary for public affairs.",
      "The resignation of Thomas Corry, a Trump administration appointee, was first reported by Politico. Corry did not respond to multiple requests from CBS News for comment.",
      "Corry's departure came just days after Kennedy faced criticism for how he handled a question about the growing measles outbreak in Texas at a White House Cabinet meeting, calling it \"not unusual\" and misstating the number of deaths reported in the state.",
      "A former HHS official and a person familiar with Corry's thinking said that he had voiced disappointment with how Kennedy handled the question. It was a missed opportunity, making headlines for appearing indifferent to the deadly outbreak.",
      "But Corry's frustrations extended beyond that, as his office triaged a deluge of inquiries on agency actions ranging from canceled vaccines meetings to stalled research funding.",
      "Unlike previous officials in the role, who usually closely work with the secretary, Corry had been cut off from Kennedy, one former HHS official said. Federal officials said they were unsure if Corry had the trust of Kennedy or his inner circle, undermining his authority.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, Kennedy claimed he never met Corry and did not know much about his former top spokesperson.",
      "\"I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news,\" Kennedy said.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not comment, when asked about Kennedy's remarks. Instead, Nixon re-sent a previous statement attributed to principal deputy chief of staff Stefanie Spear about Kennedy making measles a \"top priority\" for his team.",
      "Spear is one of a handful of aides now at HHS to have worked for Kennedy during his longshot presidential campaign. Many others were hired from the ranks of Trump supporters and alumni of other federal agencies.",
      "This includes Nixon, who previously handled press for Trump's campaign. Nixon had reported to Corry alongside Michael Brady, a former top Army public affairs official.",
      "Corry previously served as a communications official for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the COVID-19 pandemic, under the first Trump administration.",
      "Multiple current CMS officials praised Corry as highly competent, trusted and well-liked among career federal health officials, as well as by Trump aides.",
      "Spear, who also has the title of a senior counselor to Kennedy, has been tightly controlling communications across the department, multiple officials said.",
      "Before Kennedy's confirmation, Spear ordered the unprecedented department-wide communications \"pause\" that froze the release of information across HHS.",
      "Other factors have contributed to challenges within the communications shop, including a shortfall in staffing, a former HHS official said.",
      "During the Biden administration, when top-ranking civil servants within the communications office retired in recent years, they were replaced by political appointees, not career executives who would stay on after the White House changed hands.",
      "That complicated the transition and left the incoming Trump administration with a deficit of institutional knowledge.",
      "More changes could be coming soon to the communications officials who remain. A current HHS official said staff within the team were asked to provide explanations of their \"roles and responsibilities\" by noon on Tuesday.",

      "The revised memo from Charles Ezell, the acting director of OPM, comes after a federal judge ruled last week that the Trump administration's mass firings of probationary workers, who generally have been in their jobs for less than one year, were likely illegal.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup found that \"OPM did not have the authority to direct the firing of employees, probationary or otherwise, in any other federal agency.\"",
      "The latest guidance from OPM revises a Jan. 20 memo from Ezell that required agencies to identify all employees still in their probationary periods and send a report to the agency listing all those workers. The memo instructed department heads to \"promptly determine whether those employees should be retained at the agency.\"",
      "But the revised memo includes a new paragraph that states that \"by this memorandum, OPM is not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees. Agencies have ultimate decision-making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions.\"",
      "OPM said it \"wanted to clarify in light of a recent court order and some public misinformation. It has always been up to agencies whether to take performance-based actions against probationary employees.\"",
      "Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, or AFGE, said OPM's latest guidance \"is a clear admission that it unlawfully directed federal agencies to carry out mass terminations of probational employees.\"",
      "\"Every agency should immediately rescind these unlawful terminations and reinstate everyone who was illegally fired,\" Kelley said in a statement regarding the memo.",
      "The AFGE is one of the labor unions that sued the Trump administration over its firings of tens of thousands of federal workers. The unions estimated there were roughly 200,000 probationary workers employed throughout the federal government. The federal workforce consists of more than 2.4 million people, excluding military personnel and postal workers.",
      "After Ezell directed agency heads to identify probationary employees, Mr. Trump issued an executive order that instructed agency heads to \"promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "The mass firings were a drastic move by Mr. Trump in his effort to cut the size of the federal government. The president established the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to lead the efforts to shrink the government, and workers for the task force has fanned out across federal agencies. OPM also gave federal workers the option to participate in a deferred resignation program, which gave them the option to resign their positions but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The White House said roughly 75,000 employees accepted the offer to leave their government jobs, far fewer than the 200,000 it expected to take the so-called buyout.",
      "The Trump administration has also targeted specific agencies, namely the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the U.S. Agency for International Development, in its cost-cutting efforts. Mr. Trump's overhaul of the agencies, though, is being challenged in federal court."

    "story": [
      "A divided Supreme Court on Tuesday made it harder for environmental regulators to limit water pollution, ruling for San Francisco in a case about the discharge of raw sewage that sometimes occurs during heavy rains.",
      "By a 5-4 vote, the court's conservative majority ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped its authority under the Clean Water Act with water pollution permits that contain vague requirements for maintaining water quality.",
      "The decision is the latest in which conservative justices have reined in pollution control efforts.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the court that the EPA can set specific limits that tell cities and counties what can be discharged. But the agency lacks the authority \"to include 'end-result' provisions,\" Alito wrote, that make cities and counties responsible for maintaining the quality of the water, the Pacific Ocean in this case, into which wastewater is discharged.",
      "\"When a permit contains such requirements, a permittee that punctiliously follows every specific requirement in its permit may nevertheless face crushing penalties if the quality of the water in its receiving waters falls below the applicable standards,\" he wrote.",
      "One conservative justice, Amy Coney Barrett, joined the court's three liberals in dissent. Limits on discharges sometimes still don't insure water quality standards are met, Barrett wrote.",
      "\"The concern that the technology-based effluent limitations may fall short is on display in this case,\" Barrett wrote, adding that \"discharges from components of San Francisco's sewer system have allegedly led to serious breaches of the water quality standards, such as 'discoloration, scum, and floating material, including toilet paper, in Mission Creek.'\"",
      "The case produced an unusual alliance of the liberal northern California city, energy companies and business groups.",
      "The EPA has issued thousands of the permits, known as narrative permits, over several decades, former acting general counsel Kevin Minoli said.",
      "The narrative permits have operated almost as a backstop in case permits that quantify what can be discharged still result in unacceptable water quality, Minoli said.",
      "With the new restrictions imposed by the court, \"the question is what comes in place of those limits,\" Minoli said.",
      "Alito downplayed the impact of the decision, writing that the agency has \"the tools needed\" to insure water quality standards are met.",
      "In response to the decision, the Sierra Club, a grassroots environmental organization headquartered in Oakland, California, released a statement.",
      "The decision \"ignores the basic reality of how water bodies and water pollution works, and could stymie the ability of the EPA to implement the Clean Water Act, a bedrock environmental law that has kept water safe for the last 50 years,\" Sanjay Narayan, chief appellate counsel at the Sierra Club's environmental law program, said.",
      "\"Because the EPA is not allowed to include health-based standards when regulating water pollution, it'll need to know everything about what might be discharged before a clean-water permit can be issued \u2014 making the permitting process delayed and incredibly expensive,\" Narayan said. \"The result is likely to be a new system where the public is regularly subjected to unsafe water quality.\"",
      "San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu and San Francisco Public Utilities Commission General Manager Dennis Herrera said in a statement that the decision \"makes clear that permitholders like San Francisco are responsible for what they discharge, and the EPA has the tools at its disposal to ensure water quality. But it's not lawful to punish permitholders for things outside of their control, such as the end-result water quality of a shared body of water, where many other factors affect water quality.\"",

She has paused her medical education for a year to formally research the intersection of music and end-of-life care.",
      "The approach has shown some powerful results, particularly for families coping with loss.",

      "\"Neuroscience came together. We're seeing actual images on the impact on the brain,\" Wong said. The initiative, now a decade old, recognizes that many faculty members are also artists. \"When we talk to them, we ask, 'Why do you devote so much time to your art forms?' Invariably, they say, 'It makes me a more balanced person and it makes me a better doctor.'\"",
      "For Ambler, who has treated 55 patients with her musical methodology, the experience has transformed her perspective on mortality.",

    "story": [
      "When a South Carolina man who killed his ex-girlfriend's parents with a baseball bat steps into the death row chamber Friday night, it won't be lethal injection or electrocution that ends his life.",
      "It will be three people holding rifles about 15 feet away who will complete his punishment in what will be the United States' first\u00a0firing squad execution in 15 years.",
      "Some 46 prisoners have been executed by lethal injection and electrocution in South Carolina since 1985. Brad Sigmon's execution will be the first by firing squad. Just three inmates \u2014 in Utah in 1977, 1996 and 2010 \u2014 have faced a firing squad in the U.S. since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.",
      "South Carolina spent about $54,000 in 2022 constructing an area for a\u00a0firing squad\u00a0in its death chamber. It won't be far from the electric chair.",
      "Reporters, family members of Sigmon's victims and his lawyer will view the execution inside the same building used for all executions over the past 35 years, although prison officials say the glass separating the witness room from the death chamber is now bulletproof. Sigmon can give a last statement if he wishes.",
      "The crime",
      "Sigmon, 67, is being executed for the 2001 baseball bat killings of his ex-girlfriend's parents at their home in Greenville County. They were in separate rooms, and Sigmon went back and forth as he beat them to death, investigators said.",
      "He then kidnapped his ex-girlfriend at gunpoint, but she escaped from his car. He shot at her as she ran but missed, according to prosecutors.",
      "In a confession, Sigmon said, \"I couldn't have her. I wasn't going to let anybody else have her.\"",
      "How Friday's execution will unfold",
      "Death row inmates in South Carolina are housed in a building adjacent to the death chamber at the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia. Shortly before his execution, Sigmon will be moved to an individual cell closer to where his life will end.",
      "Just before 6 p.m., the warden will ask Gov. Henry McMaster by phone if he is granting clemency and the Attorney General's Office if there any any legal blocks to the execution. If both answers are no, Sigmon will enter the death chamber and the witness room curtain will be opened.",
      "Sigmon can give a last statement. Then he will be strapped to a metal chair that sits on top of a catch basin. The right side of Sigmon's face and body will be toward the witnesses. A hood will be placed on his head. A medical professional will briefly examine him to place a target over his heart, according to state protocols released in 2022.",
      "Fifteen feet away will be three state Corrections Department volunteers with rifles. All three will have live ammunition. They will fire from an opening in a wall the witnesses can't see.",
      "A doctor will come out, passing by the state's immobile electric chair, to confirm Sigmon is dead. The witnesses will leave after signing an official document that they witnessed the execution.",
      "When lethal injections take place, a gurney is in the death chamber and behind it is a curtain that blocks the view of the electric chair and the firing squad chair.",
      "The firing squad",
      "Not much is known about the people who will fire the rifles. Prison officials said they have \"completed all required training.\"",
      "A shield law passed in 2023, in part to keep the name of any supplier of lethal injection drugs secret, also keeps secret many other details about the firing squad, from what training it received to the names of anyone on the execution team.",
      "A few details came out in court in 2022 during an unrelated trial that ultimately led the state Supreme Court to rule the firing squad, electric chair and lethal injection were all legal and didn't violate the U.S. Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.",
      "The state will use .308-caliber Winchester 110-grain TAP Urban ammunition often found in police rifles, said Colie Rushton, the director of Security and Emergency Operations at the Corrections Department.",
      "Why that bullet?",
      "The round is designed to break apart as soon as it hits something firm, in this case the prisoner's rib cage. Fragments will spread out and the intent is to destroy as much of the heart as possible.",
      "A medical expert for the state said at the 2022 trial that if the heart is heavily damaged, an inmate would lose consciousness almost immediately and likely would not feel pain. The doctor said survivors of gunshots often report first feeling like they were punched and pain only following a few seconds later.",
      "But a doctor testifying for inmates said it would likely take longer for an inmate to lose consciousness and that as anyone who has ever broken a rib knows, breathing becomes extremely painful once the bones in the chest are cracked.",
      "If the aim of the executioners is not true, death could take even longer. Damaged hearts can continue to pump blood.",
      "The information released by the state to the public gives no indication what might happen if an inmate survives the initial shots. At the 2022 trial, witnesses indicated the squad could fire again.",
      "Firing squad approval",
      "South Carolina's legislature approved the firing squad after prison officials could not obtain the\u00a0drugs needed for lethal injections\u00a0because suppliers refused to sell them if they were publicly known. A shield law for privacy was passed later, but the firing squad remained on the books. The state of Idaho is also set to resume\u00a0firing squad executions, but only in circumstances where\u00a0lethal injection drugs\u00a0cannot be found.",
      "Electrocution is technically the default execution method in South Carolina, but the state hasn't used it since 2008. Sigmon didn't choose lethal injection, the method used most often, because he was concerned about problems with South Carolina's protocol.",
      "Witnesses to the state's three previous executions \u2014 carried out by injection since South Carolina moved to using a massive dose of pentobarbital for the procedure \u2014 have said that even though the condemned prisoners appeared to stop breathing and moving within a few minutes, they were not declared dead for at least 20 minutes.",
      "The autopsy report has been released for only one of the executions:\u00a0Richard Moore, who prison officials say was given two large doses of the sedative pentobarbital 11 minutes apart on Nov. 1.",
      "Freddie Owens, the first inmate killed with the new protocols, refused an autopsy for religious reasons.",
      "Lawyers for Sigmon said Moore's autopsy showed unusual amounts of fluid in his lungs and an expert suggested he might have felt like he was drowning.",

      "Other factors driving spread that were cited by PAHO include increased movement of people around the Americas and an uptick in dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection that can mask the spread of measles due to similar symptoms.",
      "What is measles elimination?",
      "The U.S. achieved measles elimination in 2000, after documenting a year of no endemic spread of the virus. WHO officials declared North and South America free of measles in 2016, making the Americas the first region to reach this milestone in the world.",
      "Health officials define \"measles elimination\" as proof of no endemic spread of the highly contagious virus within an area for at least 12 months. A continuous chain of transmission persisting for at least a year would reverse that goal.",
      "While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention usually reports hundreds of measles cases every year around the U.S., many are from short-lived outbreaks linked to unvaccinated young children who were recently outside the U.S.",
      "The last large outbreak of the virus in the U.S. was in Illinois last year. It was largely confined to migrant shelters in Chicago.",

Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance - a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Independent experts skeptical of \"de-extinction\"",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \"a lot of processes and red tape\" before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "\"We are in the world of synthetic biology. These tools exist. It's hard to put the genie back in the bottle. We need to be really thoughtful about the intended and unintended consequences of our actions,\" Lamm told CBS News Boston in 2022.",

    "summary": "Churchill, Manitoba, a small village on the Hudson Bay, is known as the polar bear capital of the world.",
    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 15:35:38 -0500",
    "summary": "Other than Pope Francis, these are the most powerful people at the Vatican.",
    "story": [
      "For more than two weeks, eyes have been on the Vatican, awaiting news about Pope Francis' health. The pope has been at Rome's Gemelli Hospital since Feb. 14, 2025, being treated for double pneumonia and other complications.",
      "When a pope is ill, resigns or passes away, who steps in? And who else helps lead the Holy See? The Conversation U.S. asked Daniel Speed Thompson, a theologian at the University of Dayton, for some insight into Vatican City.",
      "Who are the most powerful people at the Vatican, besides the pope?",
      "The Vatican houses the central government of the Catholic Church and is also an independent city-state. The pope is both the head of the Catholic Church and head of state.",
      "In order to govern both, he has the Roman Curia, meaning \"court.\" In modern terms, the Curia is the papal bureaucracy. It is an extension of the pope's authority.",
      "In Catholic doctrine, the pope has the highest authority in the church. He can exercise it alone or with the College of Bishops, made up of all the bishops in the world. Bishops named by the pope to the office of \"cardinal\" can, if under 80 years old, vote to elect a new pope. Some cardinals, but by no means all, serve in the papal Curia in Rome.",
      "Besides the pope, curial officials who oversee important aspects of the church's political and religious life are often powerful figures. For example, the secretariat of state, headed by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, oversees relations with other countries and international organizations. It also oversees the Vatican's diplomatic corps.",
      "The Dicastery \u2014 \"department\" \u2014 for the Doctrine of the Faith, led by Cardinal V\u00edctor Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez, addresses questions about correct Catholic teaching on faith and morals. The Dicastery of Bishops, headed by Cardinal Robert Prevost, coordinates the nominations of new bishops around the world.",
      "All these officials work under the authority of the pope, advocating for and implementing his agenda. For example, Prevost has suggested that all Catholics should be involved in the selection of bishops. This idea is linked with Francis' call for a more \"synodal\" church: one that is less hierarchical and shaped by lay Catholics' concerns and challenges.",
      "If a pope can't fulfill his duties, who steps in?",
      "When a pope dies \u2013 or resigns, like Benedict XVI did in 2013 \u2014 the governance of the Catholic Church formally falls to the College of Cardinals. However, the authority of the college is very limited. On their own, cardinals cannot make any significant decisions concerning faith, morals and worship. Nor can they undo previous papal decisions or change church laws about electing a new pope.",
      "All the heads of the dicasteries lose their office upon the death or resignation of a pope. The College of Cardinals serves as a caretaker government whose primary purpose is to prepare for the election of the new pope and oversee day-to-day workings of the Vatican.",
      "One cardinal, known as the \"camerlengo,\" is responsible for confirming the pope's death or resignation. He then assumes control over the pope's residence and coordinates the funeral, if needed. The camerlengo also takes custody of the Vatican's property in Rome and supervises details for the upcoming conclave.",
      "The day-to-day business of the Catholic Church continues, but no big decisions can be made in the absence of a pope. The church cannot appoint new bishops, and the Vatican cannot start new diplomatic efforts.",
      "Are officials at the Vatican often nominated to be pope?",
      "Sometimes. Francis was a cardinal from Argentina before his election as pope and had not served in the Roman Curia. However, Benedict XVI, Francis' predecessor, did serve as the prefect of the Congregation \u2014 now called Dicastery \u2014 for the Doctrine of the Faith. Some recent popes served in the Curia earlier in their career but not immediately before their election.",
      "What do you wish more people understood about the Vatican?",
      "Three things. First, the Vatican is unlike any organization in the world. Its religious mission and political status rest on nearly 2,000 years of history. This complicated story provides a unique tradition that anchors the institution of the Catholic Church, but can also block the church from critical self-examination and renewal.",
      "Second, the Vatican is like every organization in the world. Vatican officials can be faithful to the highest standards of their religion, truly wishing to serve the church and the common good of humanity. But they can also be flagrantly immoral, even criminals, and careerist seekers of status or luxury. Francis has consistently called out priests and bishops who see themselves as somehow superior by virtue of their office or their ordination.",
      "Finally, compared with the massive bureaucracies of modern governments and corporations, the Vatican is relatively small and not as wealthy as it is often portrayed.",
      "Although the Curia manages a vast international organization, its resources are far closer to my own midsize Catholic university than to the U.S. government or Apple. Vatican City and the Holy See employ about 2,000 people, with an operating budget of about $835 million.",
      "Yes, the Catholic Church has wealth \u2014 and the ongoing problem of deficits and financial corruption. But the Vatican's resources pale in comparison with what a modern state or large company can muster.",

At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\" said Trudeau. \"We two friends fighting is exactly what our opponents around the world want to see.\"",
      "Trudeau also said Canada will challenge the U.S. action by filing dispute resolution claims at the World Trade Organization and through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal that replaced NAFTA.",
      "Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media threatening to raise tariffs further: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"",
      "Some of Canada's governors have pushed for a tougher response.",
      "\"If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I'm encouraging every other province to do the same; Quebec, Manitoba, BC [British Columbia], we all have to act in unison,\" Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said at an industrial convention on Monday. \"They rely on our energy. They need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard. We're going to come back twice as hard.\"",
      "Ford said retaliatory measures that Canada could consider going forward included halting shipments of critical minerals such as uranium, potash and nickel, in addition to cutting the energy supply, which he said could leave 1.5 million people without power in New York, Michigan and Minnesota, potentially causing significant disruptions to the U.S. economy.",
      "He said he had also asked officials in his province to end billions of dollars in contracts with the U.S. and to stop the import of American alcohol to Ontario.",
      "\"It's going to be an absolute disaster for both countries,\" he acknowledged in a separate interview with NBC News. \"I don't want to respond, but I will respond like they have never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has framed his tariffs on Canada as a response to what he says is the country's failure to stem the flow of both undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across the northern U.S. border \u2014 though very little of the drug enters that way, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
      "In a message posted to his own Truth social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump also took issue with Canadian banking regulations, saying the country \"doesn't allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market,\" but providing no further context.",
      "\"I heard he talked about banking again this morning,\" Trudeau said during his Tuesday news conference, \"which doesn't make any sense, because American banks \u2014 of 16 American banks currently active in Canada \u2014 holding about $113 billion worth of assets in this country. So the American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an example of not really being able to see what it is that he [Trump] wants, because even the excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false. So we actually have to fall back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Canada should become a U.S. \"51st state.\"",
      "Trudeau defended Canada's actions on border control and the illegal flow of fentanyl on Monday, saying that between December 2024 and January 2025, seizures of the drug from Canada by U.S. authorities dropped 97%, to just 0.03 pounds. That drop came, he said, after Canada implemented a $1.3 billion plan to deploy more helicopters and more boots on the ground, and to appoint a \"Fentanyl Czar.\"",
      "China announces tariffs, warns against \"maximum pressure\" tactic",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused China of giving its manufacturers and other businesses an unfair advantage in trade with the U.S. and vowed to balance the extremely lopsided flow of goods. But he has framed his latest round of tariffs on the country as punishment for what he claims is a Chinese refusal to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it to the U.S.",
      "China's government has refused to back down in the face of the escalating trade war with the Trump administration, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that the \"Chinese people cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, and bullying tactics are not the right way to deal with China.\"",
      "\"Attempting to exert maximum pressure on China is targeting the wrong opponent and is a misreading of the situation. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the fentanyl issue, it should engage in consultation with China built on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" he said, according to China's official media.",
      "\"If the U.S. has other intentions and is committed to waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will respond in kind,\" Lin said, adding a call for the White House \"to abandon its bullying tactics and return to the necessary track of dialogue and cooperation at an early date.\"",
      "China retaliated immediately, announcing its own 10-15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products and foods, from wheat, corn and cotton to soybeans, beef, chicken and dairy. Beijing also placed 25 U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions, citing what it said were national security concerns.",
      "Veteran Chinese analyst Victor Gao told CBS News that while China's counter-tariffs will impact U.S. farmers \u2014 perceived by Beijing to be among Mr. Trump's support base \u2014 he believes Beijing is being measured in its response and that it doesn't want to inflame the situation.",
      "Gao, who has worked with the country's leadership and is now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said China is better prepared for a trade war with the U.S. than it was during Mr. Trump's first term, as it has diversified into other, non-U.S. markets.",
      "He said if President Xi Jinping really wanted to step up Beijing's retaliation, it could halt imports of U.S. gas and oil, but he warned against the implications for both nations if the trade war continues to escalate, saying at best, it would end in a \"bloody tie.\"",
      "But Gao said he believed talks were still going on behind the scenes between U.S and Chinese officials, and that both countries likely have little interest in a deteriorating, tit-for-tat tariffs battle.",
      "Mexican president vows retaliation to \"inconceivable\" tariffs",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country would respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with its own retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures, but held off announcing exactly what those would be, promising a statement on Sunday in Mexico City's main square. She said she was scheduled to have a call with Mr. Trump this week, probably on Thursday.",
      "She said the reciprocal measures Mexico would take were \"not in any way or with the purpose of starting an economic or commercial confrontation that unfortunately and regrettably is the opposite of what we must be doing.\"",
      "\"It's inconceivable that they don't think about the damage this is going to cause to United States citizens and businesses with the increase in prices for things produced in our country,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Also, the damage it will cause by stopping job creation in both countries. No one wins with this decision.\"",
      "Sheinbaum stressed how Mexico had been working alongside the U.S. to respond to requests by Mr. Trump to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to reinforce the U.S.-Mexico border to curb migration.",
      "\"We collaborate to avoid illegal drug trafficking to the United States, but as we have said on multiple occasions, that country's government must take responsibility, too, for the crisis of opioid consumption that has caused so many deaths in the United States,\" the Mexican leader said.",
      "\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" added Sheinbaum.",
      "The Mexican peso slumped against the U.S. dollar as Sheinbaum delivered her remarks on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg.",

The Ukrainian leader also said it was \"time to make things right\" with the United States after a bruising Oval Office meeting with President Trump and the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 11:49:32 -0500",
    "summary": "The iceberg A23a has run aground in the shallow waters off of South Georgia, a remote British territory in the Southern Atlantic, researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "The world's\u00a0largest and oldest iceberg, named A23a, has run aground in shallow waters off the coast of South Georgia, a remote island in the South Atlantic known for its populations of penguins and elephant seals.",
      "The \"mega-berg,\" as some call it, is a sprawling ice sheet that once covered around 1,500 square miles but on its journey northward from Antarctica lost about 200 square miles of mass. Either way, the near-trillion-ton giant is larger than the state of Rhode Island, with towering cliffs that at certain points top 1,300 feet. It cracked off from continental Antarctica in 1986 and got stuck in the Weddell Sea, where it remained grounded for about three decades, according to the British Antarctic Survey, a research group focusing on polar science. The group has a station in South Georgia, which is a British territory.",
      "The iceberg looks like a \"towering wall emerging from the ocean, stretching from horizon to horizon,\" said British Antarctic Survey oceanographer Andrew Meijers in remarks published by the research group. Meijers studied A23a while aboard the ship RSS David Attenborough in late 2023.",
      "A23a started to drift up through the Southern Ocean in 2020, when currents put it on a possible collision course with South Georgia. The iceberg and the island are about the same size in square miles. Researchers describe its path toward South Georgia as both meandering and intriguing, as the iceberg has charted a somewhat unexpected route to the island and became trapped last year in a rotating column of water that for months left it spinning in place.",
      "At this point, the iceberg appears to be grounded in the shallow continental shelf around South Georgia, settling roughly 50 miles from the island's southwestern coast, according to the British Antarctic Survey. Meijers, citing satellite images, said it seems to be intact right now. But the iceberg will likely break into smaller chunks and begin to melt shortly afterward, in a process that could interrupt shipping operations and disrupt fisheries in the surrounding region.",
      "\"Whilst the berg is large it is easily avoided by Southern Ocean shipping operators \u2014 who are well aware of the dangers bergs pose, and the location of A23a. However, as it breaks up over time, the smaller bergs are much harder to track,\" Meijers said. \"Discussions with fishing operators suggests that past large bergs have made some regions more or less off limits for fishing operations for some time due to the number of smaller \u2014 yet often more dangerous \u2014 bergy bits.\"",
      "Meijers said there's less of a concern about the effects A23a could have on South Georgia's seals and penguins, although huge chunks of ice in the island's vicinity could possibly thwart their paths to feeding sites and result in less food and higher mortality rates for pups and chicks relying on them.",
      "But the melting iceberg may also bring positive changes to the environment, Meijers added, by dispensing huge amounts of nutrients into the water that, in turn, \"could actually boost populations of local predators like seals and penguins.\"",
      "While Meijers noted icebergs like A23a are normal parts of the Antarctic life cycle, human-caused climate change has accelerated the process over the last couple of decades. Since 2000, researchers have recorded ice shelves losing about 6,000 gigatons of their mass, he said. One gigaton is equal to 1 billion metric tons, or 2.2 trillion pounds.",
      "\"This loss of ice shelf mass has significant implications for ocean circulation due to the addition of freshwater, acceleration of sea level rise ... and possible irreversible 'tipping points,' particularly in the vulnerable west Antarctic,\" Meijers said.\u202f\"These are pressing and active areas of research at BAS and elsewhere.\"",

      "One way it would do this is by allowing EU countries to spend more on defense without triggering EU mechanisms against budget deficits, Von der Leyen said. Another way would be through EU loans worth around $158 billion for EU member states.",
      "\"It will help Member States to pool demand and to buy together,\" Von der Leyen said. \"With this equipment, Member States can massively step up their support to Ukraine\u2026 This approach of joint procurement will also reduce costs, reduce fragmentation, increase interoperability and strengthen our defense industrial base.\"",

      "The Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Petr Fiala, said Europe \"cannot allow Russia's aggressive policy, which threatens us all, to succeed. The era of relying on others to address fundamental international challenges on our behalf is over. Now is the time for Europe to move decisively from words to action.\"",
      "Will Trump's move \"encourage Putin to ask for more\"?",
      "Mr. Trump's decision to suspend U.S. military aid to Ukraine \"will encourage Putin to ask for more \u2014 including Ukrainian demilitarization and neutrality,\" Malcolm Chalmers, Deputy Director-General of the Royal United Services Institute military think tank, predicted Tuesday.",
      "Chalmers said the \"nightmare scenario\" would be for the United States and Russia to announce a peace deal, \"and then tell Ukraine and Europe to 'take it or leave it.'\"",
      "Recent estimates show only about 20% of military hardware supplied to Ukraine is from the United States, with 25% provided by Europe and the rest of the world and 55% produced in Ukraine, Chalmers said. But the 20% provided by the U.S., he said, is \"the most lethal and important.\"",
      "\"What will count most of all is how far the U.K. and Europe are prepared to help Ukraine in defiance of the U.S.,\" Chalmers said. \"Ukraine will not collapse [without U.S. military aid] \u2013 they already experienced an aid cutoff last year, but the effect will be cumulative.\"",

    "summary": "For years, Mexico has been one of the world's most dangerous countries outside a war zone for journalists.",
    "story": [
      "Mexican authorities were investigating the killing of a local reporter Monday in the central state of Guanajuato, the country's homicide leader.",
      "The state prosecutor's office identified the victim only by his first name, but local media outlets said the victim was Kristian Zavala, who covered local goings on in the city of Silao on his Facebook page. Zavala and another person were killed Sunday, according to the office. According local media, Zavala and his companion were shot dead by unknown individuals aboard a vehicle after midnight",
      "It was at least the\u00a0third killing of a media worker\u00a0so far this year, though it remained unclear if the motive was connected to his work. The U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists and Mexico's chapter of Articulo 19 demanded a thorough investigation.",
      "Violence in Guanajuato is linked to ongoing conflict between the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the\u00a0Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of the most powerful in the Latin American nation. Last month, the Trump administration formally\u00a0labeled eight cartels\u00a0as terrorist groups, including the Jalisco cartel.",
      "For years, Mexico has been one of the world's most dangerous countries outside a war zone for journalists. A record number of journalists were killed worldwide in 2024, the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a report released last month.",
      "How journalist killings are counted",
      "Sometimes authorities say the victim was a journalist, but usually only if it was someone well known. More commonly, press advocacy organizations share the information.",
      "The information, however, can vary between sources. In many cases, like that of Zavala, the victims cover very local events using social platforms rather than for a traditional newspaper, television or radio station. In those cases, it's also common that the coverage is only one of the person's jobs. They may also drive a taxi or do something else to make ends meet.",
      "The same authorities who are looked to for answers in some cases quickly dismiss a journalist's work as a possible motive or suggest they were involved with unseemly people or business.",
      "The number of journalist killings is down, but does that mean it's safer?",
      "No. Mexico had its deadliest year for journalists in 2022 with 13 killings, according to CPJ and Articulo 19. In 2023 and 2024, that fell to half or fewer, but non-lethal attacks shot up.",
      "In 2023, Articulo 19 recorded 561 such attacks, which includes disappearances as well.",
      "Hyperlocal journalists like Zavala are frequently the most exposed. They cover crime in places where cartels operate with impunity or cover local politics where justice is difficult to access and politicians may consider it easier to simply silence a critical voice.",
      "All but a handful of media workers' killings and abductions remain unsolved.",
      "\"Impunity is the norm in crimes against the press,\" the\u00a0the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a report\u00a0on Mexico last year.",
      "What do authorities do?",
      "Press advocates criticize authorities for frequently downplaying aggression toward the press and sometimes not investigating at all.",
      "During the administration of former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, he used his daily press briefings frequently to attack journalists, calling them enemies or adversaries and leaving the impression they were fair game.",

      "The Vatican said Monday evening that Pope Francis had suffered \"two episodes of acute respiratory failure\" over the course of the day, which it said were caused by \"significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus and consequent bronchospasm.\"",
      "The statement said doctors carried out two bronchoscopies to relieve his respiratory distress.",

      "The pope, who is 88 and has a long history of pulmonary trouble, has struggled to get over this illness, leading to the longest hospitalization of his pontificate.",
      "Before spending a restful weekend without any crises, Francis experienced a \"sudden worsening of the respiratory picture\" on Friday, the Vatican said, when he had a single \"isolated crisis of bronchospasm,\" which is when the muscles that line the airways in the lungs tighten.",
      "That episode caused the pope to inhale vomit, the Vatican said in a statement. Francis was treated with noninvasive mechanical ventilation and had a good response, the Vatican said Friday.",
      "Not long before the Vatican revealed his Friday bronchospasm, Vatican sources told CBS News the pope's health had improved, saying he was not in critical condition after exactly two weeks in hospital.",
      "The\u00a0bilateral pneumonia\u00a0diagnosis given to the pope on February 18 would have been a worrying turn for any patient of his age, but it was of particular concern for the leader of the Catholic Church.",
      "This is the pope's fourth hospitalization since he took over leadership of the Roman Catholic Church in 2013. He underwent significant\u00a0abdominal surgery\u00a0in 2021 and then had another procedure in 2023 to repair scar tissue and an abdominal hernia. He had been hospitalized briefly for treatment for pneumonia\u00a0earlier that year.",
      "As a young man in his home country of Argentina, Francis had part of one lung removed following a pulmonary infection, which left him vulnerable to respiratory illnesses.",
      "The Vatican announced earlier this month that Francis wouldn't celebrate Sunday Mass at St. Peter's Basilica this year, due to his ongoing recovery. The pope's ongoing hospitalization comes just ahead of the start of the annual Christian observance of Lent. The 40-day Lenten period begins on Ash Wednesday, which this year falls on March 5.",
      "Just before Easter last year, Francis declined to attend a Good Friday procession at Rome's Colosseum in a bid to conserve his health, but the pope later led tens of thousands of worshipers in\u00a0Easter celebrations.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has paused U.S. military aid to Ukraine, the White House confirmed Monday. It's the latest fallout days after a contentious meeting between President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House erupted into an open dispute in front of TV cameras.",
      "\"The president has been clear that he is focused on peace,\" a White House official told CBS News. \"We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution.\"",
      "The U.S. has been a key supplier of weapons for Ukraine as it continues to fend off Russian troops\u00a0three years after Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion three years ago. But Mr. Trump's return to office has brought a marked shift in U.S. policy toward the conflict, with the president blaming Ukraine for the war Russia started.",
      "Friday's meeting, which was meant to precede the signing of an economic and minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, devolved into a confrontation.",
      "Mr. Trump told Zelenskyy to reach a ceasefire agreement with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" after he challenged the vice president's assertion that the war had dragged on because of a lack of diplomacy from Ukraine and the Biden administration. The meeting abruptly ended without signing the rare earth minerals deal, and several White House officials told CBS News that the future of military aid for Ukraine was in doubt.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office in January, $3.85 billion has been available in drawdown authority for weaponry that can be pulled from existing U.S. stockpiles and sent to Ukraine, U.S. officials previously told CBS News. But the Trump administration has not packaged any of that aid for a single shipment since Jan. 21, a diplomatic source told CBS News Monday. Still, there have been shipments of weapons sent to Ukraine since Jan. 20 that were promised by the Biden administration in earlier drawdowns, according to defense officials.",
      "The $3.85 billion is spending authority, not congressionally appropriated funds, which means it's up to the White House to determine whether to release the aid. It is also not considered \"real money,\" meaning it cannot be spent elsewhere.",
      "Separately, the State Department also has about $1.5 billion in foreign military financing for Ukraine that is under a policy review by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. So far, the Trump State Department has only given Egypt and Israel waivers for FMF assistance.",
      "After Friday's meeting, Zelenskyy traveled to London for a summit with European and Canadian leaders, where he stressed the importance of Western security guarantees as part of any agreement that would bring the war to an end. He said in Ukrainian that peace with Russia was \"still very, very far away,\" but he thought that Ukraine-U.S. relations would hold.",
      "Mr. Trump later posted a link to an Associated Press story covering Zelenskyy's comments and wrote, \"This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\"",
      "\"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. - Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Mr. Trump's hardened stance on Ukraine has rankled some GOP lawmakers.",
      "Republican Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, said Monday, \"I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. It's the Ukrainians who are shedding blood. It is Putin who launched an unprovoked and unjustified attack on a free, democratic and sovereign country. And I am not backing off my support for Ukraine.\"",
      "Before the Trump administration's announcement Monday, Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota who serves on the Armed Services Committee, said of Ukraine, \"I'll simply say that we've got to get back on track again.\"",
      "\"It's critical that we get a minerals agreement put together and that we work on getting a security agreement with Ukraine,\" Rounds told reporters at the Capitol. \"They have been attacked. Russia is in the wrong, but we want to find a pathway to peace, and that means somebody has got to be the intermediary. I don't know if the president wants to be that. We need to give him the opportunity, but Russia is the aggressor, and we have to recognize that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said last month that he had a \"lengthy and highly productive phone call\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has also directed Rubio and other members of his national security team to \"immediately\" begin negotiations aimed at ending Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "But Rubio said in February there was \"a long ways to go\" before peace talks could begin.",
      "Delegations led by Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, shortly after those comments, without Ukrainian officials present. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said after the meeting that Rubio and Lavrov had agreed to appoint \"high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible in a way that is enduring, sustainable, and acceptable to all sides.\"",

Ukraine fears Russia would renege on any peace deal that doesn't carry with it the threat that Ukraine's partners would come to its aid in case of a violation.",

      "\"Of course, we understand the importance of America, and we are grateful for all the support we've received from the United States,\" Zelenskyy said Monday. \"There has not been a day when we haven't felt gratitude. It's gratitude for the preservation of our independence \u2013 our resilience in Ukraine is based on what our partners are doing for us \u2013 and for their own security.

      "\"This is not a moment for more talk. It's time to act,\" Starmer said after the gathering with his fellow European leaders on Sunday. \"Time to step up and lead and to unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace.\"",

      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday that \"the Kyiv regime and Zelenskyy do not want peace,\" adding that the clash between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy, \"demonstrated how difficult it will be to reach a settlement trajectory around Ukraine.\"",
      "\"It is very important that someone forces Zelenskyy himself to change his position,\" Peskov said. \"Someone has to make Zelenskyy want peace. If the Europeans can do it, they should be honored and praised.\"",
      "In the meantime, Russia has continued hammering Ukraine with deadly airstrikes. More than 80 explosive drones were launched at Ukraine overnight, killing at least eight people, including a 7-year-old child, CBS News' partner network BBC News reported Monday.",
      "Zelenskyy said Sunday that Ukraine was still willing to sign a minerals deal with the Trump administration which would grant the U.S. access to Ukraine's prized natural resources. He had been expected to sign the deal during his visit to Washington last week, but never committed to it in advance as it was unclear whether Ukraine was being offered security guarantees in exchange for its mineral wealth, and he was then asked to leave the White House early following the tense exchange with Mr. Trump.",
      "U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz, speaking Monday on Fox News, said it seemed as though Zelenskyy was \"not ready to talk peace.\" He said, however, that if the Ukrainian leader is seen as changing that stance, showing he \"has regret\" for the way things transpired in Washington, and is ready to sign a deal on Ukraine's minerals, he wouldn't rule out Kyiv and Washington reaching an agreement. He even suggested it could come together in time for Mr. Trump to announce a deal when he delivers a national address on Tuesday night.",

    "story": [
      "Dutch police say they have cracked the case of the mysterious disappearance of a Brueghel painting from a Polish museum over 50 years ago. Authorities say the case was finally solved with the help of arts magazine journalists and a well-known art detective.",
      "\"Woman Carrying the Embers,\" also known as \"Woman Moving A Bonfire\" and painted by the Flemish-Dutch master Pieter Brueghel the Younger around 1626, vanished from the National Museum in Gdansk during communist times around 1974.",
      "Its whereabouts sparked numerous rumors -- including involvement by the Polish secret service at the time -- in a story worthy of a spy novel.",
      "The round painting, measuring just 6.6 inches, was thought to have disappeared forever.",
      "But the stolen painting is currently under lock and key at a museum in the Dutch province of Limburg, Richard Bronswijk of the Dutch police's arts crime unit said.",
      "\"We are 100% sure that it's the same painting that disappeared from the National Museum in Gdansk back in 1974,\" Bronswijk told AFP.",
      "\"Indiana Jones of the Art World\"",
      "Arthur Brand, a well-known Dutch art detective, said suspicions were first raised when journalists from the leading Dutch arts magazine \"Vind\" spotted the painting at a Dutch exhibition last year.",
      "Billed as \"not being seen for the past 40 years,\" the painting was on loan to the Gouda Museum from a private collection.",
      "\"A magazine contributor, John Brozius, did some research and stumbled upon an article on a Polish website with an old black-and-white picture,\" Brand told AFP.",
      "\"The article was about a theft that took place in Gdansk in 1974 in which two artworks were stolen: 'The Crucifixion', a sketch by Anthony van Dyck, and a Brueghel the Younger painting,\" he said.",
      "\"Although the people from 'Vind' were not sure, it looked pretty similar to the Brueghel on display in Gouda,\" Brand said.",
      "The painting depicts a peasant woman holding tongs with smoldering embers in one hand and a cauldron of water in the other, a reference to an old Dutch proverb: \"Never believe a person who carries water in the one hand and fire in the other\", or beware duplicity.",
      "The painting's value is unknown, but Brueghel the Younger's works generally sell for millions, according to the auction house Christie's.",
      "Brand, nicknamed the \"Indiana Jones of the Art World\" for his high-profile recoveries of stolen pieces, was called in for help.",
      "\"It's a match!\"",
      "Together with Dutch police, Brand investigated the identity of the painting, which in the meantime had been moved to a museum in Venlo, the southern Netherlands.",
      "Brand also scoured Interpol's database, which had put out a \"database alert\" for the Brueghel painting.",
      "\"I concluded that the painting listed by Interpol and the one on display was one and the same,\" he told AFP.",
      "\"We have checked and re-checked, including information on the back of the painting. It's a match!\" added Bronswijk.",
      "Dutch police have informed Polish authorities, who were expected to submit a request for legal assistance, Bronswijk said.",
      "Neither the Dutch museums nor Polish authorities were immediately available for comment.",
      "The theft was discovered on April 24, 1974, when a museum worker accidentally knocked the Brueghel off a wall.",
      "\"Instead of the original work by the famous Flemish painter, a reproduction cut out of a magazine fell out of the frame,\" stolen Polish arts expert Mariusz Pilus wrote in \"Arts Sherlock\" in 2019.",
      "Days after the discovery, a Polish customs officer who had reported the illegal export of artworks through the Baltic port of Gdynia, is said to have been set alight and killed, shortly before he was to be interviewed by police.",
      "Investigations into the customs officer's death and the paintings' disappearance were shut down shortly afterwards, Polish reports said.",
      "Dutch police are now investigating how the painting eventually ended up in a private Dutch collection.",
      "Brand said he hoped the Brueghel painting could soon be returned to Gdansk, \"to be put on display, in a museum, where it belongs.\"",
      "Brand's accomplishments include returning a Vincent van Gogh painting to a museum in 2023, more than three years after it was stolen.",
      "In 2022, he returned a Roman statue that had been stolen from Musee du Pays Chatillonnais in 1973. He also recovered Salvador Dali's \"Adolescence,\" a Picasso painting and \"Hitler's Horses,\" sculptures that once stood outside the Nazi leader's Berlin chancellery.",
      "The art detective in 2017 told \"CBS Mornings\" that\u00a0he's brokered deals\u00a0with terrorist groups, the mafia and a slew of shady characters in order to track down pieces on the black market.",
      "\"On one hand you have the police, insurance companies, collectors, and on the other hand you have the criminals, the art thieves and the forgers. So there are two different kind of worlds, and they do not communicate. So I put myself in the middle,\" Brand said.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 10:28:01 -0500",
    "summary": "A former doctor who's admitted sexually assaulting hundreds of children is facing likely new charges for abusing his own granddaughter.",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014 There was shock in the courtroom in western France on Friday as former doctor Joel Le Scouarnec admitted without any solicitation that he had sexually abused his own granddaughter. Le Scouarnec, 74, had been on trial for about a week by Friday, accused of raping or sexually assaulting 299 children, but his granddaughter is not among the alleged victims in the case \u2014 all of whom were his patients at the time.",
      "The former surgeon stood up and addressed the court just after his eldest son, whose name has not been used in the trial, gave evidence.",
      "\"This is possibly, almost certainly, the last time I will see my son, because I heard his anger and his distress,\" Le Scouarnec told the court in the town of Vannes, Brittany. \"I respect that anger, it is well-founded. Yes, I admit to having abused my granddaughter, his daughter.\"",
      "He then turned to his son and said, \"forgive me.\"",
      "The trial was adjourned immediately after he made the statement. Later Friday evening, regional prosecutors confirmed that new charges would be brought against Le Scouarnec in relation to his courtroom confession.",
      "It was the latest in a series of emotional moments at the trial, which opened on February 24.",
      "Le Scouarnec is accused of raping or sexually assaulting 299 people, almost all of whom were children under his treatment at the time of the alleged assaults. By number of purported victims, it's the single largest trial related to alleged child sexual abuse in France and one of the biggest ever in the world. It has shocked France, coming on the heels of another mass rape trial involving a\u00a0man who drugged his wife\u00a0and brought strangers into their home to assault her for years.",
      "The public prosecutor handling Le Scouarnec's case has said the alleged assaults took place over 25 years between 1989 and 2014, in several hospitals in France's western Brittany region, where the doctor worked. The prosecutor said the average age of the victims \u2014 who are both male and female \u2014 was 11 at the time of the alleged abuse.",
      "During the first week's proceedings, members of Le Scouarnec's immediate family testified about what they knew regarding the allegations.",
      "His ex-wife, Marie-France Le Scouarnec, took the stand Wednesday and denied having had any knowledge of her husband's purported actions.",
      "\"There was nothing that could have made me think that. Nothing,\" she told the court. \"I never had an inkling. It's so huge, so unthinkable, inconceivable that my husband could have done all that.\"",
      "The alleged assaults came to light in 2017 after Le Scouarnec's neighbors' then-6-year-old daughter told her parents he had exposed himself and touched her through the fence that separated their yards.",
      "During a search of his home as part of that investigation, police said they discovered hard drives containing more than 300,000 photos and videos of child sex abuse. They also said they found notebooks with meticulous records of the alleged abuse of child patients.",
      "The doctor was convicted in December 2020 of sexually abusing four young girls \u2014 the young neighbor as well as a 4-year-old patient and two of his nieces. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison.",
      "In court on Friday, his eldest son spoke of how his world had fallen apart, and how he turned to alcohol for a while after those initial revelations. He said he and his father had been very close when he was growing up and he had only good memories of his childhood.",
      "Questioned last week about her husband's conviction for abusing his two nieces, Marie-France Le Scouarnec said she had known nothing about that, either. The next day, the former surgeon's sister \u2014 the mother of the two nieces \u2014 took the stand and accused the perpetrator's ex-wife of \"cruelty\" and \"lies\" in her testimony.",
      "The woman, Annie, whose last name was not made public at the trial, claimed Marie-France Le Scouarnec had known that her husband abused his nieces. Annie said the youngest of her two daughters confided in her in October 2000 that Le Scouarnec had sexually abused her. She told the court that her brother admitted the assault to her and said that his wife was aware of what had happened.",
      "The 2017 investigation was not Le Scouarnec's first brush with the law. In 2005, he was convicted of possession of child sexual abuse images after an FBI investigation into an international network. He was given a four-year suspended sentence for those crimes. The court did not order any psychological followup, however, or any restrictions on his work.",
      "During his career, Le Scouarnec worked in several hospitals across the Brittany region. Victims' associations have asked how he could have carried out so many alleged assaults without any alarms being raised.",
      "Investigators have said few of the children had any memory of the alleged assaults. For many of them, it came as a complete shock when police contacted them with evidence of what had allegedly happened, as recounted in the surgeon's journals.",
      "As the trial got underway on February 24, Le Scouarnec told the court he had \"committed heinous acts,\" and his lawyer said he admitted to carrying out \"the vast majority\" of the assaults of which he's been accused.",
      "\"I owe it to all these people and their loved ones to take responsibility for my actions and the consequences they may have had,\" Le Scouarnec told the court.",
      "Outside the courthouse that first day, a small group of protesters brandished placards denouncing \"more than 20 years of silence\" about the surgeon's past.",
      "The trial is expected to last four months. During that time, the 299 alleged victims \u2014 who are now men and women \u2014 will be called on to recount what they can remember of their interactions with Le Scouarnec, who faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.",

      "In 2022, Kaling sparked rumors that she was using Ozempic after she reportedly lost 40 pounds. However, \"The Office\" alum explained that her trim physique is due to lifestyle changes, including adopting a regular fitness routine and using portion control.",

      "\"There has been a noticeable trend of slimmer appearances on the red carpet. This could be attributed to a combination of factors, including the influence of social media, changing beauty standards, and the accessibility of weight-loss medications.\"",
      "The Academy Award winner, who was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2017, shed 100 pounds over seven years after changing her diet and committing to a regular fitness routine.",
      "While speaking with People, Bates noted that she lost 80 pounds before using Ozempic, which then helped her shed another 20 pounds.",
      "\"There\u2019s been a lot of talk that I just was able to do this because of Ozempic,\" Bates said. \"But I have to impress upon people out there that this was hard work for me, especially during the pandemic. It\u2019s very hard to say you\u2019ve had enough.\"",

      "\"Secrecy, shame and stigma once surrounded GLP-1 medications, but that is starting to change as more people are getting on board.\"",

      "In November 2023, Osbourne told The Daily Mail that she had stopped taking Ozempic but was unable to gain weight.",
      "\"You can lose so much weight and it\u2019s easy to become addicted to that, which is very dangerous. I couldn\u2019t stop losing weight and now I\u2019ve lost 42 pounds and I can\u2019t afford to lose any more,\" she said.",

      "\"I realized I\u2019d been blaming myself all these years for being overweight, and I have a predisposition that no amount of willpower is going to control. Obesity is a disease. It\u2019s not about willpower \u2013 it's about the brain,\" Winfrey told People magazine in 2023.",
      "\"The fact that there's a medically approved prescription for managing weight and staying healthier, in my lifetime, feels like relief, like redemption, like a gift, and not something to hide behind and once again be ridiculed for,\" Winfrey said. \"I\u2019m absolutely done with\u00a0the shaming\u00a0from other people and particularly myself.\"",

      "The deadline for Congress to avoid a government shutdown is 11:59:59 p.m. ET on Friday, March 14. The House and Senate must figure out how to either re-up all current funding at existing levels for a short time period \u2013 or face a shutdown. The other option \u2013 which is utterly unrealistic at this point \u2013 is for the House and Senate to pass all 12 of the annual spending bills which run the government. The House approved several of these last year, but the Senate hasn\u2019t OK'd any of those bills.",

      "Congress finally approved a \"skinny\" stopgap spending package just before Christmas to keep the lights on. That was after adopting another interim measure to avoid a government shutdown last Oct. 1 \u2013 the start of fiscal year 2025.",
      "What does all of this mean? Well, for starters, Congress is already running behind funding the government for fiscal year 2026 \u2013 which begins this coming Oct. 1. Lawmakers are trapped on a vicious treadmill. That\u2019s because it\u2019s been years since Congress finished its bills on time. Congress didn\u2019t approve the final spending plan for fiscal year 2024 until April of last year, seven months and change after the deadline.",

      "But some conservatives are opposed to all CRs. Military hawks have yet to weigh in on the consequences of a CR, but those who support the military generally hate them. The reason? The Pentagon consumes about 55% of all money that Congress appropriates to federal departments and agencies annually. So a CR is disproportionately damaging to the armed forces. No department likes to operate under a CR because spending doesn\u2019t go up, but it\u2019s particularly troubling for the military since it enjoys the largest slice of federal dollars doled out by Congress.",

Yes, a \"budget\" may sound like the legislative vehicle to run the government, but it\u2019s not. A \"budget\" is a general, non-binding blueprint which lays out the prospective expenditures for all federal programs. That includes \"discretionary\" spending \u2013 which is what Congress allocates to run the government each year \u2013 and \"mandatory\" spending. That includes dollars which lawmakers green-lighted at one point for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Beneficiaries of those programs receive assistance based on qualifications. A big chunk of the mandatory spending pie includes interest on the debt. Congress doesn\u2019t draw up a bill to alter this spending each year, but it could, and that\u2019s where Republicans are eyeing cuts.",

      "Note that entitlements and mandatory spending comprise about 65% of every dollar spent by the government. Earlier, I wrote about how the Pentagon consumes more than 50% of discretionary spending. That\u2019s a pittance compared to what goes out the door for entitlements. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s such a challenge for Republicans to cut spending \u2013 and cut taxes \u2013 without blowing an even bigger hole in the already yawning deficit chasm.",

      "Here\u2019s the most important thing I will write in this column.",
      "The only reason Republicans want to develop a budget blueprint is so they can sidestep a Senate filibuster when it comes to advancing their final piece of legislation. It\u2019s about the math. Republicans only have 53 Senate seats. Sixty votes are required to overcome a filibuster. So while Republicans might be able to thread the needle and approve the plan with their narrow majority in the House, moving it through the Senate is tough.",

      "And don\u2019t forget that a government shutdown could sidetrack or delay all of this.",
      "That brings us to the debt ceiling.",
      "First, let\u2019s define the debt ceiling. It is a distinct issue from government funding and the budget frameworks lawmakers are now working on. The debt ceiling is simply a threshold as to how much red ink the federal government can carry at any one time. That figure is now around $36 trillion. A failure to address the debt ceiling could make the stock and bond markets go bonkers.",
      "President Trump tried to get Congressional Republicans to shoehorn an increase or suspension of the debt ceiling into the CR to avoid a government shutdown last fall. The president parachuted this demand into talks to fund the government at the last minute \u2013 even though Johnson and others had not heard anything about that request until two days before the deadline.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the debt ceiling could wind up in a spending measure or attached to another piece of legislation in the next few months. Some Republicans have never voted for a debt ceiling increase. A successful increase of the debt limit will likely need the assistance of Democrats voting yea on the floor. The numbers won\u2019t work out for House Republicans. Plus, Democrats would be necessary to break a filibuster on the plan, since Republicans only hold 53 Senate seats.",
      "President Donald Trump listens during a Cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025. (Pool via AP)",
      "The government technically hit the debt ceiling in January. But via a mechanism the Treasury Department calls \"extraordinary measures,\" the government can delay an actual drop-dead date for a few months. That means the true debt ceiling deadline probably comes in April or May.",

      "So there you have it. Four distinct fiscal issues facing Congress right now: government funding, a \"budget\" for the \"reconciliation\" process to avoid a filibuster, President Trump\u2019s policy agenda, and a race to avoid a debt ceiling collision.",
      "None are directly related, but yet all intertwined. The only thing Congress must do is fund the government and wrestle with the debt ceiling. And an imbroglio over those issues could sidetrack efforts to finalize the budget framework and move the president\u2019s policy agenda.",

      "3) Place a fraud alert or credit freeze: Contact one of the major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) to place a fraud alert on your file, which makes it harder for thieves to open accounts in your name. For stronger protection, consider a credit freeze, which restricts access to your credit report entirely.",
      "4) Be wary of phishing attempts and install strong antivirus: With personal details in the hands of cybercriminals, expect an uptick in targeted scams. Avoid clicking links or sharing information in unsolicited emails, texts or calls claiming to be from DISA or related entities.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "1) Beware of fake software updates: One of the most common infection methods is through deceptive browser update prompts. Never download updates from pop-ups or random websites. Instead, always update your software directly from official sources, such as the App Store or the application\u2019s official website. If in doubt, check out my\u00a0detailed guide on how to keep your device and software updated.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a one-time code sent to your phone. Use 2FA for all critical accounts, including email, banking and cloud services.",
      "3) Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links. Use a strong antivirus: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Your personal information is easy to find online",
      "You may wonder, \"How did they get my number in the first place? And if they have it, who else has?\" You\u2019re right. Anyone can easily find your phone number, name, address or date of birth online. All of this data, and much more, is publicly listed on\u00a0people search sites. People search sites, or public data brokers, display your data to anyone who\u2019s interested, including marketing companies and scammers building their next job scam campaign.",
      "Cybercriminals can also find this information in the databases of private data brokers. Private data brokers harvest personal information too but don\u2019t give access to their databases.",
      "However, many will happily sell a list of potential targets to the highest bidder, and your name is likely on this list already. Data brokers aside, a lot of us voluntarily give up personal information on all sorts of forms, forums, blogs and\u00a0social media accounts. Since the U.S. doesn\u2019t have a comprehensive federal law protecting personal data, anything that you publish online may eventually be shared and sold without your consent.",

      "1. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Consider using data removal services that help remove your personal information from people search sites and data brokers. These services can reduce your online exposure and minimize the risk of scammers finding your information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Be cautious of unsolicited job offers: Ignore unexpected messages about easy online job opportunities. Be wary of vague job descriptions like \"app optimization\" or \"product boosting.\"",
      "3. Verify the legitimacy of online tasks: Research unfamiliar platforms before completing tasks. Be suspicious of requests to use your own money or cryptocurrency. A legitimate potential employer will never ask you to pay for work opportunities.",

      "4. Protect your personal information: Limit sharing personal data on forms, forums and\u00a0social media.",
      "5. Don't click on links, and invest in strong antivirus software: Antivirus software helps protect your devices by monitoring your online activity, blocking access to malicious websites and preventing harmful downloads. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

If someone asks you to invest money to earn more, it's likely a scam. Returning to work in retirement can be a fantastic way to boost your income and stay socially connected.

      "According to the hacker, they obtained domain administrator privileges for Zacks' active directory, a critical network security component, allowing them to steal source code for Zacks.com and 16 other websites, including internal tools, along with user account data. The stolen information was then put up for sale on hacker forums, with samples offered for a small cryptocurrency payment to prove authenticity, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer.",
      "Further investigation confirmed the breach occurred in June 2024, exposing 12 million unique email addresses and other personal data. The fact that the attacker managed to gain domain admin access suggests a highly sophisticated attack, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in Zacks' network security.",

The leaked data includes email addresses, IP addresses, names, phone numbers, physical addresses, usernames, and unsalted SHA-256 hashed passwords.",

Alarmingly, 93% of the leaked email addresses had already been exposed in previous breaches, making reused passwords an even bigger problem. The use of unsalted SHA-256 hashes \u2014 widely considered outdated \u2014 only adds to the risk, making it easier for attackers to crack passwords and compromise accounts.",

      "1. Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0After a data breach, scammers often use the stolen data to craft convincing phishing messages. These can come via email, text or phone calls, pretending to be from trusted companies. Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "2. Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on accounts:\u00a0Enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if hackers get hold of your login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access your accounts without the second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone or email. This simple step can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive personal information.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the breach, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this breach, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Zacks Investment breach highlights just how real the threat of cyberattacks is for financial institutions. With millions of users affected and personal data exposed, the risks of scams and identity theft are higher than ever. The fact that Zacks hasn\u2019t said much about the breach only adds to the uncertainty for those impacted. As these types of attacks become more common, it\u2019s more important than ever to stay on top of your online security \u2014 use unique passwords, keep an eye on your accounts, and stay alert for any signs of suspicious activity.",

The team, led by Antonio Bicchi and Dario Farina, developed a method that integrates these postural synergies with the analysis of electrical signals from the nervous system. By decoding the activity of spinal motoneurons (the nerve cells that control muscle movement), they can predict the hand movements a user intends to make.

      "Microsoft Threat Intelligence has discovered a new version of XCSSET, a dangerous macOS malware that spreads by infecting Xcode projects, which are files used by developers to create Mac apps. While this malware is currently being seen in only a few attacks, it has been upgraded with new tricks to make it harder to detect and remove.",
      "One of the biggest changes is how the malware hides itself. It now scrambles its code in a more unpredictable way, making it difficult for security software to recognize. It also renames parts of its code to disguise its true purpose, allowing it to stay hidden for longer.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once it infects a Mac, the malware ensures it keeps running even after the computer is restarted. It does this in two ways. First, it inserts itself into system files that launch when the computer starts. Second, it replaces the shortcut to Launchpad, which is the tool used to open apps, with a fake version that runs both the real Launchpad and the malware at the same time.",

One of its primary targets is digital wallets, which are used to store cryptocurrency. If a user has a crypto wallet on their Mac, the malware can attempt to access and steal funds.",
      "It can also collect data from the Notes app, where many users store personal information, passwords and other sensitive details. If important data is saved in Notes, it could be accessed and sent to hackers.",
      "Beyond this, the malware can exfiltrate system information and files, meaning it can gather details about the Mac itself, installed applications and even specific files stored on the device. This could include work documents, saved login credentials or any other valuable information. Because XCSSET is a modular malware, meaning it can be updated with new capabilities, it may gain even more data-stealing abilities over time.",

Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",

Gone are the days when Macs were considered \"safe by default.\" Cybercriminals have leveled up, moving beyond basic adware to full-blown information stealers. They\u2019re swiping passwords, hijacking authentication cookies, intercepting OTPs and even emptying crypto wallets.

Following King Abdullah\u2019s meeting with Trump, Jordanian officials felt that the pressure had shifted to Egypt and other Arab states. \"The Jordanians were very happy with the outcome of the meeting with Trump. They feel that the pressure to accept [a] million Gazans is off them,\" Al-Omari said.",
      "At the same time, the broader political future of Gaza remains uncertain. Al-Omari noted that despite the ongoing reconstruction discussions, the primary concern for Arab leaders is how to navigate Trump\u2019s unpredictable stance on Gaza. \"Frankly, the main thinking in Arab governments right now is how to engage in a covert process with Trump to walk him back from this.

      "Former Presidents Obama and Biden publicly humiliated Netanyahu, according to media reports, and the Israeli leader, in sharp contrast to Zelenskyy, did not garner the same solidarity from many European leaders and legacy media outlets.",
      "Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs President Dan Diker\u00a0told Fox News Digital, \"The real question is why the international media, European powers and social networks were noticeably unsympathetic to Israel and its PM Netanyahu during the Obama and Biden administrations, dressing down and even humiliation of Netanyahu during and in between White House\u00a0visits, in contrast to the immediate and widespread international sympathy for Zelenskyy following his 100 mph head on collision with and excoriation\u00a0by President Trump and VP Vance?\"",
      "Dicker continued, saying, \"Broadcast around the world, we remember Obama\u2019s dumping of the Netanyahu-led delegation to the White House in 2010 and the Biden administration's overall maximum political pressure campaigns to force Israel to yield to American demands.\"",

      "Only a few major brands have vowed to hold the line on prices. \u201cIt is our intent as we sit here today to absorb those costs,\u201d Chipotle\u2019s CEO told NBC News when asked about tariffs this week.",
      "Some experts expect other businesses to think twice before asking customers to pay more, wary of what shoppers will tolerate. \u201cThe retailers will have to eat a little bit, the manufacturers are going to have to eat a little bit,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Chris Horvers recently told CNBC, adding that nonessential purchases in particular could prove more immune to hikes.",
      "Target and Best Buy, however, are looking to manage customers\u2019 expectations.",
      "No retailer is coming out and saying, \u2018Yeah, 2025 is going to be a fantastic year for us.\u2019",
      "Neil Saunders, Managing Director, GlobalData",
      "Both have had difficulties that predate Trump\u2019s return to the White House. The former has been struggling to capitalize on inflation-weary shoppers\u2019 appetite for savings, and the latter has seen customers hold off on gadget upgrades. Target said Tuesday that \u201congoing consumer uncertainty\u201d and weak sales last month will make for a bumpy road ahead, and Best Buy\u2019s stock plunged more than 14% Tuesday despite posting a slight rise in sales and better-than-expected financial results overall.",
      "Saunders said consumers are likely to see an immediate impact on perishable goods, much as Target has warned. Potential hikes in categories like electronics might be more delayed because some retailers have a buffer of domestic inventories that have already come through ports. But if the tariffs last, sellers of home furnishings, apparel and other items made fully or partly in the targeted countries will increasingly pass on those higher costs, he said.",
      "\u201cNo retailer is coming out and saying, \u2018Yeah, 2025 is going to be a fantastic year for us,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nervousness out there, and it does look as though this year might be a very middling year in terms of growth, and maybe a poor year in terms of profit.\u201d",
      "Markets tumbled Tuesday, extending a selloff triggered Monday after Trump confirmed that his latest tariffs were coming into force as planned and hinted at further ones on agricultural exports. The S&P 500 index was trading around 1.1% lower by midday Tuesday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid nearly 600 points, or about 1.4%. At least $3 trillion in value has been wiped out since Trump\u2019s election win jolted stock markets higher, according to Bloomberg.",
      "Barclays analysts said in a note to clients Monday that storm clouds were building on the economic horizon.",
      "\u201cWe think uncertainty (on tariffs, inflation, job cuts) is already weighing on business and consumer confidence,\u201d they wrote, citing Trump\u2019s announcement of an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods, on top of the 10% hike he implemented weeks ago, and his threat to slap a 25% tariff on Europe.",
      "Gauges of consumer sentiment have taken a post-election nosedive, and retail sales fell sharply last month. Mortgage demand has tumbled despite cooling rates for home loans. Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s each said last week that the largely still-frozen housing market has held back demand for renovations. And after a surprising recent jump in personal incomes, households reinforced their savings rather than juicing their spending, federal data showed last week.",
      "These and other signs suggest that all but the wealthiest consumers are holding off on big purchases and looking to keep their routine spending in check.",
      "\u201cConsumers are spending their savings, using more credit card debt, and the wealth and income gap is widening between higher-and lower-income earners,\u201d said Bea Chiem, retail and consumer managing director at S&P Global Ratings.",
      "Analysts say that a gloomier economic outlook can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, as businesses and consumers prepare for potential turbulence ahead.",
      "While the overall economy has entered the year in solid shape, inflation remains sticky and the job market continues to steadily cool. The annual pace of consumer price increases has bounced between 2.4% and 3.7% since June 2023, most recently clocking in at 3% in January, a full percentage point higher than the Federal Reserve\u2019s ideal level.",
      "\u201cOn the plus side,\u201d the Barclays analysts wrote, \u201chousehold wealth is still enormously high, and the jobless rate is still 4%. And while excess savings have fallen sharply, we estimate that they are not fully depleted.\u201d",
      "The economy \u201cis still unlikely to stumble into a recession,\u201d they said, \u201cbut the odds have definitely risen.\u201d"

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/economics/trumps-canada-mexico-tariffs-risk-higher-prices-cars-rcna194663",
    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 22:56:31 GMT",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose a 25% tariff on all imports coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico is expected to take a particular toll on the U.S. auto industry.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose a 25% tariff on all imports coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico will touch thousands of products across dozens of industries. But it is expected to take a particular toll on the U.S. auto industry, adding thousands of dollars to the cost of each new vehicle \u2014 with potential consequences including contributing to higher prices, falling sales and even cuts to manufacturing jobs.",
      "With millions of auto parts and vehicles flowing between Canada, Mexico and the U.S. each year, the tariffs are estimated to increase the cost of producing most vehicles in North America by $4,000 to $10,000, according to an analysis by Anderson Economic Group. Even vehicles assembled in the U.S. will face higher costs, because their parts are imported from Canada and Mexico and will be subjected to the new tariffs.",
      "\u201cIf I was a consumer and had my eye on a particular vehicle and I found it in inventory, I would buy it right away because the price could be significantly higher in just a month,\u201d said Patrick Anderson, head of Anderson Economic Group.",
      "At least some of those higher costs will likely be passed on to consumers, he said, since automakers are already operating on relatively thin margins. Car prices are at record highs, having increased 34% since 2019 to an average selling price of nearly $50,000. Used car prices could also increase if the supply of old cars goes down because higher prices encourage more Americans to put off upgrading their vehicle.",
      "Vehicles and their parts have been freely flowing between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico for decades as the automotive supply chain has become deeply interwoven. Cars made in the U.S. contain parts from Canada and Mexico, while U.S. parts are used in cars assembled across the border and later shipped back for sale to American consumers.",
      "\u201cParts travel back and forth very freely, and that\u2019s just part of the assembly process of a vehicle,\" said Sam Fiorani, an auto industry analyst at AutoForecast Solutions. \"A supplier in Ontario may provide parts to a factory in Michigan or Ohio and vice versa. It\u2019s how the business plan has developed over the last half century or more.\"",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick disputed the notion that the tariffs would lead to higher prices for consumers in an interview Tuesday on CNBC.",
      "\u201cTariffs do not, do not cause inflation,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cOne product can be more expensive and one product could be less expensive. China has the highest tariffs in the world. everything gets taxed in China, and they don\u2019t have inflation. In fact, they have deflation. India has the second highest tariffs in the world, they don\u2019t have inflation. So this concept is just people whining and complaining and not being truthful. The fact is, we need to protect America.\u201d",
      "Trump said he is putting the tariffs in place, in part, to pressure the countries into stopping undocumented immigrants and fentanyl from entering the U.S. via their borders. More than 107,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2023, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, with nearly 70% of those deaths from opioids, including fentanyl. Nearly all of the 21,900 pounds of fentanyl seized in 2024 was at the southern border, with just 43 pounds of fentanyl seized at the northern border, according to data from Customs and Border Protection.",
      "But Trump has also said tariffs will encourage companies to move production from Canada and Mexico to the U.S. In a post on social media Tuesday, Trump wrote, \u201cIF COMPANIES MOVE TO THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE NO TARIFFS!!!\u201d",
      "Moving more vehicle production to the U.S. could take years and come with higher costs for labor, materials, and healthcare \u2014 all factors that could also contribute to higher prices for car buyers.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons that a lot of them have sought to move production to Mexico is because labor costs are a lot cheaper, materials cost is cheaper, environmental costs are not as high, healthcare costs are an issue, as well,\u201d said Aaron Bragman, Detroit bureau chief for Cars.com. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cheap thing for these automakers to do and at the end of the day it goes back to the consumer, all that cost gets passed on.\u201d",
      "For automakers, higher costs from the tariffs could ultimately lead to higher prices that could cause consumers to put off purchases. That would, in turn, lead to a drop in the production of new cars and ultimately a reduction in jobs, Bragman said.",
      "\u201cIf people stop buying cars because they\u2019re too expensive, or they start delaying these purchases as they\u2019re getting too expensive that means cuts in production, that means they don\u2019t need as many people working in plants,\u201d said Bragman. \u201cAnd that has a knock-on effect. If you start to see plants not employing people, the local communities start to be impacted as well.\u201d",
      "The United Auto Workers, which has long opposed free-trade deals with Canada and Mexico said in a statement Tuesday that it supported Trump's latest action on tariffs, which it called a \u201cpowerful tool in the toolbox for undoing the injustice of anti-worker trade deals.\u201d (The union previously criticized Trump's tariff plans earlier in his administration.)",
      "\u201cWe are glad to see an American president take aggressive action on ending the free trade disaster that has dropped like a bomb on the working class,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk of these tariffs \u2018disrupting\u2019 the economy. But if corporate America chooses to price-gouge the American consumer or attack the American worker because they don\u2019t want to pay their fair share, corporate America bears the blame for that decision.\u201d",
      "Still, automakers have been warning that the tariffs could ultimately cripple their supply chains. Ford CEO Jim Farley warned last month that the threat of the tariffs was creating chaos in the auto industry and could have devastating consequences for American automakers.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be real honest, long-term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canadian border will blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we have never seen,\u201d Farley said at an investor conference last month.",
      "In Livonia, Michigan, AlphaUSA, which makes more than 200 million automotive parts a year for U.S. automakers, is bracing for higher costs as the tariffs ripple throughout its supply chain.",
      "While the company\u2019s parts are made in Michigan, some components to those parts, like the steel or wires, come from Canada. The company also ships to assembly plants in Canada and Mexico and buys some of its tools from Canada. It has already been notified by some suppliers that their prices will be going up as a result of the tariffs.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t imagine the tsunami that they\u2019re going to be under with these costs,\u201d said AlphaUSA president Chuck Dardas. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come to us, then we\u2019re going to have to deal with it. These suppliers that we have, unfortunately, if we don\u2019t do as they ask, they will stop shipping us, and the last thing we\u2019re going to do is let our customers down.\u201d",
      "High prices for auto parts and vehicles could also increase the cost of auto insurance if insurers have to pay more for repair parts and replacement vehicles, according to an analysis by S&P Global. Progressive CEO Tricia Griffith said on a conference call Tuesday that the insurer was closely following how the tariffs will impact prices and preparing to make adjustments for higher costs."

      "Director Bong Joon-ho is out with a new sci-fi film, \u201cMickey 17,\u201d showcasing his signature blend of drama and absurdist comedy.",
      "Directed and written by Bong, the film is an adaptation of Edward Ashton\u2019s novel \u201cMickey7\u201d and stars Robert Pattinson as an \u201cexpendable\u201d \u2014 a worker who takes on potentially fatal assignments during an expedition to a new planet, with the expectation of being cloned if he dies.",
      "Six years after the global success of \u201cParasite,\u201d and four Oscar wins, the new movie is true to Bong\u2019s style as it blends political commentary, satire and the grandeur of a space epic. The Korean director said this requires a delicate balance of tone.",
      "\u201cI believe that when the subject matter is serious or solemn, if it isn\u2019t laced with humor like a sauce, I just can\u2019t stand it,\u201d Bong told NBC News in Korean. \u201cLike sprinkling salt or red pepper flakes on a good meal \u2014 I absolutely need [humor] in order to make a movie.\u201d",
      "Bong said creating an English-language film presented a challenge when it came to injecting his absurdist comedy.",
      "\u201cRegarding language, I\u2019m much more comfortable shooting in Korean,\u201d Bong said. \u201cIf an actor suddenly does something odd on set, I can immediately adjust or throw in a new idea.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut doing this in English isn\u2019t nearly as easy. It\u2019s like, I do everything perfectly, but when a member of my crew bursts out laughing and I don\u2019t hear [what made them laugh], I get somewhat upset.\u201d",
      "He said his cast and crew are critical in helping him create film in a nonnative language.",
      "\u201cI make it a point to work with actors who can handle that kind of role, those who have a strong sense of humor and understand the nuances,\u201d Bong said. \u201cIn this film, I believe actors like Robert Pattinson, Mark Ruffalo, Toni Collette and Steven Yeun are all great examples of that nuance. Without their help, the humor wouldn\u2019t come together.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m fortunate to have excellent people around me, like [interpreter] Sharon [Choi] and at least one assistant director who practically acts as a producer. There\u2019s also Dooho Choi, a Korean American producer who speaks Korean extremely well. Having such people around me on set is invaluable. I rely on them completely during production.\u201d",
      "Bong shared his admiration for Pattinson, who he says picked up on the Korean culture quickly during their press tour.",
      "Fans on social media were quick to notice their sweet interactions, posting about their \u201caegyo,\u201d which translates to \u201ccuteness\u201d or \u201ccharm\u201d in Korean.",
      "\u201cI wondered where Pattinson learned [the finger heart], because Rob really seems to enjoy these kinds of things,\u201d Bong said. \u201cHe\u2019s good at it\u00a0\u2014\u00a0maybe someone in Korea taught him that this is what you should do when you go there. But I never told him to do it.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven at the Berlin Film Festival, after the screening in Germany, when everyone was clapping and cheering, I looked over and saw Rob saying to me, \u201cLet\u2019s do the heart,\u201d and so I did it too \u2014 especially since a renowned actor also wanted it. It\u2019s just so cute. I guess it\u2019s really fun.\u201d",
      "Despite the massive success of \u201cParasite,\u201d which earned over $250 million worldwide and won four Oscars, Bong said he was unfazed by outside pressure.",
      "\u201cNow I\u2019m 55, so I\u2019m past the age where I might get carried away, overly excited, or suddenly change my values,\u201d Bong said. \u201cTake Quentin Tarantino. He earned awards at Cannes and an Oscar with \u2018Pulp Fiction,\u2019 and his film became an internationally acclaimed independent hit. But his big breakthrough happened when he was around 31. I experienced such things in my 50s, so it didn\u2019t really shake my usual way of working. I just kept doing what I\u2019d always done.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just a film director \u2014 a filmmaker \u2014 with a desire to make films that are a bit unique. I hope I continue to do interesting, unique and distinctive work without any pressure to be a trendsetter.\u201d"

      "That garden and much of her mother\u2019s home are now covered in ash and soot after the Eaton Fire ripped through Altadena on Jan. 7, destroying more than 9,000 residences in the foothill community north of downtown Los Angeles. At least 17 people died, and thousands more were displaced.",
      "Cowart\u2019s childhood house survived the flames but is surrounded by charred homes and razed businesses near what used to be Altadena\u2019s bustling business corridor. The neighborhood off Lake Avenue sustained some of the worst damage in one of two major fires that swept through Los Angeles County in January.",
      "The Eaton and Palisades fires displaced about 150,000 residents, and many remain in rentals and hotel rooms nearly two months later. Survivors whose homes are standing face ballooning smoke remediation and restoration costs, as well as insurance companies that are lowballing payouts even though some offer smoke damage coverage.",
      "NBC News spoke with seven homeowners whose houses survived the fires. Six of them paid for smoke damage coverage through insurance, and one did not have the option through the state\u2019s insurer of last resort.",
      "Still reeling from the destruction, they now face tens of thousands of dollars in costs or more to deep clean and remediate remaining toxins inside their homes. They anticipate being displaced for months as they begin rebuilding.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really tricky being in a home that did not burn down,\u201d Cowart said. \u201cThere\u2019s such a gray area with insurance thinking, \u2018Just wipe everything down and it\u2019ll be back the way it used to be.\u2019 But it\u2019s like, 'No, I\u2019ve got soot and ash that I can see with my eyes.'\u201d",
      "The insurance industry has long been fraught in California, where wildfires are getting bigger and deadlier every year. Major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies or are refusing to renew existing ones to offset skyrocketing costs across much of the state.",
      "Residents were blindsided last year when State Farm, California\u2019s largest insurer, announced it would drop coverage for 72,000 houses and apartments. It blamed costs associated with inflation, catastrophe exposure, reinsurance and regulations for its need to protect its bottom line.",
      "On Friday afternoon, Altadena resident Andrea-Marie Stark emerged from a State Farm information tent frustrated by the lack of progress in getting her remediation estimate approved. Service was scheduled to start Monday on her three-bedroom, two-bathroom ranch-style house facing Eaton Canyon, where the fire was first reported.",
      "But State Farm had not yet approved the estimate, which ranged from $80,000 to $100,000 to pull insulation from the walls, remove harmful particles from all surfaces and replace furniture, clothing and appliances exposed to excessive smoke and ash.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to lose my place in line,\u201d Stark said of the approval delay. \u201cAnd then I could lose a place to live.\u201d",
      "Stark\u2019s house is one of several that survived the inferno on her block, but its proximity to the flames meant everything inside was coated with a thick layer of soot. Christmas decorations turned gray in the ash, and her clothing has the strong odor of smoke.",
      "A charred smoky smell lingers on Stark's street. A neighboring house has been razed to its foundation, with only the chimney left standing. In the distance, green moss and leaves sprout amid the burned branches and fallen limbs of Eaton Canyon.",
      "Stark and her husband evacuated to a friend\u2019s home the night of the fire after they secured their four rabbits, five chickens, three cats, a dog and a horse in their crates. They have been jumping from friend\u2019s home to friend\u2019s home ever since. They hoped to return to Altadena by mid-March after having booked a smoke remediation company that said it could complete the work quickly.",
      "But State Farm had not responded to her claim for two weeks, and she worried she would need to pay for the remediation herself, plus rent if her appointment had to be rescheduled.",
      "In an emailed statement, State Farm said it is \u201ccommitted to paying what we owe, promptly, courteously, and efficiently.\u201d As of Feb. 26, it has received more than 11,750 fire and auto claims related to the fires and paid nearly $2.2 billion to customers, it said.",
      "To cope with the anxiety associated with surviving a catastrophic event, Stark and her husband started a Monday night support group for residents whose homes are still standing. It is a way for people to speak openly about what few others can understand.",
      "\u201cSafeness is an internal feeling. Safety is external, and they\u2019re both ruptured right now,\u201d said Stark, a trauma-trained counselor. \u201cI don\u2019t want to express this to someone without a home, you know, because I don\u2019t want to disrespect their experience and make them think that I\u2019m not grateful. That\u2019s called survivor\u2019s guilt.\u201d",
      "The smell in Marcie Habell\u2019s Altadena home nauseates her. A remediation company recommended taking it down to the studs to fully restore it. She cannot imagine returning to it right now, let alone sitting on her fabric couch or using any of her towels or linens.",
      "\u201cI can be in my house for less than five minutes,\" said Habell, whose home is one of just two standing on her block. \"It\u2019s insane that it happened, and then on top of it, the way that insurance is behaving just compounds the tragedy.\u201d",
      "She has been quoted upward of $22,000 just for toxicity testing, and she expects rent could run $4,000 to $4,500 a month. That's on top of paying her mortgage if her insurance company does not agree to cover the full cost, she said.",
      "\u201cWe are getting zero guidance from anyone for those of us who happen to have a standing home and are surrounded by the apocalypse,\u201d she said.",
      "Michael Sollner, California's deputy insurance commissioner, said in a statement that \"smoke damage is real and insurance companies must investigate claims properly, not deny them outright or pressure homeowners into accepting less than they are owed.\"",
      "More than 33,710 insurance claims related to the Los Angeles-area fires have been filed, and nearly $7 billion in claims have been paid, according to state Insurance Department.",
      "Cowart is handling her mother\u2019s smoke damage claim from Dallas, where she has been living for more than a decade. She flew to Los Angeles on Jan. 8 to pick up her mother from a friend\u2019s house and took her back to Texas. Cowart\u2019s mother, Faye Howard, has early onset Alzheimer\u2019s and struggles with being in a new place. But Cowart fears her old neighborhood is too toxic to return to.",
      "Initial estimates to remediate the Spanish-style two-bedroom, two-bathroom house started at $55,000. A landscaper bid $3,000 to restore the garden and remove potentially toxic soil. Including furniture removal and buying new clothing, Cowart fears, the cost to fully restore her mother\u2019s home and everything in it could quickly top $100,000. Howard\u2019s Allstate adjuster has not finalized their payout or agreed to pay long-term rent while Howard remains displaced, Cowart said.",
      "\u201cMy mom doesn\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t go home,\u201d Cowart said. \u201cJust on a basic human level, no one has told us what we\u2019re supposed to be doing.\u201d",
      "\"We continue to support California customers with wildfire claims and are working to resolve them with speed and care,\" a spokesperson for Allstate said in an emailed statement, adding the company has paid more than $750 million to California customers since the fires started.",
      "Rob Rhatt, an insurance analyst for Lending Tree, said it is \u201cfrustrating and not surprising\u201d that insurance companies are slow to handle smoke damage claims. Unlike damage from fires, which is structural and clearly visible, damage caused by invisible smoke does not neatly fall into most categories. It requires professional testing, cleaning and restoration with expensive outside vendors.",
      "Simply put, homes in high wildfire-risk areas are bad for business.",
      "\u201cThese catastrophic losses have really cut into their profitability,\u201d Rhatt said of insurance companies. \u201cIt\u2019s not just cutting into their profitability where they\u2019re making less money, but it\u2019s actually threatening their solvency to the point where they\u2019re losing money insuring homes in California.\u201d",
      "Pacific Palisades resident Ian Hardcastle said he never had the option to fully insure the 2,600-square foot home he shared with his wife and 14-month-old child near Temescal Gateway Park, where the Palisades Fire sparked.",
      "After they bought their house in 2021, he signed up for the California FAIR Plan, which provides coverage for those who cannot obtain insurance from private companies, and hoped any wildfires would stay tucked in the mountains and canyons, as they had historically.",
      "But on Jan. 7, a wind-driven inferno ripped through the state park behind his house and devastated the surrounding neighborhood. His home was overwhelmed with billowing smoke and toxic ash for several days. Hardcastle can stand to be inside for only a few minutes at a time.",
      "His adjuster quoted $1,826 for remediation, but a $5,000 deductible means Hardcastle will receive no payout for work that could cost much more.",
      "\"This, this little plot of land was our special happy place, so we're happy it's still here,\" Hardcastle said Thursday as he toured his property. \"We want to come back, but again, we don't know when that will be.\""

    "summary": "An operation in Northern California led to arrests and removals of people regardless of citizenship or status, a recent lawsuit against Homeland Security and Border Patrol alleges.",
    "story": [
      "In early January, as the days of the Biden administration wound down and the Trump era loomed, five dozen Border Patrol agents deployed to predominantly Latino Kern County, 300 miles from the California-Mexico border, and began what they say was a targeted search for criminal immigrants.",
      "But attorneys for some who were subjected to their tactics that week said it was a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d targeting people of a certain skin color, regardless of citizenship and status. In a lawsuit filed on Feb. 26, they allege that agents abused their power, made arrests without warrants and used trickery to get people to agree to leave the country. These actions left the region shaken, they said.",
      "\u201cThey stopped us because we look Latino or like farmworkers, because of the color of our skin. It was unfair,\u201d Maria Guadalupe Hernandez Espinoza, 46, a grandmother, said in a statement.",
      "Hernandez Espinoza, who was arrested on Jan. 7 after working her shift at a tomato greenhouse, is one of at least 40 people who were removed from the country under what is known as voluntary departure, the ACLU states in its complaint.",
      "On Jan. 8, agents arrested Ernesto Campos Gutierrez, 44, a U.S. citizen and 20-year Bakersfield, California, resident, the lawsuit states. He was on his way to a gardening job when agents blocked his truck, slashed his tires, dragged a passenger from the truck and arrested them, the complaint adds. They accused Campos Gutierrez of alien smuggling and held him for four hours, according to the lawsuit filed by United Farm Workers and five others.\u00a0He was not deported.",
      "\"This was a fishing expedition, in which Border Patrol didn't target any particular people, used racial profiling and swept through the community,\" Bree Bernwanger, a senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Northern California, told NBC News.",
      "Later that same day, Border Patrol agents pulled over Yolanda Aguilera Martinez, 56, a lawful permanent resident \u201cfor no discernible reason,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. A 45-year-old Kern County resident, Aguilera Martinez showed her California driver\u2019s license. Border Patrol ordered her out of the car, threw the mother and grandmother to the ground, handcuffed her and arrested her, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "While she was being held in the back of an SUV, an agent allowed her to call someone to send a photo of her legal residency card. After he scanned it, he told her \u201cget the f--- out of here,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",
      "The arrests were carried out 300 miles from the California-Mexico border, well beyond the 100 air miles from the border that Border Patrol has claimed as the zone where it can conduct warrantless searches.",
      "The Los Angeles Times, citing three former Biden administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, reported last week that El Centro sector Border Patrol chief agent Gregory Bovino \"went rogue\" with the operation and did it without knowledge of higher-ups.",
      "Asked for comment, Customs and Border Protection, which includes Border Patrol, emailed a response attributed to a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson that said Border Patrol enforcement actions are \u201chighly targeted.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen we discover any alleged or potential misconduct, we immediately refer it for investigation and cooperate fully with any criminal or administrative investigations,\u201d the spokesperson also said.",
      "The statement did not mention the allegations in the lawsuit nor whether Bovino's role in the arrests was under investigation. Jaime Ruiz, a CBP spokesperson, said the agency does not comment on pending litigation.",
      "Bovino touted the arrests in Kern County on social media. His posts highlight those arrested with criminal backgrounds and include one that states that Border Patrol agents in that jurisdiction, known as a sector, \"go the extra mile \u2014 or 500 of them ...,\" a reference to the reach of its jurisdiction.",
      "In a statement last month, Bovino said that sector's responsibility stretches from the border \"all the way to the Oregon line.\"",
      "Shook the Central Valley 'to the core'",
      "The Border Patrol stated that 60 agents arrested 78 people \u2014 all were unlawfully present in the U.S. \u2014 in the three-day January operation. Those arrested included someone convicted of raping an 8-year-old girl and someone wanted on a warrant for a sex offense against a child. Other offenses included weapons charges, marijuana or other drug possession and drunk driving convictions, among other crimes, the agency said.",
      "But attorneys said the arrests have had wider impact, including among their clients, some of whom had no criminal convictions and were expelled. The agents\u2019 actions \u201chave shaken the Central Valley to its core,\u201d the attorneys stated referring to the California region.",
      "\"The level of trauma is very high. There are people \u2014 who were detained, shipped off to El Centro and then removed from the country \u2014 who had minor children who they were responsible for,\" said Ajay Krishnan, an attorney with Keker, Van Nest & Peters LLP, which is representing some of the defendants.",
      "Plaintiffs are also being represented by American Civil Liberties Foundations of Northern California, Southern California, and San Diego and Imperial counties.",
      "A person can agree, by signing appropriate documents, to a \u201cvoluntary departure.\u201d By doing so, the person avoids a deportation order and preserves the possibility of re-entering the country legally at a future time.",
      "But the person also risks being prohibited from applying for legal re-entry for several years, depending on how long they were in the U.S. without legal status and other factors.",
      "In several cases, the lawsuit alleges, agents told people to sign electronic pads without allowing them to see the document, failed to tell them of the possible consequences of voluntarily leaving the U.S., or didn\u2019t show or read them the document in their language. In some cases, according to the plaintiffs, agents told people they were signing for some other purpose or they pressured them into signing with threats of longer imprisonment or by subjecting them to difficult conditions and keeping them isolated.",
      "Juan Vargas Mendez, a 20-year resident of Kern County who is  married to a U.S. citizen and has no criminal history, was among those deported. Vargas Mendez, 37, was arrested while on his way from a ranch where he's worked for 10 years. According to the lawsuit, agents took his nasal spray that helps him breathe when he arrived at the El Centro holding facility and he was tricked into signing an agreement to voluntarily leave the country.",
      "The lawsuit accuses the agents of violating\u00a0the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights to protection from detention without a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the country illegally and from arrest without a warrant.",
      "\u201cThe person\u2019s perceived race, ethnic background or occupation cannot justify a detentive stop. Nor can a person\u2019s refusal to answer voluntary questions,\u201d the lawsuit states.",
      "The lawsuit also alleges the agents violated the due process protections of the Fifth Amendment. Agents should not have expelled any of those they arrested or detained through \u201cvoluntary departure\u201d unless those people knowingly and voluntarily waived their right to an immigration hearing, lawyers stated in the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cWhen Border Patrol left Ms. Hernandez Espinoza in Mexicali, an agent gave her a copy of the document she had signed the day before,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cIt was the first time Ms. Hernandez Espinoza saw that her signature was on a document purporting to agree to voluntary departure.\""

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pediatricians-walk-delicate-line-parents-measles-vaccination-debate-rcna194226",
    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 22:44:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Pediatricians are trying to manage anxious parents begging for early measles vaccinations and those who refuse the shot, leading to delicate discussions.",
    "story": [
      "One mom told her pediatrician she was skipping a checkup for her 4-month-old because she was afraid the baby would catch measles from the doctor\u2019s office before he could be vaccinated \u2014 even though there were no cases reported in the area. Another parent said he was refusing to inoculate his 1-year-old because he didn\u2019t want to \u201cexperiment\u201d on his child.",
      "These and other recent discussions about measles vaccinations at Dr. Alex Cvijanovich\u2019s Albuquerque, New Mexico, pediatric practice have been fraught since the highly contagious virus started making national headlines \u2014 and they\u2019re only getting more challenging.",
      "\u201cThe people who are willing, are willing to give it early,\u201d said Cvijanovich, who is also a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cBut the people who have dug in their heels, it just becomes a more frustrating conversation.\u201d",
      "As virus cases rise and the United States recorded its first measles death in a decade, pediatricians are in a dilemma. How do they convey the seriousness of the virus to vaccine-skeptical parents while also quelling the anxieties of families who want to immunize their newborns but can\u2019t yet?",
      "It\u2019s a delicate balancing act, according to six doctors in practices from West Virginia to Washington state. The measles, mumps and rubella vaccination has a proven track record against the highly contagious disease, with two doses of the shot 97% effective against measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Decades of studies have shown it to be safe and have refuted false claims that it is linked to autism.",
      "The measles outbreak so far has been concentrated in West Texas. But it comes at a pivotal moment for the country: Vaccine hesitancy, on the uptick for years, accelerated during the Covid pandemic. And now misinformation about vaccines has been spreading, fueled in part by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who led a large anti-vaccine advocacy group before becoming head of Health and Human Services last month. Shortly after his confirmation, Kennedy vowed to investigate the schedule for childhood vaccines that prevent dangerous diseases like measles.",
      "Pediatricians say they\u2019re seeing a lot of fear, both from parents who trust vaccinations and those who don\u2019t, and they worry the anxiety from both sides will create confusion that will hamper public health efforts. The death of an unvaccinated child in Texas last month has not been enough to sway everyone to immunize their children, and pediatricians are worried more kids will get sick.",
      "\u201cI feel like this is still snowballing,\u201d said Dr. Lesley Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, Texas. \u201cI think we still have a lot of work to do, to be very honest with you.\u201d",
      "The CDC recommends administering the first MMR shot at around age 1 and the second at ages 4 to 6. In cases where an infant has been exposed to measles or is traveling to a known outbreak area, pediatricians can administer a dosage as early as 6 months old \u2014 something some parents have pleaded for as more measles cases are reported.",
      "Most children in the United States receive their MMR vaccinations on schedule, with nearly 93% receiving the shots by kindergarten, according to the CDC.",
      "But in West Texas, where the measles outbreak is concentrated with at least 159 reported cases, vaccination rates are significantly lower. In Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, the immunization exemption rate was more than 17% for the 2023-2024 school year, according to health department data.",
      "Experts say that at least 95% of a community must be vaccinated to protect against a measles outbreak.",
      "\u201cWe rely on herd immunity for measles prevention,\u201d said Dr. Christina Hermos, division chief of pediatric infectious disease and immunology at UMass Memorial Children\u2019s Medical Center. \u201cMeasles is so incredibly contagious that you only need one person flying in or traveling to a region to give a nonimmune person a case.\u201d",
      "The respiratory virus spreads rapidly because it is transmitted through droplets that can linger in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours, meaning an infected person doesn\u2019t have to remain in a room to contaminate other people. Measles causes a telltale rash, but an infected individual can spread the virus up to four days before the rash appears.",
      "Measles also causes fevers and red, watery eyes and can lead to complications such as pneumonia or, in rare cases, brain damage and death. For every 1,000 children who get measles, about one to three will die from respiratory and neurologic complications, the CDC says.",
      "The United States declared measles eliminated in 2000, despite some cases being reported since.",
      "Pediatricians now fear the country could backslide in its containment efforts, especially because Kennedy has long criticized childhood vaccinations.",
      "As the measles outbreak has unfolded under his watch, he has not urged widespread vaccination, drawing ire from health experts and politicians. In an op-ed published on Fox News\u2019 website, he called the decision to vaccinate \u201ca personal one\u201d and wrote, \u201cAll parents should consult with their healthcare providers to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine.\u201d",
      "Dr. Elizabeth Meade, a Seattle pediatrician, said she finds it \u201cenormously concerning\u201d to have a vaccine-skeptic person as the nation\u2019s health secretary.",
      "\u201cI think there is this real sense among people in the United States that they are not at risk for these diseases, especially if they\u2019re not traveling outside of the U.S.,\u201d said Meade, who is also an American Academy of Pediatrics spokesperson. \u201cUnfortunately, it is just not true.\u201d",
      "Some parents who once supported immunization have since changed their minds.",
      "\u201cI see incredibly intelligent people coming in,\u201d said Hermos, who in addition to being an infectious diseases doctor is an associate professor of pediatrics at UMass Chan Medical School. \u201cTheir child has a full vaccination record, and then they\u2019re due for their next one, and they\u2019re completely convinced that they\u2019re making a decision between two potentially harmful things for their kids, like, \u2018I could potentially harm them with this vaccine versus I could potentially harm them with this disease of the vaccine.\u2019\u201d",
      "In Morgantown, West Virginia, pediatrician Dr. Lisa Costello has found that acknowledging the common ground she has with vaccine-hesitant parents is helpful.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s coming from the space that they\u2019re trying to do what\u2019s best for their child that they love, and it\u2019s a matter of having those conversations and sharing from the medical literature we have on this,\u201d said Costello, an assistant professor of pediatrics at West Virginia University.",
      "But it\u2019s keeping some parents of newborns home out of fear that, because others in the practice might not be vaccinating their children regularly, their tiny babies who are too young to get the MMR shot could be at risk.",
      "The doctors said there are steps that parents can take to protect their children if they are too young to get the vaccination, such as asking the adults who spend time near their kids if they are vaccinated themselves; asking at their day care if all children who are eligible for vaccinations have been immunized; and not being around anyone who is or recently was sick. They also recommended bringing up early vaccination with their pediatrician.",
      "\u201cThere are those folks now that are calling that are anxious about it and want to get it even earlier than the recommended schedule,\u201d said Dr. Steven Abelowitz, medical director of Ocean Pediatrics in Orange County, California. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to do it after six months, but make sure the insurance covers it and it\u2019s not out of pocket.\u201d",
      "In Texas, Motheral said her local health department has been giving free MMR vaccinations. She hopes more people will agree to receive them.",
      "\u201cIt is so sad that a disease that we once felt was eradicated in this country, and really still should be, is making a resurgence,\u201d she said. \u201cEven one death for measles is too many.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "California's attorney general on Monday announced the unsealing of an indictment charging 30 detention officers assigned to a Los Angeles-area juvenile hall with child abuse for allegedly allowing and sometimes encouraging so-called gladiator fights among youths.",
      "At the heart of the grand jury indictment is the allegation that officers stood by as children and teenagers at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall engaged in the fights, the attorney general's office said in a statement. The detention center is in Downey, about 13 miles south of downtown Los Angeles.",
      "The office of Attorney General Rob Bonta said there were at least 69 fights in the second half of 2023, with 143 children and teens between 12 and 18 years old involved. Some fights, Bonta's office said, resulted in physical injury.",
      "Officers, Bonta said in the statement, were allegedly \u201coverseeing \u2018gladiator fights\u2019 when they should have intervened.\"",
      "The defendants took advantage of the vulnerability of the victims and their own position of trust, his office said.",
      "\"Let today\u2019s charges be a warning for all those who abuse their power,\" Bonta said. \"The California Department of Justice is watching, and we will hold you accountable.\"",
      "The fights came to the attention of the attorney general and state investigators after video of one of the altercations was \"leaked\" in January 2024, Bonta's office said. Speaking to news media by video, he described the violence.",
      "\u201cThe footage, which was later circulated widely by the media and on social media, shows one youth in the detention center being attacked by a series of other youth who come at him one by one as detention officers stand by watching,\u201d Bonta said in video aired Monday by NBC affiliate\u00a0KCRA of Sacramento. \u201cThe officers look more like referees or audience members at a prize fight, not adults charged with the care and supervision of young people.\u201d",
      "Stacy Ford, president of the L.A. County Deputy Probation Officers Union, AFSCME Local 685, which represents the 30 officers in labor negotiations, said in a statement that the organization \"will do everything in our power\" to support the officers.",
      "\"Every American is innocent until proven guilty,\u201d Ford said. \u201cOur members are entitled to this same presumption of innocence and deserve to be treated with fairness and due process, just as they provide to those in their custody.\"",

      "\u201cDespite these challenges, our professional peace officers remain committed to maintaining the highest level of professionalism,\" he said. \"We will continue to advocate for the safety, rights, and integrity of our members.\"",
      "According to the indictment, each of the 30 officers is charged with felony child abuse under a California law aimed at those who enable child endangerment, with those convicted of the charge facing two to six years in state prison.",
      "One of the 30 faces an additional count of misdemeanor battery for allegedly using force and violence against an unnamed subject, according to the document.",
      "Three of the defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit a crime, according to the indictment. It alleges two of them allowed some of the fights, knew beforehand when and where they would happen, and told new detention officers to watch but not report the bouts.",
      "Prosecutors alleged the third joined the other two in allowing some of the fights, one of the which resulted in a broken nose for an unnamed victim.",
      "One of the three told new officers that nine fights on Dec. 22, 2023, in a unit of the juvenile facility, were an example of how the detention employees controlled the children in their care, according to the indictment.",
      "Twenty-two of the defendants were arraigned Monday. The rest will be arraigned April 18, the attorney general's office said.",
      "All the defendants have been placed on unpaid leave, the county's probation department said in a statement.

      "The Trump administration on Tuesday revised its guidance on probationary employment in the federal government after a judge ruled last week that the Office of Personnel Management lacked the authority to make hiring or termination decisions for other agencies.",
      "The new guidance clarifies that agencies, and not OPM, are the final word when it comes to performance-based personnel actions.",
      "\"Please note that, by this memorandum, OPM is not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees,\" the new guidance states. \"Agencies have ultimate decision-making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions.\"",

      "Senior District Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California ruled Thursday for a retraction of the initial\u00a0Jan. 20\u00a0memo, saying that OPM \"does not have any authority whatsoever under any statute in the history of the universe, to hire and fire employees within another agency.\"",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Congressional Republicans are again being advised against holding in-person town halls after several instances of lawmakers being berated by attendees went viral.",
      "The chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is the Hill committee that works to get Republicans elected to the House, told lawmakers in a closed-door meeting Tuesday morning that there were more efficient ways to reach constituents than in-person town halls, according to two sources in the room.",
      "The chairman, Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., compared the moment to 2017, when a series of GOP town halls made headlines after angry attendees confronted lawmakers.",
      "The committee's communications director, Will Kiley, said in a post on X that Hudson \"supports members reaching and helping as many of our constituents as possible, using technology makes this a heck of lot easier.\"",
      "\"Chairman Hudson opposes attention seeking Move On and Indivisible activists hijacking these events,\" he added.",
      "Later Tuesday, Hudson told reporters that \"in-person town halls are no longer effective because Democrat activists are threatening democracy by disrupting the actual communication at town halls.\"",
      "Progressive groups have previously pushed for their supporters to attend town halls, but it is unclear if those initiatives influenced the attendees who raised issues with the lawmakers to join the events.",
      "Separately, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Tuesday that House Republicans were encouraging members to \u201ccommunicate directly with their constituents\u201d in telephone town halls and small groups rather than open forums.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re professional protesters,\u201d Johnson said, though there is not evidence to back up that claim. \u201cSo, why would we give them a forum to do that right now? The best thing that our members can do is communicate directly, frequently, consistently with their constituents, and there are other avenues to do it.\u201d",
      "Hudson also claimed without evidence that the disruptions were from paid protesters. His and Johnson's cautions against in-person town halls are just the latest warnings by top Republican leaders about participating in the events, which give constituents the opportunity to ask questions and voice concerns.",
      "NBC News previously reported that House GOP leaders have urged lawmakers to stop engaging in town halls, according to a GOP aide. Party leaders have also suggested that lawmakers instead participate in tele-town halls or vet attendees, according to GOP sources.",
      "Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., faced strong criticism from attendees at a town hall at a Kansas hospital last weekend who were angry with the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "In videos obtained by NBC News, Marshall argued that DOGE employees had been vetted, prompting boos and jeers from the crowd. Later, Marshall argued that the audience has been \"fed so much information,\" prompting another outburst from the attendees.",
      "Shortly before the end of the town hall, one attendee criticized the job cuts, including the firing of veterans. Sweeping federal worker cuts have affected veterans, who comprise about 30% of the federal workforce, according to publicly available data.",
      "Marshall then left the town hall, citing other obligations. As he left, attendees booed and yelled that he had not completed the full hour he said he would stay.",
      "Rep. Keith Self, R-Texas, also faced criticism at a Saturday town hall. A video posted to X by the Collin County GOP showed attendees booing Self and chanting, \"Vote you out.\" Collin County GOP attributed the scene to Democrats, but the party of the attendees is unclear.",
      "Democrats criticized Republicans' cautions against in-person town halls.",
      "\u201cSo House Republicans\u2019 political strategy is \u2018see no families nor workers,\u2019 \u2018hear no protesters,\u2019 \u2018speak to no one\u2019 and hope everyone gets less angry at them when they rip away Americans\u2019 health care? Got it,\u201d Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Viet Shelton said in a statement.",
      "Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin took aim at Marshall's town hall as well, saying in a weekend statement that \"it comes as no surprise that Republicans like Roger Marshall are hiding from their own constituents, because Americans are rightfully furious about what's happening in Washington right now.\"",
      "President Donald Trump has also weighed in on the town halls, claiming in a Monday post to his social media site, Truth Social, that people were being paid to cause trouble, although there is no evidence to suggest that.",
      "Marshall later reposted Trump's comment, writing, \"can confirm.\""

    "story": [
      "Elizabeth Oyer\u2019s job as the U.S. pardon attorney is to run the process by which people apply for and receive clemency. A onetime federal public defender from Maryland, she is a nonpartisan advocate for second chances.",
      "That\u2019s why two statements from her in the past month carried so much meaning.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "One came after President Donald Trump appointed former federal inmate Alice Marie Johnson \u2014 who was once serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug crime \u2014 as his new \u201cpardon czar\u201d late last month. Oyer applauded the move.",
      "\u201cAlice is an inspiring and effective advocate, a wonderful and genuine person, and living proof that second chances make us safer and stronger,\u201d she wrote in a post on her LinkedIn page of Johnson, whose prison term Trump commuted in 2018 before pardoning her in 2020.",
      "But just over a month ago, Oyer sent a much different communication. In an email to U.S. attorneys across the country, she conveyed deep frustration after then-President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of 2,500 drug offenders, which he said was necessary in a justice system that disproportionately punishes Black and other minority offenders for nonviolent crimes.",
      "\u201cWhile I am a strong believer in the possibility of second chances through clemency, the process by which yesterday\u2019s action was carried out was not what we had hoped and advocated for,\u201d Oyer said in the Jan. 18 email, according to The Wall Street Journal.",
      "\u201cI understand that some of the clemency grants are very upsetting,\u201d the letter stated, according to the Journal.",
      "The comments from Oyer, who was appointed by Biden in 2022, were some of the most notable in a series of criticisms from victims, prosecutors and even other Democrats\u00a0 about Biden\u2019s pardon process in his waning hours in office \u2014 with one U.S. senator going so far as to say the episode merited an overhaul of the federal pardon process.",
      "\u201cI am proposing that we actually impose some guardrails on the president of the United States, requiring an explanation, at the very least, some explanation for why pardon has been accorded, and some notice to the prosecutors,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told a Connecticut NBC station.",
      "Days after Biden\u2019s clemency announcement, President Donald Trump enacted his own politically motivated action. On the day he took office, Trump pardoned rioters involved in the attack on the U.S Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The ability to pardon someone is one of the few areas where the president\u2019s power is completely unchecked. There\u2019s no constitutional mandate for a president to go through a certain process, and they\u2019re free to pardon any person \u2014 no matter the crime or whether it could put a potentially dangerous person back on the street.",
      "There have been plenty of calls to abolish the pardon power over the years, and presidents of both parties have used it to grant relief for friends, family members and donors.",
      "The back-to-back presidential clemencies by Biden and Trump leaned on politics, drawing intensive scrutiny of the process and its potential for abuse.",
      "While Biden hailed his extensive clemency as \u201can important step toward righting historic wrongs\u201d and boasted that he had issued \u201cmore individual pardons and commutations than any president in U.S. history,\u201d he only further inflamed some Justice Department officials, who were already angered over Biden\u2019s characterization of the agency as infected with \u201craw politics\u201d when he pardoned his son Hunter Biden.",
      "They then saw Biden\u2019s mass clemency as both rushed and careless, according to two people with knowledge of the events.",
      "As part of that move, only 10% of those granted clemency were Justice Department recommendations, according to one of the sources. Those who are recommended tend to already have been vetted to be sure that underlying violent conduct is not missed. There are some 6,100 people with active applications seeking shortened sentences or full pardons.",
      "Among those who benefited from Biden\u2019s action \u2014 drawing outrage \u2014 was an inmate named Adrian Peeler who was convicted in the 1999 murder of an 8-year-old boy and his mother. Peeler, 48, had served his sentence for the murder but faced more prison time for dealing crack cocaine. He was not due to be released from a West Virginia prison until 2033.",
      "Another was Lairon Graham, convicted of sex trafficking and trafficking fentanyl.",
      "At the time of Graham\u2019s 2023 plea deal, Trini E. Ross, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York, described Graham\u2019s crimes in stark terms.",
      "\u201cThis defendant not only sold dangerous and illegal drugs in our community, he used the addiction of vulnerable women to prey upon them and force them to commit sex acts for his financial benefit,\u201d Ross said in a statement. \u201cWe as a society cannot, and will not, tolerate this type of criminal activity.\u201d",
      "Biden\u2019s action means Graham\u2019s sentence was reduced from 22 years to 12\u00bd years.",
      "Danielle Sassoon, who resigned as the interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York after the Trump administration pressured her to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, also sharply criticized Biden\u2019s commutations. In a Feb 2. op-ed in The Wall Street Journal (before her resignation), she said it was \u201cdisheartening to see some of the most dangerous offenders released on the readily disprovable misconception that they are nonviolent.\u201d",
      "The frustration of many at the Justice Department was knowing that they have a backlog of thousands of requests for clemency \u2014 many of which officials saw as sympathetic \u2014 and watching Biden turned to his own agenda late in the game, according to one person familiar with the process, with Biden not making unfairly imposed lengthy prison terms a clemency priority until the 11th hour.",
      "\u201cIt was clearly rushed,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt was done with very little consultation with the pardon attorney\u2019s office.\u201d",
      "Further frustrating Justice Department officials were the pardons handed out to members of the Jan. 6 Select Committee, Dr. Anthony Fauci, former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, other members and aides of the House Jan. 6 committee, and Capitol and Washington Metropolitan police officers who testified before it. Biden timed the public announcement of those pardons for his last day in office \u2014 before one final strike: pre-emptive pardons for his family members, according to the person with knowledge of the process.",
      "A Biden spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "After the Biden moves, Trump compounded frustrations in the Justice Department by pardoning all Jan. 6 Capitol rioters, even after \u00a0his own vice president had said that those convicted of assault on police officers \u201cobviously\u201d shouldn\u2019t be pardoned. The department is now facing mounting challenges of another kind under Trump, including the demotion of prosecutors involved in Jan. 6 prosecutions who have been demoted to entry-level positions by Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia whom Trump appointed to lead the office on a permanent basis.",
      "Judges have made clear their displeasure at both the Trump and Biden pardons.",
      "\u201cNo \u2018process of national reconciliation\u2019 can begin when poor losers, whose preferred candidate loses an election, are glorified for disrupting a constitutionally mandated proceeding in Congress and doing so with impunity,\u201d Judge Beryl Howell, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said in January.",
      "Judge Gary Brown, of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, said that some of the Biden commutations \u201cspotlight the problems that invariably arise when a president\u2019s unreviewable pardon authority is deployed impetuously, resulting in careless execution of the president\u2019s directives. In this matter \u2014 involving sex trafficking, narcotics distribution and perjury \u2014 the grant of executive clemency seems inconsistent with its purported rational.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a Fox News interview, Johnson laid out what some of her newly created position entails, including looking for appropriate candidates for clemency. She stressed she would follow-up with those released from prison to be sure they receive appropriate support.",
      "Z\u00f6e Towns, executive director of FWD.us, an organization that advocates for criminal justice reform, said the rash of last-minute actions is precisely how the process is not supposed to work.",
      "\u201cThis should not be something we wait until the last gasps of any gubernatorial or presidential administration,\u201d Towns said. \u201cPeople should have a lot of chances to have their sentences re-examined, whether that\u2019s through parole boards that are meeting or judges that are doing second look sentencing reviews, and also clemency.\u201d",
      "Towns added support to Johnson becoming pardon czar, calling it \u201cextremely encouraging.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great that somebody with her experience is in the role, and it\u2019s also really great that it\u2019s a role that has been created this early in a presidential term, and we\u2019re hopeful that it can mean really good things to come,\u201d Towns said.",
      "Johnson\u2019s case first came to Trump\u2019s attention after reality TV star Kim Kardashian championed her as a candidate for clemency based on Johnson\u2019s exorbitant non-violent drug sentence.",
      "Johnson was in federal prison for more than 21 years after she was convicted in connection to a drug trafficking conspiracy. In 2018, she told MSNBC she did not dispute her conviction, only the length of her sentence.",
      "\u201cI believe that I deserved some time, I really do. But I also believe that that time should be just and fair based on the crime. You can\u2019t tell me that a non-violent, first-time offender should have been given a life without parole sentence,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cDo you really think I deserved the same prison time as the Unabomber? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s tapping of Johnson has drawn scorn from critics who accuse him of putting on a kind public face, even as he says drug dealers deserve the death penalty \u2014 something he repeated one day after he announced Johnson\u2019s appointment.",
      "Last month, at a Black History Month reception in the East Room of the White House, Trump praised Johnson and said he was empowering her to take a hands-on role.",
      "\u201cAlice, you\u2019ve been an inspiration to people, and we\u2019re going to be listening to your recommendation on pardons,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to find people just like you \u2026 It should not have happened. So you\u2019re going to look and you\u2019re going to make recommendations, and I\u2019ll follow those recommendations, OK?\u201d"

      "The American Bar Association this week rejected attacks on the court system and the legal profession, after billionaire Elon Musk used his X platform to call for the impeachment of judges who have overruled or delayed aspects of President Donald Trump's moves to overhaul the federal government.",
      "The ABA said in a statement that it would \u201cnot stay silent in the face of efforts to remake the legal profession into something that rewards those who agree with the government and punishes those who do not,\u201d calling for an end to efforts meant to \u201ccow our country\u2019s judges, our country\u2019s courts and our legal profession\u201d and saying that such attempts at intimidation \u201ccannot be sanctioned or normalized.\u201d",
      "Trump attacked judges whose decisions he disagreed with during his first term in office, as well as some of the judges who oversaw the four criminal cases against him during the intervening four years away from the White House.",
      "Now, with Trump back in the Oval Office and Republicans in control of both the House and Senate, the federal judiciary has paused or overturned some of the most aggressive measures implemented by Trump and Musk, who has repeatedly urged the impeachment of judges who help up Trump's measures.",
      "\"We are witnessing an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges!\" Musk wrote on Feb. 11.",
      "\"There need to be some repercussions above ZERO for judges who make truly terrible decisions,\" Musk added.",
      "\"When judges egregiously undermine the democratic will of the people, they must be fired or democracy dies!\" Musk wrote on Feb. 25.",
      "\"The only way to restore rule of the people in America is to impeach judges,\" Musk added.",
      "When a judge blocked a Trump order that paused refugee admissions, Musk posted that the judge was \"violating the will of the people.\"",
      "\"If ANY judge ANYWHERE can block EVERY Presidential order EVERYWHERE, we do NOT have democracy, we have TYRANNY of the JUDICIARY,\" Musk posted.",
      "The nonpartisan ABA did not explicitly name Musk in its statement, instead broadly noting, \"High-ranking government officials (appointed and elected) have made repeated calls for the impeachment of judges who issue opinions with which the government does not agree.\" The ABA cited two phrases \u2014 \"corrupt judges\" and \"corruption\" \u2014 that were used by or reposted by Musk and noted that those criticisms had been aimed only at judges who ruled against the government.",
      "\"We may disagree with interpretation of case law, but it is unacceptable to personally target judges just because we disagree with their ruling,\" the ABA statement read. \"We cannot have a judicial system where the government seeks to remove judges simply because they do not rule as the government desires. Considering the increasing physical threats to judges, these are clearly efforts to intimidate judges and our courts.\"",
      "The ABA's statement also noted that the intimidation efforts had also been aimed at members of the legal profession, noting that Justice Department attorneys and assistant U.S. attorneys had been \"the subject of personal attacks, intimidation, firings and demotions for simply fulfilling their professional responsibilities\" even though the Trump administration had \"espoused publicly\" that it wouldn't weaponize or politicize the Justice Department. \"The actions against Department of Justice employees belie these assertions,\" the statement read.",
      "They also referred to the government deciding to \"punish a prominent Washington, D.C., law firm because it represents a party that the administration does not like,\" referring to the Trump administration's targeting of Covington & Burling because of the firm's pro bono representation of former special counsel Jack Smith. Smith oversaw the two federal criminal investigations into Trump, one related to his handling of classified documents after he left the White House and another into his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results.",
      "\"We support the rights of people to advance their interests in courts of law when they have been wronged. We reject the notion that the government can punish lawyers who represent certain clients or punish judges who rule certain ways.\u00a0We cannot accept government actions that seek to tip the scales of justice in this manner,\" the ABA stated.",
      "\u201cThere are clear choices facing our profession,\" the statement continued. \"We can choose to remain silent and allow these acts to continue or we can stand for the rule of law and the values we hold dear. We call upon the entire profession, including lawyers who serve in elected positions, to speak out against intimidation. We acknowledge that there are risks to standing up and addressing these important issues.\""

    "summary": "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose a 25% tariff on all imports coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico is expected to take a particular toll on the U.S. auto industry.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose a 25% tariff on all imports coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico will touch thousands of products across dozens of industries. But it is expected to take a particular toll on the U.S. auto industry, adding thousands of dollars to the cost of each new vehicle \u2014 with potential consequences including contributing to higher prices, falling sales and even cuts to manufacturing jobs.",
      "With millions of auto parts and vehicles flowing between Canada, Mexico and the U.S. each year, the tariffs are estimated to increase the cost of producing most vehicles in North America by $4,000 to $10,000, according to an analysis by Anderson Economic Group. Even vehicles assembled in the U.S. will face higher costs, because their parts are imported from Canada and Mexico and will be subjected to the new tariffs.",
      "\u201cIf I was a consumer and had my eye on a particular vehicle and I found it in inventory, I would buy it right away because the price could be significantly higher in just a month,\u201d said Patrick Anderson, head of Anderson Economic Group.",
      "At least some of those higher costs will likely be passed on to consumers, he said, since automakers are already operating on relatively thin margins. Car prices are at record highs, having increased 34% since 2019 to an average selling price of nearly $50,000. Used car prices could also increase if the supply of old cars goes down because higher prices encourage more Americans to put off upgrading their vehicle.",
      "Vehicles and their parts have been freely flowing between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico for decades as the automotive supply chain has become deeply interwoven. Cars made in the U.S. contain parts from Canada and Mexico, while U.S. parts are used in cars assembled across the border and later shipped back for sale to American consumers.",
      "\u201cParts travel back and forth very freely, and that\u2019s just part of the assembly process of a vehicle,\" said Sam Fiorani, an auto industry analyst at AutoForecast Solutions. \"A supplier in Ontario may provide parts to a factory in Michigan or Ohio and vice versa. It\u2019s how the business plan has developed over the last half century or more.\"",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick disputed the notion that the tariffs would lead to higher prices for consumers in an interview Tuesday on CNBC.",
      "\u201cTariffs do not, do not cause inflation,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cOne product can be more expensive and one product could be less expensive. China has the highest tariffs in the world. everything gets taxed in China, and they don\u2019t have inflation. In fact, they have deflation. India has the second highest tariffs in the world, they don\u2019t have inflation. So this concept is just people whining and complaining and not being truthful. The fact is, we need to protect America.\u201d",
      "Trump said he is putting the tariffs in place, in part, to pressure the countries into stopping undocumented immigrants and fentanyl from entering the U.S. via their borders. More than 107,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2023, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, with nearly 70% of those deaths from opioids, including fentanyl. Nearly all of the 21,900 pounds of fentanyl seized in 2024 was at the southern border, with just 43 pounds of fentanyl seized at the northern border, according to data from Customs and Border Protection.",
      "But Trump has also said tariffs will encourage companies to move production from Canada and Mexico to the U.S. In a post on social media Tuesday, Trump wrote, \u201cIF COMPANIES MOVE TO THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE NO TARIFFS!!!\u201d",
      "Moving more vehicle production to the U.S. could take years and come with higher costs for labor, materials, and healthcare \u2014 all factors that could also contribute to higher prices for car buyers.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons that a lot of them have sought to move production to Mexico is because labor costs are a lot cheaper, materials cost is cheaper, environmental costs are not as high, healthcare costs are an issue, as well,\u201d said Aaron Bragman, Detroit bureau chief for Cars.com. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cheap thing for these automakers to do and at the end of the day it goes back to the consumer, all that cost gets passed on.\u201d",
      "For automakers, higher costs from the tariffs could ultimately lead to higher prices that could cause consumers to put off purchases. That would, in turn, lead to a drop in the production of new cars and ultimately a reduction in jobs, Bragman said.",
      "\u201cIf people stop buying cars because they\u2019re too expensive, or they start delaying these purchases as they\u2019re getting too expensive that means cuts in production, that means they don\u2019t need as many people working in plants,\u201d said Bragman. \u201cAnd that has a knock-on effect. If you start to see plants not employing people, the local communities start to be impacted as well.\u201d",
      "The United Auto Workers, which has long opposed free-trade deals with Canada and Mexico said in a statement Tuesday that it supported Trump's latest action on tariffs, which it called a \u201cpowerful tool in the toolbox for undoing the injustice of anti-worker trade deals.\u201d (The union previously criticized Trump's tariff plans earlier in his administration.)",
      "\u201cWe are glad to see an American president take aggressive action on ending the free trade disaster that has dropped like a bomb on the working class,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk of these tariffs \u2018disrupting\u2019 the economy. But if corporate America chooses to price-gouge the American consumer or attack the American worker because they don\u2019t want to pay their fair share, corporate America bears the blame for that decision.\u201d",
      "Still, automakers have been warning that the tariffs could ultimately cripple their supply chains. Ford CEO Jim Farley warned last month that the threat of the tariffs was creating chaos in the auto industry and could have devastating consequences for American automakers.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be real honest, long-term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canadian border will blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we have never seen,\u201d Farley said at an investor conference last month.",
      "In Livonia, Michigan, AlphaUSA, which makes more than 200 million automotive parts a year for U.S. automakers, is bracing for higher costs as the tariffs ripple throughout its supply chain.",
      "While the company\u2019s parts are made in Michigan, some components to those parts, like the steel or wires, come from Canada. The company also ships to assembly plants in Canada and Mexico and buys some of its tools from Canada. It has already been notified by some suppliers that their prices will be going up as a result of the tariffs.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t imagine the tsunami that they\u2019re going to be under with these costs,\u201d said AlphaUSA president Chuck Dardas. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come to us, then we\u2019re going to have to deal with it. These suppliers that we have, unfortunately, if we don\u2019t do as they ask, they will stop shipping us, and the last thing we\u2019re going to do is let our customers down.\u201d",
      "High prices for auto parts and vehicles could also increase the cost of auto insurance if insurers have to pay more for repair parts and replacement vehicles, according to an analysis by S&P Global. Progressive CEO Tricia Griffith said on a conference call Tuesday that the insurer was closely following how the tariffs will impact prices and preparing to make adjustments for higher costs."

    "summary": "An operation in Northern California led to arrests and removals of people regardless of citizenship or status, a recent lawsuit against Homeland Security and Border Patrol alleges.",
    "story": [
      "In early January, as the days of the Biden administration wound down and the Trump era loomed, five dozen Border Patrol agents deployed to predominantly Latino Kern County, 300 miles from the California-Mexico border, and began what they say was a targeted search for criminal immigrants.",
      "But attorneys for some who were subjected to their tactics that week said it was a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d targeting people of a certain skin color, regardless of citizenship and status. In a lawsuit filed on Feb. 26, they allege that agents abused their power, made arrests without warrants and used trickery to get people to agree to leave the country. These actions left the region shaken, they said.",
      "\u201cThey stopped us because we look Latino or like farmworkers, because of the color of our skin. It was unfair,\u201d Maria Guadalupe Hernandez Espinoza, 46, a grandmother, said in a statement.",
      "Hernandez Espinoza, who was arrested on Jan. 7 after working her shift at a tomato greenhouse, is one of at least 40 people who were removed from the country under what is known as voluntary departure, the ACLU states in its complaint.",
      "On Jan. 8, agents arrested Ernesto Campos Gutierrez, 44, a U.S. citizen and 20-year Bakersfield, California, resident, the lawsuit states. He was on his way to a gardening job when agents blocked his truck, slashed his tires, dragged a passenger from the truck and arrested them, the complaint adds. They accused Campos Gutierrez of alien smuggling and held him for four hours, according to the lawsuit filed by United Farm Workers and five others.\u00a0He was not deported.",
      "\"This was a fishing expedition, in which Border Patrol didn't target any particular people, used racial profiling and swept through the community,\" Bree Bernwanger, a senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Northern California, told NBC News.",
      "Later that same day, Border Patrol agents pulled over Yolanda Aguilera Martinez, 56, a lawful permanent resident \u201cfor no discernible reason,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. A 45-year-old Kern County resident, Aguilera Martinez showed her California driver\u2019s license. Border Patrol ordered her out of the car, threw the mother and grandmother to the ground, handcuffed her and arrested her, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "While she was being held in the back of an SUV, an agent allowed her to call someone to send a photo of her legal residency card. After he scanned it, he told her \u201cget the f--- out of here,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",
      "The arrests were carried out 300 miles from the California-Mexico border, well beyond the 100 air miles from the border that Border Patrol has claimed as the zone where it can conduct warrantless searches.",
      "The Los Angeles Times, citing three former Biden administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, reported last week that El Centro sector Border Patrol chief agent Gregory Bovino \"went rogue\" with the operation and did it without knowledge of higher-ups.",
      "Asked for comment, Customs and Border Protection, which includes Border Patrol, emailed a response attributed to a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson that said Border Patrol enforcement actions are \u201chighly targeted.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen we discover any alleged or potential misconduct, we immediately refer it for investigation and cooperate fully with any criminal or administrative investigations,\u201d the spokesperson also said.",
      "The statement did not mention the allegations in the lawsuit nor whether Bovino's role in the arrests was under investigation. Jaime Ruiz, a CBP spokesperson, said the agency does not comment on pending litigation.",
      "Bovino touted the arrests in Kern County on social media. His posts highlight those arrested with criminal backgrounds and include one that states that Border Patrol agents in that jurisdiction, known as a sector, \"go the extra mile \u2014 or 500 of them ...,\" a reference to the reach of its jurisdiction.",
      "In a statement last month, Bovino said that sector's responsibility stretches from the border \"all the way to the Oregon line.\"",
      "Shook the Central Valley 'to the core'",
      "The Border Patrol stated that 60 agents arrested 78 people \u2014 all were unlawfully present in the U.S. \u2014 in the three-day January operation. Those arrested included someone convicted of raping an 8-year-old girl and someone wanted on a warrant for a sex offense against a child. Other offenses included weapons charges, marijuana or other drug possession and drunk driving convictions, among other crimes, the agency said.",
      "But attorneys said the arrests have had wider impact, including among their clients, some of whom had no criminal convictions and were expelled. The agents\u2019 actions \u201chave shaken the Central Valley to its core,\u201d the attorneys stated referring to the California region.",
      "\"The level of trauma is very high. There are people \u2014 who were detained, shipped off to El Centro and then removed from the country \u2014 who had minor children who they were responsible for,\" said Ajay Krishnan, an attorney with Keker, Van Nest & Peters LLP, which is representing some of the defendants.",
      "Plaintiffs are also being represented by American Civil Liberties Foundations of Northern California, Southern California, and San Diego and Imperial counties.",
      "A person can agree, by signing appropriate documents, to a \u201cvoluntary departure.\u201d By doing so, the person avoids a deportation order and preserves the possibility of re-entering the country legally at a future time.",
      "But the person also risks being prohibited from applying for legal re-entry for several years, depending on how long they were in the U.S. without legal status and other factors.",
      "In several cases, the lawsuit alleges, agents told people to sign electronic pads without allowing them to see the document, failed to tell them of the possible consequences of voluntarily leaving the U.S., or didn\u2019t show or read them the document in their language. In some cases, according to the plaintiffs, agents told people they were signing for some other purpose or they pressured them into signing with threats of longer imprisonment or by subjecting them to difficult conditions and keeping them isolated.",
      "Juan Vargas Mendez, a 20-year resident of Kern County who is  married to a U.S. citizen and has no criminal history, was among those deported. Vargas Mendez, 37, was arrested while on his way from a ranch where he's worked for 10 years. According to the lawsuit, agents took his nasal spray that helps him breathe when he arrived at the El Centro holding facility and he was tricked into signing an agreement to voluntarily leave the country.",
      "The lawsuit accuses the agents of violating\u00a0the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights to protection from detention without a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the country illegally and from arrest without a warrant.",
      "\u201cThe person\u2019s perceived race, ethnic background or occupation cannot justify a detentive stop. Nor can a person\u2019s refusal to answer voluntary questions,\u201d the lawsuit states.",
      "The lawsuit also alleges the agents violated the due process protections of the Fifth Amendment. Agents should not have expelled any of those they arrested or detained through \u201cvoluntary departure\u201d unless those people knowingly and voluntarily waived their right to an immigration hearing, lawyers stated in the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cWhen Border Patrol left Ms. Hernandez Espinoza in Mexicali, an agent gave her a copy of the document she had signed the day before,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cIt was the first time Ms. Hernandez Espinoza saw that her signature was on a document purporting to agree to voluntary departure.\""

While Bradford\u2019s team investigates his murder, Sinatra has the public believe that the president died of natural causes.",

After changing his appearance to look like the librarian, he meets a woman who is unfulfilled with her life and offers her the wife\u2019s ID card as her own.",
      "When they are being scanned to go into Paradise, it shows that the two have taken the identities of Eli and Margaret Davis.",
      "Why and how did he kill President Bradford?",
      "While in the library, Collins gets knocked out by the librarian after he discovers the president\u2019s secret book with information about how to leave Paradise.",
      "After tying Collins up, the man confesses and admits that after entering Paradise he got comfortable and didn\u2019t go through with his initial plan to kill the president. But when President Bradford came into the library asking if he could make a mixed CD, the man says that his feelings of anger towards the president \u201ccame flooding back.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew I had to finish what I started,\u201d the man tells Collins, expressing that he wanted revenge for the people who died building Paradise and for them not being invited into the bunker.",
      "The man was able to kill the president by sneaking into his room at night and hitting him over the head with a large rotary drill bit that was seen on display at the library.",
      "While still conscious, President Bradford attempted to leave a sign for Collins by drawing an X with his blood on his cigarettes. As viewers saw earlier, one of the cigarettes contained a code that led to a library book with secret information about how to get out of Paradise.",
      "The man saw that the president was still alive and hit him over the head again, killing him.",

      "A 25% U.S. tariff on almost all goods imported from Canada and Mexico took effect Tuesday just after midnight, along with an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The three countries together accounted for\u00a0more than 40% of total U.S. imports last year and are also the top three U.S. export markets.",
      "China will impose additional tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods, its government said, while Canada vowed tariffs of up to 25%. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced her country would enact countermeasures Sunday in response to the U.S. tariffs, adding that they would include both \u201ctariff and nontariff measures.\u201d",
      "The new Chinese levies, which take effect on March 10, include a 15% tariff on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton and a 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, fruits, vegetables and dairy and fish products. Chinese state media had reported earlier that U.S. agricultural products would be targeted.",
      "China says that the U.S. tariffs undermine cooperation between the world\u2019s two largest economies and that they hurt American businesses and consumers, as well as international trade.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese people have never believed in coercion or intimidation, nor do we succumb to bullying and hegemonic tactics,\u201d Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cPressure, threats and coercion are not the right way to engage with China. If the U.S. attempts to exert extreme pressure on China, it is simply targeting the wrong country and miscalculating its moves.\u201d",
      "Lin also said that China had \u201ctaken strong measures\u201d to help stem the international flow of fentanyl, which President Donald Trump has cited as justification for the tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, and that the United States was using fentanyl as an excuse to wage a trade war.",
      "In addition to the new tariffs, China added 10 U.S. companies to its \u201cunreliable entity\u201d list and 15 to its export control list, mostly defense and intelligence firms with little exposure to the Chinese economy.",
      "Beijing is also filing a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization over the new 10% tariff, as it did in response to a previous 10% tariff that Trump imposed on Chinese goods starting Feb. 4.",
      "The combined 20% U.S. tariff on Chinese goods comes on top of tariffs Trump imposed during his first term that were maintained and in some cases sharply increased by President Joe Biden.",
      "Canada said it would move ahead with an earlier plan to impose 25% tariffs on 155\u00a0billion Canadian dollars ($107 billion) in U.S. goods if the U.S. tariff took effect as scheduled.",
      "Tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of goods will take effect immediately, while tariffs on the remaining $86.3 billion in U.S. products will begin in 21 days, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement late Monday. They will remain until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, he said.",
      "\u201cBecause of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cTariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term.\u201d",
      "Trump, who had been threatening tariffs against Canada and Mexico since November, had accused them of failing to stem the international flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs.",
      "While precursor chemicals for fentanyl are known to be shipped from China to Mexico, where they are processed into the deadly opioid that is then smuggled into the United States, Canada says it has virtually no role in the international flow of fentanyl.",
      "According to U.S. customs data, only 0.2% of the more than 20,000 pounds of fentanyl seized at the U.S. border in the 2024 fiscal year came from Canada.",
      "Trudeau said Canada had nonetheless stepped up its drug enforcement efforts, resulting in a further drop of 97% in fentanyl seizures from Canada from December to January, to 0.03 pounds.",
      "The tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which Trump issued in an executive order he signed Feb. 1, had been put on hold for 30 days after the leaders of both countries announced moves to tighten border security. They also include a 10% tariff on Canadian energy imports.",
      "U.S. stocks tumbled Monday after Trump said the tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go ahead as planned, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 650 points, or 1.48%, and the S&P 500 dropping 1.76% for its worst day so far this year.",
      "In Asia, Japan led declines in markets around the region with stocks falling almost 2%, CNBC reported. Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong were muted.",
      "Chinese leaders and lawmakers gather in Beijing this week for the country\u2019s biggest political event of the year, the National People\u2019s Congress, where the ruling Chinese Communist Party will signal its priorities and goals for the year, including its approach to the Trump administration.",
      "Though China spared U.S. agriculture in its response to the first 10% tariff, \u201cTrump\u2019s impatient tariff offensive may be changing the calculus\u201d and the U.S. farming sector \u201cshould start to feel the pinch,\u201d said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing.",
      "\u201cSounds like it\u2019s telling the U.S. that \u2018we\u2019re really going to hit you hard if you don\u2019t stop,\u2019\u201d he said in an email.",
      "In Canada, meanwhile, retaliation against U.S. tariffs could also extend to its individual provinces. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Monday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press NOW\u201d that Canada would \u201crespond like they\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d",
      "He said he was prepared to retaliate by cutting off the transmission of electricity from his province to the United States, as well as shipments of nickel, which \u201cwill shut down manufacturing because 50% of the nickel you use is coming out of Ontario.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry to the American people that your president has decided to do this,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI apologize, but he\u2019s giving us no choice.\u201d"

      "Abdalla, 44, has attended several pro-Palestinian rallies in the past and has publicly called for a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Addressing the crowds at the Jan. 18 rally, Abdalla said, \u201cTomorrow phase one of this ceasefire begins. It remains to be seen if the ceasefire will hold, or if the blood shed since it was announced augurs what it will become.\u201d",
      "In February, he was one of the signatories to an open letter written to the BBC by the advocacy group, Artists for Palestine UK, which criticized the broadcaster for pulling a documentary on Gaza\u2019s children.",

      "The force, it said, was \u201cendeavoring to halt public protest on the issue through harassment of those involved in the movement, and through increasingly draconian restrictions on demonstrations.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu railed against his critics and accused the media of working with the \u201cdeep state\u201d as he rejected the establishment of a court-appointed inquiry into the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.",
      "In a speech at the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Netanyahu, without providing any evidence, suggested the findings would be \u201cpredetermined\u201d and told lawmakers it was \u201cimportant and crucial to investigate in depth the events of Oct. 7 and what led up to it,\u201d but  thought a court-led probe would be biased.",
      "\u201cWhat do you think? That we\u2019re children?\u201d he shouted into a microphone as some his fellow politicians jeered and shouted at him during Monday night's debate.",
      "Israel\u2019s High Court of Justice ruled in December that Netanyahu\u2019s government\u00a0should hold a Cabinet hearing on whether to form a state commission of inquiry\u00a0to investigate the circumstances surrounding the Hamas-led attacks, looking at why the country\u2019s military was unable to prevent the deadly assault.",
      "But it has since agreed to requests from the government to delay updates to the court about its stance on the creation of such an inquiry.",
      "Lawmakers, including former war Cabinet minister Benny Gantz, have long called for a state commission to be set up.",
      "Banging on the podium in the Knesset, Netanyahu acknowledged that the \u201cpublic demands the truth\u201d about the Hamas attacks and he called for the formation of a commission that would \u201cinvestigate everything,\u201d including alleged leaks from Cabinet meetings and confidential parliamentary sessions.",
      "He went on to blast the media, accusing news outlets of  \u201cfull cooperation with the deep state\u201d and of creating \u201cscandals.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe cooperation between the bureaucracy in the deep state and the media didn\u2019t work in the United States, and it won\u2019t work here,\u201d he said, aping the rhetoric of President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly referred to the idea that clandestine networks operate within governments, acting to manipulate or control policy.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s rivals were quick to condemn his comments. Opposition leader Yair Lapid said the events of Oct. 7 would \u201calways belong\u201d to the Israeli prime minister, adding that \u201cthere was never a government here that had so many reasons to ask for forgiveness.\u201d",
      "Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the debate reflected a \u201ctotal disconnect\u201d by a \u201cdisastrous government.\u201d",
      "After conducting its own investigation into the deadly attacks, Israel\u2019s military acknowledged last month that it had misjudged Hamas\u2019 intentions and underestimated the militant group\u2019s capabilities and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.",
      "More than 48,000 people have been killed in Israel's assault on Gaza since then, according to health officials in the enclave.",
      "However, many Israelis believe the failures surrounding the attacks extend beyond the military and Netanyahu has faced calls to take responsibility for his country\u2019s apparent lack of preparedness.",
      "At least 65% of Israelis said they believed the most appropriate method to investigate the attacks was a State Commission of Inquiry, according to a recent poll conducted by the Jerusalem-based Viterbi Family Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research.",
      "Surveyed between from Jan. 28 to Feb. 2, just 17% of the 604 Jewish and 151 Arab respondents said they supported the idea of a government-appointed commission of inquiry.",
      "Netanyahu has nonetheless maintained that he will answer difficult questions, but only after the war that has consumed the Middle East for almost a-year-and-a-half comes to an end.",
      "His outburst came amid growing fears over the future of the fragile ceasefire between his government and Hamas, and as Israel faces mounting criticism for halting the entry of aid and goods into the Gaza Strip.",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar doubled down on that decision Tuesday, blaming Hamas for the pause \u2014 which came as families across Gaza marked the month of Ramadan \u2014 after the militant group refused to accept a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to expedite the delivery of $4 billion in military aid to Israel and reverse a partial arms embargo introduced by the Biden administration."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin has for years unsuccessfully tried to oust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, those efforts are being entertained by senior officials in Ukraine\u2019s single most important backer, the United States.",
      "Either Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Two days after the Ukrainian president was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and asked to leave the White House without signing an important deal, Johnson said it was \u201cup to the Ukrainians to figure that out.\u201d",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington needed \u201ca leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war.\u201d He told CNN that \u201cif it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wasn\u2019t sure if the U.S. \u201ccan ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d He said that Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d",
      "Critics say this plays into the hands of Russia, aiding Moscow\u2019s yearslong bid to oust Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western leader, while fanning Kyiv\u2019s domestic political divisions during wartime.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov on Monday called the White House clash an \u201cunprecedented event\u201d that showed \u201cZelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills.\u201d The exchange was part of Ukraine\u2019s \u201crefusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a blind person could fail to see this, and only a deaf person would refuse to hear it.\u201d",
      "Still, the Ukrainian leader has remained defiant and popular among European leaders. There is also evidence that last week\u2019s clash in the Oval Office may have even boosted his domestic support.",
      "\u201cIf they replace me, given what is going on, given the support, simply replacing me will not be simple,\u201d Zelenskyy told British media. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just hold an election. You need to also not let me run. This will be a bit more difficult. Looks like you will have to negotiate with me.\u201d",
      "Trump and his advisers such as Elon Musk have criticized Ukraine\u2019s indefinite postponement of elections scheduled for 2024, delayed because the country is under martial law following its invasion by Russia. That led to Trump calling democratically elected Zelenskyy  \u201ca dictator without elections.\u201d",
      "More and more Ukrainians are in favor of this pause, with support\u00a0 up to 58% from 52% last week, Ukrainian pollster Gradus found in data published Sunday.",
      "Other polling suggests that, while certainly more politically fallible than he was during the early days of the war, Zelenskyy remains widely popular and could well win a democratic ballot. In fact, another Gradus survey suggested that the Oval Office bust-up has coincided with a boost in Zelenskyy\u2019s domestic approval rising to 49% as of Saturday.",
      "Meanwhile, trust in Zelenskyy appears to be increasing, up to 65% from 57% in January, a poll by\u00a0the Ukrainian research organization Rating Group found.",
      "Zelenskyy \u201cwas elected in 2019 with the large margin,\u201d said Yevhen Mahda, director of the Kyiv think tank Institute of World Policy, adding that there isn\u2019t a serious risk to his leadership inside the country. Although Zelenskyy has offered to resign if Ukraine gets NATO membership, these statements are \u201ca bit populistic\u201d because of how unlikely that is, Mahda said.",
      "One man possibly more popular than him is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine\u2019s former top military commander \u2014 known as the Iron General \u2014 whom Zelenskyy fired in a February 2024 shakeup. Zaluzhniy, since posted to the United Kingdom as ambassador, was trusted by 76% of respondents in the Rating Group survey \u2014 higher than his boss, the president.",
      "But in informal conversations over the weekend, political, military and diplomatic figures in Kyiv, even those who did not personally support the Ukrainian leader, unanimously told NBC News that replacing Zelenskyy now would only benefit Russia. Rather than seeing a humiliation of their leader, they saw it as an example of Ukraine standing up to the U.S. and saying \u201cno.\u201d",
      "Still, many in Ukraine are under no illusions at the leverage Washington still holds over them.",
      "One soldier in Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Chystyi, whose nickname is clean guy, laid it out in stark terms: \u201cThe only international pressure that could possibly force Zelenslyi to resign is a pressure from America.\u201d",
      "Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party, said her leader has \u201cmade it clear he\u2019s not in politics for power. His aim is to ensure real, lasting peace to Ukraine and to achieve some security guarantees.\u201d",
      "\u201cHonestly, I do not understand calls for President Zelenskyy to resign in the middle of an existential genocidal war,\u201d she added. \u201cOur defense heavily depends on President Zelenskyy\u2019s leadership. Even the critics in Ukraine acknowledge that the discussion about replacing him is absurd and premature.\u201d",
      "Trump has wrongly claimed that Zelenskyy\u2019s approval rating is 4%, and Musk said the Ukrainian leader was avoiding a vote because he would \u201close in a landslide.\u201d",
      "There doesn\u2019t appear to be much evidence for either of these assertions. Trump appears to have gotten his statistic from an unscientific poll on the Telegram messaging service by one of Zelenskyy\u2019s political rivals.",
      "Alexander Smith reported from London, and Victor Sema and Daryna Meyer from Kyiv."

      "The number of violations recorded against Sudanese children was 16% higher in 2024 than in 2023, which had already seen an increase of 473% from 2022 when the war broke out, the report said.",

      "Once allies, both men were part of the military establishment that seized power following the collapse of the Western-backed government of Prime Minister\u00a0Abdalla Hamdok\u00a0in 2021.",
      "But although they agreed to rule together, their alliance broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, war broke out in April 2023.",
      "More than 12 million people have been displaced and tens of thousands of people have been reportedly killed, according to the U.N.",
      "While both sides have been accused of extensive human rights violations, a U.N. fact-finding mission in October found that the RSF was responsible for committing sexual violence on a large scale in areas under its control, including gang rapes, abductions and sexual slavery.",
      "In January, the United States determined that the RSF had committed genocide in areas under its control.",
      "UNICEF, which has been providing safe spaces for children through emergency response rooms set up by local activists, said in the report that the outcome of sexual crimes against children was \u201cdevastating\u201d due to the fact that victims have \u201cfew places to turn to for medical help.\u201d",
      "Women and girls are fleeing their homes and families to other cities where they end up becoming internally displaced and continue to face high risk of sexual violence, the report added.",

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened Tuesday to launch high-profile provocations in response to the arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier in South Korea and other U.S. military activities, which she slammed as \u201cconfrontation hysteria of the U.S. and its stooges.\u201d",
      "The warning by Kim Yo Jong implies that North Korea will most likely ramp up weapons testing activities and maintain its confrontational posture against the U.S., though President Donald Trump has said he would reach out to Kim Jong Un to revive diplomacy.",
      "In a statement carried by state media, Kim Yo Jong accused the U.S. of clearly showing \u201cits most hostile and confrontational will\u201d to North Korea with the deployments of the USS Carl Vinson and other powerful U.S. military assets and U.S.-South Korean military drills this year.",
      "\u201cThe DPRK is also planning to carefully examine the option for increasing the actions threatening the security of the enemy at the strategic level to cope with the fact that the deployment of U.S. strategic assets in the Korean Peninsula has become a vicious habit and adversely affects the security of the DPRK,\u201d she said, using the acronym of North Korea\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.",
      "Her statement suggests North Korea may test-launch powerful missiles designed to strike the mainland U.S. or American military bases in the region, observers say.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry warned later that it was ready to repel any provocations by North Korea based on a solid military alliance with the U.S. A ministry statement called Kim Yo Jong\u2019s warning \u201csophistry\u201d meant to justify her country\u2019s nuclear development and future provocations.",
      "On Sunday, the USS Carl Vinson and its strike group arrived in South Korea, the latest temporary deployment of a U.S. strategic asset aimed at displaying the firmness of the U.S.-South Korean military alliance in the face of North Korean threats and strengthening interoperability of the allies\u2019 combined assets. The U.S. carrier\u2019s arrival came four days after North Korea conducted cruise missile tests, its fourth missile launch event this year.",
      "North Korea views arrivals of such powerful U.S. military assets in South Korea as major security threats and often responds with missile tests.",
      "North Korea has not directly responded to Trump\u2019s overture, but alleged U.S.-led hostilities against North Korea have intensified since the start of Trump\u2019s second term in January.",
      "Experts say Kim Jong Un is not likely to embrace Trump\u2019s outreach anytime soon as he is now focusing on his support of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine with supply of weapons and troops. They say Kim could consider returning to diplomacy with Trump when he thinks he cannot maintain his country\u2019s current booming cooperation with Russia.",
      "Kim and Trump met three times from 2018 to 2019 during Trump\u2019s first term to discuss the future of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Their high-stakes diplomacy eventually collapsed due to wrangling over U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea."

      "In just over a month, Trump has executed a startling realignment of American foreign policy, effectively throwing U.S. support behind Moscow and rejecting the tight alliance with Kyiv cultivated by former President Joe Biden.",
      "The extraordinary pivot has upended decades of hawkish foreign policy toward Russia that provided a rare area of bipartisan consensus in an increasingly divided nation. Trump\u2019s recent moves have drawn international attention, unsettling U.S. allies in Europe and thrilling conservative populists who favor a turn away from Zelenskyy.",
      "The new posture was put in stark relief on Friday during a tense Oval Office meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy. The leaders clashed in front of the press, raising questions about the future of American support for Kyiv, more than three years after Russia opened the largest conflict in Europe since World War II.",
      "U.S. officials have made a series of policy changes in recent weeks that seem to herald a more cooperative stance with Russia:",

      "Trump has long professed a desire to reset and improve relations with Russia. He has repeatedly said he believes it is in the national interest to \u201cget along\u201d with Moscow and cast doubt on the value of core parts of the post-World War II global security architecture, including NATO and the European Union. Trump\u2019s first term was shadowed by former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation \u2014 a probe that Trump has repeatedly dismissed as the \u201cRussia hoax.\u201d",
      "Trump has pushed back on Democrats and other critics who have accused him of deferring to Russia.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not aligned with Putin. I\u2019m not aligned with anybody. I\u2019m aligned with the United States of America, and for the good of the world, I\u2019m aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with,\" Trump said Friday from the Oval Office, referring to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "But the U.S. government now appears to be pivoting away from Kyiv. In the weeks since his inauguration, Trump has suggested Ukraine was responsible for Russia\u2019s invasion and \u201cstarted\u201d the war, echoing familiar talking points from the Kremlin.",
      "The president's relationship with Zelenskyy has long been fraught, partly owing to a July 2019 phone call in which Trump pressured the Ukrainian leader to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter over the latter's position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. After the call leaked, it helped touch off the first impeachment of Trump. (He was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.)",
      "Vice President JD Vance has likewise been consistently skeptical of continued U.S. assistance to Ukraine\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cThe bitter irony of America\u2019s present predicament is that the very people who cheer for permanent arms shipments to Ukraine also supported the de-industrialization of America,\u201d Vance said in a post on X on Sunday. \u201cThe very things you want us to send are things we don\u2019t make enough of.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s approach is\u00a0a dramatic departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy toward Russia, a period spanning the Cold War with the former Soviet Union as well as the rise of Putin. American presidents, Republicans and Democrats alike, typically struck a more bellicose tone on the threat posed by an emboldened Russia.",
      "Putin\u2019s regime has welcomed the overtures from Trump. In statements reported by Russian state media agency TASS, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov praised Trump as a pragmatist who operates with \u201ccommon sense.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe see that the collective West has begun to partially lose its unity,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Monday.",
      "Democrats and anti-Trump Republican commentators have sharply criticized the administration since the Oval Office meeting, accusing Trump of effectively selling out Ukraine. In a post on his Truth Social platform early Monday, Trump defended himself and insisted he had helped keep much of Ukraine intact.",
      "\u201cThe only President who gave none of Ukraine\u2019s land to Putin\u2019s Russia is President Donald J. Trump,\u201d he wrote in the post. \u201cRemember that when the weak and ineffective Democrat\u2019s criticize, and the Fake News gladly puts out anything they say!\u201d",
      "But there is a partisan divide on Ukraine; Gallup recently found that 84% of Democrats have a favorable view of Ukraine, whereas only 54% of Republican poll respondents said the same.",
      "In the wake of the Trump-Zelenskyy spat, a handful of Republican lawmakers defended Ukraine, while most \u2014 including House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \u2014 said Zelenskyy may have to resign.",
      "The feud between continued Monday, with Trump disparaging his Ukrainian counterpart in a post on social media.",
      "Trump is by no means the first president to aim for a less hostile relationship with Moscow, however. Barack Obama and his first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, embarked on a high-profile bid to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia. But those efforts largely fell apart after Putin invaded Crimea and seized it from Ukraine in 2014.",
      "The relationship between Biden and Zelenskyy showed signs of strain, too. NBC News has reported that Biden lost his temper with Zelenskyy during a phone call in June 2022, according to four people familiar with the call. Biden raised his voice and said Zelenskyy could afford to show more gratitude for the billions in U.S. military assistance for Kyiv.",
      "Biden and his top diplomats nonetheless worked to rally international support for Kyiv\u2019s resistance to Moscow; the United Kingdom, France and other European allies joined the fight.",
      "The disagreement between Biden and Zelenskyy came in a private phone call \u2014 not a public dressing down in the Oval Office. During their meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy he should be much more grateful as the conversation grew more tense, ending with the Ukraine leader leaving the U.S. without signing a minerals deal.",
      "\u201cYou got to be more thankful, because, let me tell you, you don\u2019t have the cards,\u201d Trump said."

A spokesperson for the state interior ministry in Stuttgart said the suspect is a 40-year-old German man who lives in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Police said at this time \"it is not assumed that there is a political background.\"",

      "Friday\u2019s respiratory crisis sparked\u00a0fears of a new lung infection\u00a0because Francis inhaled some vomit. Doctors aspirated it and said they needed 24 to 48 hours to determine whether any new infection had taken hold.",
      "On Sunday evening, they said Francis remained stable, with no fever or signs of an infection, indicating he had overcome the crisis. His prognosis remained guarded, however, meaning he wasn\u2019t out of danger.",
      "Francis also received a visit Sunday from the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and his chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pe\u00f1a Parra, with whom he meets at least weekly when he is at the Vatican. The content of their talks wasn\u2019t known.,",

      "It isn\u2019t the only new routine in Culiac\u00e1n, a city of 1 million residents that for the past six months has been the battlefield for the two main factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel.",
      "The violence has limited the hours to bury the dead. Bands that played big parties now play for money at intersections. Any loud noise sends children scurrying for cover. And those who live on the shifting front lines fear for their lives daily.",
      "This is the first extended period of violence that has touched Culiac\u00e1n\u2019s residents because there was safety in the cartel\u2019s total domination. Now, many residents are grateful for the pressure applied by U.S. President Donald Trump to get Mexico to go after the cartels and some are optimistic that this difficult period could change the persistent view that the cartel has been their protector.",
      "\u2018Tired of being among the bullets\u2019",
      "It started in September, more than a month after Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada \u2014 the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s oldest and most astute leader \u2014 says he was kidnapped by one of the sons of former leader Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n and taken to the U.S. where they were both arrested.",
      "It unleashed a power struggle between both cartel factions and the unwritten agreement to not attack residents uninvolved in the drug trade was broken.",
      "There were carjackings, kidnappings, innocents caught in crossfires and cartel roadblocks where gunmen would scan people\u2019s cell phones looking for any trace of contact with the other side. According to government data, there have been more than 900 killings since September.",
      "A resident of Costa Rica, a small town south of the capital, traced the front line on the horizon: on one side the \u201cChapos,\u201d on the other the \u201cMayos.\u201d He, like most others, requested anonymity because of the danger.",
      "An old man there said he saw gunmen dump two bodies in the street.",
      "And sometimes people just disappear. Julio H\u00e9ctor Carrillo, 34, never arrived home from visiting a relative in late January. According to his brother-in-law, Mario Beltr\u00e1n, his only transgression was not respecting the locals\u2019 self-imposed curfew.",

      "When it started, Mexico was led by President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who minimized cartel violence and expressed no interest in going after cartel leaders. His close ally, Sinaloa Gov. Rub\u00e9n Rocha did the same. Rocha\u2019s spokesman, Feliciano Castro, maintains that the U.S. set off the violence by arresting Zambada.",
      "Things changed when Trump won the election. Shutting down illegal immigration and going after drug traffickers were among his campaign promises and he\u2019s threatened to impose 25% tariffs Tuesday. Mexico\u2019s new President Claudia Sheinbaum had already shown herself willing to take a more aggressive hand with the cartels, especially Sinaloa, whose main business is fentanyl.",
      "The number of security operations and arrests in Sinaloa have multiplied and now there is direct federal supervision of all security action.",

      "In December, authorities seized more than a ton of fentanyl in Sinaloa compared to just 286 pounds in all of Mexico in the first six months of 2024.",
      "In the last 10 days of February, authorities dismantled 113 synthetic drug labs, according to preliminary state data. Authorities have not clarified if they produced fentanyl or methamphetamine. It\u2019s unknown what, if any, role U.S. intelligence played.",

      "The recent actions have weakened both cartel factions but the government can\u2019t let up if it really wants to decimate them, Boj\u00f3rquez said.",
      "\u201cI never thought (Trump) would have so much power to do that \u2026 but I\u2019m grateful,\u201d said the owner of a beer store stopped at a police checkpoint.",
      "A 55-year-old woman sitting on a bench watching a forensics team load a murder victim\u2019s body into a truck agreed. The day before, she had attended a Mass for her son-in-law who was killed five months earlier by a stray bullet while he was walking with his daughter a few blocks away.",

      "The last time he closed was late last month when intense firefights and low-flying helicopters panicked residents. Two key cartel members were arrested.",
      "In January, one of his students, a 9-year-old boy, was killed along with his 12-year-old brother and their father in a carjacking. Thousands of residents took to the streets in a rare public display of indignation.",
      "At a workshop, a nongovernmental organization of ex-police led students through an exercise writing down what scares them. One listed spiders, gun shots and white trucks (the preferred cartel transportation). Another said he\u2019s afraid of being extorted or killed.",
      "\u201cThe people are full of a sense of collective anguish, anxiety, social anger and that\u2019s different from other crises,\u201d said Calder\u00f3n, the coordinator of the citizen security group.

      "BEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s annual major political event gets underway this week, bringing together the nation\u2019s top leaders and thousands of provincial leaders to endorse decisions already made by the all-powerful Chinese Communist Party.",
      "The meetings and gathering during the National People\u2019s Congress, expected to last for about a week, are still important. The rubber-stamp parliament retains an important function: to signal the priorities of the government for the coming year and to disseminate instructions to party members and officials across the country.",
      "The messaging from leadership appears unchanged from previous years \u2014 stay the course on fostering innovation while also spurring domestic consumption.",
      "The question will be how they balance those two goals, and will it be enough to reinvigorate the economy? And to what extent will the government buffer the impact of what might be another phase in the U.S.-China trade war?",
      "This year also marks the end of China\u2019s current 5-year plan, and experts will be looking for clues on the government\u2019s priorities for the next, 2026 to 2030 plan.",
      "Here is what to watch for at this year\u2019s event:",
      "What is China\u2019s economic growth target?",
      "The National People\u2019s Congress kicks off on Wednesday, with Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s top economic official, announcing the economic growth target for the year.",
      "Analysts expect it to come in at around 5% \u2014 holding the same target as the previous two years, and slightly lower than the 5.5% target in 2022. This would be no small feat considering China is still grappling with a sluggish real estate sector and lackluster consumer spending.",
      "Another uncertainty is trade tensions with the U.S. under President Donald Trump, who last month slapped a 10% tariff on Chinese imports while an additional 10% comes into effect on Tuesday. Forecasters at the International Monetary Fund are projecting a lower 4.6% growth rate this year.",
      "What are the government\u2019s priorities?",
      "A commentary last Friday from the official Xinhua News Agency indicated that priority would be placed on increasing domestic demand and promoting innovation in science and technology.",
      "There\u2019s also anticipation of more government support for the private sector to fuel growth.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping met in February with business leaders, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma and Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei, signaling support for the private sector at the highest level of leadership. A draft bill is also to be deliberated during the Congress over making a fairer and more equitable business environment for the private sector.",
      "China has already released a slew of measures to prop up the economy. Much of these have fallen short of hopes for a bigger stimulus, and analysts are tempering expectations on what to expect from the Congress.",
      "\u201cI would not expect anything ... to come out that will really meaningfully shift that policy away from industrial policy and towards boosting consumption in meaningful, sufficient ways,\u201d said Jacob Gunter, lead analyst for the economics research team at the Mercator Institute for China Studies.",
      "Instead, experts say leaders are staying the course on pushing for innovation that would increase China\u2019s self-reliance.",
      "The purpose of the economy is no longer to improve household incomes and expand the middle class, Gunter said.",
      "\u201cThis is not a development-oriented economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a geopolitically oriented economy, and technology and industry are way more important for that.\u201d",
      "Where is China\u2019s diplomacy headed?",
      "Li is expected to touch on foreign policy and Taiwan, but more attention will likely be on Foreign Minister Wang Yi.",
      "His annual news conference, to be held later in the week, will be closely watched to decipher China\u2019s stance on U.S.-China relations under Trump. After the first 10% tariffs in February, China retaliated with a 15% tariff on American coal and liquefied natural gas, as well as 10% on crude oil, agriculture machinery and large-engine cars.",
      "\u201cBeijing\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s initial 10% tariffs was measured \u2014 restrained enough to signal openness to negotiations yet firm enough to demonstrate its willingness to escalate if necessary,\u201d Neil Thomas and Jing Qian wrote in a report for the Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "They note that China\u2019s president might use speeches in closed-door meetings during the Congress to send signals on bilateral relations, as he did two years ago when Xi named the United States as leading \u201ccontainment encirclement and suppressions\u201d against China.",
      "Also closely watched will be China\u2019s relations with Russia and its position on the Ukraine war. At a recent Group of 20 foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in South Africa, Wang said a \u201cwindow for peace is opening\u201d in Ukraine, and that China supported \u201call efforts committed to peace, including the recent consensus reached by the United States and Russia.\u201d",
      "What does the National People\u2019s Congress do?",
      "The legislature is made up of nearly 3,000 delegates from China\u2019s provinces, ministries, People\u2019s Liberation Army, party organizations and various groups that represent workers and other interests.",
      "Their role is largely ceremonial in that the body does not have any real power to decide on legislation. Any vote is usually unanimous or near-unanimous to formalize decisions already taken by Communist Party leaders behind closed doors.",
      "Still, the Congress is a rare opportunity to see what the central government sees as its priorities and goals, and the reports and speeches during it can give indications of the future direction of government policy.",
      "An advisory body, the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, will meet at the same time. Members include business leaders, athletes, academics, religious leaders and representatives of ethnic groups. The concurrent meetings of the two bodies are known as the Two Sessions."

      "Israel faced sharp criticism as it stopped the entry of all food and other supplies into Gaza on Sunday and warned of \u201cadditional consequences\u201d for Hamas if a fragile ceasefire isn\u2019t extended.",
      "Mediators Egypt and Qatar accused Israel of violating humanitarian law by using starvation as a weapon.",
      "The ceasefire\u2019s first phase saw a surge in humanitarian aid after months of growing hunger. Hamas accused Israel of trying to derail the next phase Sunday hours after its first phase had ended and called Israel\u2019s decision to cut off aid \u201ca war crime and a blatant attack\u201d on a truce that took a year of negotiations before taking hold in January.",
      "In the second phase, Hamas would release dozens of remaining hostages in return for an Israeli pullout from Gaza and a lasting ceasefire. Negotiations on the second phase were meant to start a month ago but haven\u2019t begun.",
      "Israel backs a new proposal to speed up the release of hostages",
      "Israel said Sunday that a new U.S. proposal calls for extending the ceasefire through Ramadan \u2014 the Muslim holy month that began over the weekend \u2014 and the Jewish Passover holiday, which ends April 20.",
      "Under that proposal, Hamas would release half the hostages on the first day and the rest when an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. The militants currently hold 59 hostages, 35 of them believed to be dead."

    "story": [
      "An Australian man credited with saving more than 2 million babies through decades of regular blood and plasma donations has died at age 88.",
      "James Harrison, whose blood contained a rare antibody, died in his sleep Feb. 17 at a nursing home in the Australian state of New South Wales, according to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, also known as Lifeblood.",
      "The antibody in Harrison\u2019s blood was used to make the medication anti-D, which is given to pregnant women whose blood might attack their unborn babies. Without it, babies may develop hemolytic disease of the fetus\u00a0and newborn (HDFN), a blood disorder that can be fatal.",
      "Despite an aversion to needles, Harrison began donating in 1954 at age 18, keeping a promise he made at 14 when he received life-saving blood transfusions as part of a major surgery. A decade later, it was found that his blood contained an antibody essential for producing anti-D injections.",
      "Known as the \u201cman with the golden arm,\u201d Harrison donated his blood and plasma 1,173 times, never missing an appointment for more than 60 years until he retired in 2018 at the age of 81.",
      "\u201cI hope it\u2019s a record that somebody breaks, because it will mean they are dedicated to the cause,\u201d Harrison\u00a0said at the time.",
      "In total, over 3 million doses of anti-D with Harrison\u2019s blood have been given to 2 million mothers in Australia since 1967. In 1999, he received the Medal of the Order of Australia in recognition of his support for Lifeblood and the anti-D program.",
      "His daughter, Tracey Mellowship, who also received anti-D, said Harrison was a \u201chumanitarian at heart,\u201d adding that her family \u201cmay not have existed without his precious donations.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was also very proud to have saved so many lives, without any cost or pain. It made him happy to hear about the many families like ours, who existed because of his kindness,\u201d Mellowship said.",
      "\u201cHe always said it does not hurt, and the life you save could be your own,\u201d she continued.",
      "Australia has some 200 anti-D donors helping around 45,000 mothers and their babies annually, Lifeblood says.",
      "Though HDFN currently can be prevented only through blood donation, researchers are using blood from Harrison and other donors to produce a lab-grown version of the anti-D antibody in the hope that it can help prevent the disease in pregnant women in Australia and around the world.",
      "Lifeblood Chief Executive Officer Stephen Cornelissen said Harrison had left behind an \u201cincredible\u201d legacy.",
      "\u201cOn behalf of Lifeblood, and the entire Australian community, we thank James for the incredible life-saving contribution he made and the millions of lives he saved,\u201d he said."
