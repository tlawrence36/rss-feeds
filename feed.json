      "Conservative podcaster Megyn Kelly delivered a fiery speech supporting Donald Trump during an event billed as his \u201cclosing message\u201d on Monday night, a full-circle moment after the former president and the onetime Fox News star feuded bitterly during Trump's 2016 campaign.",
      "Invited to the stage in Pittsburgh, Kelly defended Trump against recent controversies, including his repeated pledge to be the \u201cprotector\u201d of women, and pressed his case on border security and his opposition to transgender athletes participating in sports.",
      "\u201cHe got mocked by the left by saying he would be a protector of women,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cHe will be a protector of women and it\u2019s why I\u2019m voting for him. He will close the border and he will keep the boys out of women\u2019s sports where they don\u2019t belong.\u201d",

      "Kelly was a popular Fox News host in 2016 when she questioned Trump during the first debate of the Republican primary about whether he had the temperament to be president.",
      "Trump largely dismissed Kelly\u2019s question at the debate, but later he went directly after her, first overnight on Twitter and later in interviews.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s not very tough and not very sharp,\u201d Trump told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cI don\u2019t respect her as a journalist.\u201d",
      "Referring to Kelly\u2019s questions during the debate, Trump said, \u201cThere was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\u201d The comment was widely viewed as a sexist reference to menstruation.",

      "Kelly was critical of some of the speakers who delivered crude and racist comments at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally last month. One suggested that Harris, who is vying to become the first woman, Black woman and person of South Asian descent to be elected president, began her career as a prostitute.",
      "The speakers, Kelly said, \u201ctook what was an amazing celebration of Trump, exciting and well-attended and hugely enthusiastic, and gave themselves a big black eye.\u201d"

      "After decades in romantic comedies, Hugh Grant has spent the last few years playing narcissists, weirdos and murders, often to the greatest acclaim of his career",
      "NEW YORK -- After some difficulties connecting to a Zoom, Hugh Grant eventually opts to just phone instead.",
      "\u201cSorry about that,\u201d he apologizes. \u201cTech hell.\u201d Grant is no lover of technology. Smart phones, for example, he calls the \u201cdevil\u2019s tinderbox.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re killing us. I hate them,\u201d he says. \u201cI go on long holidays from them, three or four days at at time. Marvelous.\u201d",
      "Hell, and our proximity to it, is a not unrelated topic to Grant\u2019s new film, \u201cHeretic.\u201d In it, two young Mormon missionaries (Chloe East, Sophie Thatcher) come knocking on a door they\u2019ll soon regret visiting. They\u2019re welcomed in by Mr. Reed (Grant), an initially charming man who tests their faith in theological debate, and then, in much worse things.",
      "After decades in romantic comedies, Grant has spent the last few years playing narcissists, weirdos and murders, often to the greatest acclaim of his career. But in \u201cHeretic,\u201d a horror thriller from A24, Grant\u2019s turn to the dark side reaches a new extreme. The actor who once charmingly stammered in \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral\u201d and who danced to the Pointer Sisters in \u201cLove Actually\u201d is now doing heinous things to young people in a basement.",
      "\u201cIt was a challenge,\u201d Grant says. \u201cI think human beings need challenges. It makes your beer taste better in the evening if you\u2019ve climbed a mountain. He was just so wonderfully (expletive)-up.\u201d",
      "\u201cHeretic,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, is directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, co-writers of \u201cA Quiet Place.\u201d In Grant\u2019s hands, Mr. Reed is a divinely good baddie \u2014 a scholarly creep whose wry monologues pull from a wide range of references, including, fittingly, Radiohead's \u201cCreep.\"",
      "In an interview, Grant spoke about these and other facets of his character, his journey from rom-com idol to horror villain and his abiding affection for \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d",
      "GRANT: Yes, thank you. It\u2019s not easy for any actor.",
      "GRANT: It\u2019s hard to remember which was the writers, which was me. But I\u2019m pretty sure doing the Jar Jar Binks impersonation was my idea.",
      "GRANT: No, I didn\u2019t. I just thought it would be fun if the character did that because it\u2019d be just weird. And, in fact, what\u2019s odd about me is that I\u2019ve never seen a \"Star Wars\u201d film.",
      "GRANT: I can\u2019t. They\u2019re too frightening for me. I watched \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d when I was too young and I\u2019ve been in counseling ever since. I watched one by mistake recently, which was \u201cMidsommar.\u201d I thought it looked like a jolly, Swedish comedy. I put it on one evening for my Swedish wife who needed cheering up and she\u2019s still very, very traumatized.",
      "GRANT: It\u2019s fascinating, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t know. Maybe these are the end of times, the end days, the apocalypse. We know it deep down but for some reason we won\u2019t confront it. I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s wonderful that it sends people into the cinemas.",
      "GRANT: It is. Talk about the end of days. To me, one of the gloomiest signs or omens is the gradual closing of cinemas \u2014 and not just that, where I live in London, but the closing of bars. The bar where I met my wife, which was party night every night of the week, is now largely closed. I think the fact that we\u2019re all staying in, staring at our devil\u2019s tinderboxes is deeply tragic, or watching things on streaming by ourselves with maybe one or two other family members. These things should be collective experiences.",
      "GRANT: My ability to gauge what\u2019s entertaining, I used to be very proud of it. In the old days, my old career, I used to say, \u201cI\u2019m not so proud of my acting but I\u2019m proud of the fact that the films I\u2019ve done, on the whole, have been entertaining and I\u2019ve been good at choosing them.\u201d And then, suddenly overnight, I became very bad at choosing them. I don\u2019t know, I lost the zeitgeist, I suppose. That can happen. Now, I feel like I\u2019ve found something again. If the character amuses me and I think I\u2019m going to enjoy being that person, then I tend to do the job. Sometimes, when actors are enjoying it, it works.",
      "GRANT: Yes, I\u2019ve got nothing else to go on. And I\u2019m not the lead character, the film doesn\u2019t rest on me. I don\u2019t have to worry that much if it does well, medium or badly. I just go by: Do I think I\u2019m going to have some fun in this?",
      "GRANT: The big shift was after \u201cDid You Hear About the Morgans?\u201d That was sort of officially the end of romantic comedy for me. Nothing much happened after that in showbiz terms. I went off and did political campaigning and I was quite happy, in fact. But in drips and drabs, strange little projects, like the Wachowskis' \u201cCloud Atlas,\u201d then Stephen Fears came along with \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d and \u201cA Very English Scandal.\u201d \u201cPaddington 2.\u201d These interesting, complex, often not very nice, narcissistic weirdos started to emerge from the woods.",
      "GRANT: Looking back, I was very lucky. I had Richard Curtis on the one hand, who is not only a gifted comic writer \u2013 he can just do flat-out comedy like \u201cBlack Adder\u201d \u2013 but he\u2019s an unrecognized dramatist. Those comedies are based on pain. The comedy is there to deal with pain. It\u2019s people with unrequited love, lost love, bereavement, brothers with mental illness \u2014 proper pain. So I was lucky with him.",
      "And I think I was very lucky with Marc Lawrence who just had a wonderful gift for the celebration of life. He actually likes people, which is so weird. So films like \u201cMusic and Lyrics\u201d have a very sustaining and uplifting buoyancy to them. He\u2019s an unrecognized talent.",
      "GRANT: You know who really loves them? The most surprising person in the world. Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino pushed his way through a crowd at a party in London once to say, (does Tarantino impression) \u201cMan, I loved \u2018Music and Lyrics\u2019 and \u2018Two Weeks Notice.\u2019\u201d He told me the whole plot of both films and how he was watching one of them on a plane and the plane landed and he had to rush off to a DVD shop to buy the disc so he could watch the end of it. I thought maybe he was joking but I don\u2019t think he was. Someone told me at his cinema here in Hollywood, a rather cool, 35mm-showing theater, he\u2019s been showing \u201cMusic and Lyrics,\u201d no less.",
      "GRANT: Yes, my enthusiasm for that film has spread. I\u2019ve just been invited to a 60th anniversary next year in Salzburg. I might go. I might wear lederhosen. Or I might wear a white dress with a blue satin sash, as I did in school when I played Brigitta Von Trapp.",
      "GRANT: Yeah, I was at all-boys English school and I played, I think, the third youngest daughter.",
      "GRANT: The older I get the more I love song and dance. I find myself watching a lot more Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, things like that. Because life is so stressful and the news is so ghastly that it\u2019s hard to watch very serious stuff and pick yourself up afterwards. I did watch \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d coming over from London the other day. And I have to say that\u2019s just about as good as filmmaking gets. Short of \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d obviously.",
      "GRANT: Yes, weirdly it has, and it\u2019s hard to say why. Is it a sort of exorcism or something? I don\u2019t know. Way back in my 20s, when I started out acting, the only thing I thought I could ever bring to entertainment was doing silly characters, doing voices. I did them as a kid to the point where I drove people mad. I was never myself. My parents and my school teachers used to say, \u201cCome on, just drop it. Who\u2019s the real Hugh Grant?\u201d So it was a bit weird to have a career as a leading-man romantic comedies where I didn\u2019t get to be anyone unusual or weird. So I feel like this is something I can do, and quite like doing. At the same time, I learned some tricks of film acting and got a little bit better.",
      "GRANT: The big thing for me was I learned to trust myself a bit more when you\u2019re actually in front of the camera. There\u2019s a terrible danger when people do film acting. They\u2019re so frightened of this big, pressure moment that\u2019s coming up that they sort of pre-rehearse and think, \u201cI\u2019m going to say the line this way, and it\u2019s excellent that way, and I shall just try to reproduce that on the day.\u201d But that\u2019s no good. You\u2019ve got to reinvent it on the day.",
      "The prep work should not be how you\u2019re going to say the lines, the prep work should be \u2014 well, for me, anyway \u2014 a kind of absurdly prolonged in-depth marinade like a piece of old meat that you leave soaking for weeks and months in sauce until it\u2019s full of flavor. So my marinade takes the form of very, very painstaking, minute examination of the script: Why do I say this? Why do I do this? What happened in childhood for this person to behave like this? What was his mother like? What was his father like?",
      "In the case of Mr. Reed in \u201cHeretic,\u201d it\u2019d be: Let\u2019s look at some serial killers. Let\u2019s look at some cult leaders. Let\u2019s look at some atheists. It\u2019s funny how important costume is. Suddenly some thing, one thing, one visual, physical thing makes you go: That\u2019s him. With Mr. Reed it was the idea of double denim. I don\u2019t actually wear double denim in the film but I realized, yes, he\u2019s Mr. Double Denim. He thinks he\u2019s a groovy teacher at university, the one who\u2019s down with the kids, making jokes.",
      "GRANT: Yeah, that\u2019s true. But doing it on those romantic comedies, I\u2019m not sure I really got anywhere particularly. I wasn\u2019t really creating monsters. It\u2019s easier when you\u2019re creating monsters. I\u2019m fascinated by the bizarre, weird distortions that human beings twist themselves into emotionally, intellectually, physically from the trials and tribulations of life. I\u2019m not sure that any of my characters in the romantic comedies were sufficiently twisted to fully get my juices flowing.",
      "GRANT: Not necessarily from the point of view of religion. But there is a part of me \u2014 probably a not very attractive part of me \u2014 that likes to smash people\u2019s idols. Anyone I feel is being a bit too smug or too pretentious, I don\u2019t like to see that. I like to just take them apart a little bit. My mother did it. She didn\u2019t like me or my brother being too up and she\u2019d find some way to bring us back to ground level.",
      "GRANT: I agree.",
      "GRANT: It\u2019s a very good question that I do not have the answer to. As a matter of fact, there is one thing sitting on my desk in the other room here which is pretty weird and relatively fresh. I agree, I\u2019m not quite sure where to go from here. Maybe it\u2019s song and dance."

      "\u201cWe then \u2018unfold\u2019 it like origami ... and put it back into 3D to be projected as a single unified image.

The costume really impacts how you carry your body, and that posture influences your mind, giving character to this woman of state.\u201d",
      "The production underscored a growing trend in Paris of using light technology to show off the city's storied church interiors.

      "Pop superstar Taylor Swift returned to Arrowhead Stadium to see the Kansas City Chiefs and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Pop superstar Taylor Swift returned to Arrowhead Stadium on Monday night to see the Kansas City Chiefs and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after wrapping up the U.S. leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.",
      "It wound up being a good night for both of them.",
      "Swift was able to celebrate Kelce's big night, which included 14 catches for 100 yards in a driving rain, along with a victory for the Chiefs. They trailed by a touchdown in the fourth quarter, scored twice to take the lead, then headed to overtime, where they won the coin toss and drove for a touchdown that gave them a 30-24 win.",
      "Kelce, who had fumbled earlier in the game, had two of his catches on the decisive drive in overtime. His total receptions was a career-best for a regular-season game, matching a 14-catch performance in a 2023 playoff win over Jacksonville, while his 16 targets from Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was just one shy of his career high.",
      "\u201cHe does a great job of finding space,\u201d Mahomes said, \u201cand I think with having DeAndre (Hopkins) out there, it takes pressure off where not all the attention is on him the entire time. And whenever he gets going, man, he's hard to stop.\u201d",
      "Swift is finally getting a chance to stop herself after playing the last of three shows at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Sunday to conclude the U.S. portion of her tour. The rest of her tour heads to Canada with the first of six shows at Rogers Centre in Toronto on Nov. 14 and three shows in December at BC Place in Vancouver, British Columbia.",
      "Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. Since then, the two have spent plenty of time together, often with cameras following every move.",
      "Swift's arrival in a black outfit and Chiefs coat Monday night came on the eve of the presidential election, in which the 14-time Grammy winner has thrown her support behind Vice President Kamala Harris. That generated a stir when Harris' rival, Donald Trump, began to reference Swift's friend and Mahomes' wife, Brittany, as a supporter of his campaign.",
      "Patrick Mahomes has declined to endorse anyone in the election, instead urging people to register to vote.",

      "To mark 30 years of his career, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli has released a new compilation album, \u201cDuets,\u201d featuring previously released and new collaborations across some of his best-known work",
      "NEW YORK -- It's one of the most immediately recognizable voices on the planet: Andrea Bocelli's tenor is beloved across generations, cultures and borders, known to induce tears in as few as three simple words: \u201cCon Te Partir\u00f2,\u201d or in its English performance, \u201cTime to Say Goodbye.\u201d",
      "This year, he's celebrating the 30th anniversary of his career with a new compilation album, \u201cDuets,\u201d featuring both previously released and brand-new collaborations of his best-known work \u2014 as well as a few surprising contemporary covers \u2014 and the release of a new concert film, \u201cAndrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration,\u201d which will arrive in theaters on Friday.",
      "So, why duets?",
      "\u201cI've loved voices since when I was a child, and I like very much to share the stage with the best artists and voices. So, this album, there are the best duets that I did in my life,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cFrom the first, \u2018The Prayer\u2019 with Celine Dion, until the last, like \u2018Perfect\u2019 with Ed Sheeran and many, many others. And the album has been remastered and remixed. So, I hope the sound can be better.\"",
      "He says: \u201cThe most important thing in voices... is to be recognizable, to give emotion.\"",
      "Sheeran was an interesting collaboration because when Bocelli first attempted to sing \u201cPerfect,\" the English singer-songwriter wasn't a fan. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like what I did because I sang in a pop style,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHe wanted to listen to my voice, like in an operatic style.\u201d So, Sheeran traveled to Bocelli's home in Tuscany, and the song was transformed. \u201cHe was right because this song had a huge success.\u201d",
      "When asked if there is anyone he would've loved to add to the \u201cDuets\u201d collection, Bocelli says of course \u2014 but \u201cthey passed away before I began to sing. For example, I would like very much to sing with Maria Callas or (Renata) Tebaldi or Magda Olivero. Many great, incredible singers. They are not anymore with us, unfortunately.\u201d",
      "Three decades into his career, Bocelli has performed for presidents, popes, and sold-out stadiums across the globe \u2014 in addition to having sold nearly 90 million records worldwide, according to a press release. \u201cReality exceeded my wildest dreams,\u201d he says.",
      "How he reflects on that time should come as no surprise. \u201cI like to sing to the future. Honestly, I don\u2019t like to think with nostalgia to the past,\" he says. \u201cMy first time on stage, for me it is like yesterday. The time is gone so quickly, so fast. And, yeah, now I like to think to the future.\u201d",
      "So, what, then, does he hope becomes his legacy in the next 30 years, 300 years? \u201cIn Italy, we have a very famous expression: The people that come after us will judge us,\u201d he says with a translator. \u201cSo I can\u2019t force the judge(ment) of the people. But I feel that my audience has a big affection for me, and this is my goal. When somebody in the street comes to me and says (to) me, \u2018Thank you for your voice, for your music,\u2019 I think mission is accomplished.\"",
      "Across \u201cDuets,\u201d Bocelli sings in Italian, English, French and Spanish. \u201cThere are many languages, but it\u2019s so difficult. I remember the day I tried to sing in Chinese, only few lines, but it has been so hard for me,\u201d he laughs.",
      "He also performs across genres, working with everyone from Latin superstars like Karol G and Jennifer Lopez to country musicians like Chris Stapleton and Shania Twain. \u201cI would like to try to sing jazz,\" he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s too difficult for me because you must live in an atmosphere, to learn step by step, day by day. I like jazz but it\u2019s too far from the experience of my life.\u201d",
      "There is little he hasn't done across these last three decades, but the ultimate goal now, he says, is steeped in faith. \u201cI have been very lucky and I reached the affection of the people. Now I must try to deserve the affection of the God. It\u2019s more difficult.\"",
      "But he will continue to perform for those who love him. On Dec. 4, Bocelli's U.S. tour kicks off in San Diego and runs through the month, before commencing again in February and June 2025. The final dates will be held in Napa Valley, California, on June 21 and 22."

    "summary": "Quincy Jones has died at age 91",

      "Quincy Jones has died at age 91",
      "Quincy Jones, the multitalented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson\u2019s historic \u201cThriller\u201d album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.",
      "Jones\u2019 publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family. Jones was to have received an honorary Academy Award later this month.",
      "\u201cTonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones\u2019 passing,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cAnd although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.\u201d",
      "Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and leaving behind a vast musical catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American song and rhythm. Over the past half century, it was hard to find a music lover who did not own at least one record with Jones\u2019 name on it or someone in the music, television or movie industries who did not have some connection to him.",
      "Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for \u201cRoots\u201d and \u201cIn the Heat of the Night,\u201d organized President Clinton\u2019s first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of \u201cWe Are the World.\u201d",
      "In a career that began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 rpm, singling out any work seems unfair. But honors likely go to his productions with Jackson on \u201cOff the Wall,\u201d \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cBad,\u201d albums universal in their style and appeal. Jones\u2019 versatility and imagination fit perfectly with the bursting talents of Jackson as he sensationally transformed from child star to the \u201cKing of Pop.\u201d On such classic tracks as \u201cBillie Jean\u201d and \u201cWanna Be Startin\u2019 Somethin\u2019,\u201d Jones and Jackson drew upon disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For \u201cThriller,\u201d some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-defying \u201cBeat It\u201d and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.",
      "\u201cThriller\u201d sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone, helped Jackson become the first major Black artist to have a video played on MTV and influenced countless performers.",
      "\u201cMichael had the look and the voice, and I had every sound you can think of,\u201d Jones would explain.",
      "The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography \u201cQ\u201d: 28 Grammys (out of 80 nominations), an honorary Academy Award and an Emmy for \u201cRoots.\u201d He also received France\u2019s Legion d\u2019Honneur and the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy. In 2001, Jones was named a Kennedy Center Honoree for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, \u201cListen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones,\u201d and his memoir made him a bestselling author.",
      "\u201cDespite all the Grammys and the special awards and testimonials that maturity bestows, it will always be the values you carry within yourself \u2014 of work, love, and integrity \u2014 that carry the greatest worth, because these are what get you through with your dreams intact, your heart held firm and your spirit ready for another day,\u201d he wrote in his book.",
      "Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, telling Oprah Winfrey that \u201cThere are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don\u2019t. Nothing\u2019s in between.\u201d Jones\u2019 mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem \u201csenseless\u201d for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting.",
      "Music was his passion, and, almost literally, his salvation. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano.",
      "\u201cI went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \u201cThat\u2019s where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.\u201d",
      "Within a few years he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band.",
      "\u201cWe had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,\u201d Jones later told Musician magazine. \u201cThat\u2019s when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.\u201d",
      "His survivors include actor Rashida Jones and five other daughters: Jolie Jones Levine, Rachel Jones, Martina Jones, Kidada Jones and Kenya Kinski-Jones; son Quincy Jones III; brother Richard Jones and sisters Theresa Frank and Margie Jay.",

      "Why did the chicken cross the road",
      "Three clucks to Sy Montgomery, who 14 years after publishing \u201cBirdology,\u201d is still finding ways to make money off the charming stories she told in that book about various avian species. \u201cWhat the Chicken Knows,\u201d subtitled \u201cA New Appreciation of the World\u2019s Most Familiar Bird\u201d was a chapter in \u201cBirdology,\u201d but is being re-released as a mini hardcover.",
      "Readers who haven\u2019t read it will be, briefly, captivated. In just 67 pages (16 of which are glossy color photographs) Montgomery introduces us to her \u201cLadies,\u201d the ever-changing flock of hens she raised on her New Hampshire farm for decades starting in the 1980\u2019s. Blending her personal experiences as queen of the coop with everything you\u2019ve ever wanted to know about chicken behavior, it\u2019s a fun and informative way to spend an hour.",
      "Here\u2019s a sampling of what you\u2019ll learn: Chickens outnumber people 4:1, they have more in common, anatomically, with dinosaurs than humans, you can mail order up to 350 different varieties of chicks, and roosters really are much meaner than hens. Montgomery sprinkles in those facts and plenty more as she shares stories about how her chickens behaved over the years and what they taught her about \u201chow rich and varied their lives are, as fraught and joyous and changeable as our own.\u201d",
      "Montgomery is wary of anthropomorphizing her feathered friends, so while she names them, she also tells plenty of stories that could be rebranded for a TV show called \u201cWhen Chickens Attack!\u201d The funniest involves her minister, who makes the mistake of running his hand down one of the hens\u2019 backs, a gesture that makes them assume a distinctive mating crouch. Across the yard, Alex \u201csaw a moral travesty, an insult to his roosterhood: the minister was trying to have sex with his hen.\u201d The minister survives the bloody \u201cspurs first\u201d attack to the back of his calves, but learns to tend his own flock.",
      "\u201cWhat the Chicken Knows\u201d joins \u201cA Hummingbird\u2019s Gift\u201d and \u201cThe Hawk\u2019s Way\u201d as standalone mini-books pulled from the pages of \u201cBirdology.\u201d Each has a new introduction by the author and would make nice stocking stuffers for bird lovers in anyone\u2019s life.",

      "NEW YORK -- Reactions to the death of Quincy Jones, who died Sunday at age 91:",
      "\u2014 \"My beloved Q. The world\u2019s beloved Q. The one and only Quincy Jones \u201cdiscovered\u201d me for \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d movie in 1985. My life changed forever for the better after meeting him. I had never experienced, nor have since, anyone who\u2019s heart was so filled with love. He walked around with his heart wide open, and he treated everybody as if they were the most important person he\u2019d ever met. He was the Light. No shadows. He was love lived out loud in human form and he was the first person I ever loved unconditionally. That\u2019s how we signed all our notes to each other, \u201cUnconditionally\u2026\u201d Oprah Winfrey on Instagram.",
      "\u2014 \u201cHe was supremely talented, and I felt privileged to have known him for many years. He was friends with George Martin, the Beatles\u2019 producer and, between the two of them, produced some very fine music. Quincy or \u2018Quince\u2019 or \u2018Q\u2019, as he was known, always had a twinkle in his eye and had a very positive, loving spirit which infected everyone who knew him. His work with Michael Jackson is, of course, legendary and he had so many other strings to his musical bow,\u201d Paul McCartney on Instagram.",
      "\u2014 \"Quincy is the reason why I decided to become a record producer. His records were my go-to when I started engineering. All of the time that I spent hanging out with him was priceless and I love how open he was- the advice he gave me, the conversations we had have helped me in my life and career. Forever inspired by the incomparable Quincy Jones,\u201d Dr. Dre, on Instagram.",
      "\u2014 \u201cI was honored to call Quincy a friend. I will always remember his generosity of spirit, his selfless support, and his deep kindness. Our world has lost a giant. But in his melodies, and in the lives he touched, Quincy\u2019s legacy will live on forever,\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris, in a statement Monday.",
      "\u2014 \u201cQuincy Jones is the true definition of a Mentor, a Father and a Friend. He pointed me toward the greatest parts of myself. He defended me. He nurtured me. He encouraged me. He inspired me. He checked me when he needed to. He let me use his wings until mine were strong enough to fly,\u201d - Will Smith on Instagram.",
      "\u2014 \u201cI am speechless at the moment. What this man means to me goes extremely deep. What a life. What an expression of authenticity. What a teacher. I am humbled that I was given the gift of your openness and friendship. I am still processing,\u201d Lenny Kravitz on X.",
      "\u2014 \u201cMy fans know how important Quincy was to the fabric of my music. I was given the opportunity to write a foreword to his book and tried to capture what he meant to me as a human. Let\u2019s celebrate his life today,\u201d Abel Tesfaye/The Weeknd on X.",
      "\u2014 \u201cI woke up today to the Terrible news that we lost Quincy Jones.. Genius is a description loosely used but Rarely deserved. Point blank, Quincy was the MAN. I won my 1st Grammy with Quincy and I live with his Wisdom daily,\u201d Ice-T on X.",
      "\u2014 \u201cMy Celestial twin Quincy was a titan in the musical world. He was a wonderful and unique human being, lucky to have known him,\u201d Michael Caine on X (Both Caine and Jones were born March 14, 1933).",
      "\u2014 \u201cQuincy Jones was a musical genius who transformed the soul of America \u2013 one beat, one rhythm, and one rhyme at a time. ... He was a great unifier, who believed deeply in the healing power of music to restore hope and uplift those suffering from hunger, poverty, and violence, in America and the continent of Africa,\u201d President Joe Biden in a statement Monday.",
      "\u2014 \u201cHis music appealed to listeners of every race and every age. And by building a career that took him from the streets of Chicago to the heights of Hollywood, Quincy paved the way for generations of Black executives to leave their mark on the entertainment business,\u201d former President Barack Obama on X.",
      "\u2014 \u201cToday, we say goodbye to the legendary Quincy Jones\u2014a musical giant whose genius reshaped our world and left an enduring legacy. Rest well, Quincy. #legend,\u201d Morgan Freeman on X.",
      "\u2014 \u201cR.I.P to my mentor #QuincyJones, you\u2019re the reason I became a composer at 16\u2026 Long live the musical king,\u201d Wyclef Jean on X",
      "\u2014 \u201cHe asked, where are you from? Philly I replied, his eyes twinkled and he talked about the Uptown Theater. I was so thrilled to meet Mr. American Music himself. I literally kneeled because he was a King. Thank you Mr. Quincy Jones for giving us all the sound,\u201d Colman Domingo on X.",
      "\u2014 \u201cA masterful musician, composer, and orchestrator, who left his mark on the American musical culture. A man of soulfulness and swing. 'If music be the food of love , play on,'\u201d Wendell Pierce on X.",

      "\u2014 \u201cMy hero. truly one of the greatest minds the music world has ever known. he was so kind to me, so wonderful, such an influence. his legacy and his music will live forever. thank you for everything, Q. you were the dude,\u201d Harry Connick Jr. on Instagram."

      "The New York Philharmonic is firing principal oboist Liang Wang and associate principal trumpet Matthew Muckey after their union decided not contest the decision, which followed renewed allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse of power",
      "The New York Philharmonic is firing principal oboist Liang Wang and associate principal trumpet Matthew Muckey after their union decided not contest the decision, which followed renewed allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse of power.",
      "The orchestra said Monday it issued a notice of non-reengagement to the two effective Sept. 21, 2025.",
      "Wang and Muckey were fired in September 2018 following allegations of misconduct dating to 2010. Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians filed a grievance and the two were ordered reinstated in April 2020 by arbitrator Richard I. Bloch. Both men deny any wrongdoing.",
      "New York Magazine in April detailed allegations and the two were placed on paid leave. They then sued the orchestra and the union.",
      "Local 802's executive board said in a nine-page decision issued Tuesday that every member of the orchestra's nine-member dismissal review committee \u201cexpressed revulsion at the abuse of power and pattern of behavior.\u201d",
      "Philharmonic executive adviser Deborah Borda said 11 women made accusations against Wang and three against Muckey during the latest investigation.",
      "\u201cIt found that both gentlemen had been involved in sexual abuse and rape as well as abuse of power,\u201d Borda said. \u201cThis is all new information that came out and I think the reason is that people were afraid to speak up before and they are not now.\u201d",
      "Borda said some of the allegations were made by students.",
      "\u201cMatt Mackey has done nothing wrong,\u201d said Steven J. Hyman, a lawyer for Muckey. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019ve attempted to do this is of course violative of his rights. What\u2019s appalling is that the union has agreed to it, and the impact of that is that it renders meaningless this most precious right that orchestra members have of tenure, which ensures that you have a career at the philharmonic and can only be terminated for just cause.\u201d",
      "Alan S. Lewis, a lawyer for Wang, called the union's decision \u201cshameful.\u201d",
      "\u201cTroublingly, the philharmonic has gone down the road of public character assassination instead of due process, throwing a lot of mud against the wall to see what sticks,\u201d he wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Lewis described the most serious allegation against Wang involving a person unaffiliated with the orchestra and \"with whom, more than a decade ago, Liang had a long-term consensual relationship.\u201d",
      "He called the other allegations against Wang false.",
      "The philharmonic this spring hired Tracey Levy of Levy Employment Law to investigate and issued a letter of non-re-engagement on Oct. 15 following Levy\u2019s conclusions that the orchestra said were based on new accusations. Muckey said in his lawsuit the New York Magazine story contained \"a reiteration of the same 2010 allegations.\"",
      "The guild's executive committee decision said in Wang's case 11 witnesses \u201ctestified to specific instances of rape, sexual assault, grooming of a young female musician, inappropriate touching and comments, unwelcome kissing, and other sexually harassing behavior.\u201d",
      "The report said a woman six years younger than Muckey testified they \u201chad sex when she was 18 years old and was too incapacitated by alcohol to voluntarily consent.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile the allegations concerning Muckey are not as numerous as those involving Wang, we cannot ignore the fact that they demonstrate a similar abuse of power and failure to acknowledge the importance of a woman\u2019s consent to sexual relations,\u201d the report said.",
      "Under the orchestra\u2019s labor contract, the philharmonic must give notice of a non-reengagement by the Feb. 15 prior to the season in question. The two had the right to contest the decision, which the orchestra said must be \u201cappropriate\u201d under the collective bargaining agreement instead of a \u201cjust cause\u201d standard.",
      "\u201cLocal 802\u2019s decision is not to arbitrate the termination,\u201d local 802 president Sara Cutler wrote in an email to the orchestra members on Monday.",
      "The executive board's unanimous report said it was not determining whether criminal conduct took place but only \u201cwhether the notices of non-reengagement were appropriate.\u201d",
      "\u201cConsidering the 11 witnesses who testified about Wang\u2019s pattern of sexual violence and harassment over many years, we do not credit his denials or failure to remember these events,\u201d the report said. \u201cWith respect to Muckey, we similarly do not find his denials sufficient to overcome the testimony of the witness whom the investigator found credible and the pattern of conduct she described. Additionally, the lack of any contrition and the absence of any empathy shown towards the victims reinforces our view that the dismissal was appropriate.\u201d",
      "The report said two-thirds of the orchestra members had said they would refuse to appear on stage with the two.",
      "Muckey was hired by the orchestra in June 2006 and was given tenure in January 2008. Wang was hired as principal oboe in September 2006.",
      "\u201cThey are barred from the building,\u201d Borda said. \u201cThey will never appear on the stage again with the philharmonic.\u201d"

      "On the night before Election Day, at campaign events across the country, celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Lady Gaga and Jon Bon Jovi turned out in force for Kamala Harris ' presidential bid.",
      "The battleground state of Pennsylvania was particularly starry: In Pittsburgh, the vice president's rally featured Cedric the Entertainer, Katy Perry and Andra Day. In Philadelphia, the finale of Harris' daylong dash across Pennsylvania, performers and presenters included DJ Cassidy, Fat Joe and Ricky Martin, while Gaga sang a soulful \u201cGod Bless America\u201d and Winfrey brought first-time voters to the stage.",
      "Republican Donald Trump was decidedly unimpressed with Harris' celebrity lineup.",
      "At his own rally in Pittsburgh, which overlapped with Harris' event in the city, the former president criticized Harris for one celebrity endorsement in particular: Beyonc\u00e9. He spoke dismissively about Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s appearance at a Harris rally with Harris in Houston last month, drawing boos for the megastar from his supporters.",
      "\"Beyonc\u00e9 would come in. Everyone\u2019s expecting a couple of songs. There were no songs. There was no happiness,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 did not perform at the event but was joined onstage by her Destiny\u2019s Child bandmate Kelly Rowland, and gave a joyful, impassioned speech met with cheers.",
      "Previously, Beyonc\u00e9 allowed the Harris campaign to take on her 2016 track \u201cFreedom,\u201d a cut from her landmark 2016 album \u201cLemonade,\u201d as its anthem.",
      "Trump added that Harris should have learned a lesson from Hillary Clinton and had Beyonc\u00e9 speak after her, saying, \u201cThat way the people stay.\u201d",
      "In 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 performed at a campaign event for Democratic nominee Clinton in Cleveland in the days leading up to the election.",
      "\u201cThey booed like hell, but the press didn\u2019t play that,\u201d Trump continued in his description of Beyonc\u00e9's appearance at the Harris event.",
      "He insisted his campaign doesn't need celebrities to pack in a crowd, adding: \"We don\u2019t need a star because we have policy. We have great policy.\u201d",
      "At another point in the same rally, though, he enthused: \"So many celebrities here, it\u2019s incredible: Mike Pompeo, please stand up,\u201d introducing his former secretary of state.",
      "Trump also was joined by Megyn Kelly and baseball star Roberto Clemente\u2019s son.",
      "Harris lined up performers to speak and play at campaign rallies in all seven battleground states on Monday, and melded them all into one Democratic get-out-the-vote livestream.",
      "In Las Vegas, performers included Christina Aguilera and electro-dance duo Sofi Tukker. In Raleigh, North Carolina, Sugarland, the country music duo of Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush, took the stage.",
      "In Detroit, performers included Jon Bon Jovi, who sang a quiet acoustic version of his band's working-class anthem \u201cLivin' on a Prayer.\u201d"

      "Peter Ames Carlin writes a cultural history of the rock bank in \u201cThe Name of This Band is R",
      "The best way to read \u201cThe Name of This Band is R.E.M.\u201d is with a pair of headphones and a collection of the band's albums on streaming services or CDs. Opt for the cassettes or vinyl if you want to go old school.",
      "Peter Ames Carlin's book isn't just a cultural biography of the band going back to its formation in the-then sleepy college town of Athens, Georgia. It's also a poetic meditation on what made so many of the band's songs stand out, and continue to shine.",
      "\u201cIt was a new kind of post-punk, alternative music that straddled obscurity and directness, dissent and delicacy, unapologetic and unashamed pure pop,\u201d he writes about the reaction to the band's music in the early 1980s.",
      "Carlin's book offers plenty of behind the scenes details and trivia about R.E.M.'s rise. Fans will enjoy reading about how record executives were wary of making \u201cLosing My Religion,\u201d the band's iconic hit, the first single from its album \u201cOut of Time.\u201d",
      "It's also a fascinating history of a different era in music before social media created viral stars, when bands like R.E.M. rose up through college radio. The early sections of the book offer a vivid description of the music scene in Athens and the band's beginning.",
      "The book also explores the band's political activism, including their work on environmental causes and promotion of the Rock the Vote campaign.",
      "The band members didn't agree to interviews for Carlin's book, and that's one of the few weaknesses of what is an otherwise well-researched history. Anyone hoping to discover major new revelations about the band and its members will likely be disappointed, but Carlin ably demonstrates the impact R.E.M.'s music has had and why its history is worth revisiting.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 16:10:24 -0500",

    "story": [
      "Cillian Murphy went back to Ireland for his first film after \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d",
      "Cillian Murphy didn\u2019t read \u201cSmall Things Like These\u201d looking for a film to do. He was simply a fan of the author, Claire Keegan.",
      "Her story, nominated for the Booker Prize, was a work of historical fiction about the Magdalene laundries in Ireland and an ordinary man with repressed trauma who can\u2019t force himself to look away over Christmas in 1985. The beauty of the prose and complexities of the themes lingered in Murphy\u2019s mind. The Irish actor had also been thinking about starting his own production company. Miraculously, the rights were available.",
      "As a nod to the film, opening in North American theaters on Friday, Murphy and his producing partner Alan Moloney named their company Big Things Films.",
      "\u201cWe were like, if you call it Small Things Films, it would show a real lack of ambition,\u201d Murphy said with a little laugh. \u201cWe thought better call it Big Things Films.\u201d",
      "\u201cSmall Things Like These\u201d was made after \u201cOppenheimer\u201d but before the Oscar win, which Murphy is still processing. Work is keeping him busy, though. His company already has another film in post-production, \u201cSteve,\u201d based on Max Porter\u2019s novel \u201cShy.\u201d And in September, he started filming the \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d movie.",
      "Murphy spoke to The Associated Press, before heading off to \u201cPeaky Blinders,\u201d about being a \u201cserial re-collaborator,\u201d the humbling and passive experience of winning the Oscar and pitching Matt Damon the film during a night shoot on \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "MURPHY: It\u2019s a seemingly simple story, but it\u2019s actually incredibly complex the way it talks about society and complicity and shame and guilt and secrecy and fear and all those things. I felt like it had a lot to offer audiences.",
      "MURPHY: It\u2019s a male protagonist written by a woman, but it\u2019s a story about women. That was quite interesting and unconventional. And the story really begins when the film ends. The real drama happens afterwards. And I think that\u2019s just so unconventional and quite radical. The reason Bill is the man that he is, is because of what happened to him as a child and this act of charity that his mother experienced. And then these awful acts of cruelty that these other girls are experiencing \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s bringing him to this place in his life.",
      "Claire had actually said in a podcast, someone said \u201coh it\u2019s such an heroic act\u201d and she said \u201cno, he\u2019s not a hero, he\u2019s just someone who's having a nervous breakdown.\u201d I thought that was really smart. And that\u2019s kind of how I tried to play it.",
      "It all comes back, as it tends to with men, in middle age. They begin to really sense their mortality and they have kids of their own. That\u2019s when it all seems to come crashing down on them. And it\u2019s so beautifully observed by Claire and Enda (Walsh).",
      "MURPHY: I\u2019m a kind of a serial re-collaborator. I just love working with people again. And I really firmly believe you got the best work from trust and from friendship. Enda I\u2019ve worked with in a theater like four or five times and, and he\u2019s just generally brilliant. I knew that he loved Claire\u2019s book and that he would understand that world. And Eileen, it\u2019s very hard to act 20 years of history, but when you have 28 years of history, you get it for free. She\u2019s just a phenomenally powerful actor. She can kind of do anything.",
      "MURPHY: My producing partner was working with Matt on the U2 documentary about Sarajevo, and I was working with Matt on \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d It was a pincer movement. I remember it was like a night shoot in the desert somewhere, and we were waiting for the rain to pass or the lights to be fixed. And he was telling me about Artists Equity. I said well, I happen to have this script, and I gave it to him. He\u2019s got such great taste. He\u2019s such a great filmmaker and actor, just a legend and just a lovely human being. He just really understands these sorts of stories. And immediately he said, yeah, we\u2019re on.",
      "MURPHY: I\u2019m not aware of it, really, because it feels so brand new and so fresh. You know, it\u2019s very hard to kind of speak about it because it was a hugely humbling and almost passive experience, because you don\u2019t really have any control over other people voting on the work that you did. But if it allows us to tell the sorts of stories that I\u2019d like to tell, which have a point of view, which have something to say, then I\u2019ll take it."

    "summary": "Quincy Jones has died at age 91",
    "story": [
      "Quincy Jones has died at age 91",
      "Quincy Jones, the multitalented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson's historic \"Thriller\" album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.",
      "Jones' publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family. Jones was to have received an honorary Academy Award later this month.",
      "\u201cTonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones\u2019 passing,\" the family said in a statement. \u201cAnd although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.\u201d",
      "Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary musical catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song. For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who did not own at least one record with his name on it, or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who did not have some connection to him.",
      "Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for \"Roots\" and \"In the Heat of the Night,\" organized President Bill Clinton's first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of \u201cWe Are the World,\u201d the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa.",
      "Lionel Richie, who co-wrote \u201cWe Are the World\" and was among the featured singers, would call Jones \u201cthe master orchestrator.\u201d",
      "In a career which began when records were still played on platters turning at 78 rpm, top honors likely go to his productions with Jackson: \u201cOff the Wall,\u201d \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cBad\u201d were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones\u2019 versatility and imagination helped set off the explosive talents of Jackson as he transformed from child star to the \u201cKing of Pop.\u201d On such classic tracks as \u201cBillie Jean\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Stop \u2018Til You Get Enough,\u201d Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For \u201cThriller,\u201d some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing \u201cBeat It\u201d and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.",
      "\u201cThriller\u201d sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles\u2019 \u201cGreatest Hits 1971-1975\u201d among others as the best-selling album of all time.",
      "\u201cIf an album doesn\u2019t do well, everyone says \u2018it was the producers fault\u2019; so if it does well, it should be your \u2018fault,\u2019 too,\u201d Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. \u201cThe tracks don\u2019t just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.\u201d",
      "The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography \u201cQ,\u201d including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for \u201cRoots.\u201d He also received France\u2019s Legion d\u2019Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, \u201cListen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones,\u201d and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author.",
      "Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, once telling Oprah Winfrey that \u201cThere are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don\u2019t. Nothing\u2019s in between.\u201d Jones\u2019 mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem \u201csenseless\u201d for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting.",
      "\u201cThey nailed my hand to a fence with a switchblade, man,\u201d he told the AP in 2018, showing a scar from his childhood.",
      "Music saved him. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano.",
      "\u201cI went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \u201cThat\u2019s where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.\u201d",
      "Within a few years he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band.",
      "\u201cWe had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,\u201d Jones later told Musician magazine. \u201cThat\u2019s when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.\u201d",
      "As a music executive, he overcame racial barriers by becoming a vice president at Mercury Records in the early \u201960s. In 1971, he became the first Black musical director for the Academy Awards ceremony. The first movie he produced, \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d received 11 Oscar nominations in 1986. (But, to his great disappointment, no wins). In a partnership with Time Warner, he created Quincy Jones Entertainment, which included the pop-culture magazine Vibe and Qwest Broadcasting. The company was sold for $270 million in 1999.",
      "\u201cMy philosophy as a businessman has always come from the same roots as my personal credo: take talented people on their own terms and treat them fairly and with respect, no matter who they are or where they come from,\u201d Jones wrote in his autobiography.",
      "He was at ease with virtually every form of American music, whether setting Sinatra\u2019s \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d to a punchy, swinging rhythm and wistful flute or opening his production of Charles\u2019 soulful \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d with a lusty tenor sax solo. He worked with jazz giants (Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington), rappers (Snoop Dogg, LL Cool J), crooners (Sinatra, Tony Bennett), pop singers (Lesley Gore) and rhythm and blues stars (Chaka Khan, Queen Latifah).",
      "On \u201cWe are the World\u201d alone, performers included Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen. He co-wrote hits for Jackson \u2013 \u201cP.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing)\u201d \u2013 and Donna Summer \u2013 \u201cLove Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger) \u2013 and had songs sampled by Tupac Shakur, Kanye West and other rappers. He even composed the theme song for the sitcom \u201cSanford and Son.\u201d",
      "Jones was a facilitator and maker of the stars. He gave Will Smith a key break in the hit TV show \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\u201d which Jones produced, and through \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d he introduced Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg to filmgoers. Starting in the 1960s, he composed more than 35 film scores, including for \u201cThe Pawnbroker,\u201d \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d and \u201cIn Cold Blood.\u201d",
      "He called scoring \u201ca multifaceted process, an abstract combination of science and soul.\u201d",
      "Jones\u2019 work on the soundtrack for \u201cThe Wiz\u201d led to his partnership with Jackson, who starred in the 1978 movie. In an essay published in Time magazine after Jackson\u2019s death, in 2009, Jones remembered that the singer kept slips of paper on him that contained thoughts by famous thinkers. When Jones asked about the origins of one passage, Jackson answered \u201cSocrates,\u201d but pronounced it \u201cSO-crayts.\u201d Jones corrected him, \u201cMichael, it\u2019s SOCK-ra-tees.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd the look he gave me then, it just prompted me to say, because I\u2019d been impressed by all the things I saw in him during the rehearsal process, \u2018I would love to take a shot at producing your album,\u2019\u201d Jones recalled. \u201cAnd he went back and told the people at Epic Records, and they said, `No way \u2014 Quincy\u2019s too jazzy.\u2019 Michael was persistent, and he and his managers went back and said, `Quincy\u2019s producing the album.\u2019 And we proceeded to make \u2018Off the Wall.\u2019 Ironically, that was one of the biggest Black-selling albums at the time, and that album saved all the jobs of the people saying I was the wrong guy. That\u2019s the way it works.\u201d",
      "Tensions emerged after Jackson\u2019s death. In 2013, Jones sued Jackson\u2019s estate, claiming he was owed millions in royalties and production fees on some of the superstar\u2019s greatest hits. In a 2018 interview with New York magazine, he called Jackson \u201cas Machiavellian as they come\u201d and alleged that he lifted material from others.",
      "Jones was hooked on work and play, and at times suffered for it. He nearly died from a brain aneurysm in 1974 and became deeply depressed in the 1980s after \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d was snubbed by Academy Awards voters; he never received a competitive Oscar. A father of seven children by five mothers, Jones described himself as a \u201cdog\u201d who had countless lovers around the world. He was married three times, his wives including the actor Peggy Lipton.",
      "\u201cTo me, loving a woman is one of the most natural, blissful, life-enhancing \u2014 and dare I say, religious \u2014 acts in the world,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Along with Rashida, Jones is survived by daughters Jolie Jones Levine, Rachel Jones, Martina Jones, Kidada Jones and Kenya Kinski-Jones; son Quincy Jones III; brother Richard Jones and sisters Theresa Frank and Margie Jay.",
      "He was not an activist in his early years, but changed after attending the 1968 funeral of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and later befriending the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jones was dedicated to philanthropy, saying \u201cthe best and only useful aspect of fame and celebrity is having a platform to help others.\u201d",
      "His causes included fighting HIV and AIDS, educating children and providing for the poor around the world. He founded the Quincy Jones Listen Up! Foundation to connect young people with music, culture and technology, and said he was driven throughout his life \u201cby a spirit of adventure and a criminal level of optimism.\u201d",
      "\u201cLife is like a dream, the Spanish poet and philosopher Federico Garcia Lorca said,\u201d Jones wrote in his memoir. \u201cMine\u2019s been in Technicolor, with full Dolby sound through THX amplification before they knew what these systems were.\u201d",

      "New York pop-punk band State Champs\u2019 self-titled album is one fans of the genre have heard before",
      "New York pop-punk band State Champs\u2019 self-titled album is one fans of the genre have heard before \u2014 a band musing about awkward interactions at parties, overthinking their romantic relationships and scorning the mundane. Across 12 tracks, the album is charming, but unchallenging.",
      "Typically, when an artist chooses to name an album after themselves, they\u2019re communicating something \u2014 that this is their most definitive work, the release they most identify with. In the case of State Champs, the album released 14 years into their career stays true to the angsty identity they established in their early music, while expressing a reluctance to branch into something more.",
      "In a collective statement, the band described the record as embodying all of State Champs\u2019 discography, and it\u2019s true. The new album\u2019s tracks could belong to their debut EP in 2010 or their last album, 2022\u2019s \u201cKings of the New Age.\u201d There\u2019s something to be said for consistency, but overwhelmingly, their matured pop-punk coupled with risk aversion leans more into the safety of pop territory than punk.",
      "A good example of this is the first song, \u201cThe Constant,\u201d all peppy drums, sultry guitars and punctuating tambourines; it launches into an energy that is carried throughout the record. The instrumentals are edgy, but the lyrics are surface level. \u201cDo you think I deserve this/Keeping me in the dark/While you got what you wanted,\" frontman Derek DiScanio sings.",
      "He declares a similar thesis five songs in at \u201cToo Late to Say,\u201d over drum-heavy production: \u201cWhen there\u2019s a good thing coming/I turn around instead/I\u2019m getting good at ignoring it.\"",
      "Influences from iconic bands in the genre like All Time Low and Blink-182 are heard throughout. Lyrics are generic and universal, avoiding any real controversy. Even profanities are meticulously placed to be affectual and nonthreatening \u2014 even more reserved than what you\u2019d find on an Olivia Rodrigo record.",
      "Across the album, State Champs wrestle with self-doubt. It takes on a few forms. On \u201cJust a Dream\u201d and the closer \u201cGolden Years,\u201d the band is stuck on the past, unsure of the future. \u201c'Cause now it takes everything in me/Putting the past up on a shelf/And falling in love with something else,\u201d DiScanio sings on the latter track.",
      "But there are standouts, like the palm-muted power chords of \u201cClueless,\u201d driving bass of \u201cLight Blue\u201d and the explosive, lovesick brooding and gang vocals of \u201cSave Face Story.\" They\u2019re not reinventing the wheel here, but in those moments, their customariness works.",
      "Overall, State Champ\u2019s eponymous album colors comfortably within pop-punk\u2019s lines, choosing familiarity over experimentation. It makes for a predictable but enjoyable album, evoking the image of a suburban house party or while practicing tricks at the skatepark.",

      "A former Denver elections worker has filed a federal lawsuit, alleging she was fired for speaking out on TV about her safety concerns",
      "DENVER -- A former Denver elections worker who says she was fired for speaking out about her safety concerns on comedian Jon Stewart's show filed a federal lawsuit Monday, alleging election officials wanted to silence her and violated her First Amendment rights.",
      "Virginia Chau, a lawyer who worked as a polling center supervisor during elections, spoke in 2022 about threats made against election workers and the lack of training for them during a panel discussion on the short-lived streaming show \u201cThe Problem with Jon Stewart.\u201d",
      "Nationally, election officials have increased security in the lead-up to Election Day both to protect their workers and to protect voting procedures and ballots. Election offices and workers have been the target of harassment and threats since the 2020 presidential election, mainly by people supporting former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies that the election was stolen from him because of fraud.",
      "According to Chau's lawsuit, the Denver elections division director R. Todd Davidson told her she was being removed as a supervisor because of her comments on the show and said she could be a hotline representative instead because no one from the public would recognize her in that job. The move would have been a demotion, the lawsuit said, and Chau refused to accept the new position.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Denver clerk and recorder Paul Lopez did not respond to Chau's request to reconsider her termination.",
      "\u201cInstead of heeding Ms. Chau\u2019s call for more resources and training for election officials facing threats to their personal safety, Defendants decided instead to retaliate against one of their best, and most passionate, election workers,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The suit was filed against the city, its elections director and clerk and recorder. It asks for Chau to be reinstated and for unspecified damages.",
      "A spokesperson for Lopez's office, Mikayla Ortega, and a representative of the city attorney's office, Melissa Sisneros, said their offices do not comment on pending litigation."

      "TOKYO -- Nintendo, the Japanese video game maker behind the Super Mario franchise, said Tuesday that its profit fell 60% in the first half of the fiscal year, as demand waned for its Switch console, now in its eighth year since going on sale.",
      "Kyoto-based Nintendo Co. reported a 108.7 billion yen ($715 million) profit for the April-September period, as sales slipped 34% from the previous year to 523 billion yen ($3.4 billion).",
      "More than 74% of its sales revenue came from overseas, according to Nintendo, which didn\u2019t break down quarterly numbers.",
      "Global Switch sales during the period dropped to 4.7 million machines from 6.8 million units the previous year.",
      "But Nintendo said in a statement that Switch sales were still growing and vowed to stick to its goal of selling a Switch console to each and every individual, not just one Switch per every household.",

      "Few artists have legacies so mammoth their very name could be considered synonymous with the music industry, but then again, most musicians are not the prodigious producer Quincy Jones",
      "Few artists have legacies so mammoth their very name could be considered synonymous with the music industry, but then again, most musicians are not the prodigious producer Quincy Jones.",
      "The larger-than-life figure died Sunday night at his Los Angeles home, surrounded by his family. He was 91 and scheduled to receive an honorary Academy Award later this month.",
      "Across his career, the 28-time Grammy Award winning Jones worked with everyone from Ray Charles and Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson with hundreds in-between. The best way to celebrate his legacy, of course, is to listen to the music he made.",
      "Read on, and then listen to all of the tracks on our Spotify playlist, here.",
      "Those looking to kickstart their Jones listening journey at the very beginning of his career could do so with \u201cLiza,\u201d from his first album, \u201cJazz Abroad,\u201d a joint release with Roy Haynes. For everyone else, look to his arrangements on 1963's \u201cElla and Basie!,\u201d an album by Fitzgerald with Count Basie's orchestra. Moving from just vocals and bass before building into its own grandness \u2014 not to mention, a delightful scat solo from Fitzgerald \u2014 \u201cHoneysuckle Rose\u201d from the album is an exemplar of Jones' jazz brilliance.",
      "Teenage heartbreak met its match on Lesley Gore's \u201cIt's My Party,\u201d recorded when its pop singer was still in her own adolescence. Jones produced the record, with its addictive melodies, percussion and cheerful horn section \u2014 emotionally and diametrically opposed to its narrative tale of a girl getting dumped by her boyfriend for her best friend on her birthday. You'd cry, too, if it happened to you.",
      "Jones' legacy is defined by an idiosyncratic ability to master various American musical forms with an apparent ease. That is the case of this canonized cover by Frank Sinatra, \u201cFly Me to the Moon,\u201d from Sinatra's 1964 album, \u201cIt Might as Well Be Swing,\u201d arranged by Jones. The producer set the song to a punchy, swinging rhythm and wistful flute, and the rest is history. You can also thank Jones for \u201cThe Best Is Yet to Come.\u201d",
      "Jones scored the 1967 film \u201cIn the Heat of the Night,\u201d which includes its R&B-gospel title track, \u201cIn the Heat of the Night,\u201d performed by his good friend Ray Charles. It is soul committed to wax, amplified by the inclusion of a lusty tenor sax solo.",
      "Perhaps Jones' best-known production partnership is the one he had with Michael Jackson, working with the King of Pop on his culture-shifting albums, 1979's \u201cOff the Wall,\" 1982's \u201cThriller\u201d and 1987's \u201cBad.\u201d The pair met while working on the 1978 movie \u201cThe Wiz\" \u2014 Jones worked on its soundtrack, and Jackson was its star. \u201cDon't Stop \u2018Til You Get Enough,\" with its inventive disco-funk, ambitious production and Jackson's signature falsetto set the stage for the massive career to come.",
      "Put it in the pantheon of great piano ballads: On Jones' 1981 album \u201cThe Dude,\u201d James Ingram takes over lead vocal duties for \u201cJust Once,\u201d the big-hearted and bigger-feelings track.",
      "What songs are more immediately recognizable? An elongated drum and bass lick introduce \u201cBillie Jean,\u201d one of the great genre-averse pop songs of all time, from Jackson's record-breaking \u201cThriller\" album. Here, Jones' production is post-disco, but still funky, still prescient. And time tells the greatest tale: \u201cThriller\u201d sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles\u2019 \u201cGreatest Hits 1971-1975\u201d among others as the best-selling album of all time.",

      "Voters are getting a say on abortion policy in Tuesday's election with ballot measures and elections to offices from president to local prosecutors",
      "WASHINGTON -- Voters in nine states are deciding whether their state constitutions should guarantee a right to abortion, weighing ballot measures that are expected to spur turnout for a range of crucial races.",
      "Passing certain amendments in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota likely would lead to undoing bans or restrictions that currently block varying levels of abortion access to more than 7 million women of childbearing age who live in those states.",
      "The future legality and availability of abortion hinges not only on ballot measures, as policies could shift depending on who controls Congress and the presidency. Same with state governments \u2014 including legislatures that pursue new laws, state supreme courts that determine the laws' constitutionality, attorneys general who decide whether to defend them and district attorneys who enforce them.",
      "If all the abortion rights measures pass, \"it\u2019s a sign of how much of a juggernaut support for reproductive rights has become,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Law and an expert on the history of reproductive rights in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf some of them fail,\" she added, \"then you\u2019re going to see some conservatives looking for guidance to see what the magic ingredient was that made it possible for conservatives to stem the tide.\u201d",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on all seven measures that have appeared since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the nationwide right to abortion. That decision opened the door to bans or restrictions in most GOP-controlled states \u2014 and protections of access in most of those controlled by Democrats.",
      "The abortion rights campaigns have a big fundraising advantage this year. Their opponents' efforts are focused on portraying the amendments as too extreme rather than abortion as immoral.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Four more bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before women often realize they\u2019re pregnant. Despite the bans, the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen slightly, because of the growing use of abortion pills and organized efforts to help women travel for abortion. Still, advocates say the bans have reduced access, especially for lower-income and minority residents of the states with bans.",
      "The bans also are part of a key argument in the presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris calls them \u201cTrump abortion bans,\u201d noting former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in overturning Roe v. Wade. Harris, meanwhile, has portrayed herself as a direct, consistent advocate for reproductive health and rights, including Black maternal health.",
      "Trump has struggled to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights, leaning on his catch-all response that abortion rights should be left up to individual states.",
      "His shifting stances on reproductive rights include vowing in October to veto a national abortion ban, just weeks after the presidential debate when he repeatedly declined to say. Trump also has regularly taken credit for appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "Trump\u2019s attempt to find a more cautious stance on abortion echoes the efforts of many Republican congressional candidates as the issue has emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP. In competitive congressional races from coast to coast, Republicans distanced themselves from more aggressive anti-abortion policies coming from their party and its allies, despite their records on the issue and previous statements opposing abortion rights.",
      "While the ballot questions have similar aims, each one occupies its own political circumstances.",
      "There\u2019s an added obstacle to passing protections in reliably Republican Florida: Supporters of the amendment must get at least 60% of the vote.",
      "Passing it there and rolling back a 6-week ban that took effect in May would be a blow to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, who has steered state GOP funds to the cause and whose administration has weighed in, too, with a campaign against the measure, investigators questioning people who signed petitions to add it to the ballot and threats to TV stations that aired one commercial supporting it.",
      "Nebraska has competing ballot measures. One would allow abortion further into pregnancy. The other would enshrine in the constitution the state\u2019s current law, which bars most abortions after 12 weeks \u2014 but would allow for further restrictions.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure would allow some regulations related to the health of the woman after 12 weeks. Because of that wrinkle, most national abortion-rights groups are not supporting it.",
      "In some states, notably Missouri, passing amendments may not expand access immediately. Courts would be asked to invalidate the bans; and there could be legal battles over that. Clinics would need to staff up and get licenses. And some restrictions could remain in effect.",
      "Arizona, a battleground in the presidential election, bans abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The ballot measure there gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a strict abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "In the Democratic-controlled Colorado and Maryland, the ballot measures would largely put existing policies into the state constitutions, though Colorado\u2019s version could also remove financial barriers to abortion. It would take 55% of the vote to pass there.",
      "Measures maintaining access also are on the ballot in Montana, where a U.S. Senate race could help determine control of the chamber, and Nevada, a battleground in the presidential election.",
      "In Nevada, where control of the state government is divided, the ballot measure would have to be passed this year and again in 2026 to take effect.",
      "New York also has a measure on the ballot that its supporters say would bolster abortion rights. It doesn\u2019t contain the word \u201cabortion\u201d but rather bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d"

      "The former president was asked twice after casting his ballot in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday about a question that the state's voters are considering. If approved, it would prevent state lawmakers from passing any law that penalizes, prohibits, delays or restricts abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks.",

      "Pressed a second time, Trump snapped at a reporter, saying \u201cyou should stop talking about it.\u201d",
      "Trump had previously indicated that he would back the measure \u2014 but then changed his mind and said he would vote against it.",
      "In August, Trump said he thought Florida\u2019s ban was a mistake, saying on Fox News Channel, \u201cI think six weeks, you need more time.\u201d But then he said, \u201cat the same time, the Democrats are radical\u201d while repeating false claims he has frequently made about late-term abortions.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Nebraska will have a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot Tuesday, including two competing ones that address abortion rights. Nebraska is the first state to feature competing abortion amendments on the same ballot since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending the nationwide right to abortion and allowing states to decide for themselves.",
      "Initiative 434, which appears at the top of the ballot list, would enshrine in the state constitution Nebraska\u2019s current 12-week abortion ban, which the Legislature passed in 2023 and which includes exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to protect the life of the pregnant woman.",
      "Appearing last on the list is Initiative 439, which would amend the constitution to guarantee the right to have an abortion until viability \u2014 the standard under Roe that is the point at which a fetus might survive outside the womb. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation. The measure includes some exceptions, including allowing abortions later in pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant woman.",
      "Because they\u2019re competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the one that gets the most \u201cfor\u201d votes would be adopted, the secretary of state\u2019s office said.",
      "Elections officials expect the competing measures to help drive high voter turnout, along with the hotly contested presidential race.",
      "Abortion is on the ballot in several other states, as well. Coming into the election, voters in all seven states that have decided on abortion-related ballot measures since the reversal of Roe have favored abortion rights, including in some conservative states.",
      "The measure that would enshrine the 12-week ban in the constitution has been bankrolled by some of Nebraska's wealthiest people, including Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts, who previously served as governor and donated more than $1.1 million. His mother, Marlene Ricketts, gave $4 million to the cause. Members of the Peed family, which owns publishing company Sandhills Global, also gave $1 million.",
      "The effort organized under the name Protect Women and Children is heavily backed by religious organizations, including the Nebraska Catholic Conference, a lobbying group that has organized rallies, phone banks and community townhalls to drum up support for the measure.",
      "The effort to enshrine viability as the standard is called Protect Our Rights Nebraska and has the backing of several medical, advocacy and social justice groups. Planned Parenthood has donated nearly $1 million to the cause, with the American Civil Liberties Union, I Be Black Girl, Nebraska Appleseed and the Women\u2019s Fund of Omaha also contributing significantly to the roughly $3.7 million raised by Protect Our Rights.",
      "Two measures, Initiative 437 and Initiative 438, would legalize the possession and use of medical marijuana, and allow for the manufacture, distribution and delivery of it.",
      "Initiative 437 would let patients and caregivers possess up to 5 ounces (142 grams) of marijuana if recommended by a doctor. Initiative 438 would create the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, which would oversee the private groups that would manufacture and dispense marijuana.",
      "The initiatives have been challenged in court over allegations that the petition campaign to put them on the ballot broke election rules. That means a judge could invalidate them even if voters approve them.",
      "Also on the ballot, Referendum Measure 435 asks voters to retain or repeal a new conservative-backed law that allocates millions of dollars in taxpayer money to fund private school tuition.",
      "And Initiative 436 would require all Nebraska employers to provide at least 40 hours of paid sick leave to their employees."

      "PHOENIX -- Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution \u2014 a vote that could cement access after the presidential battleground came close to a near-total ban earlier this year.",
      "Arizona is one of nine states with abortion on the ballot.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates are hoping for a win that could expand access beyond the state's current 15-week limit to the point of fetal viability, a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Doctors say it's sometime after 21 weeks, though there's no defined time frame.",
      "Advocates also are counting on the measure to drive interest among Democrats to vote the party line up and down the ballot. When Republicans running in tough races address the ballot measure, they generally don\u2019t dissuade voters from supporting it, though some like Senate candidate Kari Lake say they\u2019re personally voting against it. GOP U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani, whose battleground congressional district encompasses Tucson, ran an ad saying he rejects \"the extremes on abortion.\u201d",
      "Arizona has been whipsawed by recent legal and legislative battles centered on abortion. In April, the state Supreme Court cleared the way for enforcement of a long-dormant 1864 law that banned nearly all abortions. The Legislature swiftly repealed it.",
      "In addition to the abortion ballot measure itself, the issue could sway state legislative races and lead to elimination of the voice voters have over retention of state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices.",
      "Arizona for Abortion Access, the coalition leading the ballot measure campaign, has far outpaced the opposition campaign, It Goes Too Far, in fundraising. Opponents argue that the measure is too far-reaching because its physical and mental health exemption post-viability is so broad that it effectively legalizes abortion beyond viability. The measure allows post-viability abortions if they are necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the mother.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, abortion-rights supporters prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions, including in conservative-leaning states.",
      "Voters in Arizona are divided on abortion. Maddy Pennell, a junior at Arizona State University, said the possibility of a near-total abortion ban made her \u201cdepressed\u201d and strengthened her desire to vote for the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cI feel very strongly about having access to abortion,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle Lee, an independent Arizona voter, does not support the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cAll abortion is pretty much, in my opinion, murder from beginning to end,\u201d Lee said.",
      "The Civil War-era ban also shaped the contours of tight legislative races. State Sen. Shawnna Bolick and state Rep. Matt Gress are among the handful of vulnerable Republican incumbents in competitive districts who crossed party lines to give the repeal vote the final push \u2014 a vote that will be tested as both parties vie for control of the narrowly GOP-held state Legislature.",
      "Both of the Phoenix-area lawmakers were rebuked by some of their Republican colleagues for siding with Democrats. Gress made a motion on the House floor to initiate the repeal of the 1864 law. Bolick, explaining her repeal vote to her Senate colleagues, gave a 20-minute floor speech describing her three difficult pregnancies.",
      "While Gress was first elected to his seat in 2022, Bolick is facing voters for the first time. She was appointed by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to fill a seat vacancy in 2023. She has not emphasized her role in the repeal vote as she has campaigned, instead playing up traditional conservative issues \u2014 one of her signs reads \u201cBolick Backs the Blue.\u201d",
      "Another question before voters is whether to move away from retention elections for state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices, a measure put on the ballot by Republican legislators hoping to protect two justices who favored allowing the Civil War-era ban to be enforced.",
      "Under the existing system, voters decide every four to six years whether judges and justices should remain on the bench. The proposed measure would allow the judges and justices to stay on the bench without a popular vote unless one is triggered by felony convictions, crimes involving fraud and dishonesty, personal bankruptcy or mortgage foreclosure.",
      "Shawnna Bolick\u2019s husband, Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick, is one of two conservative justices up for a retention vote. Justice Bolick and Justice Kathryn Hackett King, who were both appointed by former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, sided with the high court\u2019s majority to allow the enforcement of the 1864 near-total ban. Abortion-rights activists have campaigned for their ouster, but if the ballot measure passes they will keep their posts even if they don\u2019t win the retention election."

      "Supporters and opponents disagree sharply about the potential legal impact of the Equal Rights Amendment, also known as Proposition 1.",
      "New York\u2019s constitution currently forbids discrimination based on race, creed or religion. The amendment would add language that says someone cannot be denied civil rights because of their national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes or \u201creproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d",
      "Democratic leaders put the amendment on the ballot partly in hopes of boosting turnout by voters passionate about protecting abortion access, in an election year where U.S. House races in New York could help decide which party controls Congress.",
      "Several other states also have abortion-related constitutional amendments on their ballots Tuesday. Most of those ballot questions address head-on when it should be legal to end a pregnancy. But in New York, state lawmakers took the indirect approach of writing the amendment as an antidiscrimination measure.",
      "Democrats who support the amendment have argued that the new language would create a legal framework where any restrictions on abortion would amount to an unconstitutional form of discrimination in medical care. The New York City Bar Association has agreed with that assessment, as have some other legal experts.",
      "Still, the fact that the amendment itself does not use the word abortion has caused headaches for its supporters. It also opened the door for opponents to claim its other language would lead to a raft of unintended consequences.",
      "Republicans have run a strong messaging campaign against the amendment, choosing not to focus on what protections it might provide for abortion, but to target other parts of the proposal. Their main attack line has been to argue the amendment would provide a constitutional right for transgender athletes to play on girls\u2019 sports teams.",
      "They\u2019ve also argued that its language on national origin could result in noncitizens being allowed to vote, that its ban on age discrimination might take away price discounts for senior citizens, and that it could also wind up stopping parents from having a say in their child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Previous state court decisions have found that existing language in the state constitution bars noncitizens from voting. And the New York City Bar Association says the amendment would not block existing state laws requiring parental consent for a child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Legal battles are already underway in New York over whether existing state and federal laws give transgender people the right to play on sports teams that match the gender identity.",
      "Democrats in the state legislature voted to put the amendment on the 2024 ballot after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters elsewhere have shown support for abortion access in previous elections. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll recently found that 7 in 10 Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.",
      "Uncertainty over the New York amendment\u2019s impact on abortion was pronounced enough, however, that it caused even the state Board of Elections to throw up its hands. The board is responsible for writing simple explanations of proposed amendments that voters will see on their ballots. But rather than interpret the measure or include the word abortion in its description, the board decided to reiterate the amendment\u2019s language verbatim.",
      "Supporters of the amendment objected and filed lawsuit, but the judge in the case, David A. Weinstein, eventually declined to make the board rewrite its description, in part because he could not say for certain how courts would interpret the amendment\u2019s language.",
      "Abortion is currently legal in New York up through 24 weeks from the beginning of pregnancy. After that, it is only legal if the pregnant person\u2019s life, physical health or mental health is at risk, or if a medical provider determines the fetus is not viable. Although there is no defined time frame, viability is a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus.",
      "Democrats have firm control of state government in New York, making any new abortion restrictions unlikely in the near future.",
      "Backers of the proposal argue that if the amendment passes it would create a strong layer of abortion protections in New York that would be difficult for a future legislature to repeal. That's because New York requires the legislature to pass an amendment to the constitution two times before it goes to voters for final approval."

      "Demonstrators carried posters and signs through city streets, chanting slogans such as \u201cWe won't go back.\u201d Some men joined with them. Speakers urged people to vote in the election \u2014 not only for president but also on down-ballot issues such as abortion-rights amendments that are going before voters in various states.",
      "At the Women's March in Washington, feminist activist Fanny Gomez-Lugo read off a list of states with abortion ballot measures before leading the crowd in a chant of \u201cAbortion is freedom!\u201d",
      "In Kansas City, Missouri, rally organizers urged people to sign up to knock on doors in a get-out-the-vote push for an abortion-rights measure.",
      "Abortion rights has passed inflation as the top issue in the presidential election for women under age 30 since Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee against Republican former President Donald Trump, according to a survey of female voters by KFF.",
      "Ballot initiatives have surged in response to the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that ended the nationwide right to abortion and shifted the issue to states.",
      "Nine states will consider constitutional amendments that would enshrine abortion rights \u2014 Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada and South Dakota. Most would guarantee a right to abortion until fetal viability and allow it later if necessary for the health of the pregnant woman.",
      "A proposed amendment in New York doesn\u2019t specifically mention abortion but would prohibit discrimination based on \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d and \u201creproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d",
      "Some of Saturday's rally participants also advocated for LGBTQ+ rights, higher wages, paid sick leave and greater efforts against gun violence."

    "story": [
      "Some health officials say mpox cases in Congo appear to be \u201cstabilizing.\u201d",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Some health officials say mpox cases in Congo appear to be \u201cstabilizing\u201d \u2014 a possible sign that the main epidemic for which the World Health Organization made a global emergency declaration in August might be on the decline.",
      "In recent weeks, Congo has reported about 200 to 300 lab-confirmed mpox cases every week, according to WHO. That\u2019s down from nearly 400 cases a week in July. The decline is also apparent in Kamituga, the mining city in the eastern part of Congo where the new, more infectious variant of mpox first emerged.",
      "But the U.N. health agency acknowledged Friday that only 40% to 50% of suspected infections in Congo were being tested \u2014 and that the virus is continuing to spread in some parts of the country and elsewhere, including Uganda.",
      "While doctors are encouraged by the drop in infections in some parts of Congo, it's still not clear what kinds of physical contact is driving the outbreak. Health experts are also frustrated by the low number of vaccine doses the central African nation has received \u2014 265,000 \u2014 and say that delivering the vaccine to where it's needed in the sprawling country is proving difficult. WHO estimates 50,000 people have been immunized in Congo, which has a population of 110 million.",
      "Scientists also say there needs to be an urgent, broader vaccination effort for the entire continent to halt mpox's spread and avoid further worrisome genetic mutations, like the one detected earlier this year in Congo after months of low-level circulation.",
      "\u201cIf we miss this opportunity, the likelihood of another significant outbreak increases substantially,\u201d said Dr. Zakary Rhissa, who heads operations in Congo for the charity Alima.",
      "So far this year, there have been roughly 43,000 suspected cases in Africa and more than 1,000 people have died, mostly in Congo.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how past outbreaks, such as the one in Nigeria in 2017, can lead to larger global events if not effectively contained,\u201d he said. The 2017 epidemic ended up leading to the 2022 global outbreak of mpox that affected more than 100 countries.",
      "Rhissa said the decline in cases in Kamituga \u2014 where mpox initially spread among sex workers and miners \u2014 is an opening to put more programs in place for vaccination, surveillance and education.",
      "Georgette Hamuli, an 18-year-old sex worker, hadn\u2019t been aware of mpox until immunization teams arrived last week in the poor neighborhood where she works in Goma, the biggest city in eastern Congo.",
      "\u201cThey told us we're highly exposed to the the risk of infection,\u201d she said. \u201cWe insist on condoms with our clients, but some refuse ... if they don\u2019t want to use a condom, they double the amount they pay.\u201d",
      "Hamuli said she and other friends who are sex workers each received 2,000 Congolese francs ($0.70) from a charity to get vaccinated against mpox \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t the money that swayed her.",
      "\u201cThe vaccine is also necessary,\" she said. \"I think we\u2019re now protected.\u201d",
      "The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated Congo needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the virus, and another 7 million for the rest of Africa. So far, WHO and partners have allocated 900,000 vaccines to nine African countries affected by mpox and expect 6 million vaccines to be available by the end of this year.",
      "Mpox epidemics in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda had their origins in Congo, and a number of cases in travelers have also been identified in Sweden, Thailand, Germany, India and Britain.",
      "Fewer than half of the people who are most at risk in Congo have been vaccinated, according to Heather Kerr, Congo director for the the International Rescue Committee.",
      "\u201cWe only have a tiny amount of vaccines, and nothing for the kids,\u201d she said.",
      "The vaccines for Congo are largely coming from donor countries like the U.S and through UNICEF, which mainly uses taxpayer money to buy the shots.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting a charitable approach where we only see very small donations of vaccines to Africa,\u201d said Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University. \u201cWhat we need is a public health approach where we immunize populations at scale.\u201d",
      "Drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, which makes the most widely used mpox vaccine, said it would sell shots destined for Africa at the lowest price possible.",
      "The advocacy group Public Citizen published an analysis showing that UNICEF paid $65 per dose of the Jynneos mpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic, far higher than nearly all other vaccines used in public health programs.",
      "Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, an infectious diseases expert at South Africa\u2019s University of KwaZulu-Natal, said mpox outbreaks typically peak and disappear quickly because of how the virus spreads. This time, however, he said there are two complicating factors: the virus\u2019 transmission via sex and the continued spillover from infected animals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in new territory with mpox this time,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we\u2019re never going to solve this until we vaccinate most of our people.\u201d",

      "Orlando Harris\u2019 family pleaded with Missouri police to confiscate the 19-year-old\u2019s bullet-proof vest, ammunition and AR-15-style rifle. They knew his mental health was fragile after more than one suicide attempt. But the best officers could do in a state with some of the most expansive gun rights is suggest Harris keep the weapon in a storage unit.",
      "Nine days later, Harris entered his former St. Louis high school and declared, \u201cAll of you are going to die.\u201d",
      "A new 456-page police report details the efforts Harris' family took to try to take his gun away in the days before he walked into Central Visual Arts and Performing Arts High School on Oct. 24, 2022, when he killed a student and a teacher and wounded seven others before he was fatally shot by police.",
      "Missouri is not among the 21 states with a red-flag law. Also known as extreme risk protection orders, red-flag laws are intended to restrict the purchase of guns or temporarily remove them from people who may hurt themselves or someone else.",
      "The case highlights how hard it is for law enforcement to restrict gun access, even when there are clues something is deeply amiss.",
      "After an Army reservist killed 18 people in October 2023 in Lewiston, Maine, an investigation found missed opportunities to intervene in the shooter\u2019s psychiatric crisis. And before a 14-year-old was charged in a deadly shooting this fall at his Georgia high school, a deputy talked to him about an online threat and family warned of an \u201cextreme emergency.\u201d",
      "The investigation report in Harris' case shows the first time he attempted suicide was in the fall of 2021, just before he was scheduled to leave for college. Pandemic disruptions, the arrest of a friend in a homicide and a car wreck all may have contributed to his depression, his family and former boss told investigators.",
      "The police report makes no mention of him attending college. Instead, he worked in the cafeteria at a senior facility, where he sometimes discussed guns with coworkers.",
      "The following August he met with a Washington University psychiatry resident, telling her he thought about shooting people at his old school. He said those thoughts lasted for just one evening and went away, and that there was no planning and he didn\u2019t want to do it.",
      "But soon after, Harris began a countdown to the shooting. His plans included detailed maps of the school and a plan to target teachers, students and the LGBTQ community. He also had plans to burn down his family's home with them inside.",
      "The psychiatrist prescribed medications, but Harris didn\u2019t fill the prescriptions. The report says they developed an emergency plan.",
      "Washington University did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Harris then stopped showing up for appointments.",
      "On Oct. 8, he tried to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer in St. Charles, Missouri, but the transaction was blocked by an FBI background check. The report doesn't explain why, and police didn't respond to an email from the AP. The FBI merely provided a list of the 12 reasons for a denial with no other details.",
      "Then on Oct. 10, Harris drove to a nearby suburb to pay a man $580 in cash for the rifle used in the shooting.",
      "Harris\u2019 family grew more concerned on Oct. 15, when two packages from gun and ammunition suppliers arrived. One of his sisters, Noneeka Harris, opened them, finding a body armor vest, magazine holsters and magazines. She then searched his bedroom and found the rifle inside an old TV box.",
      "Harris' mother, Tanya Ward, called BJC Mental Health Services and staff there \u201cdeemed the situation as an immediate threat.\u201d They advised her to take the items to the police department and tell officers about her son\u2019s mental illness.",
      "Police at the station told her they couldn\u2019t take the firearm because Harris was of legal age to possess it. They said she should head home and an officer would meet them there. By the time she returned, Harris was home and insistent that he keep the gun.",
      "His mother was adamant that the gun not be in the house, so the officers suggested a storage unit. The report said the officers also advised her on steps she needed to take to have her son deemed mentally unstable.",
      "Federal law has banned some mentally ill people from buying guns since 1968, including those deemed a danger to themselves or others, who have been involuntarily committed, or judged not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.",
      "Ultimately, the firearm and other items were loaded into the trunk of Harris' sister's vehicle, including a box of ammunition that arrived the next day. She later drove her brother to a storage facility, which was about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the high school.",
      "She told police she \u201cknew something was going to happen.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 24, shots rang out as Harris entered his former high school.",
      "It is unclear why Harris targeted the school. A security officer recalled him as somewhat popular and his grade school principal said he wasn\u2019t bullied, according to the investigative report. But as he fired at a dance class, one student told police she heard someone yell, \u201cI hate this school. I hate everybody.\u201d",
      "Fatally wounded, Alexzandria Bell initially ran toward the entrance before slumping to the ground, a security officer reassuring the 10th grader that help was on the way. But then she went quiet.",
      "One class jumped out a window to escape after their physical education teacher, 61-year-old Jean Kuczka, stood between them and Harris. Kuckza was killed.",
      "Harris eventually made his way to the third floor, hiding in a computer lab. The first officer to charge into the lab had a daughter at the school.",
      "\u201cI had everything to lose,\u201d the officer, who was among those to open fire, recalled in the police report. He texted his daughter afterward, telling her, \u201cI killed him.\u201d",
      "Harris' sister told investigators that when she heard about the shooting, she started driving toward the school but then went home instead, waking up her mother who had worked overnight.",
      "Harris' mother later checked her voicemail. There was a message from a hospital asking if she still needed help with her son."

      "The debate over abortion rights is leading to expensive campaigns for state Supreme Courts in several states this year",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Abortion and reproductive rights have been central to the races for president and governor in North Carolina, a battleground state that has more moderate abortion restrictions than elsewhere across the South.",
      "That's been even truer in the fight for a seat on the state Supreme Court that abortion rights supporters say will play an important role in determining whether Republicans can enact even more restrictions. Registered Republicans currently hold five of seven seats and could expand that majority even further in Tuesday's election.",
      "Justice Allison Riggs, a Democrat who is running for reelection, is focusing heavily on the issue and touts her support for reproductive rights. Her first television ad featured images of Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the Republican nominee for governor, who prefers to restrict abortions earlier than the current 12 weeks. She says her GOP rival for the court could be a deciding vote on the bench for such restrictions.",
      "\u201cThis is an issue that is landing in front of state Supreme Courts, and it is one that is very salient to voters now,\u201d Riggs said in an interview.",
      "Her Republican opponent, Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin, said Riggs is saying too much about an issue that could come before the court.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an inappropriate manner, a clear violation of our judicial standards, our code of conduct,\u201d he said.",
      "The North Carolina race emphasizes how much abortion is fueling expensive campaigns for Supreme Courts in several states this year. Groups on the right and left are spending heavily to reshape courts that could play deciding roles in legal fights over abortion, reproductive rights, voting rights, redistricting and other hot-button issues for years to come.",
      "Experts say the campaigns show how the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning constitutional abortion protections that had been in place for half a century has transformed races for state high courts.",
      "\u201cWhat Dobbs did was made clear to both political stakeholders and the public that these state courts that hadn't got a lot of attention are actually going to be really important and they're going to be deciding some of the biggest cases that people might have expected to go to the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d said Douglas Keith, senior counsel in the judiciary program at the Brennan Center, which has tracked spending on state court races.",
      "Thirty-three states are holding elections for 82 Supreme Court seats this year. The 2024 election cycle follows record-breaking spending for judicial races in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania last year.",
      "Groups on the left have ramped up their spending on state courts considerably this year. The American Civil Liberties Union has spent $5.4 million on court races in Montana, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Planned Parenthood and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee earlier this year announced they were collectively spending $5 million, focusing on court races in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.",
      "\u201cWe have never invested this heavily in state Supreme Courts before,\u201d said Katie Rodihan, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Votes. \u201cThis is really a groundbreaking move for us, and I expect this will be the norm for us moving forward.\u201d",
      "The targets include Ohio, where Republicans hold a 4-3 majority on the court. Democrats are defending two seats on the court, while a third is open, and Democratic victories in all three races are considered a longshot in the Republican-leaning state.",
      "Control of the court could be key if the state appeals a judge's ruling that struck down the most far-reaching of the state's abortion restrictions. The ruling said the law banning most abortions once cardiac activity is detected \u2014 as early as six weeks into pregnancy and before many women know they\u2019re pregnant \u2014 violated a constitutional amendment approved by voters last year that protected reproductive rights.",
      "Two seats are up for election on Michigan's court, where Democratic-backed justices hold a 4-3 majority. Court races are technically nonpartisan, but candidates are nominated at party conventions. Republicans would need to win both seats to flip the court in their favor.",
      "Justice Kyra Harris Bolden is defending the seat she was appointed to two years ago by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Bolden was the first Black woman to sit on Michigan\u2019s bench. She faces Republican-backed circuit court Judge Patrick O\u2019Grady for the remaining four years of the eight-year term.",
      "Republican state Rep. Andrew Fink is competing against University of Michigan law professor Kimberly Anne Thomas, who was nominated by Democrats, for the other open seat that is being vacated by a Republican-backed justice.",
      "Michigan voters already have locked abortion rights in the state constitution, though groups backing Bolden and Thomas are framing the races as crucial to defending those rights, with one group\u2019s ad warning that \u201cthe Michigan state Supreme Court can still take abortion rights away.\u201d",
      "The most heated races are for two seats on the Montana Supreme Court, which has come under fire from GOP lawmakers over rulings against laws that would have restricted abortion access or made it more difficult to vote.",
      "Former U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerry Lynch is running against county attorney Cory Swanson for chief justice, while state judge Katherine Bidegaray is running against state judge Dan Wilson for another open seat on the court.",
      "Progressive groups have been backing Lynch and Bidegaray. Both said in an ACLU questionnaire that they agreed with the reasoning and holding of a 1999 state Supreme Court ruling that the constitutional right to privacy includes the right to obtain a pre-viability abortion.",
      "Groups on the right have been painting them both as too liberal and echoing national Republicans' rhetoric, with text messages invoking the debate over transgender athletes on women's sports teams.",

      "A super PAC backed by conservative donor and shipping executive Richard Uihlein also has given to groups involved in state Supreme Court races in Montana and Ohio.",
      "Progressive groups are even focusing attention on longshot states such as Texas, where Republicans hold all the seats on the Supreme Court. They're trying to unseat three GOP justices who were part of unanimous rulings rejecting challenges to the state's abortion ban.",

      "The last three hospitals still partially functioning in northern Gaza have been encircled by Israeli troops and caught amid fighting for weeks",
      "JERUSALEM -- They were built to be places of healing. But once again, three hospitals in northern Gaza are encircled by Israeli troops and under fire.",
      "Bombardment is pounding around them as Israel wages a new offensive against Hamas fighters that it says have regrouped nearby. As staff scramble to treat waves of wounded, they remain haunted by a war that has seen hospitals targeted with an intensity and overtness rarely seen in modern warfare.",
      "All three were besieged and raided by Israeli troops some 10 months ago. The Kamal Adwan, al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals still have not recovered from the damage, yet are the only hospitals even partially operational in the area.",
      "Medical facilities often come under fire in wars, but combatants usually depict such incidents as accidental or exceptional, since hospitals enjoy special protection under international law. In its yearlong campaign in Gaza, Israel has stood out by carrying out an open campaign on hospitals, besieging and raiding at least 10 of them across the Gaza Strip, some several times, as well as hitting multiple others in strikes.",
      "It has said this is a military necessity in its aim to destroy Hamas after the militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. It claims Hamas uses hospitals as \u201ccommand and control bases\u201d to plan attacks, to shelter fighters and to hide hostages. It argues that nullifies the protections for hospitals.",
      "\u201cIf we intend to take down the military infrastructure in the north, we have to take down the philosophy of (using) the hospitals,\u201d Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said of Hamas during an interview with The Associated Press in January after the first round of hospital raids.",
      "Most prominently, Israel twice raided Gaza City\u2019s Shifa Hospital, the biggest medical facility in the strip, producing a video animation depicting it as a major Hamas base, though the evidence it presented remains disputed.",
      "But the focus on Shifa has overshadowed raids on other facilities. The AP spent months gathering accounts of the raids on al-Awda, Indonesian and Kamal Adwan Hospitals, interviewing more than three dozen patients, witnesses and medical and humanitarian workers as well as Israeli officials.",
      "It found that Israel has presented little or even no evidence of a significant Hamas presence in those cases. The AP presented a dossier listing the incidents reported by those it interviewed to the Israeli military spokesman\u2019s office. The office said it could not comment on specific events.",
      "The Israeli military has never made any claims of a Hamas presence at al-Awda. When asked what intelligence led troops to besiege and raid the hospital last year, the military spokesman\u2019s office did not reply.",
      "In recent weeks, the hospital has been paralyzed once again, with Israeli troops fighting in nearby Jabalia refugee camp and no food, water or medical supplies entering areas of northern Gaza. Its director Mohammed Salha said last month that the facility was surrounded by troops and was unable to evacuate six critical patients. Staff were down to eating one meal a day, usually just a flat bread or a bit of rice, he said.",
      "As war-wounded poured in, exhausted surgeons were struggling to treat them. No vascular surgeons or neurosurgeons remain north of Gaza City, so the doctors often resort to amputating shrapnel-shattered limbs to save lives.",
      "\u201cWe are reliving the nightmares of November and December of last year, but worse,\u201d Salha said. \u201cWe have fewer supplies, fewer doctors and less hope that anything will be done to stop this.\u201d",
      "The military, which did not respond to a specific request for comment on al-Awda hospital, says it takes all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties.",
      "Last year, fighting was raging around al-Awda when, on Nov. 21, a shell exploded in the facility's operating room. Dr. Mahmoud Abu Nujaila, two other doctors and a patient\u2019s uncle died almost instantly, according to international charity Doctors Without Borders, which said it had informed the Israeli military of its coordinates.",
      "Dr. Mohammed Obeid, Abu Nujaila\u2019s colleague, recalled dodging shellfire inside the hospital complex. Israeli sniper fire killed a nurse and two janitors and wounded a surgeon, hospital officials said.",
      "By Dec. 5, al-Awda was surrounded. For 18 days, coming or going became \u201ca death sentence,\u201d Obeid said.",
      "Survivors and hospital administrators recounted at least four occasions when Israeli drones or snipers killed or badly wounded Palestinians trying to enter. Two women about to give birth were shot and bled to death in the street, staff said. Salha, the administrator, watched gunfire kill his cousin, Souma, and her 6-year-old son as she brought the boy for treatment of wounds.",
      "Shaza al-Shuraim said labor pains left her no choice but to walk an hour to al-Awda to give birth. She, her mother-in-law and 16-year-old brother-in-law raised flags made of white blouses. \u201cCivilians!\u201d her mother-in-law, Khatam Sharir, kept shouting. Just outside the gate, a burst of gunfire answered, killing Sharir.",
      "On Dec. 23, troops stormed the hospital, ordering men ages 15 to 65 to strip and undergo interrogation in the yard. Mazen Khalidi, whose infected right leg had been amputated, said nurses pleaded with soldiers to let him rest rather than join the blindfolded and handcuffed men outside. They refused, and he hobbled downstairs, his stump bleeding.",
      "\u201cThe humiliation scared me more than death,\u201d Khalidi said.",
      "The hospital\u2019s director, Ahmed Muhanna, was seized by Israeli troops; his whereabouts remain unknown. One of Gaza\u2019s leading doctors, orthopedist Adnan al-Bursh, was also detained during the raid and died in Israeli custody in May.",
      "In the wreckage from the November shelling, staff found a message that Abu Nujaila had written on a whiteboard in the previous weeks.",
      "\u201cWhoever stays until the end will tell the story,\u201d it read in English. \u201cWe did what we could. Remember us.\u201d",
      "Several blocks away, on Oct. 18, artillery hit the upper floors of Indonesian Hospital, staff said. People fled for their lives. They'd already been surrounded by Israeli troops, leaving doctors and patients inside without enough food, water and supplies.",
      "\u201cThe bombing around us has increased. They\u2019ve paralyzed us,\" said Edi Wahyudi, an Indonesian volunteer.",
      "Two patients died because of a power outage and lack of supplies, said Muhannad Hadi, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Palestinian territories.",
      "Tamer al-Kurd, a nurse at the hospital, said around 44 patients and only two doctors remain. He said he was so dehydrated he was starting to hallucinate. \u201cPeople come to me to save them. \u2026 I can\u2019t do that by myself, with two doctors,\u201d he said in a voice message, his voice weak. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, the Israeli military said it had facilitated the evacuation of 29 patients from Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals.",
      "The Indonesian is Northern Gaza\u2019s largest hospital. Today its top floors are charred, its walls pockmarked by shrapnel, its gates strewn with piled-up rubble \u2014 all the legacy of Israel's siege in the autumn of 2023.",
      "Before the assault, the Israeli army claimed an underground command-and-control center lay beneath the hospital. It released blurry satellite images of what it said was a tunnel entrance in the yard and a rocket launchpad nearby, outside the hospital compound.",
      "The Indonesia-based group that funds the hospital denied any Hamas presence. \u201cIf there\u2019s a tunnel, we would know. We know this building because we built it brick by brick, layer by layer. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Arief Rachman, a hospital manager from the Indonesia-based Medical Emergency Rescue Committee, told the AP last month.",
      "After besieging and raiding the hospital, the military did not mention or show evidence of the underground facility or tunnels it had earlier claimed. When asked if any tunnels were found, the military spokesman's office did not reply.",
      "It released images of two vehicles found in the compound \u2014 a pickup truck with military vests and a bloodstained car belonging to an abducted Israeli, suggesting he had been brought to the hospital on Oct. 7. Hamas has said it brought wounded hostages to hospitals for treatment.",
      "During the siege, Israeli shelling crept closer and closer until, on Nov. 20, it hit the Indonesian\u2019s second floor, killing 12 people and wounding dozens, according to staff. Israel said troops responded to \u201cenemy fire\u201d from the hospital but denied using shells.",
      "Gunfire over the next days hit walls and whizzed through intensive care. Explosions sparked fires outside the hospital courtyard where some 1,000 displaced Palestinians sheltered, according to staff. The Israeli military denied targeting the hospital, although it acknowledged nearby bombardment may have damaged it.",
      "For three weeks, wounded poured in \u2014 up to 500 a day to a facility with capacity for 200. Supplies hadn\u2019t entered in weeks. Bloodstained linens piled up. Doctors, some working 24-hour shifts, ate a few dates a day. The discovery of moldy flour on Nov. 23 was almost thrilling.",
      "Without medicines or ventilators, there was little doctors could do. Wounds became infected. Doctors said they performed dozens of amputations on infected limbs. Medics estimated a fifth of incoming patients died. At least 60 corpses lay in the courtyard. Others were buried beneath a nearby playground.",
      "\u201cTo see patients dying before your eyes because you don\u2019t have the ability to help them, you have to ask yourself: \u2018Where is humanity?\u2019\u201d asked Dergham Abu Ibrahim, a volunteer.",
      "Kamal Adwan Hospital, once a linchpin of northern Gaza\u2019s health system, was burning on Thursday of last week.",
      "Israeli shells crashed into the third floor, igniting a fire that destroyed medical supplies, according to the World Health Organization, which had delivered the equipment just days before. The artillery hit water tanks and damaged the dialysis unit, badly burning four medics who tried to extinguish the blaze, said the hospital\u2019s director, Hossam Abu Safiya.",
      "In videos pleading for help over the past weeks, Abu Safiya had fought to maintain his composure as Israeli forces surrounded the hospital. But last weekend, there were tears in his eyes.",
      "\u201cEverything we have built, they have burned,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201cThey burned our hearts. They killed my son.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 25, Israeli troops stormed the hospital after what an Israeli military official described as an intense fight with militants nearby. During the battle, Israeli fire targeted the hospital\u2019s oxygen tanks because they \u201ccan be booby traps,\u201d the official said.",
      "Israeli forces withdrew after three days, during which Palestinian health officials said nearly all of Kamal Adwan's medical workers were detained, an Israeli drone killed at least one doctor and two children in intensive care died when generators stopped working.",
      "Days later, a drone struck Abu Safiya\u2019s son in nearby Jabalia. The 21-year-old had been wounded by Israeli snipers during the first military raid on Kamal Adwan last December. Now he is buried in the yard of the hospital, where just Abu Safiya and one other doctor remain to treat the dozens of wounded pouring in each day from new strikes in Jabalia.",
      "The Israeli military said troops detained 100 people, some who were \u201cposing as medical staff.\u201d Soldiers stripped the men to check for weapons, the military said, before those deemed militants were sent to detention camps. The military claimed that the hospital was \"fully operational, with all departments continuing to treat patients.\u201d It released footage of several guns and an RPG launcher with several rounds it said it found inside the hospital.",
      "Kamal Adwan staff say more than 30 medical personnel remain detained, including the head of nursing, who is employed by MedGlobal, an American organization that sends medical teams to disaster regions, and Dr. Mohammed Obeid, the surgeon employed by Doctors without Borders who previously worked at al-Awda Hospital and had moved to Kamal Adwan.",
      "The turmoil echoed Israel\u2019s nine-day siege of Kamal Adwan last December. On Dec. 12, soldiers entered and allowed police dogs to attack staff, patients and others, multiple witnesses said. Ahmed Atbail, a 36-year-old who had sought refuge at the hospital, said he saw a dog bite off one man\u2019s finger.",
      "Witnesses said the troops ordered boys and men, ranging from their mid-teens to 60, to line up outside crouched in the cold, blindfolded and nearly naked for hours of interrogation. \u201cEvery time someone lifted their heads, they were beaten,\u201d said Mohammed al-Masri, a lawyer who was detained.",
      "The military later published footage of men exiting the hospital. Al-Masri identified himself in the footage. He said soldiers staged the images, ordering men to lay down rifles belonging to the hospital guards as if they were militants surrendering. Israel said all photos released are authentic and that it apprehended dozens of suspected militants.",
      "As they released some of the men after interrogation, soldiers fired on them as they tried to reenter the hospital, wounding five, three detainees said. Ahmed Abu Hajjaj recalled hearing bursts of gunfire as he made his way back in the dark. \u201cI thought, this makes no sense \u2014 who would they be shooting at?\u201d",
      "Witnesses also said a bulldozer lumbered into the hospital compound, plowing into buildings. Abu Safiya, Abu Hajjaj and al-Masri described being held by soldiers inside the hospital as they heard people screaming outside.",
      "After the soldiers withdrew, the men saw the bulldozer had crushed tents that previously sheltered some 2,500 people. Most of the displaced had evacuated, but Abu Safiya said he found bodies of four people crushed, with splints from recent treatment in the hospital still on their limbs.",
      "Asked about the incident, the Israeli military spokesman\u2019s office said: \u201cLies were spread on social media\u201d about troops\u2019 activities at the hospital. It said bodies were discovered that had been buried previously, unrelated to the military\u2019s activities.",
      "Later, the military said Hamas used the hospital as a command center but produced no evidence. It said soldiers uncovered weapons, but it showed footage only of a single pistol.",
      "The hospital\u2019s director, Dr. Ahmed al-Kahlout, remains in Israeli custody. The military released footage of him under interrogation saying he was a Hamas agent and that militants were based in the hospital. His colleagues said he spoke under duress.",
      "Hagari, the military spokesperson, said hospitals \u201cprovide a life of their own ... to the (Hamas) war system.\u201d He said hospitals were linked to tunnels allowing fighters movement. \u201cAnd when you take it, they have no way to move. Not from the south to the north.\u201d",
      "Despite often suggesting hospitals are linked to Hamas' underground networks, the military has shown only one tunnel shaft from all the hospitals it raided \u2014 one leading to Shifa's grounds.",
      "In a report last month, a U.N. investigation commission determined that \u201cIsrael has implemented a concerted policy to destroy the health-care system of Gaza.\u201d It described Israeli actions at hospitals as \u201ccollective punishment against the Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Some patients now fear hospitals, refusing to go to them or leaving before treatment is complete. \u201cThey are places of death,\u201d Ahmed al-Qamar, a 35-year-old economist in Jabalia refugee camp, said of his fear of taking his children to the hospital. \u201cYou can feel it.\u201d",
      "Zaher Sahloul, the president of MedGlobal who has also worked in Gaza during the war, said the sense of safety that should surround hospitals has been destroyed.",

      "PHOENIX -- PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent proponent of debunked public health claims whom Donald Trump has promised to put in charge of health initiatives, said Saturday that Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected president.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Kennedy made the declaration Saturday on the social media platform X alongside a variety of claims about the heath effects of fluoride.",
      "\u201cOn January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S\u200b. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,\u201d Kennedy wrote. Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, \u201cwant to Make America Healthy Again,\u201d he added, repeating a phrase Trump often uses and links to Kennedy.",
      "Trump told NBC News on Sunday that he had not spoken to Kennedy about fluoride yet, \u201cbut it sounds OK to me. You know it\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "The former president declined to say whether he would seek a Cabinet role for Kennedy, a job that would require Senate confirmation, but added, \"He\u2019s going to have a big role in the administration.\u201d",
      "Asked whether banning certain vaccines would be on the table, Trump said he would talk to Kennedy and others about that. Trump described Kennedy as \"a very talented guy and has strong views.\u201d",
      "The sudden and unexpected weekend social media post evoked the chaotic policymaking that defined Trump\u2019s White House tenure, when he would issue policy declarations on Twitter at virtually all hours. It also underscored the concerns many experts have about Kennedy, who has long promoted debunked theories about vaccine safety, having influence over U.S. public health.",
      "In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and continued to promote it even after fluoride toothpaste brands hit the market several years later. Though fluoride can come from a number of sources, drinking water is the main source for Americans, researchers say.",
      "Officials lowered their recommendation for drinking water fluoride levels in 2015 to address a tooth condition called fluorosis, that can cause splotches on teeth and was becoming more common in U.S. kids.",
      "In August, a federal agency determined \u201cwith moderate confidence\u201d that there is a link between higher levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQ in kids. The National Toxicology Program based its conclusion on studies involving fluoride levels at about twice the recommended limit for drinking water.",
      "A federal judge later cited that study in ordering the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to further regulate fluoride in drinking water. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen cautioned that it\u2019s not certain that the amount of fluoride typically added to water is causing lower IQ in kids, but he concluded that mounting research points to an unreasonable risk that it could be. He ordered the EPA to take steps to lower that risk, but didn\u2019t say what those measures should be.",
      "In his X post Saturday, Kennedy tagged Michael Connett, the lead attorney representing the plaintiff in that lawsuit, the environmental advocacy group Food & Water Watch.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine organization has a lawsuit pending against news organizations including The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy is on leave from the group but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",
      "What role Kennedy might hold if Trump wins on Tuesday remains unclear. Kennedy recently told NewsNation that Trump asked him to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and some agencies under the Department of Agriculture.",
      "But for now, the former independent presidential candidate has become one of Trump's top surrogates. Trump frequently mentions having the support of Kennedy, a scion of a Democratic dynasty and the son of former Attorney General Robert Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy.",
      "Kennedy traveled with Trump Friday and spoke at his rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin.",
      "Trump said Saturday that he told Kennedy: \u201cYou can work on food, you can work on anything you want\" except oil policy.",
      "\u201cHe wants health, he wants women\u2019s health, he wants men\u2019s health, he wants kids, he wants everything,\" Trump added."

      "A pig at an Oregon farm was found to have bird flu",
      "NEW YORK -- A pig at an Oregon farm was found to have bird flu, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday. It's the first time the virus has been detected in U.S. swine and raises concerns about bird flu's potential to become a human threat.",
      "The infection happened at a backyard farm in Crook County, in the center of the state, where different animals share water and are housed together. Last week, poultry at the farm were found to have the virus, and testing this week found that one of the farm's five pigs had become infected.",
      "The farm was put under quarantine and all five pigs were euthanized so additional testing could be done. It's not a commercial farm, and U.S. agriculture officials said there is no concern about the safety of the nation's pork supply.",
      "But finding bird flu in a pig raises worries that the virus may be hitting a stepping stone to becoming a bigger threat to people, said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University pandemic researcher.",
      "Pigs can be infected with multiple types of flu, and the animals can play a role in making bird viruses better adapted to humans, she explained. The 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic had swine origins, Nuzzo noted.",
      "\u201cIf we're trying to stay ahead of this virus and prevent it from becoming a threat to the broader public, knowing if it's in pigs is crucial,\u201d Nuzzo said.",
      "The USDA has conducted genetic tests on the farm's poultry and has not seen any mutations that suggest the virus is gaining an increased ability to spread to people. That indicates the current risk to the public remains low, officials said.",
      "A different strain of the bird flu virus has been reported in pigs outside the U.S. in the past, and it did not trigger a human pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt isn\u2019t a one-to-one relationship, where pigs get infected with viruses and they make pandemics,\u201d said Troy Sutton, a Penn State researcher who studies flu viruses in animals.",
      "This version of bird flu \u2014 known as Type A H5N1 \u2014 has been spreading widely in the U.S. among wild birds, poultry, cows and a number of other animals. Its persistence increases the chances that people will be exposed and potentially catch it, officials say.",
      "It isn't necessarily surprising that a pig infection was detected, given that so many other animals have had the virus, experts said.",
      "The Oregon pig infection \"is noteworthy, but does it change the calculation of the threat level? No it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Sutton said. If the virus starts spreading more widely among pigs and if there are ensuing human infections, \"then we\u2019re going to be more concerned.\u201d",
      "So far this year, nearly 40 human cases have been reported \u2014 in California, Colorado, Washington, Michigan, Texas and Missouri \u2014 with mostly mild symptoms, including eye redness, reported. All but one of the people had been to contact with infected animals.",

      "Louisiana\u2019s new law categorizing two widely used abortion drugs as controlled dangerous substances is being challenged in a state court lawsuit by a physician, a pharmacist, two women who had difficult pregnancies and others",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana's new law categorizing two widely used abortion drugs as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances\u201d was challenged in a state court lawsuit Thursday by a physician, a pharmacist and others who say the legislation sets up needless, dangerous delays in treatment during medical emergencies.",
      "Although there already was a near-total abortion ban in Louisiana, including by medication, the reclassification of the drugs \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol, which have other critical reproductive health care uses \u2014 went into effect earlier this month. Proponents of the law said more oversight and control over the drugs was needed to prevent coerced abortions. They have used as an example a Texas case in which a pregnant woman was given seven misoprostol pills by her husband without her knowledge. The baby survived.",
      "Doctors critical of the law have said it could harm patients facing emergency complications such as postpartum hemorrhages by requiring medical personnel to go through extra steps and more stringent storage requirements to use the drugs.",
      "\u201cEven short delays in accessing misoprostol can be life-threatening for postpartum hemorrhage patients,\u201d says the lawsuit. It says the law violates the Louisiana Constitution in multiple ways, including a prohibition on discrimination based on a person's physical condition.",
      "Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill said she had not seen the lawsuit as of Thursday afternoon. \u201cI can\u2019t respond to a lawsuit we have not seen, but I\u2019m confident this law is constitutional,\" she said in a statement. \"We will vigorously defend it.\u201d",
      "In addition to the physician and the pharmacist, who the lawsuit says is pregnant, the plaintiffs in the case include the Birthmark Doula Collective, an organization of people trained to provide pregnancy care before, during and after birth.",
      "Other plaintiffs include Nancy Davis, a woman who was denied an abortion in Louisiana and traveled out of state for one after learning her fetus would not survive. A woman who said she was turned away from two emergency rooms instead of being treated for a miscarriage is also part of the lawsuit.",
      "Prior to the reclassification, a prescription was still needed to obtain mifepristone and misoprostol in Louisiana. The new law reclassified the pills as \u201cSchedule IV drugs,\u201d putting them in the same category as the opioid tramadol and other substances that can be addictive.",
      "The new classification means that if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years.",
      "The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "The legislation is a first-of-its-kind law in the U.S. While GOP Gov. Jeff Landry, many Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion groups have touted the new classification, doctors have warned of deadly delays that the law could cause.",
      "Under the new classification, doctors say there are extra steps and more stringent storage requirements, which could slow access to the drugs in emergency situations. Beyond inducing abortions, the pills are also used to treat miscarriages, induce labor and stop hemorrhaging.",
      "Prior to the law, some doctors said that misoprostol would be stored in a box in the hospital room, on the delivery table or in a nurse's pocket. But under the new requirements of the classification, the drugs may be down the hall in a locked container or potentially in-house pharmacy at smaller hospitals.",

      "JACKSON, Miss. -- Mississippi's Republican legislative leaders said Thursday that they plan to push for Medicaid expansion to cover working people who earn too little to afford private insurance \u2014 a position that business groups have advocated but that Republican Gov. Tate Reeves opposes.",
      "House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann spoke about their 2025 policy priorities to hundreds of business people and community leaders at Hobnob, a social gathering hosted by Mississippi Economic Council, the state chamber of commerce.",
      "Medicaid expansion is an option under the health overhaul that then-President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the U.S., and it\u2019s one of 10 states that have not expanded the program. The vast majority of funding for the expansion would come from the federal government, but the state would have to cover some costs.",
      "Reeves, though, refers to Medicaid as \u201cwelfare\u201d and has frequently said he does not want more people to enroll. The governor usually speaks at Hobnob, which is held at the Mississippi Coliseum on the state fairgrounds. But he did not appear at the event this year.",
      "MEC and two other business groups \u2014 the Mississippi Manufacturers Association and the Business and Industry Political Education Committee \u2014 released a joint statement in April when legislative leaders were negotiating over the possibility of Medicaid expansion. The groups said expanding access to health care would lead to \u201ca healthier population, a healthier workforce, and an improved quality of life, all of which contribute to stronger Mississippi communities.\u201d",
      "The three groups said they trust elected officials and state agencies \u201cto use federal dollars responsibly.\u201d",
      "Reeves is in his second term as governor after two terms as lieutenant governor.",
      "Hosemann said Thursday that Medicaid expansion could help about 75,000 working people who can\u2019t afford insurance, and he noted: \u201cThere\u2019s a governor that doesn\u2019t necessarily agree with some of our proposals.\"",
      "White said he has heard politicians say elected officials should run the state like a business.",
      "\u201cProviding affordable access to health care for low-income workers is a smart investment in our workforce, and it is exactly the business-minded approach that all of you would take in your own individual businesses,\u201d White said.",

      "White said some of his other big goals for the session are phasing out the state income tax, reducing the 7% sales tax on groceries and enacting a plan to let children attend public schools outside the districts where they live.",
      "Hosemann said the Senate will propose a reduction in the grocery tax. He did not list a phase-out of the income tax or a school choice plan among his policy priorities. He mentioned that Mississippi is already in a years-long process of reducing its personal income tax under a law enacted in 2022."

      "Many refugees in Uganda are struggling to get by without the food assistance they once depended on",
      "RWAMWANJA, Uganda -- For months, Agnes Bulaba, a Congolese refugee in Uganda, has had to get by without the food rations she once depended on. Her children scavenge among local communities for whatever they can find to eat.",
      "\u201cAs a woman who\u2019s not married, life is hard,\u201d Bulaba told The Associated Press. Some locals \u201ckeep throwing stones at us, but we just want to feed our kids and buy them some clothes,\u201d said the mother of six, who often works as a prostitute to fend for her family.",
      "Uganda is home to more than 1.7 million refugees, the largest refugee-hosting country in Africa, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Despite being renowned for welcoming those fleeing neighboring violence, Ugandan officials and humanitarians say dwindling international support coupled with high numbers of refugees have put much pressure on host communities.",
      "Approximately 10,000 new arrivals enter Uganda each month, according to U.N. figures. Some have recently fled the war in Sudan, but most are from neighboring South Sudan and Congo.",
      "Bulaba is among tens of thousands in Rwamwanja, a refugee settlement in southwestern Uganda. As in other settlements across the east African country, refugees there are given small plots of land to cultivate as they are slowly weaned off total dependence on humanitarian food rations.",
      "Since 2021, as funding consistently declined, the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program has prioritized the most vulnerable groups for food assistance, in food items or cash, which can be as little as $3. After spending three months in Uganda, refugees are eligible to get 60% rations, and the number falls by half after six months. Only new arrivals get 100% food assistance, leaving the vast majority of some 99,000 refugees in Bulaba's settlement vulnerable to hunger and other impoverishment.",
      "In 2017, the Ugandan government and the U.N. held a summit in Kampala, the capital, and appealed for $8 billion to deal with the sharp influx of refugees from South Sudan at the time. Only $350 million was pledged.",
      "Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, visited Uganda last week in a trip partly aimed to underscore the funding shortage.",
      "The international community \u201cshould not take Uganda\u2019s generosity and the global public good it provides for granted,\u201d Grandi said in a statement at the end of his visit. \u201cServices here are overstretched. Natural resources are limited, and financial support is not keeping pace with the needs.\u201d",
      "He also said international support \"is urgently needed to sustain Uganda\u2019s commitment to refugees,\u201d urging donors and humanitarian partners to \u201ccome together with the government to address the needs of refugees and the generous communities hosting them.\u201d",
      "Refugees in Uganda have access to the same hospitals as locals, and their children can attend school. While this helps integrate them into the Ugandan community, sometimes the competition for limited resources sparks tension. However, violence is rarely reported.",
      "Hillary Onek, the Ugandan government minister in charge of refugees, said during Grandi\u2019s visit that local officials need support to help refugees become more self-reliant. Though he said the country was \u201coverloaded\u201d with refugees, he cited several training options to help refugees become self-sufficient, including carpentry, bricklaying and metal welding.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to be innovative,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the fact that funding for refugee programs dwindled over the years, there is not enough money to meet their demands, not even giving them enough food to eat.\u201d",
      "Onek said the alternative is \u201cto survive on your own, using your skills, using whatever capacity you have.\u201d",
      "But Bulaba, the Congolese refugee who has been in Uganda since 2014 after fleeing violence in her home country with her two children, said she can't find a job. She has since had four other children who often go barefoot and without appropriate clothing. She misses the cash-for-food stipend she used to get.",

      "Some people who took a new schizophrenia drug for one year improved with only a few side effects, but many dropped out of the research",
      "Some people who took a new schizophrenia drug for a year improved with only a few side effects, but many dropped out of the research, the company announced Thursday.",
      "The results underscore the difficulties in treating schizophrenia, a severe mental illness that can cause people to hear voices, feel paranoid and withdraw from others. High dropout rates are typical in schizophrenia drug studies.",
      "Finding a drug that works can be a long ordeal punctuated by crises and hospitalizations. Side effects of existing medications \u2014 weight gain, tremors, restlessness \u2014 cause some people to stop taking medicine and relapse.",
      "There's been great hope among doctors for Cobenfy, which was approved in September, because it acts in the brain differently than other schizophrenia drugs. Instead of blocking dopamine receptors, Cobenfy\u2019s main ingredient, xanomeline, works on a different receptor that indirectly blocks dopamine release.",
      "Cobenfy also contains trospium, which blocks some of the side effects. The most common are nausea, vomiting and indigestion. In contrast to the weight gain seen with other schizophrenia drugs, people lost a few pounds while taking Cobenfy, made by Bristol Myers Squibb.",
      "Dr. John Krystal of Yale University has led research on other schizophrenia drugs but was not involved in the new studies. He noted that just 10% to 20% of participants in the new studies dropped out because of side effects.",
      "\u201cThat is pretty good,\u201d he said, noting that fewer or milder side effects could mean people will stay in treatment longer. That could mean fewer problems associated with untreated mental illness: substance use, homelessness and unemployment.",
      "So why did some patients stick with treatment while others dropped out? Krystal said it will be important to understand more about that as doctors start prescribing the drug.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved Cobenfy on the strength of two encouraging company-sponsored five-week trials and other safety data. The latest results announced Thursday at the Psych Congress meeting in Boston come from two longer studies, providing a fuller picture.",
      "In one study, focused on severely ill patients, 78% dropped out, leaving only 35 people for the final analysis. In the other, focused on more stable people, 51% left the study, leaving 283 who took the drug for a year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not any higher or any lower than what we typically see\u201d in schizophrenia studies, said Dr. Greg Mattingly of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Mattingly is a consultant for Bristol Myers Squibb and a researcher on one of the studies.",
      "In the more severely ill group, 69% of people had a meaningful improvement in their symptoms at the end of the year. In the other group, 30% saw a meaningful benefit.",
      "Results of interviews with a sample of study participants conducted by an independent research team and shared by Bristol Myers Squibb showed the likelihood of continuing treatment. After six months, 36 said they would continue taking Cobenfy after the trial if given the option; 10 said they would not. Some participants said the drug reduced the voices while others said it didn't work for them.",
      "The estimated yearly cost for Cobenfy is $22,500 compared to $540 for a generic antipsychotic. Krystal and others worry that insurers will require people to try cheaper drugs first before covering Cobenfy. Most patients\u2019 out-of-pocket costs will be much lower, depending on insurance and other factors.",
      "One cheaper generic called clozapine is widely considered one of the best treatments for schizophrenia, Krystal said. It is underused in the U.S. compared to some other countries because of a cumbersome blood testing program.",
      "The FDA started the blood tests to watch for the risk of severe neutropenia, a rare side effect which can be fatal. But doctors and families have told the FDA that patients have relapsed when their clozapine was withheld or delayed because of the testing requirements.",
      "Sally Littlefield, 29, of Alameda, California, said what works for her is a monthly injection of a long-acting antipsychotic medication. Littlefield, who has schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, wants to learn more about the experiences of people who've taken Cobenfy and not just from players with a financial stake.",
      "Mindy Greiling of Roseville, Minnesota, wants to see data on how Cobenfy compares to clozapine, which works for her 47-year-old son, Jim. Weight gain was a problem for him, but since taking diabetes medication, he\u2019s back to his normal weight, Greiling said.",
      "Cobenfy \u201cis getting a lot of ballyhoo, as any new drug does,\u201d Greiling said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a nonstarter for me unless it turns out that it\u2019s better than clozapine.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- The British government has apologized for the death of a 9-year-old girl who is believed to be the first person in the U.K. to have air pollution listed on her death certificate, after a decade-long battle that highlighted the risks vehicle emissions pose to children in low-income communities.",
      "The apology was part of a settlement announced Thursday in a lawsuit filed by the mother of Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who developed severe asthma just before her 7th birthday and suffered severe seizures before she died on Feb. 15, 2013. The government also made an undisclosed financial settlement.",
      "\u201cAlthough this isn\u2019t going to bring Ella back, we finally accept this is acknowledgement of what happened to her, and to put the issue of air pollution firmly on the map, that it\u2019s a public health crisis \u2026 and something needs to be done about it,\u2019\u2019 Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, Ella\u2019s mother, said after meeting with government officials. \u201cToday it is finally over, but I am going to continue, and I have been reassured by the government that they\u2019re going to be continuing to work with me to clean up the air.\u201d",
      "Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah fought to reopen the coroner\u2019s inquest into Ella\u2019s death after the so-called Dieselgate scandal revealed how Volkswagen obscured the true level of emissions released by its diesel-powered vehicles. Research by the Royal College of Physicians later showed that about 40,000 deaths can be attributed to outdoor air pollution each year in the U.K., with the burden falling most heavily on low-income communities close to busy roads and other major sources of emissions.",
      "Ella grew up just 25 meters (yards) from the South Circular Road, a major conduit for traffic along the southern edge of central London.",
      "Britain\u2019s High Court in May 2019 set aside the findings of the original inquest, which attributed Ella\u2019s death to asthma.",
      "In December 2020, a second inquest found that air pollution was a contributing factor in Ella\u2019s death, along with acute respiratory failure and severe asthma.",
      "Throughout her illness, Ella was exposed to levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter that exceeded World Health Organization guidelines, Deputy Coroner Philip Barlow ruled. There was also a \u201crecognized failure\u201d to bring nitrogen dioxide levels within the limits set by European Union and domestic law.",
      "\u201cElla\u2019s mother was not given information by health professionals about the health risks of air pollution and its potential to exacerbate asthma,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cIf she had been given this information, she would have taken steps which might have prevented Ella\u2019s death.\u201d",
      "The child's estate, which is administered by her mother, sued the Environment Department, the Department for Transport and the Department of Health and Social Care for compensation over Ella\u2019s illness and premature death.",
      "The government on Thursday described Ella\u2019s death as a \u201ctragedy,\u201d and said her mother\u2019s public campaign for better air quality had \u201cmade a considerable impact.\u201d",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian troops have for the first time engaged with North Korean units that were recently deployed to help Russia in the war with its neighbor, Ukraine's defense minister said Tuesday.",
      "Another Kyiv official said Ukraine's army fired artillery at North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk border region.",
      "The comments were the first official reports that Ukrainian and North Korean forces have engaged in combat, following a deployment that has given the war a new complexion as it approaches its 1,000-day milestone.",
      "Neither claim could be independently confirmed.",
      "The Ukrainian and North Korean troops engaged in \u201csmall-scale\u201d fighting that amounted to the start of Pyongyang\u2019s direct involvement in Europe\u2019s biggest conflict since World War II, Ukraine\u2019s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov told South Korea\u2019s public broadcaster KBS in an interview.",
      "North Korean soldiers are mixed with Russian troops and are misidentified on their uniforms, Umerov was quoted as saying by KBS. That makes it hard to say whether there were any North Korean casualties, he said.",
      "Umerov reportedly said he expects that five North Korean units, each consisting of about 3,000 soldiers, will be deployed to the Kursk area.",
      "Meanwhile, Andrii Kovalenko, the head of the counter-disinformation branch of Ukraine\u2019s Security Council, said \u201cthe first North Korean troops have already been shelled, in the Kursk region.\u201d",
      "He provided no further details.",
      "Western governments had expected that the North Korean soldiers would be sent to Russia\u2019s Kursk border region, where a 3-month-old incursion by the Ukrainian army is the first occupation of Russian territory since World War II and has embarrassed the Kremlin.",
      "U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence assessments say up to 12,000 North Korean combat troops are being sent by Pyongyang to the war under a pact with Moscow.",
      "The Pentagon said Monday that at least 10,000 North Korean soldiers were in Russia near Ukraine\u2019s border.",
      "More troops from North Korea\u2019s 1.3-million-strong army may be slated for deployment in Russia, according to an analysis published Tuesday by the European Council on Foreign Relations, an international think tank.",
      "The ramifications extend far beyond Europe, it said.",
      "\u201cDespite integration challenges \u2014 including communication barriers and differing military doctrines \u2014 the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia represents a significant shift in European and Asian security relations,\u201d the analysis said. \u201cFor the first time in generations, troops from East Asia are actively engaging in a European conflict.\u201d",
      "The North Korean troops, whose fighting quality and battle experience is unknown, are adding to Ukraine\u2019s worsening situation on the battlefield.",
      "Ukrainian defenses, especially in the eastern Donetsk region, are buckling under the strain of Russia\u2019s costly but relentless monthslong onslaught.",

      "It said Russia has superior troop numbers, and despite heavy casualties the Kremlin\u2019s recruitment drive is providing enough new troops to keep up the pressure.",

      "LONDON -- Legislation intended to ban today\u2019s British children from ever legally being able to smoke began its journey through Parliament on Tuesday.",
      "The Tobacco and Vapes Bill would also bar smoking and vaping in some outdoor spaces such as playgrounds and the entrances to schools and hospitals. But a proposed ban on smoking in pub beer gardens has been dropped after opposition from bar owners.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the hospitality industry had \u201ctaken a real battering in recent years\u201d and it is not \u201cthe right time\u201d to ban smoking outside pubs.",
      "The bill also proposes to restrict vape flavors and ban bright vape packaging aimed at children, to combat \u201ca cynical industry that has sought to addict a new generation of children to nicotine,\u201d Streeting said.",
      "It also continues a plan by the previous Conservative government, which was ousted in July\u2019s general election, to raise the minimum age for buying tobacco by one year each year, so that no one born after Jan. 1, 2009 will ever be able to buy cigarettes legally in Britain.",
      "It is currently illegal to sell cigarettes, tobacco products or vapes to people under 18.",
      "If passed \u2013 as is likely because of the governing Labour Party\u2019s large majority in Parliament -- the bill would give Britain some of the toughest anti-smoking measures in the world.",
      "The government said the bill \u201cbreaks the cycle of addiction and paves the way for a smoke-free U.K.\u201d",
      "The number of people who smoke in Britain has declined by two-thirds since the 1970s, but some 6.4 million people \u2014 or about 13% of the population \u2014 still smoke, according to official figures.",

      "Nominees for some of the European Union\u2019s top jobs are facing parliamentary hearings",
      "BRUSSELS -- Nominees for some of the European Union\u2019s top jobs faced parliamentary hearings on Monday, as lawmakers start to vet would-be commissioners to oversee Europe-wide policies ranging from agriculture to trade for the next five years.",
      "Four of the 26 new members of the EU\u2019s increasingly powerful executive branch, the European Commission, were each to undergo a three-hour grilling by senior lawmakers most closely linked to their policy files. The others will be heard through to Nov. 12.",
      "The commission is the only EU body with the power to draft laws which, once passed by the European Parliament and the 27 member countries. They cover everything from water quality to data protection to competition or migration policy.",
      "Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, now into her second term leading an institution with more than 33,000 employees, assembled her new-look executive in September, seeking to balance sensitive political, geographical and gender concerns.",
      "The candidates, who are nominated by their national governments, must prove their general competence to handle their portfolio, a commitment to the European project, independence and good communications skills.",
      "A first candidate to make his case was Glenn Micallef \u2014 the would-be commissioner for youth, culture and sport \u2014 who hails from Malta, the EU\u2019s smallest country. Slovakia\u2019s Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, who has served as a commissioner in various capacities since 2009, was also questioned.",
      "Some candidates are deemed not good enough. Lawmakers might reject others as a show of strength. Three were vetoed in 2019. Sometimes portfolios are switched among the commissioners, or their responsibilities redefined, to satisfy the parliament\u2019s demands.",
      "But a chain reaction could be set off should any group take umbrage at their candidate being rejected.",
      "After each hearing, an evaluation is made by senior lawmakers behind closed doors. Candidates must win a two-thirds majority vote. If they don\u2019t, the parliamentarians can ask additional questions in writing or request a further 90-minute grilling.",
      "The vote results should remain secret until the entire hearing process ends next week. But given the high political stakes for each party group, lawmakers or parliament officials are almost certain to leak the news.",
      "The European People\u2019s Party (EPP) retained its position as the biggest group in the assembly following EU-wide elections in June. Fourteen members of its political family have been nominated to the commission, meaning that they have a good chance of passing muster. Von der Leyen is an EPP member.",
      "Other pro-European parties of the political center lost votes as the hard right gained ground, and the EPP can operate without its usual allies if needed.",
      "The EPP has already worked with the political extremes \u2014 including Italian Premier Georgia Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy, which has neo-fascist roots, and stridently nationalist lawmakers from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s ruling Fidesz \u2014 to secure majorities recently.",
      "Meanwhile, the second-biggest group \u2014 the center-left Socialists and Democrats \u2014 seems ready to rubber-stamp von der Leyen\u2019s team. Its leaders say it does not have a \u201ckill list\u201d of nominees that it intends to remove.",
      "Given the strength the EPP and the alliances it can form, it\u2019s unlikely that any nominees will be voted down. In that case, it\u2019s possible that von der Leyen\u2019s new commission would be able to start work in December."

      "The train station has been renovated twice in recent years. Critics of Serbia\u2019s populist government attributed the disaster to rampant corruption, a lack of transparency and sloppy work during the reconstruction. The renovation was part of a wider deal with Chinese construction companies.",
      "Opposition parties have demanded the resignation of top officials, including President Aleksandar Vucic and Prime Minister Milos Vucevic, accusing them of being responsible for the deadly accident. The opposition says Vesic is just a scapegoat for the real culprits behind the tragedy.",
      "Opposition groups plan to hold a rally on Tuesday in Novi Sad and more protests later if their demands are not met.",
      "Vesic said that he does not accept any guilt for the deaths of the victims.",
      "\u201cI cannot accept guilt for the death of 14 people because neither I, nor the people who work with me, bear even a shred of responsibility for the tragedy that happened,'' he said. \u201cI urge the authorities to determine as soon as possible who was responsible for this tragedy.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, angry protesters in the capital, Belgrade, left red handprints on government buildings, telling officials, \u201c\u201cYou have blood on your hands.\u201d",
      "The dead included a 6-year-old girl. The three injured, who are between 18 and 24 years old, all had to have limbs amputated. They were still in serious condition on Monday without improvement, doctors said.",
      "Populist officials have accused opposition parties of using the tragedy for political gains while pledging accountability. President Vucic on Monday promised those responsible will be punished.",
      "\u201cI am certain that the state authorities will determine criminal responsibility for the tragedy that happened in our country,\u201d said Vucic.",
      "Serbian prosecutors said they have already questioned more than 40 people \u2014 including Vesic \u2014 since opening the probe on Saturday. But critics believe that justice is unlikely to be served with the populists in firm control of the judicial system and the police.",
      "Officials have insisted that the canopy had not been part of the renovation work, suggesting this was the reason why it collapsed but giving no explanation for why it was not renovated.",
      "The Novi Sad railway station was originally built in 1964, while the renovated station was inaugurated by Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest."

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea fired a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea on Tuesday, its neighbors said, as it continued its weapons demonstrations hours before the U.S. presidential election.",
      "Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said at least seven North Korean missiles flew as far as 400 kilometers (250 miles) with a maximum altitude of 100 kilometers (60 miles). He said they landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s actions, including a series of repeated missile launches, threaten the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international community,\u201d Nakatani said.",
      "South Korea's military also detected several missile launches by North Korea and subsequently boosted its surveillance posture. The North Korean missiles could be used to target key facilities in South Korea, including U.S. military bases there.",
      "The launches came days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a flight test of the country\u2019s newest intercontinental ballistic missile d esigned to reach the U.S. mainland. In response to that launch, the United States flew a long-range B-1B bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in a show of force. That drew condemnation from Kim\u2019s powerful sister Kim Yo Jong, who on Tuesday accused North Korea\u2019s rivals of raising tensions with \u201caggressive and adventuristic military threats.\u201d",
      "South Korean officials have said that North Korea was likely to dial up its military displays around the U.S. presidential election to command the attention of Washington. South Korea\u2019s military intelligence agency said last week that North Korea has also likely completed preparations for its seventh nuclear test.",
      "Outside officials and analysts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win concessions such as sanctions relief after a new U.S. president is elected.",
      "There are widespread views that Kim Jong Un would prefer a win by Republican candidate Donald Trump, with whom he engaged in high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018-19, seeing him as a more likely counterpart to give him what he wants than Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. During campaigning, Harris said she won\u2019t \u201ccozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un who are rooting for Trump.\u201d",
      "North Korea claimed that the Hwasong-19 it tested on Oct. 31 was \u201cthe world\u2019s strongest\u201d ICBM, but experts say the solid-fuel missile is too big to be useful in war. Experts say North Korea has yet to acquire some critical technologies to build a functioning ICBM, such as ensuring that the warhead survives the harsh conditions of atmospheric re-entry.",
      "Tensions between the Koreas are at their highest point in years as Kim has repeatedly flaunted his expanding nuclear weapon and missile programs, while reportedly providing Russia with munitions and troops to support President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "On Monday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters that as many as 10,000 North Korean soldiers were in Russia\u2019s Kursk region near Ukraine\u2019s border and were preparing to join Moscow\u2019s fight against Ukraine in the coming days. If they engage in combat, it would be North Korea\u2019s first participation in a large-scale conflict since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.",
      "After a meeting in Seoul on Monday, senior South Korean and European Union officials expressed concerns about Russia\u2019s possible transfer of technology to North Korea to enhance its nuclear program in exchange for its troops. Such transfers would \u201cjeopardize the international non-proliferation efforts and threaten peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and across the globe,\u201d they said.",
      "In response to North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear threat, South Korea, the United States and Japan have been expanding their combined military exercises. North Korea has portrayed such U.S.-led military drills as rehearsals for an invasion and used them to justify its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles.",

Security Council meeting Monday, North Korea\u2019s ambassador, Kim Song, defended the North's nuclear and ICBM programs as a necessary response to what it perceives as nuclear threats from the United States.

      "As millions of Americans gear up to cast ballots in U.S. elections, Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, has people rooting for her from thousands of miles away in a tiny south Indian village",
      "THULASENDRAPURAM, India -- The temple reverberated with rhythmic Sanskrit and Tamil hymns, as a Hindu priest held a flame before the god. As this tiny South Indian village gathered to pray for Kamala Harris, a gaggle of reporters jostled for space and camera angles.",
      "There's little to distinguish the village of Thulasendrapuram from any other rural community in Tamil Nadu, except its connection to a woman who could become America's first leader with South Asian roots.",
      "As millions of Americans vote, Harris has people rooting for her from thousands of miles away in a village surrounded by rice paddies and coconut trees, where her mother's family has ancestral ties. They talk about her at the local tea shop. Banners and billboards bearing her face are seen throughout the community.",
      "\u201cOur deity is a very powerful God. If we pray well to him, he will make her victorious,\u201d said M. Natarajan, the temple priest that led the prayers in front of the image of Hindu deity Ayyanar, a form of Lord Shiva.",
      "Harris\u2019 maternal grandfather was born in the village, about 350 kilometers (215 miles) from the southern coastal city of Chennai, more than 100 years ago. As an adult, he moved to Chennai, where he worked as a high-ranking government official until his retirement.",
      "Harris has never visited Thulasendrapuram and she has no living relatives in the village, but people here still venerate the family that made it big in the U.S.",
      "\u201cOur village ancestors' granddaughter is running as a U.S. presidential candidate. Her victory will be happy news for every one of us,\u201d Natarajan said.",
      "The village's sudden fame has helped bring money into the village. Recently, construction began on a water storage tank with funds donated by a local bank. Village residents say it will carry a plaque with Harris\u2019 name.",
      "Harris\u2019 late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was born in India. After moving to the U.S. to study, she married a Jamaican man, and they named their daughter Kamala, a Sanskrit word for \u201clotus flower.\u201d",
      "Other than trips during her childhood, Harris hasn\u2019t visited India much \u2014 particularly not since becoming vice president \u2014 but she has often spoken emotionally about her ties to her late mother\u2019s country of birth. On Tuesday, she released a campaign video highlighting her mother, who arrived in the U.S. at age 19 and became a cancer researcher.",
      "Titled \u201cMother,\u201d the video ends with a narrator saying: \u201cThis daughter of Shyamala, this daughter of the American story, is ready to lead us forward.\u201d",
      "Harris has often talked about how she was guided by the values of her Indian-born grandfather and mother. She has also spoken of her love of south Indian food, especially a type of steamed rice cake called idli.",
      "Harris\u2019 name is engraved in a list of donors \u2014 her aunt Sarala Gopalan gave money to the temple in her name \u2014 along with that of her grandfather. Outside, a large banner wishes \u201cthe daughter of the land\u201d success in the election.",
      "On Tuesday, the village temple also received rare international visitors: two American tourists and one from the U.K., all wearing black t-shirts that said \u201cKamala Freakin Harris.\u201d",
      "Manikandan Ganesan, a villager who runs a small store near the temple, said Harris\u2019 bid for the presidency has made the village famous. He hopes Harris will eventually visit them.",
      "\u201cEven if she mentioned that she would visit our village, it would make us very happy,\u201d Ganesan said. \u201cHer victory itself will be a big source of happiness for us.\u201d",
      "Village residents also prayed for Harris\u2019 victory in 2020, and set off firecrackers when she became the U.S. Vice President.",
      "For women of the village, the candidate's journey is a source of inspiration.",
      "Local politician Arulmozhi Sudhakar said Harris embodies a significant step toward female empowerment in places like Thulasendrapuram, where a majority of women continue to face discrimination and gender inequality.",
      "\u201cFrom the time when women were not even allowed to step out of their house, to now a woman from our village contesting in the U.S. presidential election \u2014 this brings happiness for us,\u201d Sudhakar said. \u201cThe coming generations will see her as a role model to succeed in life.\u201d"

      "Palestinian officials say an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza has killed at least 20 people, mostly women and children",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza killed at least 20 people, mostly women and children, Palestinian officials said Tuesday, as Palestinians fled Israel\u2019s assault. Some said they had hardly eaten, with aid cut off for weeks to the most isolated and heavily destroyed part of the territory.",
      "Israel has been waging an offensive in Gaza\u2019s northernmost end for weeks, saying it is targeting Hamas militants who regrouped in the area.",
      "The U.N. has said Israel hasn\u2019t allowed food and other supplies into the area north of Gaza City since the assault began, even as tens of thousands of people remain there. That has drawn rebukes from the Biden administration, which has warned that U.S. laws might force it to curb military aid to Israel if more aid is not allowed in.",
      "The strike late Monday hit a home where several displaced families were sheltering in the town of Beit Lahiya, near the border with Israel, according to Hossam Abu Safiya, the director of the recently raided and barely functioning Kamal Adwan Hospital, which received the casualties.",
      "The Israeli military said it targeted a weapons storage facility from which a militant had operated, and that \u201cnumerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians.\u201d",
      "The dead included eight women and six children, according to a list provided by the Gaza Health Ministry\u2019s emergency service. Separate strikes elsewhere in Gaza early Tuesday killed another 10 people, according to health officials.",
      "Dozens of Palestinians trickled out of Beit Lahiya on Tuesday \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 dragging rucksacks and satchels with belongings. They entered Gaza City on a street where every building had been completely flattened or heavily damaged.",
      "\u201cWe came barefoot. We have no sandals, no clothes, nothing. We have no money. There is no food or drink,\u201d said Huda Abu Laila.",
      "\u201cWe are hungry. Hunger has killed us. We were under siege for one month without water or food,\u201d the gaunt elderly women continued, before erupting in tears.",
      "Um Nidal Abu Laila, another woman fleeing Beit Lahiya, said there were bodies of Palestinians killed in the assault lying in the streets. \u201cNo one is able to retrieve them,\u201d she said.",
      "Gaza\u2019s civil defense agency said it had received reports of people trapped alive under the rubble of buildings destroyed by Israeli troops in Beit Lahiya, but it was unable to send teams to rescue them. It said the military has prevented its teams from operating in the area for the past two weeks. The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said there are no ambulances currently operating north of Gaza City.",
      "Two elderly patients, one who was battling cancer, died as they tried to leave Beit Lahiya as they waited to cross an Israeli military checkpoint, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.",
      "The military has ordered the complete evacuation of Beit Lahiya, the nearby town of Beit Hanoun and the urban Jabaliya refugee camp. Still, the U.N. estimated last week that around 100,000 people remain there even after tens of thousands fled the past month, the latest wave of displacement within the besieged territory. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million have fled during the 13-month-old war, often multiple times.",
      "The army has returned to several areas of Gaza multiple times after previous operations, as Hamas continues to carry out hit-and-run attacks on troops and fire occasional rockets into Israel.",
      "The three hospitals serving the area have been largely inaccessible because of the fighting, and ambulances have stopped operating. Israeli troops raided Kamal Adwan Hospital last month, saying Hamas militants were sheltering there, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials.",
      "The offensive has raised fears among Palestinians that Israel is implementing a surrender-or-starve plan for northern Gaza proposed by former generals, in which civilians would be ordered out, aid would be cut off and anyone remaining would be considered a fighter.",
      "The Israeli military has denied receiving such orders, but the government has not said whether it is adopting part or all of the plan.",
      "Early Tuesday, an Israeli strike hit a house in the Tufah neighborhood in Gaza City, killing two children and their parents, according to the Health Ministry\u2019s emergency service. Two other children were wounded, it said.",
      "In the central town of Zuweida, a strike hit a tent where a displaced family was sheltering, killing four people, including a mother and her two children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah. Another strike hit a house in Deir al-Balah, killing two people, the hospital said. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue.",
      "The Israeli military says it only targets militants and accuses them of hiding among civilians. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, taking another 250 people hostage. Around 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its toll but says over half of those killed were women and children.",

    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer says he will double funding for Britain\u2019s border security agency and treat people-smuggling gangs like terror networks",
      "LONDON -- People-smuggling gangs sending migrants across the English Channel in small boats are a serious threat to global security and should be treated like terror networks, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told an international law-enforcement conference on Monday.",
      "Starmer told a meeting of the international police organization Interpol that \u201cthe world needs to wake up to the severity of this challenge.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople-smuggling should be viewed as a global security threat similar to terrorism,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer, a former chief prosecutor for England and Wales, said his government would be \u201ctaking our approach to counterterrorism, which we know works, and applying it to the gangs.\u201d That means more cooperation between law enforcement agencies, closer coordination with other countries and unspecified \u201cenhanced\u201d powers for law enforcement, he said.",
      "Starmer said that in counterterrorism operations, \u201cwe can shut down their bank account, cut off their internet access and arrest them for making preparations to act before an attack has taken place.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd we need to stop people-smuggling gangs before they act too,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer also announced plans to increase the U.K. Border Security Command\u2019s two-year budget from 75 million pounds ($97 million) to 150 million pounds ($194 million). The money will be used to fund high-tech surveillance equipment and 100 specialist investigators.",
      "Senior police and government officials from Interpol\u2019s 196 member nations are attending the global police body\u2019s four-day congress in Glasgow, Scotland. Starmer and British Home Secretary Yvette Cooper both addressed the meeting, calling for stronger international policing cooperation to fight drug trafficking and child sexual abuse, as well as people-smuggling.",
      "Britain\u2019s 2020 departure from the European Union complicated international cooperation on law-enforcement by taking the U.K. out of the bloc\u2019s police agency, Europol. Starmer\u2019s Labour Party opposed Brexit, but says it will not try to reverse the decision to leave the bloc.",
      "Starmer said he is seeking a new security pact with the EU that would restore real-time intelligence sharing.",
      "Like previous Conservative British governments, Starmer\u2019s administration is struggling to stop thousands of people fleeing war and poverty from trying reach the U.K. from France in flimsy, overcrowded boats.",
      "Europe\u2019s increasingly strict asylum rules, growing xenophobia and hostile treatment of migrants are pushing many migrants north. While the U.K. government has been hostile, too, many migrants have family or friends in the U.K. and believe they will have more opportunities there.",
      "More than 31,000 migrants have made the perilous crossing of one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes so far this year, more than in all of 2023, though fewer than in 2022. At least 56 people have perished in the attempts this year, according to French officials, making 2024 the deadliest since the number of channel crossings began surging in 2018.",
      "Starmer, who leads a center-left government, has raised some eyebrows in September when he visited Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and praised her nationalist conservative government\u2019s \u201cremarkable\u201d progress in reducing the number of migrants reaching Italy\u2019s shores by boat.",
      "Starmer argued Monday that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing progressive about turning a blind eye as men, women and children die in the channel.\u201d",
      "The opposition Conservative Party argues that Starmer should not have scrapped the previous government\u2019s plan to send some asylum-seekers who reach Britain by boat on one-way trips to Rwanda. Supporters of the proposal say it would act as a deterrent. Human rights groups and many lawyers say it is unethical and unlawful to send migrants thousands of miles to a country they don\u2019t want to live in.",
      "Starmer called the plan a \u201cgimmick\u201d and canceled it soon after he was elected in July. Britain paid Rwanda hundreds of millions of pounds for the plan under a deal signed by the two countries in 2022, without any deportations taking place.",
      "Former Conservative Immigration Minister Tom Pursglove urged Starmer to revive the Rwanda plan, telling the BBC \u201cit\u2019s a very serious failure not to have a credible deterrent in place.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Brazilian police official Valdecy Urquiza is expected to be named the new Interpol general secretary, replacing J\u00fcrgen Stock of Germany. He will be the first chief of the Lyon, France-based organization not to come from Europe or the United States.",
      "Interpol, which celebrated its centennial last year, works to help national police forces communicate with each other and track suspects and criminals in fields like counterterrorism, financial crime, child pornography, cybercrime and organized crime.",

      "Indonesia\u2019s National Disaster Management Agency says that at least ten people have died as a series of volcanic eruptions widens on the remote island of Flores",
      "MAUMERE, Indonesia -- Indonesia\u2019s National Disaster Management Agency said Monday that at least 10 people have died as a series of volcanic eruptions widens on the remote island of Flores.",
      "The eruption at Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki around midnight spewed thick brownish ash as high as 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) into the air and hot ashes hit several villages, burning down houses including a convent of Catholic nuns, said Firman Yosef, an official at the Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki monitoring post.",
      "He said volcanic material was thrown up to 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from its crater, blanketing nearby villages and towns with tons of volcanic debris and forcing residents to flee.",
      "Rescuers were still searching for more bodies buried under collapsed houses, said Abdul Muhari, the National Disaster Management Agency\u2019s spokesperson. Muhari said all the bodies, including a child, were found with a 4-kilometer (2.4 mile) radius of the crater.",
      "He said at least 10,000 people have been affected by the eruption in six villages of Wulanggitang District, and four villages in Ile Bura district. Some have fled to relatives\u2019 houses while the local government is readying schools to use as temporary shelters.",
      "The country\u2019s volcano monitoring agency increased the volcano\u2019s alert status to the highest level and more than doubled the exclusion zone to a 7-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius after midnight on Monday as eruptions became more frequent.",
      "A nun in Hokeng village died and another was missing, said Agusta Palma, the head of the Saint Gabriel Foundation that oversees convents on the majority-Catholic island.",
      "\u201cOur nuns ran out in panic under a rain of volcanic ash in the darkness,\u201d Palma said.",
      "Photos and videos circulated on social media showed tons of volcanic debris covering houses up to their rooftops in villages like Hokeng, where hot volcanic material set fire to houses.",
      "Lewotobi Laki-laki is one of a pair of stratovolcanoes in the East Flores district of East Nusa Tenggara province known locally as the husband \u2014 \u201cLaki-laki\u201d means man \u2014 and wife mountains. Its mate is Lewotobi Perempuan, or woman.",
      "About 6,500 people were evacuated in January after Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki began erupting, spewing thick clouds and forcing the government to close the island's Frans Seda Airport. No casualties or major damage were reported, but the airport has remained closed since then due to seismic activity.",
      "In a video conference on Monday, Muhammad Wafid, the head of Geology Agency at the Energy and Mineral Resources ministry said there was a different character between January\u2019s eruption and Monday\u2019s eruption due to a blockage of magma in the crater, which reduced detectible seismic activity while building up pressure.",
      "\u201cThe eruptions that occurred since Friday were due to the accumulation of hidden energy,\u201d Wafid said.",
      "It\u2019s Indonesia\u2019s second volcanic eruption in as many weeks. West Sumatra province\u2019s Mount Marapi, one of the country\u2019s most active volcanos, erupted on Oct. 27, spewing thick columns of ash at least three times and blanketing nearby villages with debris, but no casualties were reported.",
      "Lewotobi Laki-laki is one of the 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, an archipelago of 280 million people. The country is prone to earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activity because it sits along the \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the Pacific Ocean. ___",

      "Mexico\u2019s Defense Department claims the National Guard has killed two Colombians and wounded four others in a confrontation near the U.S. border",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico\u2019s National Guard fatally shot two Colombians and wounded four others in what the Defense Department claimed was a confrontation near the U.S. border.",
      "Colombia's foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday that all of the victims were migrants who had been \u201ccaught in the crossfire.\u201d It identified the dead as a 20-year-old man and a 37-year-old woman, and gave the number of Colombians wounded as five, not four. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.",
      "Mexico\u2019s Defense Department, which controls the National Guard, did not respond to requests for comment Monday on whether the victims were migrants, but it said one Colombian who was not injured in the shootings was turned over to immigration officials, suggesting they were.",
      "If they were migrants, it would mark the second time in just over a month that military forces in Mexico have opened fire on and killed migrants.",
      "On Oct. 1, the day President Claudia Sheinbaum took office, soldiers opened fire on a truck, killing six migrants in the southern state of Chiapas. An 11-year-old girl from Egypt, her 18-year-old sister and a 17-year-old boy from El Salvador died in that shooting, along with people from Peru and Honduras.",
      "The most recent shootings happened Saturday on a dirt road near Tecate, east of Otay Mesa on the California border, that is frequently used by Mexican migrant smugglers, the department said in a statement late Sunday.",
      "The Defense Department said a militarized National Guard patrol came under fire after spotting two trucks in the area, which is near an informal border crossing and wind power generation plant known as La Rumorosa.",
      "One truck sped off and escaped. The National Guard opened fire on the other truck, killing two Colombians and wounding four others. There was no immediate information on their conditions, and there were no reported casualties among the guardsmen involved.",
      "One Colombian and one Mexican man were found and detained unharmed at the scene, and the departments said officers found a pistol and several magazines commonly used for assault rifles at the scene.",
      "Colombians have sometimes been recruited as gunmen for Mexican drug cartels, which are also heavily involved in migrant smuggling. But the fact the survivor was turned over to immigration officials and that the Foreign Relations Department contacted the Colombian consulate suggests they were migrants.",
      "Cartel gunmen sometimes escort or kidnap migrants as they travel to the U.S. border. One possible scenario was that armed migrant smugglers may have been in one or both of the trucks, but that the migrants were basically unarmed bystanders.",
      "The defense department said the three National Guard officers who opened fire have been taken off duty.",
      "Former president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office Sept. 30, gave the military an unprecedentedly wide role in public life and law enforcement; he created the militarized Guard and used the combined military forces as the country\u2019s main law enforcement agencies, supplanting police. The Guard has since been placed under the control of the army.",
      "But critics say the military is not trained to do civilian law enforcement work. Moreover, lopsided death tolls in such confrontations \u2014 in which all the deaths and injuries occur on one side \u2014 raise suspicions among activists whether there really was a confrontation.",
      "For example, the soldiers who opened fire in Chiapas \u2014 who have been detained pending charges \u2014 claimed they heard \u201cdetonations\u201d prior to opening fire. There was no indication any weapons were found at the scene.",

That\u2019s up from 8,000 troops that the U.S. government mentioned Thursday.",

      "The accident occurred in Almora district in the mountainous state of Uttarakhand. The bus was carrying around 60 people, and more than 20 have been injured, said Deepak Rawat, a senior state government official.",
      "Authorities said earlier they believed there were 42 passengers, which was how many people the bus could accommodate.",

      "The Soyuz rocket lifted off as scheduled from Vostochny launchpad in far eastern Russia and put its payload into a designated orbit nine minutes after the launch. It was carrying two Russian Ionosphere-M Earth observation satellites and several dozen smaller satellites, including the two Iranian ones.",
      "Iran\u2019s two satellites, named Kowsar and Hodhod, were the first launched on behalf of the country\u2019s private sector. In 2022, a Russian rocket launched an Iranian Earth observation satellite called Khayyam that was built in Russia on Tehran\u2019s order, and in February Russia put another Iranian satellite named Pars-1 into orbit.",
      "Tuesday's launch comes as Russia and Iran have expanded ties in various spheres. Ukraine and the West have accused Tehran of providing Moscow with hundreds of exploding drones for use on the battlefield in Ukraine and helped launch their production in Russia. The Iranian drone deliveries, which Moscow and Tehran have denied, have allowed for a constant barrage of long-range drone strikes at Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure.",
      "Moscow and Tehran are planning to further bolster their ties with a \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership\u201d that is set to be signed during Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian\u2019s planned visit to Russia. The date for that visit hasn\u2019t been set yet, but the Kremlin said it could happen soon.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s successful launch of the Iranian satellites atop a Russian rocket follows a series of failed launches suffered by Iran\u2019s civilian space program in recent years. There have been five failed launches in a row for the Simorgh program, a satellite-carrying rocket.",
      "A fire at the Imam Khomeini Spaceport in February 2019 killed three researchers, authorities said at the time. A launchpad rocket explosion later that year drew the attention of then-President Donald Trump, who taunted Iran with a tweet showing what appeared to be a U.S. surveillance photo of the site.",
      "At the same time, a separate Iranian space program run by the country\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard has seen successful launches from a military base outside of Shahroud, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) east of the capital, Tehran. However, satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press show Israel likely bombed the site during its Oct. 26 retaliatory strike on Iran.",
      "The U.S. intelligence community\u2019s worldwide threat assessment this year said Iran\u2019s development of satellite launch vehicles \u201cwould shorten the timeline\u201d for Iran to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile because it uses similar technology.",

Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for \u201cseveral\u201d nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has warned.",
      "Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003."

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco reported third-quarter profits of $27.5 billion on Tuesday, down about 15% from last year as low oil prices ate into its revenues.",
      "Aramco, formally known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., had revenues of $111.1 billion over the quarter, the company said in a filing on Riyadh's Tadawul stock exchange. It had $113 billion in revenues the same quarter last year.",
      "Profits for the third quarter last year were $32.5 billion.",
      "The profit decrease \u201cwas mainly due to the impact of lower crude oil prices and weakening refining margins,\u201d Aramco said.",
      "Profit for the first nine months of 2024 was $83.9 billion, down from $94.5 billion the year before.",
      "Oil prices have been depressed over recent days as tensions in the Middle East appear to have receded slightly and as China's economy has slowed. Benchmark Brent crude traded Tuesday at around $75 a barrel.",

      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s vast oil resources, located close to the surface of its desert expanse, make it one of the world\u2019s least expensive places to produce crude. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hopes to use the oil wealth to pivot the kingdom off oil sales, through projects such as his planned $500 billion futuristic desert city, called Neom. But lower oil prices have Saudi Arabia reportedly looking at curtailing some of those ambitions as the kingdom likely faces looming budget deficits.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s privacy watchdog on Tuesday fined social media company Meta 21.6 billion won ($15 million) for illegally collecting sensitive personal information from Facebook users, including data about their political views and sexual orientation, and sharing it with thousands of advertisers.",
      "It was the latest in a series of penalties against Meta by South Korean authorities in recent years as they increase their scrutiny of how the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, handles private information.",
      "Following a four-year investigation, South Korea\u2019s Personal Information Protection Commission concluded that Meta unlawfully collected sensitive information about around 980,000 Facebook users, including their religion, political views and whether they were in same-sex unions, from July 2018 to March 2022.",
      "It said the company shared the data with around 4,000 advertisers.",
      "South Korea\u2019s privacy law provides strict protection for information related to personal beliefs, political views and sexual behavior, and bars companies from processing or using such data without the specific consent of the person involved.",

      "The company categorized ads to identify users interested in themes such as specific religions, same-sex and transgender issues, and issues related to North Korean escapees, said Lee Eun Jung, a director at the commission who led the investigation on Meta.",
      "\u201cWhile Meta collected this sensitive information and used it for individualized services, they made only vague mentions of this use in their data policy and did not obtain specific consent,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Lee also said Meta put the privacy of Facebook users at risk by failing to implement basic security measures such as removing or blocking inactive pages. As a result, hackers were able to use inactive pages to forge identities and request password resets for the accounts of other Facebook users. Meta approved these requests without proper verification, which resulted in data breaches affecting at least 10 South Korean Facebook users, Lee said.",
      "In September, European regulators hit Meta with over $100 million in fines for a 2019 security lapse in which user passwords were temporarily exposed in an un-encrypted form.",
      "Meta\u2019s South Korean office said it would \u201ccarefully review\u201d the commission\u2019s decision, but didn\u2019t immediately provide more comment.",
      "In 2022, the commission fined Google and Meta a combined 100 billion won ($72 million) for tracking consumers\u2019 online behavior without their consent and using their data for targeted advertisements, in the biggest penalties ever imposed in South Korea for privacy law violations.",
      "The commission said then that the two companies didn\u2019t clearly inform users or obtain their consent to collect data about them as they used other websites or services outside their own platforms. It ordered the companies to provide an \u201ceasy and clear\u201d consent process to give people more control over whether to share information about what they do online.",
      "The commission also hit Meta with a 6.7 billion won ($4.8 million) fine in 2020 for providing personal information about itsx users to third parties without consent."

      "WICHITA, KANSAS -- Sobs of relief broke out in a federal courtroom in Kansas on Monday as dozens of people whose life savings had been embezzled by a bank CEO learned that federal law enforcement had recovered their money.",
      "\"I just can\u2019t describe the weight lifted off of us,\u201d said Bart Camilli, 70, who with his wife Cleo had just learned they\u2019d recover close to $450,000 \u2014 money Bart began saving at 18 when he bought his first individual retirement account. \u201cIt\u2019s life-changing.\u201d",
      "In August, former Kansas bank CEO Shan Hanes was sentenced to 24 years after stealing $47 million from customer accounts and wiring the money to cryptocurrency accounts run by scammers. Prosecutors said Hanes also stole $40,000 from his church, $10,000 from an investment club and $60,000 from his daughter\u2019s college fund and lost $1.1 million of his own in the scheme. Deposits were \u201cjettisoned into the ether,\u201d said prosecutor Aaron Smith.",
      "Hanes' Heartland Tri-State Bank, drained of cash, was shut down by federal regulators and sold to another financial institution. Customers\u2019 savings and checking accounts amounting to $47.1 million were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which paid off their losses.",
      "But there were still 30 shareholders of the community-owned rural bank Hanes helped found \u2014 including his close family friends and neighbors \u2014 who thought they lost $8.3 million in investments: well-planned retirements were upended, funds for long-term eldercare gone, education funds and bequests for children and grandchildren zeroed out.",
      "On Monday the shareholders stood to cheer federal Judge John W. Broomes in Wichita after he told them, one at a time, that they\u2019d be paid back in full. The FBI recovered the funds from a cryptocurrency account held by Tether Ltd. in the Cayman Islands.",
      "During an earlier sentencing hearing, these victims had called Hanes a \u201cdeceitful cheat and a liar,\u201d and \u201cpure evil.\u201d",
      "Margaret Grice came to court Monday figuring she\u2019d get $1,000 back. Instead, she learned she\u2019d be recovering almost $250,000, her entire 401(k).",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just really thrilled,\u201d she said. \u201cI can breathe.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said Hanes, who was the CEO of Heartland Tri-State Bank in Elkhart, Kansas, lost the money in a scam referred to as \u201cpig butchering,\u201d or the way pigs are fattened before slaughter. In the scam, a third party gains a victims' trust and, over time, convinces them to invest all of their money into cryptocurrency, which immediately disappears. U.S. and U.N. officials say these schemes are proliferating, with scammers largely in Southeast Asia increasingly taking advantage of Americans.",
      "Hanes started buying what he thought was $5,000 in cryptocurrency in late 2022, communicating with someone who had reached out on WhatsApp, according to court records. A few months later he transferred over his church and investment club funds. Records show the scam accelerated in the summer of 2023, when Hanes wired $47.1 million out of customer accounts in 11 wire transfers over just eight weeks. Each transfer, he thought, was necessary to end the investment and cash out, court records said. He watched, on a fake website, as the money appeared to grow to more than $200 million.",
      "\u201cHe was to take some of the money, and the rest of the money was supposed to go back to the bank,\u201d his attorney John Stang explained. \u201cNow it's fiction, it didn't exist. We all know that now ... It failed big time.\u201d",
      "Hanes, who was not in court Monday, apologized at an earlier sentencing hearing.",
      "\u201cFrom the deepest depth of my soul, I had no intention of ever causing the harm that I did,\" he said. \u201dI\u2019ll forever struggle to understand how I was duped and how what I thought was just getting the money back was making it worse.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Hanes wasn\u2019t just the victim of a scam, he crossed a line when he began taking customers' money and violating banking regulations. He pleaded guilty to embezzlement by a bank officer in May.",
      "His prominent standing in his hometown of 2,000 made it easier for him to get away with it, a Federal Reserve System investigation found; he had been on the school board, volunteered as a swim meet official, and served on the Kansas Bankers Association.",
      "He also was a banking leader beyond his rural community. In recent years, he testified to Congressional committees about the importance of local banks in farming communities, and he served as a director for the American Bankers Association, which represents almost all banking assets in the U.S.",
      "On Monday, prosecutors said the FDIC wanted to be paid back for the insurance claims it reimbursed to bank customers. But Judge Broomes said the economic circumstances of shareholders \u201cwho became insolvent because of a fraud scheme\u201d justified paying them back first, before the FDIC recovers anything.",
      "Hanes, 53, may be in his late 70s when he is released and is unlikely to be able to pay the FDIC the $47.1 million still owed.",
      "In a court filing, Hanes and his attorney tried to explain what had happened.",
      "\u201cMr. Hanes made some very bad choices after being caught up in an extremely well-run cryptocurrency scam,\u201d they said. \u201cHe was the pig that was butchered.\u201d"

      "A strike by 33,000 Boeing factory workers is coming to an end after more than seven weeks",
      "SEATTLE -- Factory workers at Boeing voted to accept a contract offer and end their strike after more than seven weeks, clearing the way for the aerospace giant to resume production of its bestselling airliner and generate much-needed cash.",
      "Leaders of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers district in Seattle said 59% of members who cast ballots agreed to approve the company\u2019s fourth formal offer and the third put to a vote. The deal includes a 38% wage increase over four years, and ratification and productivity bonuses.",
      "However, Boeing refused to meet strikers\u2019 demand to restore a company pension plan that was frozen nearly a decade ago.",
      "The contract\u2019s ratification on the eve of Election Day cleared the way for a major U.S. manufacturer and government contractor to restart Pacific Northwest assembly lines that the walkout idled for 53 days.",
      "Bank of America analysts estimated last month that Boeing was losing about $50 million a day during the now-ended strike, which did not affect a nonunion plant in South Carolina where the company makes 787s.",
      "Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees that he was pleased to have reached an agreement.",
      "\u201cWhile the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team,\u201d Ortberg said. \u201cWe will only move forward by listening and working together. There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.\u201d",
      "According to the union, the 33,000 workers it represents can return to work as soon as Wednesday or as late as Nov. 12. Ortberg has said it might take \u201ca couple of weeks\u201d to resume production in part because some workers might need retraining.",
      "The average annual pay of Boeing machinists is currently $75,608 and eventually will rise to $119,309 under the new contract, according to the company. The union said the compounded value of the promised pay raise would amount to an increase of more than 43% over the life of the agreement.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to come together. This is a victory,\u201d IAM District 751 President Jon Holden told members while announcing the tally late Monday. \u201cYou stood strong and you stood tall and you won.\u201d",
      "Reactions were mixed even among union members who voted to accept the contract.",
      "Although she voted \u201cyes,\u201d Seattle-based calibration specialist Eep Bola\u00f1o said the outcome was \u201cmost certainly not a victory.\u201d Bola\u00f1o said she and her fellow workers made a wise but infuriating choice to accept the offer.",
      "\u201cWe were threatened by a company that was crippled, dying, bleeding on the ground, and us as one of the biggest unions in the country couldn't even extract two-thirds of our demands from them. This is humiliating,\" she said.",
      "For other workers like William Gardiner, a lab lead in calibration services, the revised offer was a cause for celebration.",
      "\u201cI'm extremely pumped over this vote,\u201d said Gardiner, who has worked for Boeing for 13 years. \u201cWe didn't fix everything \u2014 that's OK. Overall, it's a very positive contract.\u201d",
      "Union leaders had endorsed the latest proposal, saying they thought they had gotten all they could through negotiations and the strike. Along with the wage increase, the new contract gives each worker a $12,000 ratification bonus and retains a performance bonus the company wanted to eliminate.",
      "\u201cIt is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,\u201d the local union district said before the vote. \u201cWe believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn\u2019t be right as we have achieved so much success.\u201d",
      "President Joe Biden congratulated the machinists and Boeing for coming to an agreement that he said supports fairness in the workplace and improves workers\u2019 ability to retire with dignity. The contract, he said, is important for Boeing\u2019s future as \u201ca critical part of America\u2019s aerospace sector.\u201d",
      "Biden's acting labor secretary, Julie Su, intervened in the negotiations several times, including when Boeing made its latest offer last week.",
      "A continuing strike would have plunged Boeing into further financial peril and uncertainty. Last month, Ortberg announced plans to lay off about 17,000 people and a stock sale to prevent the company\u2019s credit rating from being cut to junk status.",
      "The strike began Sept. 13 with an overwhelming 94.6% rejection of the company's offer to raise pay by 25% over four years \u2014 far less than the union\u2019s original demand for 40% wage increases over three years.",
      "Machinists voted down another offer \u2014 35% raises over four years, and still no revival of pensions \u2014 on Oct. 23, the same day that Boeing reported a third-quarter loss of more than $6 billion.",
      "The contract rejections reflected bitterness that built up after union concessions and small pay increases over the past decade.",
      "The labor standoff \u2014 the first strike by Boeing machinists since an eight-week walkout in 2008 \u2014 was the latest setback in a volatile year for the aerospace giant. The 2008 strike lasted eight weeks and cost the company about $100 million daily in deferred revenue. A 1995 strike lasted 10 weeks.",
      "Boeing came under several federal investigations this year after a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Federal regulators put limits on Boeing airplane production that they said would last until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at the company.",
      "The door-plug incident renewed concerns about the safety of the 737 Max. Two of the planes had crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. The CEO at the time, whose efforts to fix the company failed, announced in March that he would step down. In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving regulators who approved the 737 Max.",
      "Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said Monday's vote puts Boeing\u2019s future back on more solid footing.",
      "\u201cWashington is home to the world\u2019s most skilled aerospace workers, and they understandably took a stand for the respect and compensation they deserve,\u201d Inslee said in a statement congratulating the workers.",

      "DETROIT -- The U.S. government's auto safety regulator has ended a 2 1/2-year investigation into Ford engine failures after the company replaced engines or extended the warranty on some vehicles.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says in documents posted Monday on its website that its analysis traced the problem to intake valves that can fracture inside some 2.7-liter and 3-liter turbocharged engines.",
      "Documents say the probe opened in May of 2022 ended up covering more than 411,000 vehicles from the 2021 and 2022 model years including the Ford F-150 Bronco, Edge and Explorer as well as the Lincoln Aviator and Nautilus.",
      "The agency was looking into catastrophic engine failures caused by intake valves fracturing, dropping into the cylinder and hitting the piston.",
      "The documents say a forensic analysis of fractured valves found that when the they were made by a parts supplier, the temperature got too high, making them brittle and likely to fracture during normal engine use.",
      "An analysis of failure report data found that the faulty valves were made from May through October of 2021, the agency said. Ford contended that not all valves produced during this period were faulty and that a vast majority of the failures happened before the vehicles were driven 20,000 miles.",
      "An agency statistical analysis to predict the number of failures, and an analysis of failure reports \u201care generally consistent\u201d with Ford's determination that the valves would fail at low mileage, and the majority of vehicles with the faulty valves \u201chave already experienced a failure,\u201d the agency said.",
      "Earlier this year Ford recalled about 91,000 vehicles with valves made during the suspect period. They'll be tested and get a new engine if necessary. The company also extended the warranty on vehicles with valves made during the period to 10 years or 150,000 miles, the documents said.",
      "During the investigation, the agency said it found 396 customer complaints, 825 warranty claims and 936 engine replacements. There were no reported crashes or injuries."

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hopes to use the oil wealth to pivot the kingdom off oil sales, through projects such as his planned $500 billion futuristic desert city, called Neom. But lower oil prices have Saudi Arabia reportedly looking at curtailing some of those ambitions as the kingdom likely faces looming budget deficits.",

      "The massive Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference comes after the UAE just last year hosted the United Nations COP28 climate talks. Those talks ended with a call by nearly 200 countries to move away from planet-warming fossil fuels \u2014 the first time the conference made that crucial pledge.",

      "TOKYO -- Nintendo, the Japanese video game maker behind the Super Mario franchise, said Tuesday that its profit fell 60% in the first half of the fiscal year, as demand waned for its Switch console, now in its eighth year since going on sale.",
      "Kyoto-based Nintendo Co. reported a 108.7 billion yen ($715 million) profit for the April-September period, as sales slipped 34% from the previous year to 523 billion yen ($3.4 billion).",
      "More than 74% of its sales revenue came from overseas, according to Nintendo, which didn\u2019t break down quarterly numbers.",
      "Global Switch sales during the period dropped to 4.7 million machines from 6.8 million units the previous year.",
      "But Nintendo said in a statement that Switch sales were still growing and vowed to stick to its goal of selling a Switch console to each and every individual, not just one Switch per every household.",

      "The release of a Super Mario Brothers movie lifted sales in the previous fiscal year, while the absence of such a movie this fiscal year negatively impacted the latest results, Nintendo said. Revenue also declined in its mobile-game offerings and IP-related businesses, it said.",

      "It\u2019s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too",
      "It\u2019s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too.",
      "Returnless refunds are a tool that more retailers are using to keep online shoppers happy and to reduce shipping fees, processing time and other ballooning costs from returned products.",
      "Companies such as Amazon, Walmart and Target have decided some items are not worth the cost or hassle of getting back. Think a $20 T-shirt that might cost $30 in shipping and handling to recover. There are also single-use items, such as a package of plastic straws, that might be difficult to resell or medicines that could be unsafe to market again.",
      "Analysts say the companies offering returnless refunds do it somewhat sporadically, typically reserving the option for low-cost objects or ones with limited resale value. But some online shoppers said they've also been allowed to keep more pricey products.",
      "Dalya Harel, 48, received a return-free refund recently after ordering a desk from Amazon that cost roughly $300. When the desk arrived, she noticed it was missing some key pieces and would be impossible to put together, Harel said. She couldn't request a replacement and have it within a reasonable time for the office of her New York lice detection removal service because the item was out of stock.",
      "Harel, who routinely buys towels and other products from Amazon for her business, said her team reached out to the company's customer service line. She was pleasantly surprised to hear she would get a refund without having to send back the desk.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one less headache to deal with,\u201d Harel said. \u201cIt was really nice for us to not have to make an extra trip up to the post office.\u201d",
      "She used the desk pieces to create makeshift shelves in her office in Brooklyn.",
      "While the retail practice of letting customers keep merchandise and get their money back is not exactly a trade secret, the way it works is shrouded in mystery. Companies are not keen to publicize the circumstances in which they issue returnless refunds due to concerns over the potential for return fraud.",
      "Even if brands don't provide details about such policies on their websites, returnless refunds are expanding in at least some retail corners.",
      "Amazon, which industry experts say has engaged in the practice for years, announced in August that it would extend the option to the third-party sellers who drive most of the sales on the e-commerce giant's platform. Under the program, sellers who use the company\u2019s fulfillment services in the U.S. could choose to offer customers a traditional refund for purchases under $75 along with no obligation to return what they ordered.",
      "Amazon did not immediately respond to questions about how the program works. But publicly, it has pitched returnless refunds more directly to international sellers and those who offer cheaper goods. Items sold in an upcoming section of Amazon's website, which will allow U.S. shoppers to buy low-cost goods shipped directly from China, will also be eligible for returnless refunds, according to documents seen by The Associated Press.",
      "In January, Walmart gave a similar option to merchants who sell products on its growing online marketplace, leaving it up to sellers to set price limits and determine if or how they want to participate.",
      "China-founded e-commerce companies Shein and Temu say they also offer returnless refunds on a small number of orders, as does Target, the online shopping site Overstock and pet products e-tailer Chewy, which some customer said had encouraged them to donate unwanted items to local animal shelters.",
      "Wayfair, another online retailer cited by some customers as offering returnless refunds, did not reply to a request for comment on its policies.",
      "Overall, retailers and brands tend to be careful about how often they let customers keep items for free. Many of them are deploying algorithms to determine who should be given the option and who should not.",
      "To make the decision, the algorithms assess multiple factors, including the extent to which a shopper should be trusted based on prior purchasing \u2013 and returning \u2013 patterns, shipping costs and the demand for the product in the customer\u2019s hands, according to Sender Shamiss, CEO of goTRG, a reverse logistics company that works with retailers like Walmart.",
      "Optoro, a company that helps streamline returns for Best Buy, Staples and Gap Inc., has observed retailers assessing the lifetime value of a customer and extending returnless refunds as a type of unofficial, discreet loyalty benefit, according to CEO Amena Ali.",
      "The king of online retail appeared to verify the process works that way.",
      "In a statement, Amazon said it offers returnless refunds on a \u201cvery small number\u201d of items as a \u201cconvenience to customers.\u201d",
      "The company also said it's hearing positive feedback from sellers about its new program that authorized them to tell customers they could keep some products and still be reimbursed. Amazon said it was monitoring for signs of fraud and setting eligibility criteria for sellers and customers. It didn't provide additional details on what that encompassed.",
      "Some retailers also are stiffening the liberal return policies they long employed to encourage online orders. Shoppers who enjoyed making purchases on their computers or cellphones became accustomed to loading up their digital shopping baskets with the intent of returning items they ended up not liking.",
      "Shopping online also grew significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homebound consumers reduced their trips to stores and relied on sites like Amazon for everyday items. Retail companies have talked in recent years about returns becoming more expensive to process due to the growing volume, rising inflation and labor costs.",
      "Last year, U.S. consumers returned $743 billion worth of merchandise, or 14.5% of the products they purchased - up from 10.6% in 2020, according to the National Retail Federation. In 2019, returned merchandise was valued at $309 billion, according to loss prevention company Appriss Retail.",
      "Last year, roughly 14% of returns were fraudulent, costing retailers $101 billion in losses, according to a joint report from the National Retail federation and Appriss Retail. The problem spans from low-level forms of fraud - such as shoppers returning already worn clothing - to more complicated schemes by fraudsters who return shoplifted merchandise or items purchased on stolen credit cards.",
      "To deter excessive returns, some retailers, including H&M, Zara and J. Crew, started charging customers return fees in the past year. Others have shortened their return windows. Some shopping sites, such as the Canadian retailer Ssense, have threatened to kick frequent returners off their platforms if they suspect abuse of their policies.",
      "However, retailers don't all view frequent returners in the same way. Such customers could be seen as \u201cgood returners\u201d if they purchase \u2013 and keep \u2013 many more items than they send back, Ali said.",
      "\u201cOftentimes, your most profitable customers tend to be high returners,\u201d she said."

      "State police have destroyed tens of thousands of pounds of marijuana plants at greenhouses in northwestern New Mexico",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- State police have destroyed tens of thousands of pounds of marijuana plants at greenhouses in northwestern New Mexico, marking what regulators say is the largest seizure and destruction of cannabis in New Mexico since new possession and cultivation laws took effect in 2021.",
      "Authorities announced the operation Monday, saying dozens of agents were assigned to eradicate the plants in October. The state Cannabis Control Division had started the process of revoking the license of NNK Equity LLC, having filed a noncompliance order and a default order earlier this year.",
      "The company was accused of not posting its licenses on site, failing to obtain water rights for cultivation, not having cameras that could monitor certain areas of its operation and violating sanitation and health requirements.",
      "\u201cThe organization involved showed a blatant disregard for the laws of this state and we will prove that once this investigation is over,\u201d New Mexico State Police Chief Troy Weisler said in a statement.",
      "Jacob Candelaria, an Albuquerque attorney who represents NNK Equity, disputed the state's claims and accused regulators and state police of violating his client's civil rights. He said the state failed to properly serve notice of its intent to revoke the company's license and subsequently denied a request for a hearing on the merits of the case.",
      "He said clients Irving Lin and Bao Xue speak Mandarin Chinese and have limited ability to understand the written English language. Lin asked for a Chinese translation, but the attorney said regulators did not respond to his request.",
      "The Cannabis Control Division stated in filings related to the case that it complied with notice and hearing requirements and had afforded the company its due process rights.",
      "The company plans to ask a state district judge to set aside the order revoking the license and to order state regulators to hold a hearing, Candelaria said. He added that NNK Equity also plans to sue the state for destroying what he said amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars of private property.",
      "\u201cThe idea that law enforcement officers can destroy public property based upon a temporary restraining order \u2014 which can be entered without notice to all parties and before a hearing on the evidence \u2014 which was the case here, should concern all of us who believe in the Constitution.\u201d",
      "According to state regulators, NNK Equity was issued a license in December 2023 for a marijuana growing operation at a property in Waterflow, a rural area on the edge of the Navajo Nation and just south of the Colorado border. The region also made headlines earlier this year when state regulators cracked down on two other operations and Navajo Nation authorities ended up filing their own charges against two tribal members.",
      "In the latest case, the Cannabis Control Division conducted a compliance check in June and determined that NNK Equity had exceeded its allotted plant count. The New Mexico State Police Special Investigations Unit was brought in and later found plants at a second location that was not licensed.",
      "The violations outlined by state regulators also involve transportation and tracking requirements, which include assigning identifying numbers to each plant."

      "The park opened in 2000 just off Interstate 10 as Jazzland Theme Park, but it went bankrupt in two seasons. Six Flags took over the lease, but then Hurricane Katrina struck, flooding the park and much of the city. The theme park never reopened, and Six Flags eventually went bankrupt. Control of the property then went to the Industrial Development Board of the City of New Orleans, which negotiated an agreement with the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority that gave NORA title transfer ownership of the site.",

      "NEW YORK -- Bernard \u201cBernie\u201d Marcus, the co-founder of The Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement chain, a billionaire philanthropist, and a big Republican donor, has died. He was 95.",
      "Marcus died Monday in Boca Raton, Florida, surrounded by family, according to a Home Depot spokesperson.",
      "Marcus was Home Depot's CEO as it grew rapidly during its first two decades, and was chairman of the board until his retirement in 2002. In recent years, he became an outspoken supporter of former president Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cWe owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude to Bernie,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cHe was a master merchant and a retail visionary. But even more importantly, he valued our associates, customers and communities above all. He\u2019s left us with an invaluable legacy and the backbone of our company: our values and culture. \u201d",
      "The son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Marcus was born in 1929 and grew up in a tenement in Newark, New Jersey, according to a biography on the company's website. Marcus had aspirations of becoming a doctor, but his family couldn't afford medical school and he endeavored to become a pharmacist, receiving a degree from Rutgers University. Marcus used to say he'd skip classes to sell Amana freezers door-to-door, according to Home Depot.",
      "After college, Marcus worked at the manufacturing conglomerate O\u2019Dell\u2019s and the retail chain Vornado, quickly ascending the corporate ladder. By 1972, Marcus was chairman and president of Handy Dan Improvement Centers, part of the Daylin conglomerate. It was there that Marcus formed a lifelong friendship with Arthur Blank.",
      "The big moment in his career arrived after he was fired by Handy Dan in 1978, along with Blank. Marcus had dreamt of a one-stop shop for do-it-yourselfers. At age 49, Marcus, along with Blank, founded Home Depot. Investment banker Ken Langone helped to secure financing to get The Home Depot started, according to the company.",
      "The first Home Depot opened in Atlanta the following year and by 1981, the company went public and began selling stock. There are now more than 2,000 Home Depot stores and the company employs more than 500,000 people. In the past decade annual sales at Home Depot have doubled, reaching nearly $153 billion in 2023",
      "Marcus has financially supported various charities as well as Jewish and medical organizations through donations. He also built the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, one of the largest in the world. The company said that his philanthropic work will continue through The Marcus Foundation, with a focus on Jewish causes, children, medical research, free enterprise and the community.",
      "Marcus was a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump, donating nearly $5 million to the Republican Party between 2016 and 2020, according to OpenSecrets, an organization that tracks political spending. Last year, Marcus penned an op-ed for the right wing site Real Clear Politics, a clearinghouse of elections data and analysis, that spelled out the reasons he was endorsing Trump for a second term.",

      "U.S. stocks are rallying as voters head to the polls on the last day of the presidential election and as more data piles up to show the economy remains solid",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks are rallying Tuesday as voters head to the polls on the last day of the presidential election and as more data piles up showing the economy remains solid.",
      "The S&P 500 was up 1% in afternoon trading, rising closer to its record set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 356 points, or 0.9%, as of 1:56 p.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was 1.2% higher.",
      "Treasury yields also rallied after a report showed growth for retailers, transportation companies and other businesses in the U.S. services industries accelerated last month. That was despite economists' expectations for a slowdown, and the Institute for Supply Management said it was the strongest growth since July 2022.",
      "The strong data offered more hope that the U.S. economy will remain solid and avoid a long-feared recession following the worst inflation in generations.",
      "Excitement about the artificial-intelligence boom also helped lift the stock market, as it has for much of the last year. Software company Palantir Technologies jumped 22.6% after delivering bigger profit and revenue than analysts expected for the latest quarter. It\u2019s an industry known for thinking and talking big, and CEO Alexander Karp said, \u201cWe absolutely eviscerated this quarter, driven by unrelenting AI demand that won\u2019t slow down.\u201d",
      "It helped offset a 6.5% drop for NXP Semiconductors. The Dutch company fell to one of the largest losses in the S&P 500 after warning that weakness it saw in the industrial and other markets during the latest quarter is spreading to Europe and the Americas.",
      "The market's main event, though, is the election, even if the result may not be known for days, weeks or months as officials count all the votes. Such uncertainty could upset markets, along with an upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve on interest rates later this week. The widespread expectation is for it to cut its main interest rate for a second straight time, as it widens its focus to keeping the job market solid in addition to getting inflation under control.",
      "Despite all the uncertainty heading into the final day of voting, many professional investors suggest keeping the focus on the long term and what corporate profits will do over the next few years and a decade. The broad U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins  the White House, even if each party's policies help and hurt different industries' profits underneath the surface.",
      "Since 1945, the S&P 500 has risen in 73% of the years where a Democrat was president and 70% of the years when a Republican was the nation\u2019s chief executive, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.",
      "The U.S. stock market has tended to rise more in magnitude when Democrats have been president, in part because a loss under George W. Bush\u2019s term hurt the Republican\u2019s average. Bush took over as the dot-com bubble was deflating and exited office when the 2008 global financial crisis and Great Recession were devastating markets.",
      "Besides who will be president, other questions hanging over the market include whether the White House will be working with a unified Congress or one split by political parties, as well as whether the results will be contested.",
      "The general hope among investors is often for split control of the U.S. government because that\u2019s more likely to keep the status quo and avoid big changes that could drive the nation\u2019s debt much, much higher.",
      "As for a contested election, Wall Street has some precedent to look back to. In 2000, the S&P 500 dropped 5% in about five weeks after Election Day before Al Gore conceded to George W. Bush. That, though, also happened during the near-halving of the S&P 500 from March 2000 to October 2002 as the dot-com bubble deflated.",
      "Four years ago, the S&P 500 rose the day after polls closed, even though a winner wasn\u2019t clear yet. And it kept going higher even after former President Donald Trump refused to concede  and challenged the results, creating plenty of uncertainty. A large part of that rally was due to excitement about the potential for a vaccine for COVID-19, which had just shut down the global economy.",
      "The S&P 500 ended up rising 69.6% from that Election Day in 2020 through Monday, following President Joe Biden's win. It set its latest all-time high on Oct. 18, as the U.S. economy bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic and managed to avoid a recession despite a jump in inflation.",
      "In the prior four years, the S&P 500 rose 57.5% from Election Day 2016 through Election Day 2020, in part because of cuts to tax rates signed by Trump.",
      "Investors have already made moves in anticipation of a win by either Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris. The value of the Mexican peso might fall if Trump's tariffs on Mexico come to fruition, for example.",
      "But Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, suggests not getting caught up in the pre-election moves, or even those immediately after the polls close, \u201cwhich we believe will face inevitable tempering, if not outright reversals, either before or after Inauguration Day.\u201d",
      "In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.31% following Tuesday morning's strong report on U.S services businesses from 4.29% late Monday.",
      "In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe and Asia. The moves were mostly modest outside of jumps of 2.3% in Shanghai and 2.1% in Hong Kong.",

      "Election Day will arrive Tuesday, though its result may not be known for some time as officials count all the votes. That\u2019s raised fears about the possibility of sharp swings around the world because markets infamously hate uncertainty.",
      "History may be less foreboding. The broad U.S. stock market has historically gone on to rise regardless of which party wins  the White House. And in 2020, U.S. stocks climbed immediately after Election Day and kept going even after former President Donald Trump refused to concede  and challenged the results, creating plenty of uncertainty. A large part of that rally was due to excitement about the potential for a vaccine for COVID-19, which had just shut down the global economy.",
      "\u201cBottom line \u2013 the US election is incredibly important, but the process is likely to be incredibly noisy,\u201d according to Michael Zezas, a strategist at Morgan Stanley.",
      "For markets, Zezas also points to how prices may have already moved ahead of expected outcomes from the election. A win for Trump this election could mean U.S. tariffs  on Mexican imports, for example, which could hurt the value of the Mexican peso. But the peso has already fallen against the U.S. dollar in recent months, which could limit further moves if a Trump win were actually to happen.",
      "A Trump victory would be less of a surprise to markets this time around than in 2016, when Treasury yields soared on expectations for tax cuts that could further inflate the nation\u2019s debt or fuel a stronger U.S economy. Treasury yields have already climbed in recent weeks, in part due to rising expectations in some market corners for a Trump win, along with a spate of data showing the U.S. economy has remained stronger than feared.",
      "On Monday, Treasury yields gave back a chunk of those gains. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.29% from 4.38% late Friday.",
      "Another investment that\u2019s become a barometer in the market for Trump\u2019s perceived chances of victory swung sharply through the day. After veering between losses and gains through the morning, Trump Media & Technology Group  ended up rising 12.4%.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture says that students eligible for free or reduced price school meals cannot be charged processing fees beginning in 2027",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced price school meals cannot be charged processing fees beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \u201cprocessing fees\u201d for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can\u2019t afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department\u2019s policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\u201cUSDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\u201d said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \u201cWhile today\u2019s action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\u201d",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just massively inconvenient,\u201d said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\u201cA dollar here and there, I expected,\u201d she said. \u201cBut $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\u201d",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child\u2019s account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \u201cmay insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\u201d Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \u201cfamilies have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\u201d the agency said, \u201cincluding those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\u201d",

There were 470 work stoppages (466 strikes and four lockouts) involving approximately 539,000 workers last year, according to Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. The nearly 500 work stoppages resulted in approximately 24,874,522 strike days.",

      "The new contract agreements were widely seen as a victory for the UAW. The companies agreed to dramatically raise pay for top-scale assembly plant workers, with increases and cost-of-living adjustments that would translate into 33% wage gains.",
      "Top assembly plant workers were to receive immediate 11% raises and would earn roughly $42 an hour when the contracts expire in April of 2028.",
      "Under the agreements, the automakers also ended many of the multiple tiers of wages they had used to pay different workers. They also agreed in principle to bring new electric-vehicle battery plants into the national union contract.",
      "UPS workers that are members of the Teamsters union approved a tentative contract with the package delivery company last year.

    "story": [
      "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
      "NEW YORK -- For some television viewers, size apparently does matter.",
      "Forget the 65-inch TVs that were considered bigger than average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 8 feet diagonally. That's wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a king-size bed.",
      "Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year, according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise tepid television market, according to analysts.",
      "The 38,100 televisions of at least 97 inches sold between January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs \u2014 the 19 models range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 \u2014 and introduced displays in roughly 70% of its stores.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really taken off this year,\" Blake Hampton, Best Buy's senior vice president of merchandising, said.",
      "Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at least 97 inches was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its first 98-inch TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said.",
      "Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling business, recently bought a 98-inch Sony for his 14,000-square-foot house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 85-inch TV in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home and uses some to display digital art.",
      "\u201cWe just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking for and thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony. \u201cYou get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You\u2019re sitting watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can put yourself in the scene.\u201d",
      "The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through September period, Circana said.",
      "Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski, the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a year, Kowalski said.",
      "The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of two inches in both 2021 and 2022, and 85-inch TVs began gaining traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 98-inch TVs to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 110-115 inches are on the market right now, he said.",
      "\u201cYou get better resolution over time,\" Kowalski said. \"You get better picture quality. And so just over time, it\u2019s easier to produce those sets and improve the technology.\"",
      "Best Buy's Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as \u201cincredible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re watching YouTube TV content or \u2018 NFL Sunday Ticket,\u2019 you can actually get four screens up, and that\u2019s four 48-inch screens on it,\u201d he said.",
      "Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed its 98-inch lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every scene.",
      "James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment division of Samsung's U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and experience content is shifting.",
      "\u201cIt's even more so about watching TV as a shared experience,\u201d Fishler said. \u201cThey want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at home. \u201d",
      "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, its Sam\u2019s Club division, and Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens.",
      "TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach on home theater projectors, which create a 100- to 120-inch image that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without windows.",
      "\u201cA dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the purview of projectors,\u201d Andrew Sivori, vice president in the entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer. \"But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV.\"",
      "Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd. But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, \u201cIt\u2019s still a niche business.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of people just don\u2019t have the space to put one of those in,\u201d he added.",
      "Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make sure a 98-inch TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said.",
      "But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good news is that the recommended distance for a 98-inch TV is actually just 6-12 feet from the seating area. The rule of thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine the ideal viewing distance, Samsung's Fishler said.",
      "If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go?",
      "\u201cI think we'll have to wait and see,\u201d Fishler said.",
      "___",
      "This story was first published on Nov. 3, 2024. It was updated on Nov. 5, 2024 to correct that TV sizes are measured on the diagonal, not by width."

      "The original $1.7 billion project included up to 222 wind turbines across 24 miles (38.6 kilometers) of hillsides in the Tri-Cities area of eastern Washington and three solar arrays covering up to 8.5 square miles (22 square kilometers).",
      "But then Washington\u2019s Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, a clearinghouse for permits required by large projects, recommended slashing the proposal in half because nests of the endangered ferruginous hawk were found in the area. It wanted a 2-mile (3.2-kilometer) buffer around each nest.",
      "Most nests were empty, but the hawks can return to them years later.",
      "In May, Inslee rejected the council's recommendation to shrink the project, prompting the panel to suggest a compromise that would examine turbines and nests on a case-by-case basis. Under this plan, which Inslee formally approved Oct. 18, a technical advisory group would recommend whether to reduce individual nest setbacks to 1 kilometer (0.6 mile.)",
      "This could allow the developer, Boulder, Colorado-based Scout Clean Energy, to build all but 30 of the turbines originally proposed.",
      "Inslee, a Democrat, has sought to make climate initiatives key to his legacy. He is not seeking reelection after three terms in office.",
      "The wind farm project has pitted local opponents against the state\u2019s ever-growing need for renewable energy since it was first proposed in 2021. In a letter to the site evaluation council, Inslee noted that Washington\u2019s energy demands could nearly double by 2050."

      "The March for Clean Water was organized by groups ranging from Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth to British Rowing.",

      "Private companies that provide both water and sewage have failed to update their often-Victorian infrastructure as populations have grown and demand swelled. Leaks are common, and during heavy rainfall companies discharge raw sewage into rivers, lakes and the sea.

      "Water companies say the industry regulator won\u2019t allow them to raise water bills enough to finance improvements.",
      "The Labour Party government, elected in July, has introduced a bill to strengthen regulation and impose tougher penalties on water companies responsible for pollution. But the demonstrators said more needs to be done.",
      "Nature broadcaster Chris Packham, who attended the march, said Britain\u2019s rivers are \u201damong the worst in Europe.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019m hopeful, firstly because we know what we need to do, and we have the technologies to fix it. What we need to do is to convince our new government to act more rapidly,\u201d he said."

      "The reverse hurdle stunned the Jaguars and set up an Eagles field goal for 10-0 lead. But Barkley also had a costly mistake.",

Barkley then fumbled on the next possession, the loose ball scooped by Travon Walker and returned 35 yards for a TD. The Jaguars cut it to 22-16 after another 2-point conversion.",

Before he hurdled for a first down, Barkley hauled in an over-the-shoulder 20-yard touchdown catch in the corner of the end zone to make it 7-0 \u2014 significant for the lead, yes, but also the Eagles scored their first points in the first quarter all season.",
      "After an Eagles touchdown was wiped out on offensive pass interference, Barkley got the ball on the next play and hustled 19 yards for the score and a 16-0 halftime lead.",

      "The Red Bull driver had expected a tough weekend at Interlagos.

In a crash-ridden race where visibility was hindered by the constant spray of water from the cars in front, Verstappen kept overtaking car after car and ended up finishing almost 20 seconds ahead of second-placed Esteban Ocon of Alpine.",
      "\u201cIt was definitely an emotional win,\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cI was really motivated and put everything into this race and I surprised myself today as I wasn\u2019t expecting to finish in P1.\u201d",
      "The manner of the victory also sent a message to some of Verstappen's critics, who had described his driving style as being too aggressive.",
      "\u201c(Verstappen) silenced a few critics today,\u201d said former F1 champion Damon Hill, who himself was one of those critics.",
      "In his post-race press conference, the Red Bull driver also took a shot at some of the British journalists who have questioned his abilities in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cI have a quick question here. I appreciate all of you being here, but I don\u2019t see any British press,\u201d Verstappen said, drawing laughter. \u201cDo they have to run to the airport, or they don\u2019t know where the press conference is?\u201d",
      "Fans at Interlagos were also impressed by the Dutch driver's performance.",
      "Many of them, like Carlos Santos de Ara\u00fajo, 65, were hesitant to support Verstappen because of his ties to Nelson Piquet, the father of his girlfriend Kelly and the main rival of another Brazilian three-time F1 champion, the late local hero Ayrton Senna.",
      "Sunday'a race put Verstappen under a different light, de Ara\u00fajo said.",
      "\u201cNo one can be indifferent to what Max did today. I am sure he will think this the best race of his life, one of the best here at Interlagos,\u201d he said, wearing a Senna shirt and a Mercedes cap. \u201cHardcore F1 fans like me do like him as a driver, but today probably changed his status for us all. Anyone who thought he was just cold and sometimes arrogant will see the fighter that he was to win this. That adds to him being a champion.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Retired NBA great Michael Jordan and his fellow owners of two NASCAR teams headed to federal court for a hearing in their antitrust fight against the stock car series over what they say is an unfair business model",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Retired NBA great Michael Jordan and his fellow owners of two NASCAR teams went to federal court Monday for a hearing in their antitrust fight against the stock car series over what they say is an unfair business model.",
      "23XI Racing, which is owned by Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, and Front Row Motorsports, owned by restaurant entrepreneur Bob Jenkins, sued NASCAR and chairman Jim France in October after months of tense negotiations over NASCAR's charter system, which is essentially a franchise model that includes revenue sharing.",
      "The two teams say NASCAR gave all Cup Series teams a last-minute, take-it-or-leave-it offer in September that both 23XI and Front Row refused to sign. The owners contend the charter system limits competition by unfairly binding teams to the series, its tracks and its suppliers, and they called the France family and NASCAR \"monopolistic bullies.\u201d",
      "The two teams are represented by Jeffrey Kessler, the top antitrust lawyer in the country, who argued repeatedly they are only asking for a temporary injunction that allows them to compete without the clause that would prevent their ongoing lawsuit.",
      "He said NASCAR has since rescinded the charter agreements offered to 23XI and FRM in September.",
      "\u201cWe do not challenge the entire charter agreement. We want a return to status quo,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cWe are not seeking a seven-to-14-year argument. Let us operate under the terms they offered for the duration of the (court) case and race under the charter terms for the duration of the case.\u201d",
      "Kessler said NASCAR is fighting the injunction because NASCAR does not believe it has a winnable case.",
      "The fight is playing out as NASCAR heads into its championship weekend, with the title-deciding race set for Sunday in Phoenix with 23XI Racing's Tyler Reddick among the four drivers who can win.",
      "After a hearing that lasted nearly two hours, U.S. District Judge Frank D. Whitney said he'd have a decision on 23XI and FRM's request for a preliminary injunction to be recognized in 2025 as chartered teams by Friday \u2014 when cars hit the track in Phoenix to begin preparations for the title-deciding race.",
      "Jordan listened to Kessler's arguments from the front row of the gallery, and he leaned forward intently for the entirety of NASCAR's case before the court.",
      "I n a brief comment outside court, Jordan said he didn't think the legal battle would detract from 23XI's effort to win the championship with Reddick.",
      "\u201cNo, I've been in situations of disparity. I think the race team is going to focus on what they have to do this weekend, which I expect them to do,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI think Jeffrey did an unbelievable job today, and I think I put all my cards on the table. I'm looking forward to winning a championship this weekend.\u201d",
      "At issue before the court is 23XI and FRM's request to be released from a clause in NASCAR's agreement that prohibits teams from suing the sanctioning body. Both teams have said they will operate as \u201copen\u201d teams in 2025 if they don't receive the injunction, but even that agreement prevents them from suing NASCAR.",
      "Also, an \u201copen\u201d team is not guaranteed a spot in the weekly 40-car field, does not receive the same amount of revenue as chartered teams, and its drivers and sponsors potentially could leave because they are associated with unprotected chartered teams.",
      "The charter system began in 2016 and has now twice been extended, with the deals signed by 13 organizations set to run from 2025 through 2031.",
      "Christopher Yates, of Latham & Watkins LLP, represented NASCAR and France. He said the teams have plenty of options outside of NASCAR.",
      "\u201cMr. Jordan had a choice: They could invest in NASCAR, IndyCar, buy another NBA team,\u201d Yates said, \u201cbut they chose to invest in NASCAR.\u201d",
      "Yates also disputed the notion that the 13 teams who signed the charter agreements 48 hours before the playoffs began in September did so under coercion, but he used slides that cherry-picked quotes that left out the parts where owners admitted to reporters that NASCAR threatened to kill the entire charter process if it did not receive signed agreements within a very short time period.",
      "\u201cWe're talking about Roger Penske, Rick Hendrick and Joe Gibbs \u2014 people who do not get pushed around,\u201d Yates said.",
      "Kessler called Yates' synopsis a \u201ccomplete distortion\u201d of the facts.",
      "Kessler also argued that the terms of the new charters potentially could put the two teams out of business, and cause Reddick to leave 23XI even if he wins the championship Sunday.",
      "\u201cWe have a potential champion who would be free to leave and we'd never get him back,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cThis could put these teams out of business. You can't go to a stock car team and ask them to become a Formula 1 team.\u201d",
      "Whitney last week denied an expedited discovery request from 23XI and Front Row for NASCAR to produce documents prior to Monday's preliminary injunction hearing.",
      "\u201cWhile the proposed discovery requests may help plaintiffs show a likelihood of success on the merits, they are not sufficiently narrowly tailored,\" Whitney wrote.",
      "Jordan, Hamlin and Curtis Polk of 23XI were joined by Jenkins and Front Row President Jerry Freeze for the hearing, which is crucial to how next season will proceed for the two teams.",
      "The teams argue that NASCAR would not be harmed by the injunction because the series had planned to have 36 chartered teams and allowing them to compete as chartered teams while pursuing the lawsuit was maintaining the status quo.",
      "NASCAR now says it plans to run 32 chartered teams and eight open cars (instead of four) in its 40-car field each week. Front Row and 23XI currently have two charters apiece that they did not sign, and both have deals with Stewart-Haas Racing to buy one charter each.",
      "Those deals have not closed and NASCAR has indicated it won't recognize the sales. NASCAR is alleging it is only honoring the 32 charter agreements that were signed in September.",
      "NASCAR contends the two teams don\u2019t meet the requirements for an injunction because they can still compete as open teams and that any damages that they suffer if they prevail in the case can be covered monetarily.",

      "Kerby Joseph scored on a 27-yard interception return, and the Lions converted two fourth downs into touchdowns as they continued one of the best starts in franchise history by beating the Green Bay Packers 24-14 on a rainy and windy Sunday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re built for this, man,\" Lions coach Dan Campbell said. \u201cJust because we play indoors, it doesn\u2019t matter. We can play anywhere. We can play in the snow. We can play in the rain. We can play in the mud. That\u2019s just us. We\u2019re built to win.\u201d",
      "The NFC North-leading Lions are 7-1 for the first time since 1956. They withstood the second-quarter ejection of safety Brian Branch and won at Lambeau Field for a third straight year, the first time they've done that since a run of six straight at Lambeau from 1986-91.",
      "By the time Jared Goff took a knee to conclude his latest efficient game, the Lions fans in the stands were chanting his name.",
      "\u201cIt's pretty cool,\u201d said Goff, who completed his first 11 passes and finished 18 of 22 for 145 yards and a touchdown. \u201cI heard it all. Our fans are awesome. They came out and showed out again. It's a lot of fun to play for a team that has a fan base that travels.\u201d",
      "Over his past last six games, Goff has completed 82.8% of his passes and has a 140.1 passer rating, both the best over any six-game stretch in NFL history.",
      "Detroit took the lead for good on the first play of the second quarter when Goff hit Amon-Ra St. Brown for a 3-yard touchdown on fourth-and-goal. Jahmyr Gibbs capped the opening drive of the second half by rushing for a 15-yard touchdown on fourth-and-1 to extend the Lions\u2019 lead to 24-3.",
      "Green Bay\u2019s Jordan Love went 23 of 39 for 273 yards with an interception, one week after he left in the third quarter of a 30-27 victory at Jacksonville with a groin strain. Jayden Reed had five catches for 113 yards and Josh Jacobs rushed for 95 yards.",
      "The Packers (6-3) outgained the Lions 411 yards to 261 but wasted several opportunities. Green Bay drove inside Detroit\u2019s 35-yard line on three possessions without scoring. The Packers' four trips to the red zone resulted in one touchdown and two field goals.",
      "\u201cThey played a clean game, much cleaner than we did,\u201d Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. \u201cI was disappointed with the number of penalties and just self-inflicted wounds that we had. You can't do that against a really good football team.\u201d",
      "The game turned late in the second quarter, with Detroit\u2019s starting safeties playing featured roles.",
      "Green Bay trailed 7-3 when Branch was ejected for a helmet-to-helmet hit on Packers receiver Bo Melton during a pass incompletion near Green Bay\u2019s sideline. Branch also drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for gesturing to the Lambeau Field crowd, giving the Packers a first down at the Detroit 32 rather than facing third-and-20 from their own 38.",
      "But the Packers failed to capitalize on the situation. Their drive ended with Brandon McManus sending a 46-yard field-goal attempt wide left. Detroit marched down the field on its next series and extended its lead to 10-3 on Jake Bates\u2019 27-yard field goal.",
      "Green Bay got the ball back with less than a minute left in the half. Facing second-and-2 from Green Bay\u2019s 38, Love rolled right under pressure. Love's pass was intended for Jacobs but went directly to Joseph, who caught it with arms outstretched and raced down the Lions sideline to the end zone.",
      "\u201cI didn't see him when I threw it,\u201d Love said. \u201cI just saw Josh kind of trying to get out of there. The ball didn't go where I wanted it to.\u201d",
      "Joseph\u2019s pick-6 was his sixth interception of the season, tying Green Bay\u2019s Xavier McKinney for the NFL lead. He\u2019s picked off a pass in five of Detroit\u2019s last six games and became the first safety to intercept at least 14 passes through his first three seasons since Hall of Famer Ed Reed did it from 2002-04.",

    "story": [
      "Duke freshman Cooper Flagg turned in an all-around floor game against his home-state team in the seventh-ranked Blue Devils' season opener",
      "DURHAM, N.C. -- Cooper Flagg felt nerves and excitement ahead of his highly anticipated regular-season debut for No. 7 Duke in its famed Cameron Indoor Stadium. Coming out of the tunnel to see the opponent wearing the jersey of his home-state program \u2014 one with long ties to his family \u2014 added a little extra feeling.",
      "The nation's No. 1-ranked recruit and preseason Associated Press All-American had 18 points, seven rebounds, five assists and one flashy dunk to help the Blue Devils beat Maine 96-62 on Monday night.",
      "It came against a program where his mother played basketball, where the Newport, Maine, native went to games while he was growing up about 30 minutes away from the campus. And where his brother Ace \u2014 who was sitting behind the Black Bears bench while their parents sat behind the Duke sideline \u2014 will play next year.",
      "\u201cI think even for me, it was a little more emotional walking out seeing the Maine across their chest,\u201d Cooper Flagg said. \u201cObviously, that\u2019s a team that I grew up watching when I was young. Seeing them gave me a lot more emotions and knowing it was the first real game. It was definitely a high-emotion game for me, but I was able to just take it in stride and handle business.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-9 forward didn\u2019t have a hot-shooting start to a career that is all but certain to be a single-year stopover on the way to the NBA as a possible No. 1 overall pick. But he turned in an all-around floor game that had him making plays on the glass, as a facilitator and bringing the ball up in transition all the same.",
      "He made 6 of 15 shots in his roughly 30 minutes of work, making all six of his free throws but missing all four of his 3-point shots \u2014 including a couple in the first half that either rolled or rattled out. But he also glided across the court to make his presence felt within the flow of the game, including a pair of waved-off finishes after the whistle that would have counted as and-1s with continuation rules at the next level.",
      "\u201cI thought he was close to having 25 tonight honestly, with some of those finishes, a couple of open shots,\" said Duke coach Jon Scheyer, who outdueled two-time reigning national champion UConn to land Flagg. \"That\u2019s going to fall. I think the thing that\u2019s exiting for me watching him is just how he makes everybody better and how he plays every possession.\u201d",
      "Indeed, beyond the assists that came either with high-low entries to 7-foot-2 freshman Khaman Maluach or by skipping the ball across the defense, Flagg also drew eight of Maine's 19 team fouls on the night as a matchup problem for the America East program. He also showed plenty of zip, at one point diving on the floor for a steal after knocking the ball loose near halfcourt \u2014 with Duke up 29 points with about four minutes left.",
      "\u201cHe just goes out and has fun and plays basketball,\u201d junior point guard Tyrese Proctor said. \u201cHe doesn't overcomplicate his game. He just makes the right play and it's really fun to play with.\u201d",
      "Flagg's first college points came on free throws, his first field goal on a stickback with 6:25 before halftime. And yes, there was an impressive move that the \u201cCameron Crazies\u201d \u2014 and anyone else ready to dissect Flagg's every move \u2014 were ready to see when Flagg dribbled around defender Quion Burns, curled into the paint and took off from just outside the charge circle to throw down a full-extension dunk with his right hand.",
      "Flagg's night ended abruptly when he landed awkwardly in traffic on the baseline and stayed down with 3:28 left due to cramps, with trainer Jose Fonseca coming over to briefly work on his left leg. But Flagg soon hobbled back to the bench to watch the final minutes while chugging from a Gatorade water battle.",
      "Afterward, Scheyer said he was glad to hear that Flagg could \u201cadmit and say he was emotional\u201d about playing against Maine with all the ties to the program. And to listen to Black Bears coach Chris Markwood, the feeling was mutual in being on hand for the next step of Flagg's \u201cstorybook\u201d journey from small-town Maine to one of college basketball's famed arenas.",
      "\u201cI think we're a little bit in awe because you just don't see it happen a lot in the state of Maine,\" Markwood said. \"He's got a whole state behind him. Everybody is just cheering him along and can't wait to watch everything he does.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The College Football Playoff selection committee will release its first rankings of the season on Tuesday night",
      "After two months of college football comes the first chance to see if committee members in charge of setting the new, 12-team bracket for the playoff have been watching the same season unfold as everyone else.",
      "If they have, then Oregon \u2014 undefeated and a unanimous No. 1 in the latest AP Top 25 \u2014 will get top billing when the first of six sets of weekly rankings are revealed Tuesday evening.",
      "If not, then who would they pick? Miami, BYU and Indiana are the nation's top undefeated teams alongside the Ducks, but one thing the committee has made clear is that wins and losses are only one factor in determining its top 25. That list will eventually be used to slot teams into the final bracket that will be unveiled Dec. 8.",
      "Strength of schedule will also play a big factor and would account for teams with one loss, setting the table for the likes of Ohio State and Georgia potentially being ranked higher than the unbeaten.",
      "The playoff is expanding from four to 12 teams this year, college football's latest attempt to find a perfect way to crown a champion. That the expanded playoff adds eight more games that were then sold to ESPN for $7.8 billion certainly played a big role in these calculations.",
      "A committee of 13 people will pore over the results from the first 10 weeks of the season and rank the teams from 1 through 25. This is just a starting point, because none of these rankings are solidified until Dec. 8 \u2014 the date of the last poll, at which point the teams will be slotted into the bracket based on their ranking.",
      "Well, not exactly. The five best-ranked conference champions are guaranteed spots in the playoff no matter where they're slotted in the poll. And the top four are guaranteed first-round byes.",
      "So, for instance, let's say BYU wins the Big 12 and was ranked ninth by the CFP (that is its ranking in this week's AP poll). That means BYU would automatically move up to No. 4 in the CFP bracket, since the top four conference champs get byes. And if, for instance, Boise State wins the Mountain West, is ranked lower than 12 by the CFP but no other Group of Five school is ranked ahead of the Broncos, they would make the playoff anyway.",
      "There are seven at-large selections and no limit to the number of at-large bids a conference can receive.",
      "If Oregon isn't placed atop the standings, then the committee is watching a different sport than the rest of us. The Ducks have beaten five Big Ten opponents by three touchdowns or more and also have a one-point victory over Ohio State, ranked third by AP.",
      "It will be interesting to see what the committee does with Notre Dame, an independent with no way to win a conference (and a bye) that is 7-1 but also has a home loss to Northern Illinois in Week 2 on its resume.",
      "Also, Indiana is 9-0 and not finding much resistance on its less-than-brutal Big Ten schedule. Doubters will be looking at that Nov. 23 matchup against Ohio State.",
      "Once the bracket is set Dec. 8, here is what comes next:",
      "\u2014 Seeds five through eight will host seeds nine through 12 in first-round games on campus. Those games will be played on Dec. 20 (one game) and Dec. 21 (three).",
      "\u2014 The quarterfinals will be played in traditional bowl games on Dec. 31 (Fiesta Bowl) and Jan. 1 (Peach, Rose, Sugar). Where the top four seeds will be aligned as closely as possible with current and traditional bowl tie-ins. For example, the Big Ten champion would play in the Rose Bowl and the SEC champion likely plays in the Sugar Bowl.",
      "\u2014 The semifinals will also be played in bowl games. This season, that\u2019s Jan. 9 at the Orange Bowl and Jan. 10 at the Cotton Bowl.",
      "\u2014 The championship game will be played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on Jan. 20.",

      "Demarcus Robinson made a one-handed, 39-yard touchdown reception in overtime, and the Los Angeles Rams stunned the Seattle Seahawks 26-20",
      "SEATTLE -- Demarcus Robinson had the undisputed highlight for the Rams on Sunday, a one-handed, 39-yard touchdown reception in overtime that gave Los Angeles a 26-20 victory over the Seattle Seahawks.",
      "But Matthew Stafford, who threw the beautiful deep ball that Robinson hauled in with cornerback Riq Woolen all over him, said the play of the game happened a few minutes earlier \u2014 on defense.",
      "The Seahawks drove to the Rams 16 on the opening possession of overtime and went for it on fourth-and-1 instead of trying a field goal. Bobby Brown III and Omar Speights stopped Kenneth Walker III for no gain, setting up Stafford and the Rams' offense.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t get the ball right there, we don\u2019t get a chance,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cThe defense did a hell of a job getting us the ball back.\u201d",
      "Although the Rams only needed a field goal, Stafford went for the win by throwing to Robinson, who grabbed the ball in the end zone with his one free hand and secured it as he fell to the turf. Robinson spiked the ball and was mobbed by teammates.",
      "Stafford threw for 298 yards, two touchdowns and one interception for the Rams (4-4), who have won three straight after losing four of their previous five. Robinson finished with six catches for 94 yards and both scores.",
      "Geno Smith passed for 363 yards with three touchdowns and three interceptions for the Seahawks (4-5), who have lost four straight at home and five of six overall to fall into last place in the bunched-up NFC West. Jaxon Smith-Njigba had seven catches for a career-best 180 yards and two scores.",
      "The Seahawks have a much-needed bye week to figure out what's gone wrong.",
      "\u201cWe've got the right guys, we just have to make it come to life,\u201d first-year Seattle coach Mike Macdonald said. \u201cBut out back's against the walls and we've got to go.\u201d",
      "The Rams rallied from a 13-3 deficit and took a 20-13 lead on Kamren Kinchens\u2019 103-yard interception return early in the fourth quarter, only to let the Seahawks tie it when Smith connected with Smith-Njigba for a 14-yard touchdown with 51 seconds left.",
      "Stafford tried to drive the Rams into position for a winning field goal, but the drive stalled just short of midfield and Los Angeles punted to set up overtime.",
      "\u201cWhat a unique, weird game that was,\" Rams coach Sean McVay said. \u201cWhat a job by our group to come away with the win.\u201d",
      "Kinchens had two of the Rams' three interceptions of Smith, both in the red zone in the fourth quarter. On first-and-goal from the 6, Smith was pressured and made an ill-advised throw directly to Kinchens, who took it out of the end zone and was untouched as he ran the length of the field. It was the longest pick-6 in franchise history.",
      "A blocked put set up Seattle deep in Los Angeles territory again, but Smith was pressured again and Kinchens picked off his short pass on second-and-goal from the 4.",
      "Robinson came up big for the Rams after receiver Puka Nacua was ejected in the second quarter for throwing a punch at Seahawks linebacker Tyrel Dodson following an interception by Woolen. After the game, Nacua called it a learning experience.",
      "\u201cObviously, that's not something he wants to do, he doesn't want to not be out there and play with us,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cSometimes emotion gets the best of us but I've got total trust and confidence in his ability to respond and understand those are things we can't do.\u201d",
      "The Seahawks, meanwhile, were without top receiver DK Metcalf because of a right knee sprain, and Smith-Njigba filled the void.",
      "The game began quietly, with the teams combining to punt eight times before the second quarter was halfway over.",
      "The Rams got their first pick when Smith's first-quarter pass meant for Smith-Njigba bounced off his hands and into the arms of Jaylen McCollough, who leads all NFL rookies with four interceptions this season. He\u2019s the first Rams rookie with at least four interceptions since Janoris Jenkins in 2012.",
      "Smith hit Tyler Lockett for a 30-yard touchdown for a 6-3 lead and Jason Myers missed the extra point. With 5 seconds left in the first half, Smith-Njigba caught a 24-yard scoring pass for a 13-3 advantage.",
      "Stafford connected with Robinson from 1-yard out on LA's first possession of the second half to get the Rams within 13-10.",
      "\u201cWhat an up and down game, right?\u201d Stafford said. \u201cOur defense getting turnovers. We got down there and didn't score from the 1, we had a punt blocked. It was all over the place. It took a lot of mental fortitude and strength and belief to win that.\u201d",
      "Rams: CB Josh Wallace injured a leg on the kickoff to open the second half and did not return. ... OT Rob Havenstein limped off the field with an ankle injury late in the third quarter.",

      "The slumping Las Vegas Raiders have fired offensive coordinator Luke Getsy as part of an offensive coaching staff shakeup",
      "HENDERSON, Nev. -- The slumping Raiders fired offensive coordinator Luke Getsy as part of an offensive coaching staff shakeup Sunday night, less than a year after Las Vegas hired him.",
      "Quarterbacks coach Rich Scangarello and offensive line coach James Cregg also were let go. Both also were on the job less than a year.",
      "The moves come on the same day the Raiders lost 41-24 at Cincinnati, their fifth defeat in a row to fall to 2-7.",
      "Coach Antonio Pierce's decision-making also has come under scrutiny after what had been a feel-good story for Raiders fans after he went 5-4 as the interim coach to end last season. By making these moves, there will be increased focus on what Pierce does moving forward to get the Raiders going in the right direction.",
      "He will meet with the media on a virtual call Monday morning and likely will be asked who will fill the now vacant jobs.",
      "Pierce had touted the hiring of Getsy, who came to Las Vegas with major question marks about being fired by the Bears after last season, largely for his handling of quarterback Justin Fields. Chicago opted to not only dismiss Getsy but trade Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers.",
      "With Getsy in charge, the Raiders have ranked near the bottom of the NFL in several offensive categories. They average just 18.7 points and 280.2 yards per game.",
      "Expectations were low entering the season because the Raiders' quarterbacks were journeyman Gardner Minshew and second-year pro Aidan O'Connell, who was steady but far from spectacular over the final half of last season. The Raiders have since signed Desmond Ridder, who flamed out in Atlanta and was on Arizona's practice squad.",
      "Plus, there was the trade drama surrounding wide receiver Davante Adams, who eventually was shipped to the New York Jets.",
      "Regardless, Getsy did himself few favors with often conservative play-calling that came under increasing scrutiny each week as the losses the piled up. He showed little ability to make in-game adjustments.",
      "The Raiders scored opening-drive touchdowns in four their past five games and four on the other 50 series combined.",
      "Midseason changes are not new for the Raiders, who will be changing head coaches or coordinators in the middle of the year for the fourth time in the past five seasons.",
      "Defensive coordinator Paul Guenther was fired late in the 2020 season, coach Jon Gruden was replaced five games into 2021 over the release of his offensive emails, and coach Josh McDaniels was fired after eight games last season. Now Getsy is gone.",

      "Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott will miss at least one game with a hamstring injury that the team says is still being evaluated",
      "FRISCO, Texas -- Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott will miss at least one game with a hamstring injury that the team said Monday is still being evaluated.",
      "Coach Mike McCarthy ruled out Prescott for Sunday's game at home against Philadelphia. Prescott was injured in the second half of a 27-21 loss at Atlanta.",
      "Multiple reports citing anonymous sources said Prescott was expected to miss multiple games. McCarthy said putting his 31-year-old QB on injured reserve was a possibility. That move would sideline Prescott at least four games.",
      "\u201cObviously a lot of conversation,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI think once the doctors and really once he figures out exactly where he\u2019s at, those are conversations that will probably happen here over the course of this week.\"",
      "Any lengthy absence for Prescott would be another setback in a season full of them for the Cowboys (3-5), who are on their first three-game losing streak since 2020. Dallas played the last 11 games of that 6-10 season without Prescott after he broke an ankle.",
      "Prescott said after the Atlanta game that he noticed something might be wrong with the hamstring on a scramble, then felt something he hadn't before on a throw. He didn't play in the fourth quarter.",
      "Cooper Rush replaced Prescott against the Falcons. Rush was 4-1 as the starter filling in for Prescott two years ago after Prescott broke a thumb in a loss to Tampa Bay in the opener. Dallas went on to the second of three consecutive 12-win playoff seasons.",
      "\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t change anything with us,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThis is about the quarterback room. We\u2019ve always invested all the time and energy into the quarterback, Dak, that has the football. So now it\u2019s Cooper\u2019s turn, and Dak will be part of that process.\u201d",
      "The Cowboys are already three games behind Washington and Philadelphia in the loss column in the NFC East. The defending division champs host the Eagles (6-2) on Sunday, and Rush figures to get the call.",
      "Trey Lance, the No. 3 overall pick by San Francisco in 2021, will be Rush's backup. The 49ers traded Lance to the Cowboys last year after he lost a battle for the backup job.",
      "Lance played extensively in the preseason as the 24-year-old finishes out his four-year rookie contract. McCarthy indicated there were no immediate plans to get a glimpse of what the future with Lance might be.",
      "Rush led the Cowboys on an 86-yard drive capped by his 4-yard pass to Jalen Tolbert in the final two minutes to cut the Falcons' lead to six points. Atlanta recovered an onside kick to seal the victory.",
      "\u201cI think if you just look at the way we played the last game, we just really want to improve on the things we did well but also we\u2019ve got to clean up the pre-snap penalties,\u201d McCarthy said. Our focus is really to go into this and have a game plan to beat the Eagles defense, and we have great confidence in Cooper.\"",
      "In Prescott's first eight seasons, Dallas missed the playoffs twice when he wasn't healthy from start to finish.",
      "The 2017 season was marred by running back Ezekiel Elliott's six-game suspension over domestic violence allegations. A quick start in 2019 faded to an 8-8 finish, and then-coach Jason Garrett's contract wasn't renewed. McCarthy, Garrett's replacement, is in the final year of his contract.",
      "\u201cIt's definitely hard,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI just think this is the path that\u2019s been cut out for us. We\u2019re going through adversity and it\u2019s a phenomenal opportunity for us as a team.\u201d",

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Retired Eagles center Jason Kelce apologized during ESPN's pregame show Monday night after grabbing the phone of an unruly fan and spiking it to the ground before the Ohio State-Penn State game last weekend.",
      "\u201cIn a heated moment, I decided to greet hate with hate,\u201d Kelce said before ESPN's broadcast of the Buccaneers-Chiefs game featuring his brother, Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce. \u201cI fell short this week.\u201d",
      "Jason Kelce was attending the Big Ten matchup between the Buckeyes and Nittany Lions in State College, Pennsylvania, on Saturday when the incident occurred. Video on social media showed him walking through a crowd near Beaver Stadium and fans asking for photos and fist bumps when one fan began to heckle him and appeared to shout an anti-gay slur directed toward his brother for dating Taylor Swift.",
      "At that point, Kelce grabbed the fan's phone and threw it to the ground, then turned to confront the man dressed in Penn State attire. Kelce appeared to use the same anti-gay slur during the exchange before another fan stepped between them before the altercation could escalate.",
      "\u201cI think everybody has seen on social media what happened this week,\u201d Kelce said on the ESPN broadcast. \"Listen, I\u2019m not happy with anything that took place. I\u2019m not proud of it. In a heated moment I chose to greet hate with hate and I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s a productive thing, I really don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think it leads to discourse and it\u2019s the right way to go about things. In that moment I fell down to a level that I shouldn\u2019t have.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is, I try to live my life by the golden rule, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always been taught,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to treat people with common decency and respect, and I\u2019m going to keep doing that moving forward.\u201d",

      "For instance, trainees are taught on how to detect and properly dispose of the radiological elements of discarded medical equipment that militants could use to fashion a weapon. Another emerging threat is the possible use of off-the-shelf drones to disperse chemical or biological agents over populated centers.",
      "CYCLOPS has been the product of ever-closer Cypriot-U.S. defense and security ties, earning plaudits from U.S. officials all the way up to the White House. During Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides\u2019 meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden last week, the center figured prominently as an example of enhanced bilateral security cooperation.",
      "The center was built on a $7 million U.S. government grant, $2 million of which was for the purchase of border security equipment. The island nation's proximity to the Middle East was seen as an asset to helping train officials from the region, whose options for such training would otherwise be very limited. The Cypriot government has secured another $5.6 million in European Union funding to expand the center and purchase additional high-tech equipment.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s such a huge interest by different agencies of the U.S. and the U.N. too, because they have seen the value of utilizing CYCLOPS because of its proximity to their neighboring countries,\u201d Chrysiliou said.",
      "Another selling point for the center is that it\u2019s situated a stone\u2019s throw away from Cyprus\u2019 main international airport of Larnaca and is close to top-flight accommodations that this tourism-reliant country is known for.",
      "The center's managers want to procure an expansive virtual reality system enabling officials to safely train on biological, chemical and radiological agents. Chrysiliou liaises daily with Kevin Keeler from the U.S. State Department\u2019s Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) program, who called the VR system a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d",
      "Although the center does have small quantities of radiological and other dangerous substances for training, a virtual simulator would greatly enhance the center\u2019s training capacity.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already put the word out about this new virtual simulator and we have agencies like, okay, how can we get on the schedule next year when it\u2019s not even been built yet? Yes, because it\u2019s a big factor in today\u2019s world,\u201d said Keeler.",
      "It\u2019s still early days for the center to count on headline-grabbing cases where WMD materials have been seized at any given border. Chrysiliou said what\u2019s equally important in acting as a potent deterrent is to send out the message that trained professionals \u201chave the means and the ways to check and stop you.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo if we teach Iraqis or Yemenis or Libyans or from other countries to do a better job in controlling their borders, in controlling the dispersion of weapons of mass destruction ... it makes their citizens much safer and more secure,\u201d said Chrysiliou."

      "A Japanese nuclear reactor that restarted last week for the first time in more than 13 years after it survived a massive earthquake and tsunami that badly damaged the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant has been shut down again due to an equipment problem",
      "TOKYO -- A Japanese nuclear reactor that restarted last week for the first time in more than 13 years after it had survived a massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that badly damaged the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant was shut down again Monday due to an equipment problem, its operator said.",
      "The No. 2 reactor at the Onagawa nuclear power plant on Japan\u2019s northern coast was put back online on Oct. 29 and had been expected to start generating power in early November.",
      "But it had to be shut down again five days after its restart due to a glitch that occurred Sunday in a device related to neutron data inside the reactor, plant operator Tohoku Electric Power Co. said.",
      "The reactor was operating normally and there was no release of radiation into the environment, Tohoku Electric said. The utility said it decided to shut it down to re-examine equipment to address residents' safety concerns. No new date for a restart was given.",
      "The reactor is one of three at the Onagawa plant, which is 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of the Fukushima Daiichi plant where three reactors melted following a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, releasing large amounts of radiation.",
      "The Onagawa plant was hit by a 13-meter (42-foot) tsunami triggered by the quake but was able to keep its crucial cooling systems functioning in all three reactors and achieve their safe shutdowns.",
      "All of Japan\u2019s 54 commercial nuclear power plants were shut down after the Fukushima disaster for safety checks and upgrades. Onagawa No. 2 was the 13th of the 33 still useable reactors to restart.",
      "Japan's government last year adopted a plan to maximize use of nuclear energy and is pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024. killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. It caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate."

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 13:38:20 -0500",
    "summary": "It&rsquo;s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too",

      "It\u2019s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too",
      "It\u2019s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too.",
      "Returnless refunds are a tool that more retailers are using to keep online shoppers happy and to reduce shipping fees, processing time and other ballooning costs from returned products.",
      "Companies such as Amazon, Walmart and Target have decided some items are not worth the cost or hassle of getting back. Think a $20 T-shirt that might cost $30 in shipping and handling to recover. There are also single-use items, such as a package of plastic straws, that might be difficult to resell or medicines that could be unsafe to market again.",
      "Analysts say the companies offering returnless refunds do it somewhat sporadically, typically reserving the option for low-cost objects or ones with limited resale value. But some online shoppers said they've also been allowed to keep more pricey products.",
      "Dalya Harel, 48, received a return-free refund recently after ordering a desk from Amazon that cost roughly $300. When the desk arrived, she noticed it was missing some key pieces and would be impossible to put together, Harel said. She couldn't request a replacement and have it within a reasonable time for the office of her New York lice detection removal service because the item was out of stock.",
      "Harel, who routinely buys towels and other products from Amazon for her business, said her team reached out to the company's customer service line. She was pleasantly surprised to hear she would get a refund without having to send back the desk.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one less headache to deal with,\u201d Harel said. \u201cIt was really nice for us to not have to make an extra trip up to the post office.\u201d",
      "She used the desk pieces to create makeshift shelves in her office in Brooklyn.",
      "While the retail practice of letting customers keep merchandise and get their money back is not exactly a trade secret, the way it works is shrouded in mystery. Companies are not keen to publicize the circumstances in which they issue returnless refunds due to concerns over the potential for return fraud.",
      "Even if brands don't provide details about such policies on their websites, returnless refunds are expanding in at least some retail corners.",
      "Amazon, which industry experts say has engaged in the practice for years, announced in August that it would extend the option to the third-party sellers who drive most of the sales on the e-commerce giant's platform. Under the program, sellers who use the company\u2019s fulfillment services in the U.S. could choose to offer customers a traditional refund for purchases under $75 along with no obligation to return what they ordered.",
      "Amazon did not immediately respond to questions about how the program works. But publicly, it has pitched returnless refunds more directly to international sellers and those who offer cheaper goods. Items sold in an upcoming section of Amazon's website, which will allow U.S. shoppers to buy low-cost goods shipped directly from China, will also be eligible for returnless refunds, according to documents seen by The Associated Press.",
      "In January, Walmart gave a similar option to merchants who sell products on its growing online marketplace, leaving it up to sellers to set price limits and determine if or how they want to participate.",
      "China-founded e-commerce companies Shein and Temu say they also offer returnless refunds on a small number of orders, as does Target, the online shopping site Overstock and pet products e-tailer Chewy, which some customer said had encouraged them to donate unwanted items to local animal shelters.",
      "Wayfair, another online retailer cited by some customers as offering returnless refunds, did not reply to a request for comment on its policies.",
      "Overall, retailers and brands tend to be careful about how often they let customers keep items for free. Many of them are deploying algorithms to determine who should be given the option and who should not.",
      "To make the decision, the algorithms assess multiple factors, including the extent to which a shopper should be trusted based on prior purchasing \u2013 and returning \u2013 patterns, shipping costs and the demand for the product in the customer\u2019s hands, according to Sender Shamiss, CEO of goTRG, a reverse logistics company that works with retailers like Walmart.",
      "Optoro, a company that helps streamline returns for Best Buy, Staples and Gap Inc., has observed retailers assessing the lifetime value of a customer and extending returnless refunds as a type of unofficial, discreet loyalty benefit, according to CEO Amena Ali.",
      "The king of online retail appeared to verify the process works that way.",
      "In a statement, Amazon said it offers returnless refunds on a \u201cvery small number\u201d of items as a \u201cconvenience to customers.\u201d",
      "The company also said it's hearing positive feedback from sellers about its new program that authorized them to tell customers they could keep some products and still be reimbursed. Amazon said it was monitoring for signs of fraud and setting eligibility criteria for sellers and customers. It didn't provide additional details on what that encompassed.",
      "Some retailers also are stiffening the liberal return policies they long employed to encourage online orders. Shoppers who enjoyed making purchases on their computers or cellphones became accustomed to loading up their digital shopping baskets with the intent of returning items they ended up not liking.",
      "Shopping online also grew significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homebound consumers reduced their trips to stores and relied on sites like Amazon for everyday items. Retail companies have talked in recent years about returns becoming more expensive to process due to the growing volume, rising inflation and labor costs.",
      "Last year, U.S. consumers returned $743 billion worth of merchandise, or 14.5% of the products they purchased - up from 10.6% in 2020, according to the National Retail Federation. In 2019, returned merchandise was valued at $309 billion, according to loss prevention company Appriss Retail.",
      "Last year, roughly 14% of returns were fraudulent, costing retailers $101 billion in losses, according to a joint report from the National Retail federation and Appriss Retail. The problem spans from low-level forms of fraud - such as shoppers returning already worn clothing - to more complicated schemes by fraudsters who return shoplifted merchandise or items purchased on stolen credit cards.",
      "To deter excessive returns, some retailers, including H&M, Zara and J. Crew, started charging customers return fees in the past year. Others have shortened their return windows. Some shopping sites, such as the Canadian retailer Ssense, have threatened to kick frequent returners off their platforms if they suspect abuse of their policies.",
      "However, retailers don't all view frequent returners in the same way. Such customers could be seen as \u201cgood returners\u201d if they purchase \u2013 and keep \u2013 many more items than they send back, Ali said.",
      "\u201cOftentimes, your most profitable customers tend to be high returners,\u201d she said."

      "It was the latest in a series of penalties against Meta by South Korean authorities in recent years as they increase their scrutiny of how the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, handles private information.",

      "The eruption at Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki around midnight spewed thick brownish ash as high as 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) into the air and hot ashes hit several villages, burning down houses including a convent of Catholic nuns, said Firman Yosef, an official at the Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki monitoring post.",
      "He said volcanic material was thrown up to 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from its crater, blanketing nearby villages and towns with tons of volcanic debris and forcing residents to flee.",
      "Rescuers were still searching for more bodies buried under collapsed houses, said Abdul Muhari, the National Disaster Management Agency\u2019s spokesperson. Muhari said all the bodies, including a child, were found with a 4-kilometer (2.4 mile) radius of the crater.",

      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",
      "When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said \"this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat.\u201d The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status.",
      "\u201cWe find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\u201d the agency concluded.",
      "The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion.",
      "The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project \u201cwill result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.\u201d",

      "Japan is planning an automated cargo transport corridor between Tokyo and Osaka to make up for a shortage of truck drivers",
      "TOKYO -- Japan is planning to build an automated cargo transport corridor between Tokyo and Osaka, dubbed a \u201cconveyor belt road\u201d by the government, to make up for a shortage of truck drivers.",
      "The amount of funding for the project is not yet set. But it's seen as one key way to help the country cope with soaring deliveries.",
      "A computer graphics video made by the government shows big, wheeled boxes moving along a three-lane corridor, also called an \u201cauto flow road,\u201d in the middle of a big highway. A trial system is due to start test runs in 2027 or early 2028, aiming for full operations by the mid-2030s.",
      "\u201cWe need to be innovative with the way we approach roads,\u201d said Yuri Endo, a senior deputy director overseeing the effort at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.",
      "Apart from making up for a shrinking labor force and the need to reduce workloads for drivers, the system also will help cut carbon emissions, she said.",
      "\u201cThe key concept of the auto flow-road is to create dedicated spaces within the road network for logistics, utilizing a 24-hour automated and unmanned transportation system,\u201d Endo said.",
      "The plan may sound like a solution that would only work in relatively low-crime, densely populated societies like Japan, not sprawling nations like the U.S. But similar ideas are being considered in Switzerland and Great Britain. The plan in Switzerland involves an underground pathway, while the one being planned in London will be a fully automated system running on low-cost linear motors.",
      "In Japan, loading will be automated, using forklifts, and coordinated with airports, railways and ports.",
      "The boxes measure 180 centimeters in height, or nearly six feet, and are 110 centimeters, or 3.6 feet, by 110 centimeters in width and length, about the size of a big closet.",
      "The system, which is also intended for business deliveries, may be expanded to other routes if all goes well. Human drivers may still have to do last-mile deliveries to people's doors, although driverless technology may be used in the future.",
      "Japan's shortage of truck drivers is worsening due to laws that took effect earlier this year that limit the amount of overtime drivers can log. That's seen as necessary to avoid overwork and accidents and to make the jobs tolerable, but in Japanese logistics, government and transportation circles, it\u2019s known as the \u201c2024 problem.\u201d",
      "Under current conditions, Japan's overall transport capacity will plunge by 34% by 2030, according to government estimates. The domestic transport capacity stands at about 4.3 billion metric tons, almost all, or more than 91%, by trucks, according to the Japan Trucking Association.",
      "That's a fraction of what's moving in a massive country like the U.S. About 5.2 trillion ton-miles of freight are transported in the United States each year, and that's projected to reach more than 8 trillion ton-miles of freight by 2050. A ton-mile measures the amount of freight shipped and how far it\u2019s moved, with the standard unit being one ton being moved one mile.",
      "Demand for deliveries from online shopping surged during the pandemic, with users jumping from about 40% of Japanese households to more than 60%, according to government data, even as the overall population keeps declining as the birth rate falls.",
      "As is true in most places, truck drivers have tough jobs requiring them to be on the road for days at a time, work that most jobseekers find unappealing.",
      "In recent years, annual fatalities from delivery trucks crashing on roads have hovered at about 1,000 deaths. That's improved from nearly 2,000 deaths in 2010, but the Trucking Association, which groups some 400 trucking businesses and organizations in the nation, would like to make deliveries even safer.",
      "The association is also urging consumers to hold back on delivery orders or at least bundle their orders. Some industry experts are urging businesses to limit free delivery offers.",
      "Trucks carry about 90% of Japan\u2019s cargo, and about 60% of Japan\u2019s fresh produce, like fruits and vegetables, come from distant places requiring trucking, according to Yuji Yano, a professor at the Ryutsu Keizai University, which is funded? by deliveries giant Nippon Express Co., now called NX Holdings, and focuses on economics and liberal arts studies, including trucking problems.",
      "\u201cThat means the 2024 problem isn\u2019t just a transportation problem but really a people\u2019s problem,\u201d Yano said.",

    "story": [
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to clarify remarks he made at a New York campaign rally where he suggested that Republicans may try to repeal legislation that has spurred U.S. production of semiconductor chips",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday that Republicans \u201cprobably will\u201d try to repeal legislation that spurred U.S. production of semiconductor chips, a statement he quickly tried to walk back by saying he would like to instead \u201cstreamline\u201d it.",
      "Johnson made the initial comment while campaigning for a vulnerable New York GOP congressman in a district that is anticipating a large new Micron semiconductor manufacturing plant.",
      "A reporter asked Johnson whether he would try to repeal the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had disparaged last week. \u201cI expect that we probably will, but we haven\u2019t developed that part of the agenda yet,\" Johnson replied.",
      "Democrats quickly jumped on the Republican speaker\u2019s comments, warning that it showed how Johnson and Trump are pursuing an aggressive conservative agenda bent on dismantling even popular government programs. The White House has credited the CHIPS Act for spurring hundreds of billions of dollars of investments as well as hundreds of thousands of jobs. Vice President Kamala Harris has pointed to the legislation on the campaign trail as proof that Democrats can be entrusted with the U.S. economy.",
      "Johnson, who voted against the legislation, later said in a statement that the CHIPS Act, which poured $54 billion into the semiconductor manufacturing industry, \u201cis not on the agenda for repeal.\"",
      "\u201cTo the contrary, there could be legislation to further streamline and improve the primary purpose of the bill\u2014to eliminate its costly regulations and Green New Deal requirements,\u201d the speaker's statement said.",
      "It wasn't the first recent comment Johnson has had to walk back. Earlier this week he had to clean up comments he made saying he wanted to \u201ctake a blow torch to the regulatory state\u201d and make \u201cmassive\u201d changes to the Affordable Care Act. After facing political blowback, he said that repealing the health care law was \u201cnot on the table.\u201d",
      "The incident was emblematic of Johnson's struggle working closely with Trump and at the same time campaigning for his House colleagues, especially those locked in tough reelection battles that are crucial to Republicans holding a narrow majority. The speaker was campaigning for Rep. Brandon Williams, a New York Republican who worked in the tech industry before running for Congress and supported the CHIPS Act.",
      "Williams said in a statement that he spoke privately with Johnson after he suggested that the act could be repealed.",
      "\u201cHe apologized profusely, saying he misheard the question,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Williams' district is anticipating a large new Micron semiconductor manufacturing plant. The company has said it received grants of $6.1 billion from the CHIPS Act to support its plans.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement Friday, \u201cAnyone threatening to repeal the CHIPS & Science Act is threatening more than 50,000 good-paying jobs in Upstate New York and $231 billion worth of economic growth nationwide.\u201d",
      "Democrats are hoping that the comments give them a late boost as they try to court working class voters in regions that depend on factory jobs. Harris, during a campaign stop in Saginaw, Michigan earlier this week, toured another semiconductor factory to bring attention to the 2022 law.",
      "In response to Johnson's comments Friday, a spokesperson for Harris' campaign, Ammar Moussa, said, \"Harris is running to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and make us competitive globally. The only way to guarantee these Republicans never get a chance to repeal these laws that are creating jobs and saving Americans money is to elect her president.\u201d",
      "As of August, the CHIPS and Science Act had provided $30 billion in support for 23 projects in 15 states that would add 115,000 manufacturing and construction jobs, according to the Commerce Department. That funding helped to draw in private capital and would enable the United States to produce 30% of the world\u2019s most advanced computer chips, up from 0% when the Biden-Harris administration succeeded Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "Viet Shelton, spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said, \u201cMost politicians usually go to a community promising to create jobs in the town they\u2019re visiting\u2026 Mike Johnson, ever the trendsetter, decided to visit a town and promise to kill jobs in that town.\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 15:13:57 -0500",
    "summary": "In a story published Nov. 3, 2024 and updated on Nov. 5, 2024, about supersized TVs, The Associated Press erroneously reported the size of televisions according to their width",
    "story": [
      "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
      "NEW YORK -- For some television viewers, size apparently does matter.",
      "Forget the 65-inch TVs that were considered bigger than average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 8 feet diagonally. That's wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a king-size bed.",
      "Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year, according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise tepid television market, according to analysts.",
      "The 38,100 televisions of at least 97 inches sold between January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs \u2014 the 19 models range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 \u2014 and introduced displays in roughly 70% of its stores.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really taken off this year,\" Blake Hampton, Best Buy's senior vice president of merchandising, said.",
      "Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at least 97 inches was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its first 98-inch TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said.",
      "Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling business, recently bought a 98-inch Sony for his 14,000-square-foot house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 85-inch TV in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home and uses some to display digital art.",
      "\u201cWe just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking for and thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony. \u201cYou get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You\u2019re sitting watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can put yourself in the scene.\u201d",
      "The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through September period, Circana said.",
      "Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski, the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a year, Kowalski said.",
      "The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of two inches in both 2021 and 2022, and 85-inch TVs began gaining traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 98-inch TVs to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 110-115 inches are on the market right now, he said.",
      "\u201cYou get better resolution over time,\" Kowalski said. \"You get better picture quality. And so just over time, it\u2019s easier to produce those sets and improve the technology.\"",
      "Best Buy's Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as \u201cincredible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re watching YouTube TV content or \u2018 NFL Sunday Ticket,\u2019 you can actually get four screens up, and that\u2019s four 48-inch screens on it,\u201d he said.",
      "Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed its 98-inch lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every scene.",
      "James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment division of Samsung's U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and experience content is shifting.",
      "\u201cIt's even more so about watching TV as a shared experience,\u201d Fishler said. \u201cThey want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at home. \u201d",
      "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, its Sam\u2019s Club division, and Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens.",
      "TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach on home theater projectors, which create a 100- to 120-inch image that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without windows.",
      "\u201cA dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the purview of projectors,\u201d Andrew Sivori, vice president in the entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer. \"But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV.\"",
      "Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd. But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, \u201cIt\u2019s still a niche business.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of people just don\u2019t have the space to put one of those in,\u201d he added.",
      "Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make sure a 98-inch TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said.",
      "But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good news is that the recommended distance for a 98-inch TV is actually just 6-12 feet from the seating area. The rule of thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine the ideal viewing distance, Samsung's Fishler said.",
      "If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go?",
      "\u201cI think we'll have to wait and see,\u201d Fishler said.",
      "___",
      "This story was first published on Nov. 3, 2024. It was updated on Nov. 5, 2024 to correct that TV sizes are measured on the diagonal, not by width.",

      "TOKYO -- A remote-controlled robot has safely returned with a tiny piece of melted fuel it collected from inside one of three damaged reactors at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant for the first time since the 2011 meltdown.",
      "The Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, said Saturday that the extendable fishing rod-like robot successfully clipped a piece of gravel of about 5 millimeters (0.2 inches), the size of a tiny bit of granola, from the top surface of a mound of molten fuel debris that sits on the bottom of the No. 2 reactor\u2019s primary containment vessel.",
      "The \u201ctelesco\u201d robot, with its frontal tongs still holding the melted fuel bit, returned to the enclosed container for safe storage after workers in full hazmat gear pulled it out of the containment vessel earlier Saturday.",
      "The sample return marks the first time the melted fuel is retrieved out of the containment vessel. But the mission is not over until it's certain that the sample's radioactivity is below a set standard and safely placed into a container.",
      "If the radioactivity exceeds the limit, the robot must go back inside the reactor to find another piece. TEPCO officials said they expect the piece is small enough to meet the requirement.",
      "The mission initially started in August for what was supposed to be a two-week round trip but had been suspended twice due to mishaps.",
      "First one was the procedural mistake at the beginning that held up the work for nearly three weeks, then the robot\u2019s two cameras designed to transmit views of the target areas for its operators in the remote control room failed. The camera problem required the robot to be pulled out all the way for replacement before the mission resumed Monday.",

      "Most rain death in an instant: the drones, the ballistic missiles, the glide bombs, the artillery shells. But Russian soldiers control another weapon they have never deployed, with the potential to be just as deadly: The nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.",
      "The NPP, as it\u2019s known, once produced more electricity than any other nuclear power plant in Europe. It fell to Russian forces in the first weeks of the full-scale invasion, and Russia has held its six reactors ever since. The plant has come under repeated attacks that both sides blame on the other.",
      "These twin dangers \u2014 bombs and radiation \u2014 shadow families in Zaporizhzhia. Most of the youngest residents of the city have never seen the inside of a classroom. Schools that had suspended in-person classes during the COVID-19 pandemic more than four years ago continued online classes after the war started in February 2022.",
      "So with missiles and bombs still striking daily, Zaporizhzhia is going on a building binge for its future, creating an underground school system.",
      "Construction has begun on a dozen subterranean schools designed to be radiation- and bomb-proof and capable of educating 12,000 students. Then, officials say, they will start on the hospital system.",
      "The daily bombs are a more tangible fear than radiation, said Kateryna Ryzhko, a mother whose children are the third generation in her family to attend School No. 88. The main building, dating to the Soviet era of the children\u2019s grandmother, is immaculate but the classrooms are empty. The underground version is nearly complete, and Ryzhko said she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to send her kids to class there. Nearly four years of online learning have taken their toll on kids and parents alike.",
      "\u201cEven classmates don\u2019t recognize each other,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only safe way to have an education and not be on screens.\u201d",
      "Within days of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Zaporizhzhia\u2019s 300,000 residents found themselves on the front lines. Unlike larger Ukrainian cities, like Kyiv or Kharkiv, there is no subway system that could do double-duty as a bomb shelter and few schools had basements where students could more safely attend classes.",
      "Many residents left \u2014 though some have returned. But the single-family homes and Soviet-style apartment blocks of Zaporizhzhia, the capital of the region that shares its name, filled nearly as quickly with Ukrainians fleeing areas seized by Russian forces, like the cities of Mariupol, Melitopol and Berdyansk.",
      "By the start of the school year in September 2022, which was supposed to mark the post-pandemic return to classrooms, schools were empty. Windows were boarded up to protect against bomb shockwaves, the lawns left unkempt. Fifty kilometers (31 miles) away, the nuclear reactor went into cold shutdown after intense negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Russian government.",
      "The IAEA has rotated a handful of staff on site ever since. There are risks even in cold shutdown, when the reactor is operating but not generating power. The main danger is that its external electrical supply, which comes from Ukrainian-controlled territory under constant Russian bombardment, will be cut off for a longer period than generators can handle.",
      "The nuclear plant needs electricity to keep crucial backups functioning, including water pumps that prevent meltdowns, radiation monitors and other essential safety systems.",
      "During a recent Associated Press trip to the Ukrainian-controlled zone closest to the nuclear plant, two airborne bombs struck electrical infrastructure in a matter of minutes as night fell. Russia has repeatedly struck at Ukraine\u2019s grid, attacks that have intensified this year. Highlighting the constant danger, electricity to the NPP was cut yet again for three days as emergency workers struggled to put out the fire. It was at least the seventh time this year that the plant was down to either a single electrical line or generator power, according to the global Nuclear Energy Agency.",
      "\u201cNuclear power plants are not meant to be disconnected from the grid. It\u2019s not designed for that. It\u2019s also not designed to be operating in cold shutdown for that long,\u201d said Darya Dolzikova, a researcher on nuclear policy at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accuses Russia of targeting nuclear plants deliberately. The 1986 meltdown in Ukraine\u2019s Chornobyl, on the northern border nearly 900 kilometers (550 miles) from Zaporizhzhia, increased the country\u2019s rates of thyroid disease among Ukrainian children far from the accident site and radiation contaminated the immediate surroundings before drifting over much of the Northern Hemisphere. To this day, the area around the plant, known in Russian as Chernobyl, is an \u201cexclusion zone\u201d off-limits except to the technical staff needed to keep the decommissioned site safe.",
      "Russian forces seized control of Chornobyl in the first days of the invasion, only to be driven back by Ukrainian forces.",
      "The Zaporizhzhia plant has a safer, more modern design than Chornobyl and there\u2019s not the same danger of a large-scale meltdown, experts say. But that doesn\u2019t reduce the risk to zero, and Russia will remain a threatening neighbor even after the war ends.",
      "An investment that might seem extreme elsewhere is more understandable in Ukraine, said Sam Lair, a researcher at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies.",
      "\u201cThey are there under a conventional air and missile attack from the Russians, and they have experience with the fact that those attacks aren\u2019t being targeted only at military targets,\u201d Lair said. \u201cIf I were in their position, I would be building them too.\u201d",
      "In addition, the Zaporizhzhia region received a European Union donation of 5.5 million iodine pills, which help block the thyroid\u2019s absorption of some radiation.",
      "Since the start of the war, Russia has repeatedly alluded to its nuclear weapons stockpile without leveling direct threats. In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would consider any attack by a country supported by a nuclear-armed nation to be a joint attack and stressed that Russia could respond with nuclear weapons to any attack that posed a \u201ccritical threat to our sovereignty.\u201d",
      "Ukrainian officials fear that the Russian attacks on Chornobyl and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plants may be just a start. During his speech in late September to the U.N. General Assembly, Zelenskyy warned that Russia was preparing strikes on more nuclear plants, which generate a large portion of Ukraine\u2019s electricity.",
      "\u201cIf, God forbid, Russia causes a nuclear disaster at one of our nuclear power plants, radiation won\u2019t respect state borders,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "The cost to build a subterranean school system is enormous \u2014 the budget for the underground version of Gymnasium No. 71 alone stands at more than 112 million hryvnias ($2.7 million). International donors are covering most of it, and the national and local governments have made it a priority on par with funding the army.",
      "\u201cEverybody understands that fortification and aid for the army, it\u2019s priority No. 1,\u201d said Ivan Fedorov, head of the Zaporizhzhia region. \u201cBut if we lose the new generation of our Ukrainians, for whom (do) we fight?\u201d",
      "Daria Oncheva, a 15-year-old student at Gymnasium 71, looks forward to the underground classes, and not just because she\u2019ll finally be in the same place as her schoolmates.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s safer than sitting at home remotely,\u201d she said.",
      "School No. 88, across town, is further along, with rooms carved out and fully lined with concrete thick enough to block an initial onslaught of radiation. The contractor leading the project is also digging trenches for Ukraine\u2019s military. When done, it will also be the primary bomb shelter for the neighborhood, whose single-family homes tend to have small orchards and trellised gardens \u2014 but no basements.",
      "An optimistic timeline has the school ready for children by December. It has three layers of rebar totaling 400 tons of metal, plus 3,100 cubic meters of reinforced concrete. The building will be topped by nearly a meter (yard) of earth, concealed by a soccer field and playground.",
      "The school will have an air filtration system, two distinct electrical lines and the ability to operate autonomously for three days, including with extra food and water supplies.",
      "Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who studies how people can survive nuclear fallout, said being underground improves survival by a factor of 10.",
      "But Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said ultimately people can do more \u2014 \u201cwhich is eliminating these weapons instead of \u2026 building, really not even a Band-Aid, for the actual problem.\u201d",
      "Lyudmila Zlatova, who has been the principal at School No. 88 for 30 years, hopes it will be a structure designed for the dangers Zaporizhzhia will face in the future. But she and the parents who gathered on a recent day were most concerned with the present, speaking at the edge of the construction pit as air raid sirens sounded.",
      "It takes 10 seconds for a bomb to reach the neighborhood from the front line, far too short a time to evacuate, and they land with unnerving frequency. The subterranean school\u2019s sunless rooms and concrete corridors will only make children more comfortable, given what they\u2019re already enduring, she said.",
      "\u201cThey will feel better studying without windows,\u201d Zlatova said, peering across at the construction site.",
      "Zlatova believes it will bring back at least some of the families who\u2019ve left Zaporizhzhia for other cities in Ukraine or elsewhere in Europe. The city remains fully functional, with public transit operating and grocery stores, markets and restaurants operating, and repairs ongoing for structures damaged by shelling \u2014 albeit in limited fashion. Around 150 of the school\u2019s 650 prewar students have left the city, but she said she\u2019s in touch with absent families and many promise to return home once there is a safe place to study.",
      "Gymnasium No. 6, which runs from first grade through high school, already has one. Its main building sits on the city\u2019s easternmost edge, closer than any other school to the front 40 kilometers (25 miles) away.",
      "Little wonder that its principal, Kostyantyn Lypskyi, seems a little frayed at the beginning of the academic year. But at least his students can attend because parents chipped in money last year to renovate the basement shelter about 50 meters from the main school building into a series of classrooms.",
      "His underground school, whose concrete walls and relatively thin metal doors are not radiation proof but protect against explosions, hold around 500 people \u2014 the same number as the new designs. The school has double that number, so students will alternate weeks. The youngest children study full-time just upstairs from the shelter, and the older ones are in the main building.",
      "\u201cOf course it will work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe prepared everything for the start of the new school year.\u201d",
      "In the earliest days of the school year, an air raid alarm meant he could test that confidence. It took five minutes from the moment the sirens sounded until the last children took their seats and spread out their books, awaiting instruction.",
      "It was morning, and they were ready for the day ahead.",

      "Online video production company MrBeast says it has fired somewhere between 5 to 10 employees following an investigation into the YouTube empire\u2019s workplace culture",
      "NEW YORK -- Online video production company MrBeast said Friday it has fired somewhere between 5 to 10 employees following an investigation into the YouTube empire's workplace culture.",
      "A company spokesman declined to put a precise number on the firings, say which employees were let go or for what reasons. But the shakeup comes as Jimmy Donaldson, who draws millions of views under the MrBeast alias with highly produced stunts and giveaways, deals with accusations of impropriety against himself, his collaborators and others within his multimillion-dollar production company that have threatened his family-friendly image.",
      "Investigators only identified \u201cseveral isolated instances of workplace harassment and misconduct,\" according to a two-page letter sent Friday by Alex Spiro, a trial lawyer who led the investigation by white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and whose clients have included Jay-Z and Elon Musk.",
      "The nearly three-month probe concluded that there was no basis behind allegations that MrBeast team members committed sexual misconduct or \u201cknowingly\u201d employed people with \u201cproclivities or histories towards illegal or questionable legal conduct.\"",
      "Spiro said the team interviewed 39 current and former employees. Millions of documents from phones, emails, and messaging platforms including Discord and Slack were also reviewed, according to the letter.",
      "The controversies surrounding the so-called King of YouTube began snowballing this summer. Ava Tyson, a Donaldson friend and fellow creator accused of sharing inappropriate sexual messages with minors over multiple years, left the channel in July. Also circulated online by YouTuber Rosanna Pansino was a 2017 recording of Donaldson making racist comments and using homophobic slurs.",
      "A preliminary July shoot for his ambitious \u201cBeast Games\u201d Amazon Prime Video show was quickly hit with safety complaints from some contestants who said they faced \u201climited sustenance\u201d and \u201cinsufficient medical staffing\u201d while competing for a $5 million grand prize.",
      "MrBeast in turn has hired new executives, including a head of personnel and a general counsel, according to Spiro, and additional employees are getting \u201ctargeted training and executive coaching\u201d for undisclosed violations of company policy.",
      "The company \u201chas grown exceedingly quickly from a YouTube start-up comprised of a group of talented young individuals to a much larger entity,\u201d Spiro wrote to MrBeast's Board of Directors. \u201cIt is not uncommon that policies and practices essential in a mature company would lag behind commercial success.\u201d",
      "Donaldson has largely remained silent on the matters. He recently launched a prepacked lunch brand alongside internet personalities Logan Paul and KSI \u2014 marking his latest entrance into the food market after his chocolate bar and burger chain were met with mixed reviews. His 325 million YouTube subscribers have continued to see their feeds filled with outlandish, high-energy videos like the recently titled \u201c100 Identical Twins Fight For $250,000.\u201d",
      "In a Friday post on X sharing Spiro's letter, Donaldson wrote that he \u201cwas asked to refrain from making public statements to enable a detailed and unbiased investigation.\u201d",
      "Pansino, one of Donaldson\u2019s most vocal critics, responded on X that the findings of \u201cworkplace harassment and misconduct\u201d and \u201cmultiple firings\u201d mean \"it might be time for a bigger investigation.\u201d",
      "Donaldson's level of fame and growth place him in \u201cpretty rare company,\u201d said advertising lawyer Robert Freund, whose practice helps creators resolve disputes. He said he suspects the letter was released in attempt to assure stakeholders \u201cthat he's running a professional operation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see anything fishy or suspicious about what we\u2019ve been presented with here as the public,\u201d Freund told The Associated Press.",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Oct 2024 06:22:34 -0400",
    "summary": "The European Union has finalized its sharply higher customs duties on electric vehicles imported from China",
    "story": [
      "The European Union has finalized its sharply higher customs duties on electric vehicles imported from China",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The European Union has finalized its sharply higher customs duties on electric vehicles imported from China. EVs are the latest flash point in a broader trade dispute over Chinese government subsidies and Beijing's burgeoning exports of green technology to the 27-nation bloc.",
      "The duties took effect provisionally in July and were finalized after talks between the EU and China failed to resolve their differences. Negotiations are expected to continue, and the EU could lift the duties if an agreement is reached.",
      "Here are some basic facts about the EU's customs duties:",
      "The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, conducted an eight-month investigation and concluded that companies making electric cars in China benefit from massive government help that enables them to undercut rivals in the EU on price, take a large market share and threaten European jobs.",
      "The duties differ depending on the maker: 17% for BYD, 18.8% for Geely and 35.3% for state-owned SAIC. Other EV manufacturers in China, including Volkswagen and BMW, would be subject to a 20.7% duty. The commission has an individually calculated rate for Tesla of 7.8%.",
      "\u201cBy adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we\u2019re standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base,\u201d European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said.",
      "The duties will stay in force for five years unless an amicable solution is found.",
      "Chinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, the commission has said.",
      "The commission says companies in China accomplished that with the help of subsidies all along the chain of production, from cheap land for factories from local governments to below-market supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises to tax breaks and below-interest financing from state-controlled banks.",
      "The rapid growth in market share has sparked fears that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU's ability to produce its own green technology needed to combat climate change, as well as the jobs of 2.5 million workers at risk in the auto industry and 10.3 million more people whose jobs depend indirectly on EV production.",
      "Subsidized solar panels from China have wiped out European producers \u2014 an experience that European governments don't want to see repeated with their auto industry.",
      "Unusually, the commission acted on its own, without a complaint from the European auto industry. Industry leaders and Germany, home to BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have opposed the tariffs. That's because many of the cars that will be hit with tariffs are made by European companies, and China could retaliate against the auto industry or in other areas.",
      "Beijing has been sharply critical of the investigation and the higher duties as protectionist and unfair.",
      "The Commerce Ministry has also launched anti-dumping investigations into European exports of brandy and pork and an investigation of dairy product subsidies. Earlier this month, it announced provisional tariffs of 30.6% to 39% on French and other European brandies, after EU member countries voted in favor of finalizing the tariffs on EVs.",
      "Officials have also said that they are weighing whether to raise tariffs on imports of gasoline-powered vehicles with large engines.",
      "Talks between the two sides focused in recent weeks on so-called \u201cprice commitments\u201d as a possible resolution. In such a scenario, carmakers would agree to a minimum selling price for their EVs in Europe.",
      "Some Chinese automakers are looking at making cars in Europe to avoid any tariffs and be closer to the market. BYD is building a plant in Hungary, while Chery has a joint venture to build cars in Spain\u2019s Catalonia region.",
      "The Biden administration is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% from the current 25%. At that level, the U.S. tariffs block virtually all Chinese EV imports.",
      "That's not what Europe is trying to do.",
      "EU officials want affordable electric cars from abroad to achieve their goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 \u2014 but without the subsidies EU leaders see as unfair competition",
      "The planned tariffs are aimed at leveling the playing field by approximating the size of the excess or unfair subsidies available to Chinese carmakers.",
      "European countries subsidize electric cars, too. The question in trade disputes is whether subsidies are fair and available to all carmakers or distort the market in favor of one side.",
      "It's not clear what impact the duties will have on car prices. Chinese carmakers are able to make cars so cheaply that they could absorb the duties in the form of lower profits instead of raising prices.",
      "Currently, Chinese carmakers often sell their vehicles overseas at much higher prices than in China, meaning they are favoring profits over market share, even given their recent market gains. Five of BYD\u2019s six models would still earn a profit in Europe even with a 30% tariff, according to Rhodium Group calculations.",
      "BYD\u2019s Seal U Comfort model sells for the equivalent of 21,769 euros ($23,370) in China but 41,990 euros ($45,078) in Europe, according to Rhodium. The base model of BYD\u2019s compact Seagull, due to arrive in Europe next year, sells for around $10,000 in China.",
      "While consumers might benefit from cheaper Chinese cars in the short term, allowing unfair practices could eventually mean less competition and higher prices in the long term, the commission argues.",

      "The ban on new iPhone models had been in place since 2023 but now, the country's telecommunications minister said authorities are allowing the registration of the new models.",
      "The minister, Satar Hashemi, said on X that the problem of registering new iPhone models on the Iranian market was \u201csolved\u201d and that Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian backed the efforts of the communication ministry toward that goal.",
      "Hashemi did not elaborate but said the import measures would be announced, soon.",
      "Following the 2023 ban, iPhone 13 and older versions could still be imported amid high demand for an item that remains a status symbol for many young Iranians.",
      "While the ban was in place, any iPhone 14, 15 or a newer model brought into Iran would stop working on Iran\u2019s state-controlled mobile phone networks after one month, the time span for tourists allowed to visit the county.",
      "The ban spurred a parallel economy for the older handsets, jacking up prices for the devices as many sought to put their depreciating Iranian rials into any physical commodity. It was a sign of the economic woes plaguing Iran after decades of Western sanctions.",
      "Imports of iPhones have long been a contentious point \u2014 government statistics suggest that about a third of Iran\u2019s entire $4.4 billion mobile phone import market consisted of iPhones before the ban.",
      "Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in 2020 pointedly criticized iPhone imports though he had previously slammed what he described as all American luxury goods.",
      "\u201cExcessive imports are something dangerous,\u201d Khamenei said at the time, according to a transcript on his official website. \u201cSometimes this import is a luxury product, meaning there is no need for it. I\u2019ve heard about half a billion dollars were spent to import one type of American luxury cellphone.\u201d",
      "However, other foreign smartphone brands such as Motorola, Samsung, Nokia, Xiaomi and Huawei remain widely available in Iran."

      "\u201cPrevious research has shown that a large part of the present-day state of Campeche is a landscape that was transformed by its ancient inhabitants,\u201d said Adriana Vel\u00e1zquez Morlet of Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Anthropology and History, a co-author of the report. \u201cNow, this study shows that a little-known region was a urbanized landscape.\u201d",
      "Mexico\u2019s National Institute said about 6,479 structures have been detected in LiDAR images covering an area of about 47 square miles (122 square kilometers). The technique maps landscapes using thousands of lasers pulses sent from a plane, which can detect variations in topography that ware not evident to the naked eye.",
      "Those images revealed structures that include what appear to be temple platforms, ceremonial ball courts, housing platforms, agricultural terraces and even what appears to be a dam. The Institute said the structures may date to between 250 and 900 A.D., but the settlement could have been started 100 years earlier.",
      "A consortium of researchers made the discovery by using software to re-examine a 2013 LIDAR survey originally carried out to measures deforestation. While re-examining the data, Luke Auld-Thomas, then a graduate student at Tulane University, noticed strange formations in the survey of the jungle.",
      "Auld-Thomas's advisor, Tulane professor Marcello Canuto, said the extensive data they've collected will \u201callow us to tell better stories of the ancient Mayan people,\u201d marrying what scientists already know \u2013 political and religious histories \u2013 with new details about how ancient civilizations were run.",
      "\u201cWe have always been able to talk about the ancient Maya especially in the lowland regions because of their hieroglyphic texts, because they left us such interesting record,\" he said. \u201cWhat we are now able to do is match that information with their settlement and the population and what they were fighting over, what they were ruling over, what they were trading.\u201d",
      "Susan D. Gillespie, an anthropology professor at the University of Florida who was not connected to the study, said that while LiDAR is a valuable tool, some of the features would have to be confirmed by researchers on the ground.",
      "\u201cThey realize that small natural rock piles (chich in the local parlance) were likely misinterpreted as house mounds, being the same size and shape. Thus, they recognize that their feature counts are preliminary,\u201d Gillespie wrote.",
      "\u201cThe final caveat, which I think must always kept in mind, is contemporaneity of use of mapped features,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cLiDAR maps what\u2019s on the surface, but not when it was used. So, a large region might be dense with structures, but the size of an occupation at any one time cannot known with aerial survey data alone.\u201d"

      "Republican women are underrepresented in Congress. This cycle won't change that.",
      "As I mentioned earlier on the blog, women make up 41% of Democrats' members of Congress, but just 15% of Republicans' members of Congress. That gap is unlikely to shrink after all the races today are projected, because the GOP nominated fewer women to run this cycle, compared to the last two cycles, and only a handful were nominated to run in safe districts.",
      "There are seven other non-incumbent Republican women we will be watching tonight, but they are running in races that our forecast rate as \"Likely Democratic\" Of these, only two are in open races, while the rest are challenging Democratic incumbents: Kari Lake, who is running in the open Arizona Senate race and wins just 22-in-100 simulations in our forecast against Ruben Gallegos, and Caroleene Dobson, who wins just 9-in-100 simulations against Shomari Figures.",
      "We will be watching these races, and a handful of others where Republican women could win, today:",
      "Will the loser of the presidential race get a consolation prize in 2026?",
      "From taxes to abortion, from immigration to health care, the policy stakes for this presidential election are large. But there is a consolation prize that is likely to go to the party that loses this presidential election: control of the House of Representatives in two years' time.",
      "Political scientists have documented that American electoral politics is subject to powerful, often predictable tides. And as I wrote back in 2016, midterm elections, and especially midterm elections for the U.S. House, offer a clear example of that. Particularly in an era of close margins in the House, whichever party loses the presidency today will become the immediate favorite to retake the House in the next election.",
      "Dating all the way back to 1980, there has only been one presidential election in which the losing party didn't wind up in control of the House of Representatives after the subsequent midterm, regardless of whether they controlled the House at the start of their president's term. In the other 11 elections since then, the party that lost the White House either regained the House or held control in the subsequent midterm. Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden all saw their party lose control of the House in their first midterm election; Republican Donald Trump did in 2018 as well.",
      "The only exception came in 2002, when 9/11 had reshaped the political landscape and helped Republicans gain seats in the House while George W. Bush was president. But even Bush was not immune from this pattern \u2014 in 2006, two years after his reelection, his Republicans lost control of both the House and the Senate.",
      "Why Sen. Ted Cruz might be in danger tonight",
      "Ted Cruz has established quite the reputation as a rabble-rouser; but his confrontational, and often unconventional, politicking has earned him yet another competitive general election challenge.",
      "This isn't the first time that the two-term senator has faced a serious challenger. In 2018, Cruz narrowly eked out a win against onetime Democratic sensation Beto O'Rourke, and it's likely tonight's race will be similarly close. 538's final average of polls gives Cruz only a 4-point lead over his opponent, Democratic Rep. Colin Allred.",
      "Part of the reason why Cruz finds himself here again is because he's one of the most loathed members of Congress. He was among several Republican senators who tried to cast doubt on the legitimacy of President Biden's victory in 2020 and has refused to answer whether he'll accept the results of his own race tonight. And despite his largely unsuccessful attempts to rebrand himself as bipartisan, Cruz has repeatedly leaned into red meat and culture issues to fire up his base of Texas' most staunch conservative voters.",
      "Texans have taken notice: According to an October poll from the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, Cruz was viewed as more ideologically extreme than Allred. Just 26% of likely voters said they'd describe Allred as \"extremely liberal\" compared with 44% who rated Cruz as \"extremely conservative.\"",
      "Allred has worked to take advantage of this perception. During a spirited debate on October 15, the former NFL player made repeated reference to the fact that he's been rated Texas' most bipartisan member of Congress. He's also tried to paint Cruz as someone who won't work across the aisle, citing, for instance, that Cruz was among a group of Senate Republicans who torpedoed a bipartisan border legislation package in February after former President Donald Trump came out against it. Allred has also laced into Cruz for refusing to say whether he agrees with Texas' near-total abortion ban and for taking that infamous trip to Canc\u00fan in 2021 amid a weeklong storm that left many of the state's residents without power or water.",
      "Cruz's attempts to fight back have mainly been focused on comparing Allred to Democratic bogeymen like Nancy Pelosi. And in the home-stretch to Election Day, Cruz has amped up attacks focused on Allred's support for policies supporting transgender Americans. (Allred in 2023 voted against the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, which would've cut off federal funds for athletic programs that allow transgender men to compete in women's or girls' sports.)",
      "538's final election forecast gives Cruz about an 84-in-100 shot at winning the Senate race. And in a lean-Republican state like Texas, the race remains his to lose. But the Republican's vulnerability for a second go-around is an interesting sight to see and raises questions about whether Democrats might be closing the gap on flipping a statewide seat there \u2014 something the party hasn't accomplished since 1994.",
      "Republicans are very likely to win the Senate majority",
      "And now for the race that is decidedly not close: the race to control the Senate. Our model gives Republicans a 92-in-100 chance of winning control of the upper chamber, which includes scenarios in which they win 51 seats or more and scenarios in which they win 50 seats as well as the White House. (The vice president breaks ties in the Senate.)",
      "Republicans' strength in our forecast comes from their expected wins in reliably red Montana and Ohio, where moderate Democratic incumbents are trying to fend off fierce competition from Republicans. In Montana, Sen. Jon Tester is trailing Republican Tim Sheehy by about 7 points in the 538 polling average. In Ohio, Sen. Sherrod Brown is polling 0.8 points behind Republican businessman Bernie Moreno. And our forecast gives the Democratic candidate in West Virginia, Glenn Elliott, less than a 1-in-100 chance of holding onto retiring Sen. Joe Manchin's seat.",
      "If Democrats lose at least two of these seats, which our forecast reckons should happen about 95% of the time, they would need to pick up new senators from either Florida or Texas to hold onto their majority. They currently have a 16-in-100 chance of winning each. That is not negligible; to return to our classic examples, it's about the chance of rolling a standard six-sided dice and getting a one. But with Democratic candidates with no record of overperformance statewide and weak polling numbers, our model thinks the party has a fairly steep uphill climb in each.",

      "Harris leads suburban women voters nationally by 15 points overall; however, Trump has a four-point advantage among white women, according to the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll. That demographic is widely believed to have contributed to his victory in 2016.",
      "Sandy Joiner, president of the Western Wake County Republican Club, has worked to canvass with Republican women competing for state and local seats.",
      "\"We have knocked on around 12,000 doors in our area,\u201d Joiner said. \"And we have, we have knocked all the doors, so we don't have any doors left. So what we're doing now is we're knocking doors in areas that may not have been reached.\"",
      "The same goals drive these women, whether they are encouraging voters to turn out in storm zones, suburbs or on college campuses. Women are likely to hold the key to determining who ascends to the White House when all the votes are counted on and after election night.",

      "Experts say Michigan is a must-win for both sides, which is why both candidates campaigned extensively across the Great Lakes.",

      "ABC News spoke with Douglas King, an autoworker and UAW member for nearly 30 years. He says the economy, like for so many other Americans, is his top issue.",
      "\"I was raised to believe that the Democrats are the party of the working people,\" King said. \"And maybe at one time they were. I don't feel that way now.\"",
      "Many union leadership endorsed Harris.",
      "In this tightly contested race, the more than 500,000 union workers are crucial for Harris; however, some of them appear to be moving away from voting for the Democratic Party. King, who voted for Barack Obama twice, has decided to support Trump for president for the third time.",
      "\"People are afraid to say they're voting for Trump because Trump supporters are put in a box, that they're these hateful, racist people that are homophobic, and it's just not true,\" King said. \"Trump has a lot of support on the plant floor.\"",
      "There are cracks in the old coalition that has consistently voted for Democrats for the past 30 years. However, Trump broke through the blue wall in 2016 by narrowly defeating Hillary Clinton by roughly 10,000 votes in Michigan.",

      "Nearly half of states have laws restricting political apparel, per NCSL.",
      "Millions of people have cast their ballots without incident so far this election. Though in some reported cases there have been issues with what voters are wearing to the polls.",
      "With early voting underway in Bexar County, Texas, Sheriff Javier Salazar told reporters recently that there have been several instances of voters wearing \"inappropriate clothing\" in support of a political candidate.",
      "\"That's electioneering, and it's certainly something that you're not supposed to do,\" Salazar said at a press briefing last month.",
      "Things \"got ugly\" in one instance last month, he said, when a man allegedly punched a 69-year-old poll worker at an early voting site in San Antonio. The altercation occurred while the man was being escorted out of the site after being asked to remove a political hat, according to Salazar. The man was wearing a red \"MAGA\" or \"Trump\" baseball cap, according to an incident report.",
      "\"I can't think of anything like this happening during my time here as sheriff,\" Salazar said.",
      "At an early voting location in Orangeburg County, South Carolina, last week, a poll worker and voter got into an altercation after the voter was told to remove his \"Let's Go Brandon\" hat, according to a police report and video of the incident.",
      "In the video, the man can be heard saying, \"It's my [expletive] right\" while holding up the hat, before tossing it. Amid the altercation, a poll worker allegedly punched the man in the face, according to the incident report. The poll worker was not arrested but was issued a summons.",
      "The incidents draw attention to laws restricting forms of political activities in or near polling places to prohibit electioneering, or any activity intended to influence voting at an election.",
      "Every state has restrictions on electioneering in some form near polling sites, \"such as limiting the display of signs, handing out campaign literature or soliciting votes within a pre-determined distance (typically 50 to 200 feet) of a polling place,\" according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL).",
      "Nearly half of states, including Texas and South Carolina, have statutes restricting what you can wear to vote, according to NCSL.",
      "These 21 states have statutes restricting campaign apparel -- like shirts, hats and buttons -- in polling places, according to NCSL: Arkansas, California, Delaware, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Vermont.",
      "NCSL's analysis is based on what the statutes state. The organization advises voters to check with their local election official, though, as implementation of electioneering laws can vary within a state.",
      "For instance, in addition to those 21 states, Massachusetts prohibits \"wearing certain political apparel (t-shirts, hats, buttons, pins, stickers, etc.)\" within 150 feet of a voting location, according to a 2024 election advisory. Examples of prohibited materials include those containing the name or face of any candidate on the ballot and slogans \"that are closely aligned with or actively used by candidates and campaigns,\" according to the advisory.",
      "Political attire is not allowed at polling sites in Missouri and Georgia, according to their respective secretary of state's offices. Electioneering is prohibited within 25 feet of a polling place in Missouri, and within 150 feet in Georgia.",
      "Poll workers in Wisconsin are also advised that \"politically-themed attire or materials/clothing/buttons supporting a candidate, political party or ballot initiative\" are not allowed at the polling place, according to poll worker training materials.",
      "The restrictions on political apparel could extend to political references beyond the candidates or issues on the ballot.",
      "For instance, in Texas, \"it is prohibited to electioneer, including expressing preference for or against any candidate, measure, or political party, regardless of whether they are or are not on the ballot, or relating to the conduct of an election,\" the Texas Secretary of State said in an recent advisory.",
      "Electioneering laws have a \"long history,\" according to Ohio State University law professor Steven Huefner.",
      "\"In many states, they respond to times when voters were more intimidated at the polls or more influenced,\" he told ABC News. \"They responded to the potential that these types of activity have more influence on the less well-known races.\"",
      "He said voters may not be aware they exist in their state \"unless they had it happen to them or unless they're an election junkie.\"",
      "Penalties for violating electioneering laws could include fines or imprisonment, though people are typically asked to remove or cover up any political items in order to vote.",
      "Some voters may view restrictions on electioneering as suppressing their First Amendment rights, Huefner noted.",
      "\"This really is a very narrow and selective exception to that based on the desire to keep the election process as secure as possible,\" he said. \"Secure includes preventing campaigns and their supporters from improperly influencing people as they vote.\"",
      "Electioneering laws have been challenged in several states through civil rights lawsuits, with some cases reaching the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "In a 1992 decision, the Supreme Court found that a Tennessee law restricting political campaigning to within 100 feet of a polling place did not violate the First Amendment.",
      "In a 2018 decision, the high court did find that Minnesota's law barring political apparel at voting sites was too broad and violated the First Amendment. A voter filed the lawsuit after he was temporarily prevented from voting in 2010 because he was wearing a T-shirt with a Tea Party logo and a button that advocated for photo ID voting requirements.",
      "Today, Minnesota prohibits \"campaign t-shirts, buttons or literature which relate to specific candidates, official political parties, or ballot questions on the ballot that day\" in polling places, according to the Minnesota Secretary of State's office.",
      "In Texas, a woman sued after she had to turn a T-shirt in support of a ballot measure inside out while voting in a 2018 election. The complaint argued that the state's electioneering laws unconstitutionally chilled her right to free speech and that enforcement was inconsistent. The laws were ultimately upheld by the appeals court after the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.",
      "Huefner said enforcement of the restrictions \"can be quite inconsistent\" between poll workers or polling places, which can lead to confusion.",
      "\"It's often being enforced by volunteers who are poll workers who may not even have had much training about how to handle this, or in one county might have been well-trained and in another county, other people aren't well-trained,\" he said.",
      "Huefner said eliminating any differential enforcement is key, while also urging voters to \"extend some grace\" to volunteers at polling places.",
      "\"Volunteers have really been under some pretty sustained, unfortunate attacks of late, and all of it undeserved,\" he said. \"They are performing this critical public service.\"",
      "In the Texas incident cited by the Bexar County sheriff, 63-year-old Jesse Lutzenberger was booked on Oct. 24 on injury to an elderly person, a third-degree felony, according to the sheriff's office. Salazar said his office was looking into additional charges for assault on an election worker.",
      "Amid an \"especially contentious election cycle,\" Salazar said he wanted to address the incident to \"bring down the tone of what's going on out there.\"",
      "\"Look, nothing here is worth getting hurt or going to jail for,\" Salazar said. \"There's no sense picking up a criminal case, picking up a criminal history -- or injuring or even killing somebody in the name of politics. It just doesn't make any sense.\"",
      "An attorney for the defendant told ABC News he is \"honored to represent Mr. Lutzenberger, a U.S. Navy veteran.\"",
      "\"We are eager for our opportunity to defend Jesse,\" the attorney, Jonathan Watkins, said in a statement. \"We feel the facts of this case have been mischaracterized by local media.\"",
      "In the Orangeburg County incident, the South Carolina Elections Division confirmed it is investigating but would not comment on an open probe.",
      "The Orangeburg County election director, Aurora Smalls, said in a statement that the county \"works hard to ensure elections are safe, secure, and run smoothly allowing all eligible voters the opportunity to vote in fair and impartial elections in accordance with state and federal regulations.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 07:24:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Here\u2019s what to know about the rules that govern if and how presidential race recounts are conducted in each of the seven swing states.",
    "story": [
      "Recent presidential recounts have not changed the winner in swing states.",
      "As Election Day arrives, polling still shows razor-thin margins between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in battleground states.",
      "If the actual vote margin remains that thin in some states, it is possible that automatic recounts could be triggered or that a campaign could request a recount, depending on that state's rules.",
      "A recent analysis of statewide recounts in general elections from 2000-2023 by the advocacy group FairVote found that statewide recounts in general elections are very rare and usually have not changed much of the vote count. Recounts have almost never changed the state's winner of a presidential election, although in 1960, a recount in Hawaii changed the winner of the state's Electoral College votes from Richard Nixon to John F. Kennedy.",
      "More recent presidential recounts have not impacted the winner in the states they were held in, including the attempted 2000 recount in Florida meant to deal with a razor-thin margin between George W. Bush and Al Gore, which the Supreme Court halted. (If Florida's results had flipped, Al Gore would have won that election.)",
      "In 2020, Donald Trump's campaign requested recounts in Georgia (after the secretary of state had already undertaken a recount) and some Wisconsin counties. In 2016, the campaign of Green Party candidate Jill Stein requested a recount that was fully undertaken in Wisconsin, and requested one in Michigan (which was halted) and Pennsylvania (which was denied).",
      "Here's what to know about the rules that govern if and how presidential race recounts are conducted in each of the seven battleground states.",
      "The \"canvass of the vote\" discussed below refers to the county and/or state procedures that compile, confirm, and validate every vote cast. Recount rules may vary for other races, such as congressional or mayoral races. An \"automatic recount\" means a recount that is mandated by state law because of the results; the term does not reflect how votes are recounted.",
      "A recount is automatically triggered in Arizona if the margin between the two candidates who received the most votes is equal or less than half a percent of the total votes cast, according to Arizona law. The recount must be completed five days after the canvass of the vote is completed, which is Nov. 30.",
      "It is not possible for a candidate, party or voters to request a recount in Arizona. (A Republican-aligned review of election results in Arizona's Maricopa County in 2021 was not a state-run recount and found no evidence that changed the results in the county.)",
      "According to Georgia law, a candidate can ask for a recount within two days of results being certified if the margin between the candidates is less than half a percentage point of the vote. Election officials can also request recounts if they think there is an issue with the results, while the secretary of state can ask for a recount if a candidate petitions them about a suspected issue. There is no explicit deadline for a recount to be completed.",
      "There are no automatic recounts in Georgia.",
      "According to Michigan law, an automatic recount is triggered in statewide races if the margin between the top two candidates is 2,000 votes or less.",
      "A candidate can petition for a recount if a few requirements are met, including \"a good-faith belief that but for fraud or mistake, the candidate would have had a reasonable chance of winning the election,\" according to Michigan law. The petition needs to be filed within 48 hours of the canvass of votes being completed.",
      "Recounts must be completed within 30 days of the end of the period that candidates are allowed to file petitions challenging results, or within 30 days of when recounts are allowed to begin.",
      "(New laws changing how recounts can be done in Michigan were signed into law this year, but will not be in effect for the 2024 election.)",
      "A candidate for presidential elector -- specifically an Electoral College elector, not the candidate -- can request a recount in Nevada up to the 13th day following the election, according to Nevada statutes. The requester needs to deposit the estimated cost of the recount with the secretary of state, but gets the deposit refunded if the recount results in a change in the winner.",
      "The recount needs to be started within a day after being requested and finished within 5 days.",
      "There is a more general statute in Nevada law that allows statewide candidates to request recounts, but this does not apply to presidential races, according to Nevada-based attorney and election law expert Bradley Schrager. Rather, the specific and more recent statute overrides the more general one, so the recount request would have to come from the presidential elector.",
      "\"In practice, that's not really significant, however, because any elector candidate would follow the direction of his or her presidential candidate,\" Schrager said.",
      "There are no automatic recounts in Nevada.",
      "A presidential candidate can request a recount in North Carolina if the margin between the candidates is less than half a percentage point or 10,000 votes, whichever is less, according to state law. (The North Carolina State Board of Elections told ABC News that the threshold this year will likely be 10,000 votes.)",
      "The candidate needs to ask for a recount by noon on the second day after the county canvassing of the vote. (In 2024, that day is Tuesday, Nov. 19.)",
      "There are cases where a requested recount would trigger an automatic recount as well, but the election results themselves do not trigger automatic recounts in North Carolina.",
      "An automatic recount is triggered in Pennsylvania if the margin between the candidates is within half a percentage of the vote.",
      "The recount must begin \"no later than\" the third Wednesday after Election Day and be done by noon on the next Tuesday, according to guidance published by the Pennsylvania Department of State.",
      "Candidates themselves cannot request recounts in Pennsylvania.",
      "In a presidential race, any presidential candidate can request a recount if the margin between the candidates that got the most votes is one percent or less of the total votes cast, according to Wisconsin state statutes. The candidate must request it within the first day after the canvass of the vote is completed.",
      "The state itself pays if the margin is 0.25% of the vote or less; if it is larger, then the candidate who requested the recount must pay. (They receive a refund if the election result changes due to the recount.)",
      "The recount must be completed within 13 days of being ordered.",
      "There are no automatic recounts in Wisconsin.",

      "More than a dozen Republicans hold seats in districts that President Joe Biden won in 2020, though many are putting up strong fights to keep their seats. A handful of Democratic incumbents are also running in districts that went for former President Donald Trump four years ago, but they, too, are working assiduously to run ahead of their national party.",

      "Here are five House races to watch Tuesday that will help determine chamber control.",
      "The open seat left by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat who is running for Virginia governor in 2025, is a good barometer for Democrats' support among suburban voters that aren't big Trump fans.",
      "The district, which stretches from the central Virginia exurbs of Washington to the Blue Ridge Mountains, voted against Trump by 2 points in 2016 and 7 points in 2020.",
      "Democrat Eugene Vindman is facing off against Republican Derrick Anderson. Vindman has name recognition and strong fundraising from his and his brother's fame as whistleblowers under Trump, while Anderson, a combat veteran, is getting immense outside help from groups in Washington.",
      "Each side is looking to associate their opponents with the most extreme flanks of their respective parties, and both candidates, as first-time contenders, lack longstanding political ties to power players in the district.",
      "Suburban seats like this are at the heart of the battlefield for the House, and Democrats' ability to keep seats like this in their column are key to flipping the chamber.",
      "GOP Rep. Mike Lawler won his first term in 2022, marking an upset against then-Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of House Democrats' campaign arm. Now, he'll have to face off against former Democratic Rep. Mondaire Jones to secure a second term and make a statement.",
      "Lawler has depicted himself as a pragmatist rather than a Trump-aligned Republican while casting Jones as a progressive, including quotes of him saying \"Defund the police.\" Jones, meanwhile, is also running in a moderate lane, voicing support for Israel and saying that his past remarks are being taken out of context, all while saying Lawler is untrustworthy on issues like abortion, which is also on the ballot this year in the form of a constitutional referendum.",
      "Biden won Lawler's district by 10 points four years ago, though Lawler is still running a competitive race.",
      "Lawler and other Republicans won a handful of seats in 2022 in the upper New York City suburbs and Long Island on the back of concerns over crime under Democratic leadership in the state. Lawler's race will be a test both of the lingering potency of those arguments and how first-term Republicans in the area fare in their first reelection bids in a presidential year.",
      "If Lawler wins, it shows that Republicans could still find success messaging on crime -- and should he win with Harris replicating Biden's success, an indication of Republicans' strength protecting incumbents in blue-leaning seats.",
      "Nebraska partially designates its Electoral College votes by congressional district, and with the 2nd Congressional District, anchored in Omaha, as the only competitive one, it has drawn outsized attention in the presidential race.",
      "Trump and Republicans in the state fought hard to change state rules to a winner-take-all system just based on the statewide tally. They failed, however, and now Trump is getting washed out in polling and fundraising in the district, essentially ceding it to Harris, who has flooded the zone there.",
      "That's left veteran GOP Rep. Don Bacon in a tough spot.",
      "Bacon is facing off in a rematch against Tony Vargas, a Democratic member of Nebraska's unicameral legislature.",
      "Bacon has been an outspoken moderate and worked diligently to keep Trump at arm's length in a district that Biden won in 2020. However, his ability to win reelection in a district that his party's presidential nominee has all but given up on is a test of the dwindling trend of ticket-splitting.",
      "New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District features a 2022 rematch between first-term Democratic Rep. Gabe Vasquez and former GOP Rep. Yvette Herrell, who he defeated two years ago.",
      "The race is focusing largely on red meat issues -- abortion for Vasquez and immigration for Herrell. The district spans 180 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Vasquez has sought to seize on past remarks from Herrell in which she said she wishes \"we could have eliminated all abortion in this state.\" Herrell has not disavowed any of her past stances, touting her support for legislation offering legal personhood to fertilized eggs, which would essentially ban abortion and treatments like in vitro fertilization.",
      "Herrell's counter argument is that voters actually care more about illegal border crossings.",
      "Vasquez comes into the race with a fundraising advantage, but the victor in this race could indicate whether key aspects of each party's message resonates with voters in swing districts.",
      "Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola won her first term in 2022 in an experiment of Alaska's first statewide ranked-choice election. Now, she'll have to pull off the feat again in a presidential year.",
      "There are two main obstacles Peltola will have to overcome. First, Republicans are more unified this time around Nick Begich, likely leaving less division among GOP voters even in a ranked-choice format. And second, she'll share a ballot with Harris and Trump.",

      "Peltola has sought to maintain her appeal by focusing on hyper local issues like fishing, boasting on her website that she has \"reduced Chum bycatch by 87%.\"",
      "Like Republicans in similar situations, Begich is working to convince voters that Peltola is not the moderate she says she is. Whether he succeeds could be a good gauge of how much a laser-focus on local issues can break through in a national climate.",

      "Former President Donald Trump and his vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance, spent the closing hours of the 2024 campaign reviving rhetoric criticized by opponents as divisive.",
      "Trump's closing rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, saw the former president deliver meandering attacks on political opponents, baselessly claim that electronic voting machines are not secure and suggest it would be the fault of his supporters if he lost Tuesday's vote.",

      "Vance, meanwhile, described Democratic leaders as \"trash\" in returning to Biden's recent remarks in which he appeared to call Trump supporters \"garbage.\"",
      "Biden's comments were in response to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe's controversial joke about Puerto Rico at last month's Madison Square Garden rally. Biden later said he was referring specifically to Hinchcliffe, not Trump supporters generally.",
      "\"To the Pennsylvanians who are struggling, no matter what Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and Tim Walz say, you are not garbage for being worried about not being able to afford your groceries,\" Vance told rally goers at an event in Newtown, Pennsylvania.",

      "NYU\u2019s Michael Waldman says the 2024 election will go \"overwhelmingly smoothly.\"",
      "Michael Waldman, president of NYU's Brennan Center for Justice, discusses how elections have become increasingly secure.",
      "In a closely contested election, even the slightest hint of doubt about whether votes are counted accurately could incite violence and exacerbate political divisions in the U.S.",
      "ABC News' Linsey Davis sat down with Waldman to talk about the unprecedented security of U.S. elections and the threat of misinformation.",
      "ABC NEWS: Two thousand threats against election workers since the 2020 election. Officials are preparing for a wave of misinformation within the next 24 hours. Joining us now is the head of the Brennan Center for Justice, Michael Waldman.",
      "Michael, thank you so much for joining us. First, let's just talk about the civic exercise of voting. What do you make of the 80 million Americans who've already voted early?",
      "WALDMAN: Well, people are eager to participate. People are eager to have their voices heard. And people are taking advantage of these new ways to vote, early voting in particular. But that still means a lot of people are going to have that time-honored sort of civic ritual of showing up on Election Day.",
      "You know, this compressed campaign with only three months where Vice President Harris has been the nominee, actually has made it more exciting, more like almost like a European campaign, a snap election than it would have been otherwise. And so we expect a very high turnout.",
      "And despite the intense and growing and far more organized threats to the election from the conspiracy theorists and the election deniers, the system is much stronger than it was four years ago. There are new laws. Law enforcement is very involved in protecting polling places, and Americans should have very little difficulty voting tomorrow in a way that is calm, probably uneventful and secure.",
      "ABC NEWS: That said, how do you think elections are going so far? Because, of course, we started out this segment with you showing the video of those ballots exploding. So people see things like that and think that must be happening everywhere. So by and large, do you feel like things are going smoothly?",
      "WALDMAN: Overwhelmingly smoothly. Yes. It's important for all of us to not overreact to one, you know, cell phone video of a, of a bombing of a drop box somewhere. That's exactly what the conspiracy theorists want us to do.",
      "What I'm more worried about is what comes after the election, because, you know, Donald Trump and others have said, well, the only way he can lose is if there's massive cheating. And already it appears that Russia and others are pumping disinformation into the system.",
      "And we can expect a lot of fake videos, deep fakes, a lot of lies coming not before the voting, but after. It's really important we remember it's going to take a few days to count the votes. That doesn't mean it's a problem. It doesn't mean there's fraud. It just means that the public servants who run the elections are doing their job conscientiously.",
      "ABC NEWS: So if you were a betting man, when do you think that we might be able to determine who has won this election? And I'm asking that based on when you think we're going to start getting those results in, because a number of the states, including Pennsylvania, they're saying that they have newer, faster equipment and that they could very well have their results by Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning.",
      "WALDMAN: So it varies state by state. And it really would be better off if all states were as fast as they could be. Michigan and North Carolina, among these swing states, are likely to come in early. Pennsylvania did not change its law to make it so they could start counting absentee ballots before Election Day. They do have new equipment and that should make a difference. Again, we're not going to know the results.",
      "We have heard already that Donald Trump is going to claim victory tomorrow night, just as he did in 2020 before the votes are counted. And so whenever we hear him or any other candidate claiming victory before the votes have been counted, know that it's basically, it's not real. It's not on the level. And that's part of the disinformation we all have to kind of have our guard against.",
      "ABC NEWS: Brennan Center head Michael Waldman, we thank you so much for your time tonight. Appreciate it.",
      "WALDMAN: Thank you.",

    "summary": "Foreign powers await the U.S. choice just as Americans do.",
    "story": [
      "Foreign powers await the U.S. choice just as Americans do.",
      "As American voters head to the polls, the direction of the country, not the world, is likely to drive their decision.",
      "But there's a reason the president of the United States is often referred to as the leader of the free world. The victor will play a monumental role in shaping consequential international dynamics --but the uncertainty swirling around the election is already having an impact on global issues.",
      "Foreign affairs also have the potential to motivate voters in both overt and subtle ways, and in a race as tight as the contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, these issues may tip the scale.",
      "ABC News spoke to analyst as well as current and former officials to understand what impact the election is having on the world -- and how the world is affecting the election.",
      "Even as protests over Israel's war in Gaza swell on American city streets, and even as Ukrainian flags are unfurled from porches in solidarity with the country's efforts to fend of Russia's invasion, very few Americans say these issues are a major factor in their choice for president.",
      "In fact, just 2% of likely voters this election cycle say that foreign policy is the most important issue to them, ranking it dead last out of seven topics presented to them in a poll conducted by CNN. (The economy came in first, with 41% of respondents saying it was their top priority.)",
      "Kori Schake, a senior fellow and the director of Foreign and Defense Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, says that while international issues aren't usually on the top of voters' minds, they test political leaders in profound ways and have the ability to immovably shape the public's judgment.",
      "\"You can actually see it in the polling of support for President Biden, that it dropped substantially after the disgraceful withdrawal from Afghanistan. It really never recovered,\" she said.",
      "Schake argues that the powerful images of desperate Afghans chasing after U.S. aircraft, clinging to the wings in the harried evacuation brought the so-called \"Forgotten War\" into focus and \"really changed public attitude.\"",
      "\"President Biden and his administration billed themselves as a safe pair of hands--you're not going to have the recklessness of the Trump administration,\" she said, adding that the exit \"really shattered that frame of reference.\"",
      "Schake also says that matters like the Israel-Hamas war, China's economic rise and Russian aggression that have become topics of kitchen table conversation may help voters draw contrasts between the candidates.",
      "But despite the lengthy speeches and political platforms, the rhetoric of the campaign trail doesn't lend itself to nuanced explanations on their different approaches to these matters.",
      "\"Americans tend not to like complicated answers on foreign policy,\" Schake said. \"If you have too many objectives and if they're cutting against each other, it feels like you can't succeed.\"",
      "Schake argues that Biden and Harris are more likely to get tangled in these weeds. For example, she says their talking points on Ukraine are likely to include vows to give the country all the help it needs -- but also a substantial list of caveats intended to avoid escalation with Moscow.",
      "\"It sounds too complicated, too hard,\" Schake says.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump takes a more facile approach\u2014frequently claiming he would be able to resolve the conflict in a matter of hours.",
      "\"President Trump talks about things on the other end of the spectrum as so simple as to be simplistic. That's a lot more attractive to most American voters because it's not too complicated,\" Schake said, adding however that the reality \"often has consequences that voters won't like.\"",
      "While the outcome of the election will determine who sits behind the Resolute desk, the election itself is already impacting international affairs as the Biden White House enters its lame duck period.",
      "U.S. officials acknowledge privately that the administration's response to the developments in the Middle East have been constrained in recent weeks, as it has sought to avoid fresh rebuke over its handling of the Israeli war in Gaza--a topic that has deeply divided Democrats and could hurt Harris at the polls.",
      "Many believe Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is biding his time, too.",
      "\"Some argue that Netanyahu is seeking to wait out Biden, in hopes that a Trump presidency would create fewer pressures for concessions to Palestinian national aspirations. Some even charge that Netanyahu is doing what he can to create that outcome,\" said Jon B. Alterman, a senior vice president of the Center for Strategic & International Studies and a former State Department official.",
      "Iran is also keeping a close eye on the election, Alterman says, and is poised to become a pressing issue for the next commander-in-chief in the immediate aftermath of the inauguration.",
      "\"The new administration will need to establish its approach to Iran in the first weeks of the presidency, in part because Iran is likely to test the new president,\" he said.",
      "Steven Blockmans, an associate research fellow at the Centre for European Policy Studies, says European handwringing over the U.S. election is bound to intensify if Trump wins\u2014but that a Harris victory also comes with challenges for the continent.",
      "\"Europe has been slow to Trump-proof itself and will struggle to respond collectively to new security challenges, thus leaving the continent more vulnerable to malevolent actors,\" he said.",
      "\"A Europe-friendly President Harris would enter office as fatigue with the three-year old war in Ukraine runs high and the likelihood of shaky ceasefire deals increases,\" Blockmans continued. \"Moreover, Harris's relative lack of foreign policy experience would likely be tested by China and Russia in other theaters, thus leaving Europe to compete for attention.\"",
      "Experts say that although the U.S. electoral process itself is safeguarded from foreign actors, influence campaigns run by China, Iran and Russia are underway -- and likely to intensify after the polls close.",
      "According to an update from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released last month, the intelligence community \"expects foreign influence actors to continue their campaigns by calling into question the validity of the election's results.\"",
      "\"Foreign actors are almost certainly considering the possibility of another contested presidential election,\" the update continues. \"They will likely take advantage of such an opportunity to use similar tactics in a post-election period to undermine trust in the integrity of the election, election processes, and further exacerbate divisions among Americans.\"",
      "The intelligence community has already flagged fake videos by foreign actors, including one showing men who claim to be Haitian and to have voted in Georgia -- a video produced by the Russians, a joint statement of U.S. intelligence agencies said.",
      "Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Jenn Easterly, told ABC News' Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas last week, that all of the U.S.'s adversaries \"want just two things.\"",
      "\"They want to undermine American confidence in our elections and trust in democracy, and they want to stoke partisan discord. They want to pit Americans against each other, and they are looking for any opportunities to create rage, and we know that enragement equals engagement,\" the cyber chief said.",

      "Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have tied in the Dixville Notch midnight vote kicking off the official start to 2024's Election Day.",
      "Following the national trends, indicating a very close race, Harris and Trump each garnered three votes between the six registered voters in Dixville Notch, a small New Hampshire north country town.",
      "The group -- composed of four registered Republicans and two registered undeclared voters -- remained split in their decision for president.",
      "With more journalists at the Balsam Resort than voters, the entire process from start to finish lasted nearly 10 minutes. After the national anthem was played, all six voters walked one-by-one into the voting booth before the ballots were subsequently hand counted and read out loud as the results were scribbled on a white board.",
      "In the race for New Hampshire\u2019s governor, Republican gubernatorial candidate Kelly Ayotte received five votes indicating that Dixville Notch opted to split their ballots compared to the presidential race.",
      "In the last two presidential elections, the Dixville Notch voters have tilted toward the Democrats, giving all five of their votes in 2020 to President Joe Biden and four of their seven votes in 2016 to Hillary Clinton.",
      "The tradition dates back nearly 60 years, but this year, Dixville Notch is the only town in New Hampshire that voted at midnight. Officials with two other towns that traditionally join in on the midnight voting -- Millsfield and Hart's Location -- have decided to hold more traditional, daytime voting hours.",

    "story": [
      "Democrats basically need a straight flush to hold on to control of the Senate.",
      "Senate Democrats are heading into Tuesday's elections facing the fight of their lives: defending a 51-49 majority with a map so formidable that Republicans have called it their best opportunity in a decade to gain ground.",
      "Republicans have already all but gotten that down to 50-50, with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, retiring, likely assuring that GOP Gov. Jim Justice will replace him in one of the deepest red states in the country.",
      "Now, Democrats are basically needing to pull a straight flush to keep themselves in the majority, leaning on several battle-hardened incumbents and House members to keep red- and purple-state seats in their column while also eyeing an extremely small set of highly difficult flip opportunities.",
      "How to watch ABC News live coverage of 2024 election results.",
      "And even if they succeed in defending all the blue seats, Democrats may still find themselves in the minority if former President Donald Trump defeats Vice President Kamala Harris, with vice presidential nominee JD Vance serving as the GOP tiebreaker.",
      "Here are five Senate races to watch Tuesday that will help determine Senate control and the sliver of races where Democrats are on offense.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, a three-term incumbent, has emerged from tough races before, despite running in unfriendly territory. But his race for a fourth term may be his toughest challenge yet.",
      "Tester is running against businessman and former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, a wealthy candidate who was highly sought after by Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Steve Daines, the chair of Senate Republicans' campaign arm who has made it his mission to unseat Tester, his fellow Montanan.",
      "The polls are daunting for Tester -- he's behind by more than 5 points in 538's polling average, and he hasn't led in the metric since July 9.",
      "Tester has leaned on his authenticity as a seven-fingered farmer and third-generation Montanan to suggest that he hears the concerns of his constituents and is fighting for them. He's also hoping that an abortion referendum on the ballot will help boost turnout among Democrats.",
      "Sheehy, meanwhile, has run as a businessman who accuses Tester of being out of touch with the increasingly Republican state and Washington overall being dysfunctional. He's faced a slew of attacks from Tester, including questions over how he suffered a gunshot wound to his forearm and the fact that he's not originally from Montana, a state that has long prioritized a sense of place but has increasingly seen wealthy out-of-staters buy land.",
      "Still, Tester is thought to be facing tough odds despite his past successful high-wire acts. Trump won the state by over 16 points in 2020, and while Tester is anticipated to run ahead of Harris, such a margin at the top of the ticket could be insurmountable for the incumbent senator.",
      "Unless Democrats can pick off a GOP-held seat, a Tester loss would likely hand Republicans the Senate majority.",
      "Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is also running for his fourth term in a state that has gone from purple to red, imperiling his chances of reelection.",
      "Brown is running as a blue-collar populist, sporting a gravelly voice and often wrinkled suit that emphasize his everyman bona fides. A vocal union supporter and opponent of some international trade agreements before it was cool, Brown has consistently overperformed with the kind of white voters without a college degree who used to vote Democratic but have defected en masse to Trump.",
      "He's also leaned heavily on the issue of abortion after 57% of Ohioans supported a referendum last year protecting access to the procedure. He's also launched ads featuring support from law enforcement as a way to separate himself from national Democrats' brand.",
      "Brown is facing Bernie Moreno, a Colombian immigrant and businessman. Moreno has worked hard -- and spent millions -- to cast Brown as too liberal for a state that went for Trump by 8 points twice. He, too, has focused on social issues, including abortion and transgender athletes participating in female sports.",
      "Moreno has never led in the 538 polling average, but he has significantly cut into Brown's edge, now trailing by just 1.2 points after being down by 6.5 points at the end of July. Moreno has been aided by a flood of outside spending from Republicans in Washington who are looking to build as large of a majority as possible, particularly as Montana appears to be increasingly out of reach for Democrats.",
      "Here too, the presidential margin is anticipated to play a significant role. Like Tester, Brown is expected to run ahead of Harris. But if Trump expands his margin of victory a third time around, Brown could face significant headwinds.",
      "Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow's retirement opened a top opportunity for Republicans to fill a purple-state vacancy.",
      "The race pits Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin against former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers. Slotkin has a 3.5-point edge in 538's polling average, as well as a fundraising advantage, but the lack of an incumbent makes the race particularly appetizing for Republicans.",
      "Slotkin has leaned on her past as a CIA analyst who deployed to Iraq, Rogers' votes against abortion protections and her crossover appeal, including her endorsement from former Rep. Liz Cheney.",
      "Rogers, meanwhile, has embraced Trump after past criticism and attacked Slotkin over transgender athletes and worries over the manufacturing of electric vehicles (Slotkin repeats that she lives on a dirt road but wants the \"next generation\" of vehicles to be made in the state).",
      "A massive X factor in both the presidential and Senate races in the state is the war in Gaza, which has infuriated Michigan's substantial Arab population and risks leaving voters displeased with and disaffected from President Joe Biden and Democratic candidates this year.",
      "Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, a three-term incumbent, is a fixture in Pennsylvania -- his father was a former governor and the Casey name rings out across the state.",
      "However, he'll face a well-heeled opponent in Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund executive who was heavily recruited to run this year. He ran in 2022, but lost to Dr. Mehmet Oz in the GOP primary. Oz went on to lose to now-Sen. John Fetterman, D.",
      "Pennsylvania is home to fierce and competitive presidential-level fighting and the Senate race is no different. Casey is up by 2.6 points in the 538 polling average, though that has shrunk from a more than 8-point lead in August.",
      "Casey and Democrats have attacked McCormick over abortion, his residence in Connecticut and past business ties to China. McCormick, meanwhile, has embraced Trump after bumping heads with him in 2022 after he endorsed Oz, and accused Casey of being out of touch with Pennsylvanians and too entrenched in Washington, pushing voters to \"make a change\" on Tuesday.",
      "Dealmaking Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, announced in March that she wouldn't run for a second term, setting up a prime flip opportunity for Republicans.",
      "However, Kari Lake, the failed 2022 gubernatorial nominee and GOP Senate nominee this year, is on her back foot.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego has held a consistent lead in 538's polling average even as Trump is thought to have an edge in the state on the presidential level.",
      "The race represents a rare case of low name recognition being advantageous, particularly in a state like Arizona that values pragmatism.",
      "Gallego has an extensive past as a progressive, but he wasn't a particularly well-known lawmaker outside of his district, offering him a chance to rebrand himself as a moderate, including supporting things like increased border enforcement after hammering Trump's border wall.",
      "Lake, meanwhile, became a MAGA rock star in 2022, particularly after she panned \"McCain Republicans\" and refused to accept her loss in the gubernatorial race that year. She has sought to moderate this year, including reaching out to former Gov. Doug Ducey, but she has a more cemented image of a firebrand than Gallego, making it difficult to appeal to centrists in and around Phoenix who hold the key to victory in Arizona.",
      "She still has not conceded the results of her 2022 race or Trump's 2020 loss.",
      "The race could offer key clues as to how Democrats could keep Latino voters in their column amid widespread worries of defections this year. Gallego, of Colombian and Mexican descent and a combat veteran, has said that he has talked to Latino voters who say they'll support both him and Trump.",
      "The race will also serve as a barometer of sorts on the margin in the overall Senate. Republicans will rue a missed opportunity if Gallego wins, but if Lake is able to pull a victory off, it likely means that Republicans have had a good night elsewhere too.",
      "Democrats are playing in a small handful of Republican-held seats, though they face steep odds in flipping any of them.",
      "GOP Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida are facing off against Rep. Colin Allred and former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, respectively. FiveThirtyEight's polling averages show both Democrats within striking distance, and the national party has begun spending money there, particularly in Texas. However, both red states are tough territory for Democrats to gain ground in, particularly in a presidential year.",
      "Independent Dan Osborn is also challenging GOP Sen. Deb Fischer in Nebraska. Osborn has insisted he won't caucus with either party in the Senate, but Republicans have worked hard to paint him as a Democrat in centrist's clothing. Polling indicates a tight race, but Osborn too faces headwinds in a state with a heavy Republican lean.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 07:37:33 -0500",
    "summary": "As Election Day draws near, many Americans may be experiencing stress and anxiety. Here's how to cope.",
    "story": [
      "Uncertainty about the election may be the main driver of stress, experts said.",
      "It's officially Election Day, and former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are making their final campaign pushes across the country.",
      "As Americans consider which candidates to vote for, and which ballot initiatives to support, experts tell ABC News that election seasons often lead to increased levels of stress, anxiety and uncertainty.",
      "A 2022 study from the University of Nevada, Reno, found that self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression rose significantly around the 2020 election compared to April 2020, in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"Election stress and anxiety is very real, and so anyone that is feeling it should know that there are literally probably millions of other people that are that are also experiencing this right now,\" Dr. Kevin Antshel, a professor of psychology at Syracuse University, told ABC News.",
      "What's behind election stress, anxiety",
      "Experts said there are a few reasons why people may be feeling stress and anxiety, with one reason being the uncertainty associated with the election.",
      "Dr. Judson Brewer, director of research and innovation at the Mindfulness Center at the Brown University School of Public Health, said it's a basic survivor strategy that dates back thousands of years.",
      "\"If our ancient ancestors [heard] a rustling in the bushes, and they weren't sure what that sound was, and they didn't go and investigate, it could be a lion that was coming to have them for lunch, so that the process is really baked in,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Brewer said the same way people's stomachs rumble for food when they are hungry, there's a similar process in the brain.",
      "\"Information is food for our brain just like a sandwich is food for our stomach,\" he said. \"The basic underlying process is that our brains really don't like uncertainty. So, it's not about who's going to win. It's about the uncertainty of who might win.\"",
      "People also may experience uncertainty because they are not sure what to believe about the candidates and their platforms due to misinformation and disinformation.",
      "Dr. Jessica Borelli, a professor of psychological science at University of California, Irvine, added that people may feel uncertainty the election can result in changes in access to health care, reproductive rights, immigration-related rights, economic policy and climate change policy.",
      "\"There can be a lot of uncertainty related to one's future when there's a change in the government structure,\" she told ABC News. \"It can cause a change in policy, many different policies that can directly affect people's livelihood.\"",
      "Election-related stress and anxiety may also be caused by the inundation of political ads on social media or television and by being exposed to a 24/7 news cycle covering the election.",
      "Coping strategies",
      "To cope with election stress and anxiety, Antshel recommends that people first focus on things they do have control over in their everyday lives, which can provide a sense of accomplishment.",
      "\"If we know uncertainty is the poison here, then the antidote is certainty, and so what do we have control over?\" he said.",
      "Borelli said if people want to be politically active, they can focus on concrete tasks that they have control over, like helping get people registered to vote or participating in canvassing.",
      "Another way to cope is to set boundaries around news consumption and social media use and take the time to form connections with others offline, experts said.",
      "Brewer added that if people can identify their triggers, such hearing polarizing news, then people can focus on replacing the behavior with something more beneficial, whether it's limiting news consumption or becoming more politically active.",
      "Additionally, the experts said it's important to practice self-care, including getting adequate sleep, eating healthy, getting plenty of physical activity and practicing mediation or mindfulness.",

      "Some Republican-led states say they they will block Justice Department\u2019s election monitors from going inside polling places on Election Day, pushing back on federal authorities\u2019 decades-long practice of watching for violations of federal voting laws",
      "WASHINGTON -- Some Republican-led states say they will block the Justice Department's election monitors from going inside polling places on Election Day, pushing back on federal authorities' decades-long practice of watching for violations of federal voting laws.",
      "Officials in Florida and Texas have said they won't allow federal election monitors into polling sites on Tuesday. And on Monday, Missouri filed a lawsuit seeking a court order to block federal officials from observing inside polling places. Texas followed with a similar lawsuit seeking to permanently bar federal monitoring of elections in the state.",
      "The Justice Department announced last week that it's deploying election monitors in 86 jurisdictions across 27 states on Election Day. The Justice Department declined to comment on the moves by the Republican-led states, but filed court papers urging the judge to deny Missouri's request.",
      "The race between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump is a dead heat, and both sides are bracing for potential legal challenges to vote tallies. The Justice Department\u2019s election monitoring effort, a long practice under both Democratic and Republican administrations, is meant to ensure that federal voting rights are being followed.",
      "Here's a look at election monitors and the states' actions:",
      "_____",
      "Election monitors are lawyers who work for the Justice Department, including in the civil rights division and U.S. attorney's offices across the country. They are not law enforcement officers or federal agents.",
      "For decades, the Justice Department's civil rights division has sent attorneys and staff members to monitor polling places across the country in both federal and non-federal elections. The monitors are tasked with ensuring compliance with federal voting rights laws.",
      "The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division enforces a number of statutes protecting the right to vote. That includes the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits intimidation and threats against those who are casting ballots or counting votes. And it includes the Americans with Disabilities Act, which mandates that election officials ensure people with disabilities have the full and equal opportunity to vote.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Justice has a nearly 60-year history of addressing Election Day issues to safeguard the voting rights of Black citizens and other communities of color,\" said Edward Casper, acting co-chief counsel at the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. \u201cWhile some recent efforts to interfere in this process may appear more bark than bite, they still pose a real threat to civil rights enforcement,\u201d he said.",
      "The 86 jurisdictions that the Justice Department will send monitors to on Tuesday include Maricopa County, Arizona and Fulton County, Georgia, which in 2020 became the center of election conspiracy theories spread by Trump and other Republicans. Another place on the list is Portage County, Ohio, where a sheriff came under fire for a social media post in which he said people with Harris yard signs should have their addresses recorded so that immigrants can be sent to live with them if the Democrat wins the presidency.",
      "Other areas where federal monitors will be sent include Detroit; Queens, New York; Providence, Rhode Island; Jackson County, South Dakota; Salem, Massachusetts; Milwaukee; Manassas, Virginia; Cuyahoga County, Ohio; and Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska. The Justice Department\u2019s monitors will be in St. Louis, four jurisdictions in Florida and eight jurisdictions in Texas.",
      "In filing the lawsuit Monday, Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft said state law \u201cclearly and specifically limits who may be in polling places.\" He also accused the federal government of \"attempting to illegally interfere in Missouri\u2019s elections.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit states that Missouri law \u201cpermits only certain categories of persons to be present in voting locations, including voters, minor children accompanying voters, poll workers, election judges, etc.\" and not federal officials.",
      "The Justice Department also sought to monitor polling places in Missouri in 2022. The agency planned to have officials at Cole County, which includes Jefferson City, the state capital. County Clerk Steve Korsmeyer said he wouldn\u2019t let them in if they show up.",
      "The federal agency backed down after Ashcroft showed Justice Department officials the state law, Ashcroft said. He says the Justice Department is now \u201ctrying to go through the back door\" by contacting local election officials for access.",
      "Messages were left Monday with the St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners.",
      "In court papers filed late Monday, the Justice Department said it has authority to conduct monitoring there under a settlement agreement with the St. Louis Board aimed at ensuring people with mobility and vision impairments can access polling places. The settlement was reached in 2021 under Trump's Justice Department after federal officials found problems, such as ramps that were too steep and inaccessible parking, according to the court papers. The settlement, which expires next year, says the board must \u201ccooperate fully\u201d with Justice Department's efforts to monitor compliance, \u201cincluding but not limited to providing the United States with timely access to polling places (including on Election Day).\u201d",
      "The Justice Department said an attorney and investigator from its Disability Rights Section are in St. Louis to inspect for accessibility issues Tuesday. The department has carried out such inspections under the settlement agreement on \u201cmultiple occasions,\u201d including in the April local elections, government lawyers said in court documents.",
      "In a letter to the Justice Department on Friday, Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson said wrote, \u201cTexas law is clear: Justice Department monitors are not permitted inside polling places where ballots are being cast or a central counting station where ballots are being counted.\u201d",
      "\u201cTexas has a robust processes and procedures in place to ensure that eligible voters may participate in a free and fair election,\" Nelson wrote.",
      "In a similar letter Friday, Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd told the Justice Department that Florida law lists who is allowed inside the state's polling places and Justice Department officials are not included. Byrd said Florida is sending its own monitors to the four jurisdictions the Justice Department plans to send staff to and they will \u201censure there is no interference with the voting process.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "An appeals court says Arizona must release a list of tens of thousands of voters who were mistakenly classified as having access to full ballots because of a coding glitch",
      "PHOENIX -- The Arizona Court of Appeals on Monday affirmed a decision by a lower court that required the Secretary of State\u2019s office to release a list of tens of thousands of voters who were mistakenly classified as having access to Arizona\u2019s full ballot because of a coding glitch.",
      "The court rejected an appeal by Secretary of State Adrian Fontes\u2019 office that sought to reverse the lower court\u2019s order or at least suspend it. A group had sued in an effort to verify whether those on the list are in fact eligible to cast full ballots.",
      "Fontes\u2019 office had initially denied a public records request for the list of voters that was filed by America First Legal, a group run by Stephen Miller, a onetime adviser to former President Donald Trump. Fontes\u2019 office cited concerns over the accuracy of the list and the safety of the voters included.",
      "Fontes expressed his disappointment with the latest ruling during a news conference and vowed that officials will be watching for any instances of voter intimidation. While it was his intention to ensure that voter information would remain protected, he said his office has complied with the court order and has turned over the list to the plaintiffs.",
      "The lower court\u2019s ruling permitted the plaintiff to distribute the list to county recorders, the state Senate president, the House Speaker, and members of both chambers\u2019 elections committees, which the plaintiff said it intended to share. Senate President Warren Petersen posted on the social platform X that he received the list.",
      "Pointing to a previous ruling by the Arizona Supreme Court, Fontes said \u201cevery single one of these voters is eligible to vote and eligible to vote in every single election.\u201d",
      "Arizona is unique among states in that it requires voters to prove their citizenship to participate in local and state races. Those who haven\u2019t but have sworn to it under the penalty of perjury are allowed to participate only in federal elections.",
      "The misclassification of voters from federal-only to full-ballot voters was blamed on a glitch in state databases involving drivers\u2019 licenses and the Arizona Motor Vehicle Division.",
      "Several tight races in the battleground state are expected to be decided by razor-thin margins. While the batch of about 218,000 potentially affected voters won\u2019t impact the outcome of federal contests, they could influence tight state and local races.",
      "Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Scott Blaney ruled last week that the court received no credible evidence showing the information would be misused or encourage violence or harassment against the voters whose citizenship hasn\u2019t been verified.",
      "Still, Fontes reiterated his concerns Monday and used the news conference to take a swipe at the Republican-controlled Legislature. He said he has spent hours with his lawyers trying to unravel \u201csome of these crazy rules that have been shoved down our throats.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that anybody is confused about this,\u201d Fontes said, when asked about the conflicting guidance that voters are getting in some counties."

      "National Guard officials say more than two dozen states have indicated they would be willing to send Guard troops to Washington if requested in the weeks following the presidential election and in the runup to the inauguration",
      "WASHINGTON -- More than two dozen states have indicated they would be willing to send National Guard troops to Washington if requested in the weeks following the presidential election and in the runup to the inauguration, Guard officials said Monday.",
      "The District of Columbia has not yet made any formal requests for Guard troops, but officials across the government have been preparing for the possibility that the U.S. Capitol could once again be rocked by violence around the certification of the election by Congress on Jan. 6 and the inauguration two weeks later.",
      "About 25,000 Guard troops from around the country flooded into Washington in the days after the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, riot, when thousands of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol in an effort to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden's win.",
      "The troops, along with local and federal law enforcement, locked down the city for the inauguration, securing the Capitol, monuments, Metro entrances and the perimeter of the central part of the city.",
      "Speaking to reporters Monday, Col. Jean Paul Laurenceau, chief of future operations for the National Guard Bureau, said it is not yet clear how many Guard troops will be needed or requested this year. He said it will depend on what the District of Columbia wants, but he noted that the National Guard Bureau and the states are leaning forward in anticipation of a request for assistance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to support D.C. with sustainment, lodging, transportation \u2014 anything they need to prepare for this mission,\u201d he said.",
      "Other officials have said it also will depend on intelligence reports assessing the potential threats to the city and the transition of power.",
      "Fueling concerns about possible violence are Trump's claims \u2014 without proof \u2014 that cheating is already underway in the election. At rally after rally, he has told supporters that the only way he can lose is if Democrats cheat, and he has repeatedly refused to say whether he will accept the results regardless of the outcome.",
      "Guard members have historically provided support for presidential inaugurations, going back to the one for President George Washington.",
      "But the 2021 event involved an enormous response due to the riot on Jan. 6, which forced lawmakers to flee the Capitol, delaying the certification of the presidential vote for hours. In the days afterward, Guard forces poured into the city by the busload.",
      "In 2021, a few states declined to send troops, also worried about violence within their own borders and capitals.",
      "Defense officials said Monday that 10 states have activated state Guard members to assist for the election \u2014 primarily doing cybersecurity missions. The total number of troops is about 125.",
      "In addition, nine states and the District of Columbia have put a total of about 120 Guard troops on standby, ready to deploy if needed on Tuesday or in the following days \u2014 also mostly for cyber missions and some security.",
      "Those states are Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. Officials said those numbers could change on Election Day as states reassess their needs."

      "All seven U.S. House seats are up for grabs in South Carolina",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina Republican U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace is trying to cement her hold on her seat in a state that doesn't mind sending people back to Congress for decades.",
      "There have been questions over whether Mace\u2019s attention-seeking personality and brashness and willingness to buck her party's establishment could be a liability. But so far she has been embraced by her coastal 1st District.",
      "Mace flipped the seat back to Republicans in 2020 after a stunning upset of incumbent Democratic Rep. Joe Cunningham. She fought off a GOP challenger endorsed by former President Donald Trump in 2022 and breezed to a surprisingly easy win \u2014 this time with Trump's backing \u2014 in the 2024 Republican primary without a runoff.",
      "Her fellow Republicans in the South Carolina General Assembly also did her a favor by redrawing the district and sending traditional Democratic precincts in and around downtown Charleston to the state's only majority-minority district. Under the old map in 2020, Mace won less than 51% of the vote. With the new maps in 2022 she received more than 56%.",
      "Mace's Democratic challenger as voting ends Tuesday is businessman and former International African American Museum CEO Michael Moore. His campaign has struggled to gain momentum and Mace has barely acknowledged he is in the race.",
      "Moore said Mace is more concerned with national attention and pet causes like legalizing marijuana than helping out people in her district. She joined seven hard-right Republicans to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.",
      "Mace said it's her way of fighting for the voters in her eclectic district which includes centuries-old neighborhoods near Charleston and massive developments of retirees around Beaufort who have moved to South Carolina.",
      "A win Tuesday and Mace is on her way to becoming a fixture in South Carolina's U.S. House delegation \u2014 like Democrat Jim Clyburn, who is running for a 17th term, or Republican Joe Wilson, who is seeking a 12th term.",
      "Wilson is taking on Democrat David Robinson II in the 2nd District, which includes suburban areas around Columbia and to the west and south toward Aiken.",
      "Robinson is a U.S. Army veteran who enlisted after the 9/11 attacks and is an advocate for missing people after his son disappeared in the desert in Arizona.",
      "Wilson is on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and is the most senior member of the House Armed Services Committee. He also is remembered as the congressman who shouted \u201cYou lie!\u201d at Barack Obama during the president's joint address to Congress about health care in 2009.",
      "Clyburn has represented the state's 6th District since it was drawn in 1992 to have a majority of minority voters. This year, his Republican challenger is attorney Duke Buckner in the sprawling district that is bounded by areas around Charleston, Beaufort and Columbia.",
      "Clyburn is a key member of the U.S. House's Democratic leadership and his endorsement of President Joe Biden just before the 2020 South Carolina presidential primary sparked his longtime friend's path to victory.",
      "Perhaps no challenger has worked harder than Democrat Kathryn Harvey in the 4th District that includes Greenville and Spartanburg and has sent a Republican to Washington in every election since 1992.",
      "Harvey has raised a surprising amount of money and traveled all over the district while U.S. Rep. William Timmons has spent most of his time outside the state campaigning for Republicans in races he thinks are more competitive as he tries to make sure the U.S. House stays in GOP control.",
      "For the second election in a row, Timmons had to win a tough Republican primary where his opponent tried to paint him as liberal.",
      "Harvey helps nonprofit organizations with marketing, fundraising and leadership.",
      "South Carolina will have at least one new face in the U.S. House. Republican Rep. Jeff Duncan decided not to run for an eighth term in the 3rd District, which is the most Republican in the solidly conservative state.",
      "Sheri Biggs is a nurse practitioner and Air National Guard officer and if she wins Tuesday, she will be only the second Republican woman to head to Congress from South Carolina, following Mace.",
      "Her opponents are Sherwin-Williams paint store manager and Democrat Byron Best from Greenwood, and Michael Bedenbaugh of the Alliance Party.",
      "The district in the northwest corner of the state contains several small population centers.",

Jacky Rosen \u2014 a former computer programmer and synagogue president \u2014 against Republican Sam Brown, a retired Army captain whose face is still scarred from injuries he suffered in Afghanistan. Both parties agree the state is in the midst of a tight race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump at the top of the ticket, but that the senate race has drawn little notice, though Rosen has emerged as the favorite.",

Brown, who was awarded the Purple Heart, has campaigned on his biography and the state's cost-of-living crisis, particularly acute in working-class Nevada. He's had trouble gaining traction, though a last-minute infusion of GOP money in late October came as Republicans, cheered by strong turnout for their party in early voting, hoped Brown could upend expectations in the race.",

      "Damore added that since Nevada became a state in 1864, only five of its incumbent senators have lost bids for reelection. Most have behaved like Rosen, positioning themselves as nonpartisan leaders who deliver for the state.",
      "\u201cThere's a history of longstanding, moderate senators who have dominated Nevada politics,\u201d Damore said.",
      "Rosen won in 2018 when the prior senator who'd occupied that role, Republican Sen. Dean Heller, veered sharply to the right in response to attacks from Trump for not supporting the then-president adequately. The state's other senator, Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, narrowly won reelection in 2022 with a similarly centrist, low-profile campaign against a Trump-backed candidate.",
      "Trump endorsed Brown in the state's primary, but his political career predates Trump. Brown tried to run for a statehouse seat in Texas in 2014 before moving to Nevada in 2018 and unsuccessfully competing in the 2022 Republican primary to challenge Cortez Masto.",
      "Brown in 2008 was grievously wounded by an improvised explosive device during a Taliban ambush of his unit in southern Afghanistan. He left the army in 2011 after 30 surgeries and years of recovery, founding a business to help veterans get medical care. Brown's face remains seriously scarred and has become central to his campaign ads.",
      "\u201cAs a U.S. Senator I will proudly stand alongside Donald Trump to make American affordable, safe and strong again,\u201d Brown said at the Republican National Convention this summer.",
      "Rosen has hammered Brown over his stance on abortion, saying he'd vote for a national ban if sent to Washington, D.C.",
      "Abortion until 24 weeks of pregnancy is protected in Nevada by a 1990 state law. A measure to enshrine the right to an abortion until viability \u2014 which is after 21 weeks \u2014 in the state constitution is on ballots this year. If it passes, it must pass again in 2026.",
      "Brown describes himself as \u201cpro-life\u201d and contends he never filled out a 2022 questionnaire that states he opposes exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother. Brown and his wife Amy sat down for a joint interview with NBC news earlier this year describing an abortion she had before the two met.",
      "Meanwhile, Rosen kicked off her reelection earlier this year with an ad in which she states: \u201cSix years ago I promised to do what's right for Nevada, not my party leaders.\u201d",
      "Republicans need to net two senate seats to win a majority in the chamber, so every seat counts in this election. But the GOP is already well-positioned in West Virginia, where they have an open seat in a state Trump won overwhelmingly. The Republican party is confident in its odds ousting Democrats in two other red states, Montana and Ohio. So the party has not invested heavily in Nevada.",
      "The senate race isn't the only underwhelming one in Nevada. The state has three Democratic-held House seats that could be competitive, but Republicans are significant underdogs in all of them.",
      "\u201cThey did a horrible job of recruiting,\u201d Damore said of the state Republican party, which has been taken over by hardline pro-Trump activists.",
      "Democratic Rep. Dina Titus, who has represented Nevada's 1st Congressional District for more than a decade, again faces a challenge from retired Army Col. Mark Robertson. Titus defeated Robertson in 2022 by nearly 6 percentage points. Her district is reliably blue, covering Las Vegas and portions of the city's suburbs of Henderson and Boulder City.",
      "In the 3rd Congressional District, widely considered the state's most competitive, Democratic U.S. Rep. Susie Lee is trying to defend her seat from Drew Johnson, a conservative policy analyst. The district includes a large swath of the culturally diverse Spring Valley neighborhood in Las Vegas, but also more rural areas in Clark County, which is the state's most populous.",
      "Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, is looking to keep his seat in Nevada's sweeping 4th Congressional District that covers downtown Las Vegas and deep-red rural counties including Nye, Mineral and Esmeralda. He faces a challenge from former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, now a Republican after switching parties and running an unsuccessful primary campaign in 2022 for governor."

As of mid-October, he reported raising less than $7,000 in campaign contributions.",

      "As a state senator, McBride has earned a reputation for working on health care issues, including successfully sponsoring legislation to create a statewide paid family and medical leave insurance program. She also sponsored legislation regarding Medicaid reimbursement rates for home health care services and expanded access to dental care for low-income Delawareans. Another bill she sponsored imposed a 3.58% tax on net revenue of Delaware hospitals to leverage additional federal Medicaid funds. All of those bills became law.",

      "Organized labor has made itself heard over the past couple of years, and the number of actions taken by unions has soared. There were 470 work stoppages (466 strikes and four lockouts) involving approximately 539,000 workers last year, according to Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. The nearly 500 work stoppages resulted in approximately 24,874,522 strike days.",
      "While the number of work stoppages increased by only 9% between 2022 and 2023, the number of workers involved in those work stoppages skyrocketed 141% to well over a half million workers, according to Cornell.",
      "Unions including the UAW, the Teamsters and, most recently, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, say they made the sacrifices asked of them by their companies during the pandemic and previous periods of distress for different economic sectors. Workers have stood firm on demands of late, however, saying that now is the time for companies, which have been consistently posting billions of dollars in profits every year, to catch up and pay workers what they are owed.",
      "Here's a look at some recent standoffs between corporate America and workers.",
      "Late last year the United Auto Workers union overwhelmingly ratified new contracts with Ford and Stellantis, along with a similar deal with General Motors, that would raise pay across the industry and force automakers to absorb higher costs.",
      "The agreements, which run through April 2028, ended contentious talks that began in the summer of 2022 and led to six-week-long strikes at all three automakers.",
      "The new contract agreements were widely seen as a victory for the UAW. The companies agreed to dramatically raise pay for top-scale assembly plant workers, with increases and cost-of-living adjustments that would translate into 33% wage gains.",
      "Top assembly plant workers were to receive immediate 11% raises and would earn roughly $42 an hour when the contracts expire in April of 2028.",
      "Under the agreements, the automakers also ended many of the multiple tiers of wages they had used to pay different workers. They also agreed in principle to bring new electric-vehicle battery plants into the national union contract.",
      "UPS workers that are members of the Teamsters union approved a tentative contract with the package delivery company last year. The run-up to the approval was acrimonious, with labor negotiations that threatened to disrupt package deliveries for millions of businesses and households nationwide.",
      "After negotiations broke down in early July 2023, Atlanta-based UPS reached a contract agreement with the Teamsters just days before an Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "At the time the agreement was struck, full- and part-time union workers were set to get $2.75 more per hour in 2023, and $7.50 more in total by the end of the five-year contract. Starting hourly pay for part-time employees also got bumped up to $21, but some workers said that fell short of their expectations.",
      "UPS said at the time that by the end of the new contract, the average UPS full-time driver would make about $170,000 annually in pay and benefits. It was not clear how much of that figure benefits accounted for.",
      "As part of the deal, the delivery company also agreed to make Martin Luther King Jr. Day a full holiday, end forced overtime on drivers\u2019 days off and stop using driver-facing cameras in cabs, among a host of other issues. It eliminated a two-tier wage system for drivers and agreements on safety issues were also reached, including equipping more trucks with air conditioning.",
      "In September video game performers reached agreements with 80 individual games that have signed interim or tiered budget agreements with the performers\u2019 union and accepted the artificial intelligence provisions they have been seeking.",
      "The performers had been striking for over a month.",
      "Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists began striking in July after negotiations with game industry giants that began more than a year and a half ago came to a halt over AI protections.",
      "The interim agreement secures wage improvements, protections around \u201cexploitative uses\u201d of artificial intelligence and safety precautions that account for the strain of physical performances, as well as vocal stress. The tiered budget agreement aims to make working with union talent more feasible for independent game developers or smaller-budget projects while also providing performers the protections under the interim agreement.",
      "Thousands of hospitality union workers on the Las Vegas Strip reached a tentative deal with the Venetian and Palazzo resorts in August, a first for employees at the sprawling Italian-inspired complex that opened 25 years ago.",
      "The Culinary Workers Union announced on the social platform X that the deal came together after a year of negotiations. It covers over 4,000 hotel and casino workers, from housekeepers and cocktail servers to bartenders and porters.",
      "Bethany Khan, a union spokesperson, said the deal mirrors the major wins secured in recent contracts awarded to 40,000 hospitality workers at 18 Strip properties owned or operated by casino giants MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts.",
      "Those wins included a 32% pay increase over five years, housekeeping workload reductions and improved job security amid advancements in technology and artificial intelligence.",
      "The bump in pay under those contracts will amount to an average $35 hourly wage by the end of the contracts, according to the union. Workers at these properties were making about $26 hourly with benefits before winning their latest contracts in November.",
      "Unions representing 85,000 health care workers reached a tentative agreement with industry giant Kaiser Permanente in October 2023 following a strike over wages and staffing levels.",
      "The deal included setting minimum hourly wages at $25 in California, where most of Kaiser\u2019s facilities are located, and $23 in other states. Workers would also see a 21% wage increase over four years.",
      "The lead up to the tentative agreement included a three-day strike involving 75,000 workers in multiple states.",
      "The tentative agreement also included protective terms around subcontracting and outsourcing, as well as initiatives to invest in the current workforce and address a staffing crisis.",
      "Hollywood\u2019s actors voted to ratify a deal with studios in December 2023 that ended their strike after nearly four months, bringing an official finish to a labor strife that shook the entertainment industry for most of last year.",
      "Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists approved a three-year contract.",
      "Control over the use of artificial intelligence was the most hard-fought issue in the long, methodical negotiations. The contract called for a 7% general pay increase with further hikes coming in the second and third years of the deal.",
      "The agreement also included a hard-won provision that temporarily derailed talks: the creation of a fund to pay performers for future viewings of their work on streaming services, in addition to traditional residuals paid for the showing of movies or series.",
      "Some 45,000 dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports returned to work in October after their union reached a deal to suspend a strike that could have eventually caused shortages and higher prices if it had dragged on.",
      "A walkout would have shut down as many as 36 ports that handle almost half of the nation\u2019s cargo from ships entering and exiting the nation. Any such strike would eventually have led to shortages that would have hurt the U.S. economy if the walkout by the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association went on for more than a month.",
      "The dispute is not over, however. Longshoremen suspended its strike after three days, but that lasts only until Jan. 15, providing more time to negotiate a new contract. The union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and shipping companies, said in a joint statement that they have reached a tentative agreement on wages.",
      "Talks now turn to the automation of ports, which the unions says will lead to fewer jobs, and other sticking points."

      "Massachusetts voters are weighing five ballot measures, including giving union rights to drivers for ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft",
      "BOSTON -- Massachusetts voters decide five ballot issues Tuesday, including giving union rights to drivers for ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft.",
      "Other questions would allow the use of certain plant-based psychedelics, eliminate the use of statewide tests as a high school graduation requirement and gradually increase the minimum hourly wage for workers who collect tips.",
      "Drivers for ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft are considered independent contractors who don't have the right to unionize under federal law.",
      "The proposal would allow them to unionize in the state. Drivers wouldn't be required to participate. Individual companies could team up to form associations to represent their interests in negotiations.",
      "As part of the measure, the state would have the right to approve negotiated contracts. The proposal would also create a hearing process when a company or union is charged with an unfair work practice.",
      "Unions pushed for the change despite a settlement announced in June by the state attorney general\u2019s office guaranteeing Uber and Lyft drivers earn a minimum pay standard of $32.50 per hour.",
      "Opponents said the measure will raise prices for riders without directly benefitting drivers. Critics also argued that the question would create what they call \u201ca new radical labor category\u201d that is inconsistent with federal labor laws and say the drivers already enjoy benefits including the higher hourly rate and paid sick and family medical leave.",
      "The proposal would gradually increase how much employers must pay workers who collect tips, like servers in restaurants.",
      "The state\u2019s wage for tipped workers is now $6.75 an hour, while the minimum hourly wage for most other workers is $15. Now, if a worker doesn\u2019t earn enough in tips to bring them up to $15 an hour, the employer must make up the difference.",
      "Under the proposal, employers would have to pay tipped workers $9.60 on Jan. 1. By Jan. 1, 2029, employers would have to pay them the state\u2019s full minimum wage.",
      "Supporters argued tips should be a reward for good service, not a subsidy for low wages. Critics said the proposal would reduce overall wages for servers, increase costs for restaurants, raise the price of eating out and could force some neighborhood eateries to close.",
      "The ballot issue would allow residents 21 and older to grow and use plant-based psychedelics in certain circumstances, making it the third state to legalize some mind-altering drugs that are considered illegal by the federal government.",
      "The psychedelics would include two found in so-called \u201cmagic mushrooms\u201d \u2014 psilocybin and psilocyn \u2014 and three from plants \u2014 mescaline, dimethyltryptamine and ibogaine.",
      "The measure would allow the substances to be purchased at approved locations for use under the supervision of a licensed facilitator. Although it would prohibit retail sale, it would let individuals grow psychedelics at home and share them.",
      "The proposal would allow for the regulation and taxation of psychedelics and create a five-member commission to oversee the industry.",
      "Critics warned it could lead to a black market. They also argued the centers would not be prevented from giving psychedelics to people considered high risk, like those with schizophrenia, bipolar illness or who are pregnant or breastfeeding.",
      "Massachusetts students must pass comprehensive tests to receive a high school diploma. The ballot issue wouldn\u2019t get rid of the tests, but passing them would no longer be required for graduation.",
      "The Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests are given in mathematics, science and technology and English.",
      "Instead of passing the tests, students would be required to finish coursework certified by the local school district and achieve state academic standards in the subjects.",
      "Teachers unions have been among the strongest critics of using the tests as a graduation requirement, saying that \u201cteaching to the test\u201d limits their ability to give students a fuller education.",
      "Supporters of the tests argued that without the testing requirement, school districts will adopt lower standards so students can graduate. They said it\u2019s unfair to grant diplomas to students who aren\u2019t ready.",
      "The proposal would give the state auditor the authority to audit the Massachusetts Legislature \u2014 a ballot question spearheaded by state Auditor Diana DiZoglio, who served in both the state House and Senate.",
      "DiZoglio argued the Legislature is the only state entity refusing to be audited, ranks as one of the least transparent in the country and is one of a few that exempts itself from public records laws.",
      "Critics said the question would violate the separation of powers outlined in the Massachusetts Constitution.",
      "They also argued that the giving DiZoglio and her successors the power to audit the Legislature would turn them into \u201cpolitical actors\u201d with undue influence on the legislative process. Legislative leaders have called the proposed audit unnecessary."

      "Voters faced a stark choice between two candidates with drastically different temperaments and visions for the world\u2019s largest economy and dominant military power. More than 82 million people voted early.  Those casting Election Day ballots mostly encountered a smooth process, with isolated reports of hiccups that regularly happen, including long lines, technical issues and ballot printing errors.",
      "Trump voted in Palm Beach, Florida, near his Mar-a-Lago club, and said afterward that he was feeling \u201cvery confident.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt looks like Republicans have shown up in force,\u201d he told reporters, wearing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap. He said he had not prepared a speech on the results \u2014 win or lose \u2014 saying, \u201cI\u2019m not a Democrat. I\u2019m able to make a speech on very short notice.\u201d",
      "Harris, the Democratic vice president, did phone interviews with radio stations in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada. She stands to be the first female president if elected and has promised to work across the aisle to tackle economic worries and other issues without radically departing from the course set by President Joe Biden.",
      "Trump, the Republican former president, has vowed to replace thousands of federal workers with loyalists, impose sweeping tariffs on allies and foes alike, and stage the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "In Scranton, Pennsylvania, Liza Fortt arrived at her polling location in a wheelchair and not feeling well. But she said she ventured out anyway to vote for Harris.",
      "\u201cIt means a lot to me and my grandkids, my granddaughters, my nieces. ... I was just waiting for this day to come,\u201d said Fortt, who is 74 and Black. She said she never thought she\u2019d have such an opportunity, to cast a ballot for a Black woman in a presidential race.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud, to see a woman, not only a woman, but a Black woman,\u201d Fortt said.",
      "Harris and Trump entered Election Day focused on seven swing states, five of them carried by Trump in 2016 before flipping to Biden in 2020: the \u201cblue wall\u201d of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin as well as Arizona and Georgia. Nevada and North Carolina, which Democrats and Republicans respectively carried in the last two elections, also were closely contested.",
      "First-time voter Jasmine Perez, 26, cast her ballot at the Las Vegas Raiders\u2019 stadium in Nevada for Trump, citing his spiritual values.",
      "\u201cWhat really attracted me to Donald Trump is I\u2019m a Christian,\" Perez said, noting of the former president, \u201cI like that he openly promotes Christianity in America.\u201d",
      "The closeness of the race and the number of states in play raised the likelihood that, once again, a victor might not be known on election night.",
      "In 2020, it took four days to declare a winner. Regardless, Trump has baselessly claimed that if he lost, it would be due to fraud. Harris' campaign was preparing for him to try to declare victory before a winner is known on Tuesday night or to try to contest the result if she wins. Four years ago, Trump launched an effort to overturn the voters\u2019 will that ended in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Trump said Tuesday that he had no plans to tell his supporters not to refrain from violence if Harris wins, because they \u201care not violent people.\u201d Asked about accepting the race\u2019s results either way, Trump said, \u201cIf it\u2019s a fair election, I\u2019d be the first one to acknowledge it.\u201d He visited a nearby campaign office to fire up staffers before a party at a nearby convention center.",
      "Harris voted by mail in her home state of California. She'll have a watch party at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington.",
      "Harris, 60, would be the first woman, Black woman and person of South Asian descent to serve as president. She also would be the first sitting vice president to win the White House in 36 years.",
      "\u201cI think this is an inflection point in terms of this is the moment where we have two very different visions of the future of our nation,\" Harris said in a Tuesday interview with The Big Tigger Morning Show on V-103 in Atlanta. \u201cAnd mine is focused on progress.\u201d",
      "A victory would cap a whirlwind campaign unlike any other in American history. Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket less than four months ago after Biden, facing massive pressure from his party after a disastrous debate performance, ended his reelection bid.",
      "Trump, 78, would be the oldest president ever elected. He would also be the first defeated president in 132 years to win another term in the White House, and the first person convicted of a felony to take over the Oval Office.",
      "He survived one assassination attempt by millimeters at a July rally. Secret Service agents foiled a second attempt in September.",
      "Trump' s winning would affirm that enough voters put aside warnings from many of Trump's former aides or instead prioritized concerns about Biden and Harris' stewardship of the economy or the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "It would all but ensure he avoids going to prison after being found guilty of his role in hiding hush-money payments to an adult film actress during his first run for president in 2016. His sentencing in that case could occur later this month. And upon taking office, Trump could end the federal investigation into his effort to overturn the 2020 election results.",
      "The potential turbulence of a second Trump term has been magnified by his embrace of the Republican Party\u2019s far right and his disregard for long-held democratic norms. Trump has used harsh rhetoric against Harris and other Democrats, calling them \u201cdemonic,\u201d and has suggested military action against people he calls \u201cenemies from within.\u201d",
      "Harris, pointing to the warnings of Trump's former aides, has labeled him a \u201cfascist\u201d and blamed Trump for putting women's lives in danger by nominating three of the justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. In the closing hours of the campaign, she tried to strike a more positive tone and went all of Monday without saying her Republican opponent's name.",
      "Federal, state and local officials have expressed confidence in the integrity of the nation\u2019s election systems. They nonetheless were braced to contend with what they say is an unprecedented level of foreign disinformation \u2014 particularly from Russia and Iran \u2014 as well as the possibility of physical violence or cyberattacks.",
      "Both sides have armies of lawyers in anticipation of legal challenges on and after Election Day. And law enforcement agencies nationwide are on high alert for potential violence.",
      "JD Jorgensen, an independent voter in Black Mountain, North Carolina, which was hit hard by Hurricane Helene, said voters should have made up their minds by now.",
      "\u201cI think that the candidates, both being in the public eye as long as they both have been, if you\u2019re on the fence, you hadn\u2019t really been paying attention,\u201d said Jorgensen, 35.",

      "A 17-year-old suspect in a shooting that killed two people and wounded seven others during a Halloween celebration which drew 75,000 revelers to the streets of downtown Orlando, Florida last week has been charged as an adult",
      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- A 17-year-old suspect in a shooting that killed two people and wounded seven others during a Halloween celebration that drew 75,000 revelers to the streets of downtown Orlando, Florida, last week has been charged as an adult, a prosecutor said Monday.",
      "Jaylen Edgar was charged as an adult with two second-degree murder charges and a count of attempted murder, though the case will be presented before a grand jury, which could decide to up the charges to first-degree murder, said State Attorney Andrew Bain.",
      "\u201cThis decision was not made lightly, and only after reviewing all the available evidence,\u201d Bain said at a news conference in Orlando.",
      "Edgar is accused of opening fire during a Halloween street celebration that drew tens of thousands of costumed revelers to downtown Orlando's bar and restaurant district early Friday. Besides the two men who were killed, an additional seven people were wounded and a woman was trampled as people fled in terror, according to the Orlando Police Department.",
      "One of the Halloween celebrants killed and another who was injured were students at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.",
      "Edgar was tackled at the scene by some of the 100 police officers who were patrolling downtown Orlando.",
      "Among the factors that went into the decision to charge Edgar as an adult were \u201cthe brazen nature of the crime\u201d and the fact that multiple people were shot, the prosecutor said.",
      "\u201cTo shoot into a massive crowd like that shows a total disregard for life and the only recourse is to charge the defendant as an adult because it fits the egregious nature of the crime,\u201d Bain said. \u201cThis was a blatant execution in the middle of our streets, and so that's something that we can't have in our community.\u201d",
      "There was no online court docket for Edgar so it couldn't be determined if he had an attorney. Moreover, the case originated in juvenile court, where records are not public. An email to the Orange County Public Defender's office seeking information was not immediately returned Monday.",
      "Bain wouldn't disclose whether authorities knew of a motive and said detectives were still determining how he obtained the handgun.",
      "The Halloween celebration, which is one of the biggest events in downtown Orlando each year, took place about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from Orlando\u2019s tourist district, and it primarily attracts central Florida residents.",
      "In response to the shootings, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer last Friday issued a local state of emergency for the downtown entertainment area. Under the weeklong order, alcohol sales will end at midnight, and a curfew will be enforced from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m.",
      "During past Halloween celebrations, police would close off downtown streets and use dogs to screen for weapons as people walked past entry points, but they stopped doing that after Florida lawmakers passed a permit-less concealed carry law in 2023."

    "summary": "The Supreme Court is taking up a new redistricting case involving Louisiana&rsquo;s congressional map with two mostly Black districts",
    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court is taking up a new redistricting case involving Louisiana\u2019s congressional map with two mostly Black districts",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court said Monday it will take up a new redistricting case involving Louisiana's congressional map with two mostly Black districts.",
      "The court won't hear arguments until early next year and the 2024 elections are proceeding under the challenged map, which could boost Democrats' chances of retaking the closely divided House of Representatives.",
      "A lower court had invalidated the map, but the justices allowed it to be used in 2024 after an emergency appeal from the state and civil rights groups.",
      "The issue in front of the justices is whether the state relied too heavily on race in drawing a second majority Black district.",
      "The court's order Monday is the latest step in federal court battles over Louisiana congressional districts that have lasted more than two years. Louisiana has had two congressional maps blocked by lower courts and the Supreme Court has intervened twice.",
      "The state\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature drew a new congressional map in 2022 to account for population shifts reflected in the 2020 Census. But the changes effectively maintained the status quo of five Republican-leaning majority white districts and one Democratic-leaning majority Black district in a state that is about one-third Black.",
      "Noting the size of the state\u2019s Black population, civil rights advocates challenged the map in a Baton Rouge-based federal court and won a ruling from U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick that the districts likely discriminated against Black voters.",
      "The Supreme Court put Dick\u2019s ruling on hold while it took up a similar case from Alabama. The justices allowed both states to use the maps in the 2022 elections even though both had been ruled likely discriminatory by federal judges.",
      "The high court eventually affirmed the ruling from Alabama, which led to a new map and a second district that could elect a Black lawmaker. The justices returned the Louisiana case to federal court, with the expectation that new maps would be in place for the 2024 elections.",
      "The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals gave lawmakers in Louisiana a deadline of early 2024 to draw a new map or face the possibility of a court-imposed map.",
      "Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, had defended Louisiana\u2019s congressional map as the state\u2019s attorney general. Now, though, he urged lawmakers to pass a new map with another majority Black district at a special session in January. He backed a map that created a new majority Black district stretching across the state, linking parts of the Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge areas.",
      "A different set of plaintiffs, a group of self-described non-African Americans, filed suit in western Louisiana, claiming that the new map was also illegal because it was driven too much by race, in violation of the Constitution. A divided panel of federal judges ruled 2-1 in April in their favor and blocked use of the new map.",
      "The Supreme Court voted 6-3 to put that ruling on hold and allow the map to be used.",
      "State Attorney General Liz Murrill, whose office has defended both maps enacted by lawmakers, called on the court to \u201cprovide more clear guidance to legislators and reduce judicial second-guessing after the Legislature does its job. Based upon the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent pronouncements, we believe the map is constitutional.\u201d",
      "The state and civil rights groups were at odds over the first map, but are allies now.",
      "\u201cFederal law requires Louisiana to have a fair map that reflects the power and voice of the state\u2019s Black communities,\" Stuart Naifeh of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund said in a statement. \"The state recognized as much when it adopted a new map with a second majority-Black district in January. Now the Supreme Court must do the same.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court vote to use the challenged map in this year's elections was unusual in that the dissenting votes came from the three liberal justices, who have been supportive of Black voters in redistricting cases. But, in an opinion by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, they said their votes were motivated by their view that there was time for a new map to be drawn, and their disagreement with past court orders that cited the approach of an election to block lower-court rulings.",
      "\u201cThere is little risk of voter confusion from a new map being imposed this far out from the November election,\u201d Jackson wrote in May.",
      "In adopting the districts that are being used this year, Landry and his allies said the driving factor was politics, not race. The congressional map provides politically safe districts for House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, fellow Republicans. Some lawmakers have also noted that the one Republican whose district was greatly altered in the new map, Rep. Garret Graves, supported a GOP opponent of Landry in last fall\u2019s governor\u2019s race. Graves chose not to seek reelection under the new map.",
      "Among the candidates in the new district is Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, a former congressman who is Black.",

      "The New Hampshire governor's race comes down to one candidate who is trying to jump from local to statewide office and another who wants to bring federal experience to the Statehouse",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- In one of the nation\u2019s most competitive gubernatorial races, New Hampshire voters are choosing between one candidate trying to jump from local to statewide office and another seeking to bring federal experience to the Statehouse.",
      "Democratic former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig faces Republican former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte in Tuesday\u2019s election to replace Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who declined to seek a fifth two-year term. Either would become the third woman elected governor of New Hampshire, following Democrats Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, both of whom are now in the Senate.",
      "It was a narrow loss to Hassan in 2016 that ended Ayotte\u2019s tenure in Washington after one term. Before that, Ayotte spent five years as the state\u2019s attorney general, and she often highlighted her past as a prosecutor during her campaign.",
      "Endorsed by Sununu ahead of September\u2019s GOP primary, Ayotte promised to continue his anti-tax, pro-business economic policies. She used a \u201cDon\u2019t Mass it up\u201d slogan to rail against more liberal Massachusetts to the south while accusing Craig of supporting tax hikes and blaming her for crime, homelessness and drug overdose deaths in the state\u2019s most populous city.",
      "\u201cIf you're a retiree or you're saving for retirement, she's already said in this campaign she's going to increase your taxes,\u201d Ayotte said during a recent debate, referring to Craig's support for reinstating a tax on interest and dividends. \"If she's willing in a contested campaign to talk about increasing your taxes, imagine what she's going to do when she's governor.\u201d",
      "Craig, who served on the Manchester school board and board of aldermen before being elected as the city\u2019s first female mayor in 2017, emphasized her executive experience. She said it prepared her to tackle the state\u2019s housing crisis, strengthen public schools and expand access to reproductive health care.",
      "She was particularly critical of Ayotte on the latter issue, pointing to Ayotte\u2019s Senate votes to defund Planned Parenthood and eliminate mandated insurance coverage for birth control. Though Ayotte has said she would veto any bill further restricting abortion, she supported a 20-week ban as a senator. Craig portrayed her as \u201cthe most extreme threat to reproductive freedoms our state has ever seen\u201d and out of touch with state and local communities.",
      "\u201cSen. Ayotte has spent her entire career attacking reproductive freedom,\u201d Craig said during a debate last week. \u201cHer actions speak louder than her words, and we cannot trust her.\u201d",
      "New Hampshire law prohibits abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy except when the mother\u2019s health or life is in danger or there is a fatal fetal anomaly.",
      "While Ayotte enjoyed stronger name recognition and fundraising, Craig benefited from a more unified party energized by Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket. In contrast, Republicans are more fractured, and Ayotte has a rocky history with former President Donald Trump. She rescinded her support for him in 2016 over his lewd comments about women but now backs him again, saying his record was better than the Biden administration's."

Democratic-backed justices currently hold a 4-3 edge, and Republicans have sought to flip it to regain a margin of control in a state dominated by Democrats for the past two years. They need to win both seats up for election to do so.",

O\u2019Grady has campaigned on his experience as a state trooper, prosecutor and longtime circuit judge in southern Michigan. The winner will serve the last four years of the eight-year term vacated in 2022 by former Justice Bridget McCormick.",
      "Republican nominee state Rep. Andrew Fink and Democratic nominee law professor Kimberly Anne Thomas are competing for a full-term seat being vacated by Justice David Viviano, a Republican-backed justice. Thomas and Bolden have campaigned arm and arm since they were officially nominated by the Democratic party in August.",
      "Fink, like O\u2019Grady, has said his election would restore balance to a court accused of \u201clegislating from the bench\u201d in favor of liberal causes and Democratic policy in recent years.",
      "Abortion access was enshrined in the state constitution by voters in 2022. Democratic allies have framed the race through the lens of reproductive rights, saying the court has the potential to rule on abortion in the future. Republicans have rejected this idea, saying the amendment finalized abortion protections that cannot be undone."

      "Kamala Harris spent all of Monday in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral votes offer the largest prize among the states expected to determine the Electoral College outcome. Donald Trump held four rallies in three states, beginning in Raleigh, North Carolina, stopping twice in Pennsylvania with events in Reading and Pittsburgh, then ending in Grand Rapids, Michigan.",

      "The tiny New Hampshire resort town Dixville Notch has a tradition that dates back to 1960 for being the first in the nation to complete in-person voting. After a rousing accordion version of the national anthem, the town\u2019s six voters began casting their ballots at the stroke of midnight and the vote count was complete 15 minutes later.",

      "\u201cFolks, this is getting pretty simple now: Kamala and I trust women,\u201d Walz said. \u201cNow tomorrow, women all across America, of every age, both parties, are going to send a loud, clear message to Donald Trump, whether he likes it or not.\u201d",
      "The comment is a callback to Trump telling an audience in Green Bay, Wisconsin, last week that he would protect women as president \u201cwhether the women like it or not. I am going to protect them.\u201d Trump acknowledged during the comment that his top aides urged him not to call himself a protector because it is \u201cinappropriate.\u201d",
      "Walz\u2019s comment also hints at numerous polls that show a large gender gap in the 2024 race, with women leaning toward Harris and Walz and men leaning toward Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.",

      "\u201cI think it would be amazing seeing a woman president,\u201d Annalise said.",
      "Their neighborhood in Croydon leans toward Trump, and Geist said Harris signs have been destroyed or stolen. That doesn\u2019t make her hopeful the country will come together after the election. She thinks it may take another election cycle to cool things down.",

      "Harris and Trump\u2019s differences have long been clear. But on Monday night in Pittsburgh, their dueling rallies drove home just how large the gulf between them truly is.",
      "Only 9 miles (14 kilometers) separated the two in the key Pennsylvania city. Trump spoke at PPG Paints Arena, home to the Pittsburgh Penguins, in one of his standard arena rally setups. Harris spoke at Carrie Furnaces, a historic steel facility with an event that nodded to Pittsburgh\u2019s place as the heart of the country\u2019s steel industry.",
      "Harris spoke for 10 minutes. Trump spoke for 950% more, clocking in an hour and 45 minutes.",

      "Trump repeatedly invoked Harris \u2014 and her nearby rally.",
      "\u201cIf you vote for Kamala, you will have four more years of misery, failure, and disaster, and our country may never recover,\u201d Trump told his audience, earning boos. Later, he added, \u201cKamala has a little rally going on. And when I say little, I mean little.\u201d",
      "Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, has referred to Kamala Harris as \u201ctrash.\u201d",
      "Speaking Monday in Atlanta, Vance ripped Harris by referencing a comment made by President Joe Biden suggesting that Trump supporters were \u201cgarbage.\u201d Biden, in turn, was responding to a joke by comic Tony Hinchcliffe at Trump\u2019s recent Madison Square Garden rally in which Hinchcliffe likened Puerto Rico to a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "The Trump campaign has faced days of criticism from Harris allies over Hinchcliffe\u2019s joke. It has focused on Biden\u2019s reference to Trump supporters instead.",
      "Vance told the Atlanta audience that Americans should not be called \u201cgarbage\u201d for supporting border restrictions or \u201cwanting to be able to afford groceries.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn two days, we are going to take out the trash in Washington, D.C., and the trash\u2019s name is Kamala Harris,\u201d he said.",
      "The comment stirred anger among Harris allies online. Levar Stoney, the mayor of Richmond, Virginia, said Vance had \u201cmade one of the worst mistakes of his political career.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s about half the number who voted overall in 2020. More people voted early that year because of the pandemic. Still, several states have reported record levels of early voting because former President Donald Trump has urged Republicans to vote that way now.",
      "Early voting data only tells you who has cast ballots, not who they voted for. We\u2019ll have to wait for Tuesday night to find that out. But, meanwhile, you can pore over the early vote data in your state.",
      "The nation\u2019s federal law enforcement and election security agencies are debunking a video falsely claiming election fraud in Arizona, linking it to an ongoing Russian disinformation scheme and warning on the eve of Election Day that the Russia-linked efforts risk inciting violence, including against election officials.",
      "The joint statement by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency also cited an article posted recently and amplified by Russian influence actors that falsely claimed officials in swing states plan to orchestrate election fraud using such methods as ballot stuffing and cyberattacks.",

      "Katy Perry took the stage after Harris spoke in Pittsburgh, singing a mashup of songs starting with her 2013 hit, \u201cDark Horse.\u201d Before singing a piece of 2010\u2019s \u201cPart of Me,\u201d she shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s my body, and my choice,\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re almost there!\u201d",
      "In 2016, the singer was a major campaigner for Hillary Clinton. She both spoke at and performed at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia that year, and her song \u201cRoar\u201d was a staple of the Clinton campaign.",
      "Harris urged her supporters not to be shy about asking people in their lives to get out and vote.",
      "\u201cPittsburgh, listen, we\u2019ve got one day left to get this done,\u201d Harris said in the penultimate speech of her campaign. \u201cSo now we work to get out the vote. Let\u2019s reach out in these next 24 hours to family and friends and classmates and neighbors and coworkers.\u201d",
      "Harris\u2019 remarks were notably short in Pittsburgh. She spoke for under 10 minutes before singer Katy Perry took the stage to perform.",
      "\u201cI am asking for your vote,\u201d Harris said, adding later, \u201cYour vote is your voice and your voice is your power.\u201d",
      "Harris now travels to Philadelphia for the final rally of her campaign.",
      "Harris projected the confidence her campaign is feeling at the penultimate event of her presidential run, telling an audience on Monday night in Pittsburgh that \u201cthe momentum is on our side.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is it,\u201d Harris said with Carrie Furnaces behind her, a historic steel facility that nodded to Pittsburgh\u2019s history as the heart of the country\u2019s steel industry. \u201cTomorrow is Election Day, and the momentum is on our side.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must finish strong,\u201d Harris added. \u201cMake no mistake, we will win.\u201d",
      "This is not Harris\u2019 final stop of the night. She will head to Philadelphia for the final event of her campaign.",
      "It was a full-circle moment for the two after Trump and the broadcaster feuded bitterly and publicly during Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.",
      "Kelly defended Trump against recent controversies, including his repeated pledge to \u201cprotect women,\u201d and pressed his case against Harris as weak on the border.",
      "\u201cHe got mocked by the left by saying he would be a protector of women,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cHe will be a protector of women and it\u2019s why I\u2019m voting for him. He will close the border and he will keep the boys out of women\u2019s sports where they don\u2019t belong.\u201d",
      "Trump stood to the side, grinning and beaming, as Kelly spoke.",
      "Kelly was a Fox News star in 2016 when she infuriated Trump at a GOP debate with a question about his treatment of women. He bitterly attacked her after the debate, and his supporters joined in, leaving her worried about threats.",
      "Trump later boycotted another debate telecast by Fox because Kelly was one of the moderators.",
      "Kelly left Fox for NBC News, an ill fit where she was taken off the air following an uproar when she suggested it was OK for white people to wear blackface on Halloween. She now hosts a SiriusXM satellite radio show.",
      "The standup comic and actor declared, \u201cShe is not a demagogue, and yet she is not demure.\u201d",

      "\u201cI just thought it was a very important moment in history,\u201d said Henley. \u201cRegardless of whether Trump wins or loses \u2013 I do hope he wins \u2013 it will be his last rally.\u201d",
      "Henley added that \u201cit\u2019s an important kind of closure on history, on this chapter, this tumultuous time in America.\u201d",
      "While Henley said that he didn\u2019t necessarily have an issue with absentee voting, he planned to vote on Election Day. He supports Trump due to his \u201cfiscal policies\u201d and Trump\u2019s ability to create \u201cpeace through strength\u201d in the Middle East during his time in office.",
      "Whoever wins the election, Henley said that he is hopeful for a peaceful transfer of power, \u201cassuming there\u2019s a free and fair election and everything was on the up and up.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhenever they decide to close the election out, if Kamala Harris is the president of the United States, then begrudgingly she\u2019s the president,\u201d said Henley. \u201cI say begrudgingly, because I will always respect the office of the president.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just wish we could focus on our commonalities and our common interests and work toward the common good and strive to make America the best country you can be,\u201d Henley added. \u201cYou know, one where kids can ride their bikes till the lamp posts turn off.\u201d",
      "At his recent rallies, Trump has been invoking \u201cBarack Hussein Obama,\u201d emphasizing his predecessor\u2019s middle name.",
      "Obama\u2019s critics frequently used his middle name during his presidency along with other ways to make him appear foreign. Trump was a leading proponent of the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s sad because we\u2019ve been doing this for nine years,\u201d Trump said in Pittsburgh after inviting members of his family to join him on stage.",
      "Trump is holding his second-to-last rally of the 2024 election \u2014 and says he\u2019ll be done once this ends. His rallies became a cultural phenomenon during his 2015 campaign, drawing thousands of people who often camped out overnight or waited for hours in freezing cold or blazing heat.",
      "\u201cI have one left. And remember the rallies are the most exciting thing. There\u2019ll never be rallies like this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is never going to happen again.\u201d",

      "He is leaning into hardline immigration rhetoric and vowing to \u201cliberate\u201d the country from what he describes as an \u201coccupation.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s rhetoric that has animated his core supporters since he declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination \u2014 and that still earns him some of his loudest applause. His call for the death penalty for any migrant who kills a U.S. citizen drew hoots and whistles and a \u201cUSA!\u201d chant.",
      "Trump invited several of his children on stage as he spoke nostalgically about the end of his campaign.",
      "He told a story about his youngest son, Barron Trump, teaching him about technology.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m optimistic. Very bullish on Michigan,\u201d Hoekstra told The Associated Press.",
      "Republicans have also focused on election security in Michigan, but on Monday night, Hoekstra said that \u201cso far\u201d he felt good about the security of the election, but \u201cyou never know what you don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "\u201cOverall, we\u2019re feeling good. We\u2019ve got a great effort in place,\u201d said Hoekstra, adding that a \u201cwar room\u201d was in place to take calls if there were any issues with voting tomorrow.",

      "\u201cI want the migrants to go against the champion, and I think the migrant might actually win,\u201d Trump said, describing migrants \u2014 as he often does \u2014 as killers who\u2019ve spent time in jail.",
      "He said he met the wrestlers recently and told them \u201cthey might be the only guys in the country who can beat the hell out of the migrants.\u201d",
      "He had a similar riff at a rally earlier Monday.",
      "Immigration has been Trump\u2019s signature issue since the day he announced his first campaign for president. He often uses dehumanizing language to describe migrants and massively inflates the danger posed by immigrants, who commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans.",
      "The election may be a nail-biter, but Andra Day said at a rally for Harris in Pittsburgh that she has \u201ccomplete faith\u201d when it comes to the voting power of the people of Pennsylvania.",
      "\u201cI love women in positions of power,\u201d she said in her introduction.",

      "\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 would come in. Everyone\u2019s expecting a couple of songs. There were no songs. There was no happiness,\u201d Trump said. Harris supporters who were there might dispute his characterization of the raucous rally.",
      "Then Trump offered some advice to fellow politicians who want to appear with celebrities: \u201cAlways put the stars on after you. That way they stay.\u201d",
      "\u201cA vote for Trump means your groceries will be cheaper,\u201d Trump says. \u201cYour paychecks will be higher, your streets will be safer, your communities will be richer, and your future will be brighter than ever before.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe do not have to settle for weakness, incompetence, decline and decay,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWith your vote tomorrow, we can fix every single problem our country faces and lead America, and indeed the whole world, to new heights of glory.\u201d",

      "Connecticut voters will decide Tuesday whether to get rid of rules preventing the state from joining the 36 others that allow people to cast ballots by mail or through drop boxes without needing an excuse for not going to a polling place in person.",
      "An amendment to the state constitution would lift long-standing restrictions that only allow people to vote by absentee ballot if they are going to be out of town, are sick or disabled, or can't get to a polling location because of religious restrictions.",
      "\u201cWe can finally free our state from the shackles of a long history of overly restrictive voting laws and ensure every eligible voter can cast their ballot conveniently, safely, and securely,\" said state Rep. Matt Blumenthal, a Democrat who co-chairs the General Assembly's Government Administration and Elections Committee.",
      "If voters ultimately agree by a simple majority to allow \u201cno-excuse\u201d balloting, it will then be up to state lawmakers to enact the new system.",
      "\u201cThis just enables them to do it,\u201d said Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas.",
      "Thomas, a Democrat, said that if the amendment passes, her recommendation would be for legislators to take a year to research and design a \u201cholistic\" system that also includes early voting and voting in person.",
      "Connecticut voters recently agreed to change the state's constitution to allow early in-person voting, which took place for the first time in the March primaries. There were 14 days of early voting for the general election. Besides being mailed, absentee ballots can also be put in drop boxes located in every city and town, or submitted to local election offices.",
      "Twenty-eight states let voters request an absentee ballot without requiring an excuse, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Eight more states, plus Washington, D.C., go a step farther and automatically mail a ballot to all registered voters without them having to request one.",
      "Critics of Connecticut's proposed change, mostly Republicans, have questioned the safeguards surrounding the state\u2019s current absentee ballot system.",
      "In the state's largest city, Bridgeport, there were allegations of abuses of absentee ballots during the Democratic mayoral primaries in 2019 and 2023. Last year, a judge ordered the Bridgeport mayoral election redone after campaign volunteers were caught on camera stuffing wads of other people's absentee ballots into collection boxes.",
      "\u201cIt is clear the current absentee ballot system currently in place is broken,\u201d Sen. Rob Sampson and Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, the top Republicans on the Government Administration and Elections Committee, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIn Bridgeport, investigations have shown that people were illegally cheating the system, yet this ballot measure would expand the use of absentee ballots, opening the door to even more fraud and misuse,\" they said.",
      "Both said they would also oppose any change that would lead to ballots being automatically mailed to qualified voters.",
      "Thomas had noted that states with universal access have implemented systems with greater ballot security and voter protection. Requiring things like basic personal information, the last four digits of a Social Security number or a driver\u2019s license number might be considered by Connecticut legislators if the amendment passes.",
      "Patricia Rossi, co-president of the League of Women Voters of Connecticut, said the state's current absentee voting rules left out people who might not be able to make it to a polling place on Election Day for other good reasons, like having to work or act as someone\u2019s caregiver, or because they couldn't access transportation.",
      "Coralys Santana, policy and advocacy strategist for The Connecticut Project Action Fund, a group promoting the ballot measure, contends that easing voting rules would benefit people of all political ideologies.",
      "\u201cThere can be a partisan divide if folks choose that,\" Santata said. \"But I think for the most part, this measure is nonpartisan and is just about equal opportunity and access to the ballot box.\u201d"

      "The abortion measure would prevent lawmakers from passing any law that penalizes, prohibits, delays or restricts abortion until fetal viability, which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks. If it's rejected, the state's restrictive six-week abortion law would stand, and that would make Florida one of the first states to reject abortion rights in a ballot measure since Roe v. Wade was overturned.",
      "The marijuana measure is significant in a state that is home to a large population of farmers and a bustling medical marijuana industry. The ballot initiative would allow adults 21 years old and older to possess about 3 ounces of marijuana, and it would allow businesses already growing and selling marijuana to sell it to them. This vote also comes at a time when federal officials are moving to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug.",
      "The ballot measures need to be approved by more than 60% of voters. In other states, abortion rights have proven to help drive turnout and were a leading issue that allowed Democrats to retain multiple Senate seats in 2022.",
      "Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and other state leaders have spent months campaigning against the measures. Democrats heavily campaigned in support of both issues, hoping to inspire party supporters to the polls. Republican have a 1 million-voter registration edge over Democrats.",
      "Among DeSantis' arguments against the marijuana initiative is that it will hurt the state\u2019s tourism because of a weed stench in the air. But other Republican leaders, including Florida resident Donald Trump and former state GOP Chairman Sen. Joe Gruters, support legalizing recreational marijuana.",

Its judgements and forecasts are closely watched by financial markets to determine if the UK's economic plans are credible.",
      "Pushed on whether the Treasury broke the law over not disclosing an overspend, Mr Hughes said there may \"have been a misunderstanding of how the law ought to be interpreted\"",

      "Prof Miles said the OBR estimated employers would only take around a quarter of the hit from the NI changes in terms of lower profits, and suggested that the rest would be felt by workers.",
      "He said part of the reason for this was the reduction of the threshold for employers paying the tax.",

      "The UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\u2019s first digital dyeing process.",
      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",
      "NTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\u2019s interview request.",
      "Kirsi Niinim\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \u201cquite promising\u201d \u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.",
      "But even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.",
      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",
      "The company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.",
      "They will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.",
      "Big fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 00:01:32 GMT",
    "summary": "A growing global movement is seeing people object to data centres in their locality.",
    "story": [
      "Environmental campaigner Julie Bolthouse points out that Northern Virginia has the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centres. This is not something she is thrilled about.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re the Wall Street of the data centre industry,\u201d says Ms Bolthouse, who is a director of local Virginian charity and campaign group Piedmont Environmental Council.",
      "Data centres are vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Northern Virginia, the northern region of the state of Virginia, has been a key location for data centres since the 1990s. This is thanks to its immediate proximity to Washington DC, yet with historically cheap electricity and land prices.",
      "Centred on the city of Ashburn, which is 35 miles (56km) west of the US capital, there are more than 477 data centres in the state. This is by far the largest number in the US, with Texas in second place on 290, and California third with 283.",
      "In fact, some studies say that 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic goes through Ashburn and the surrounding area, which has been dubbed \u201cData Centre Alley\u201d.",
      "Thanks in large part to the continuing boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires more computing power, demand for data centres is rocketing. As a result, global data centre capacity is expected to double over the next five years, according to a recent study by business analysis firm Moody\u2019s.",
      "Ms Bolthouse and other environmentalists in Northern Virginia are opposed to the continuing expansion of the data centre sector in their region, saying it is already having a major negative impact on their quality of life.",
      "She points to new electricity cables being built over conservation land, parks and neighbourhoods, increased water demand, and the facilities\u2019 back-up diesel generators affecting air quality.",
      "Ms Bolthouse also cites the fact that households in Virginia and neighbouring Maryland are being expected to help pay for the electricity network upgrades that the data centres require.",
      "She and fellow campaigners are fighting back. \u201cWe\u2019re working directly on the ground, opposing each data centre application and working on the local zoning, and trying to educate our local planning commission and supervisors about the issues that we see. But we're also working at the state level.\u201d",
      "Similar campaigns against data centres are springing up all over the world, including in the Republic of Ireland, where such facilities use 21% of the country\u2019s electricity.",
      "\"Our main objections to data centres revolve around their potential negative impacts on our climate, their sustainability, and local infrastructure,\" says Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment. \"When data centres rely on fossil fuel, they potentially strain the electricity grid and can undermine national renewable energy commitments.\"",
      "The group is continuing to challenge plans for a new \u20ac1.2bn ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) data centre in County Clare on Ireland\u2019s west coast.",
      "Mr Lowes adds that while Friends of the Irish Environment would prefer to see data centre development halted altogether, there are various mitigations that might help, including sites prioritising renewable energy, and implementing energy and cooling efficiency measures.",
      "The big players in the global data centre industry are trying to allay people\u2019s concerns. This summer, for example, Microsoft launched its Data Center Community Pledge.",
      "Microsoft is promising that by next year it will procure 100% renewable energy globally. And that by 2030 it will \u201cachieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting\u201d, and become \u201cwater positive\u201d. The latter means that it aims for its data centres to return more water to the local supply than they use.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already uses recycled water for cooling in 20 of its 125 data centres around the world, and also says it will be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030.",
      "Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, which represents dozens of data centre operators including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, says that data centres are leading the way on clean energy use.",
      "\"For example, wind and solar capacity contracted to data centre providers and customers represented two-thirds of the total US corporate renewables market last year, and four of the top five purchasers of renewable energy in the US are companies that operate data centres,\" he says.",
      "\"The data centre industry is also unlocking greater energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users \u2013 everything from smart thermostats to grid-enhancing technologies require the digital infrastructure provided by data centres.\"",
      "The protests against data centres have also extended to South America, where campaigners say they have achieved successes.",
      "In Uruguay, for example, Google changed the design of a new facility now under construction. It was initially due to be water cooled, but the US giant switched to an air-cooled system.",
      "This followed protests in a country that has been experiencing droughts and a shortage of drinking water.",
      "\"Water use by Google in the initial proposal would have been equivalent to the daily consumption of drinking water by 55,000 people in our country,\" says Mar\u00eda Selva Ortiz of Friends of the Earth Uruguay.",
      "\"This threat to the right to water amidst a water crisis raised strong criticisms, leading Google to change the proposed technology to cool down its equipment, so the project was modified. Chillers will cool down with air instead of water.\u201d",
      "In Chile, meanwhile, Google has halted plans for a data centre over similar water use concerns.",
      "Back in Virginia, Ms Bolthouse says the firms need to do more to boost sustainability. In the long run, she says, it will be in the industry's own interests to improve data centres' environmental impact.",
      "\"What's going to happen if we continue with business as usual is that electrical prices are going to skyrocket for everybody, including the data centre industry - and that's their biggest bill, so that's going to impact them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe water scarcity issue is also going to impact them.",

    "story": [
      "The door of Juan Botero\u2019s apartment in Houston, Texas is made of wood \u2013 with a classy, walnut-like finish.",
      "But, for Halloween, he planned an eye-catching change. \u201cI\u2019m going to paint my door orange,\u201d Mr Botero, founder and chief executive of Colombia-based Glasst, told the BBC last month. And he has kept his promise.",
      "However, the move is not as drastic as it sounds. Mr Botero\u2019s firm, an \u201cinnovation company\u201d, has designed the paint to be removable \u2013 once dry, you can peel it off like plastic wrap. If it works as intended, it shouldn\u2019t leave behind any marks or residue.",
      "Mr Botero had the idea for the product, called Unpaint, about five years ago and, initially, his investors weren\u2019t keen. \u201cThey said I was crazy,\u201d he recalls. Nevertheless, he insisted: \u201cPeople are looking for customisation in their lives.\u201d",
      "Glasst is just one of many firms that claim house paint can do more than look nice. Various products now on the market, their makers promise, will save you money, keep you comfortable during heatwaves, or transform your relationship with the walls of your home. But is it all too good to be true?",
      "Unpaint is due to launch in the US this November, and Mr Botero is convinced that there is a market for the stuff. He argues it will appeal to people living in rented accommodation, who can\u2019t make permanent changes to their decor.",
      "Glasst, unsurprisingly, declines to share details about how it makes the paint, but Mr Botero says it is a resin from a renewable source. I ask if he means trees and he confirms.",
      "Peelable paint already exists for car bodywork, but getting such a product to work reliably on softer home interiors is more challenging.",
      "There is a risk of damaging your existing, underlying paint when you eventually wrest Unpaint off your walls, but, if the permanent paint below is in good condition, this shouldn\u2019t happen, says Mr Botero.",
      "It does have an odd texture: \u201cA little bit rubbery,\" says Mr Botero. Plus, it is easier to scratch than water-based emulsion.",
      "Bringing the product to market hasn\u2019t been easy. Glasst posted a video about the paint to YouTube two years ago, but the launch was delayed until this year \u201cto align with the correct funding and resources needed,\u201d says Mr Botero.",
      "He mentions that Glasst is working on other coatings with unusual properties \u2013 including \u201cThermglasst\u201d, an insulating resin due to launch next year. Mr Botero claims that less than a millimetre of this coating will provide the same insulating effect as 40 millimetres of foam.",
      "There\u2019s no independent validation of that claim just yet, but there are already a range of insulating paints on the market that promise to reduce your heating bills and, it is fair to note, they have not always performed well in scientific evaluations.",
      "In 2019, Richard Fitton of the University of Salford and colleagues published a paper in which they investigated the efficacy of six thermal paints available on the UK market at the time. In short, they found that claims that such paints could reduce heating bills by up to 20% or 25% were impossible to validate.",
      "First, the researchers coated boards with the paints, which allowed them to measure the coatings\u2019 thermal resistance, or insulating values. Then, the team calculated the reduction in heating costs you would expect after applying each of these paints to the interior of a typical Victorian terraced house.",
      "The biggest cost saving measured was a mere 2.9%, and, given the price of the paints in question, homeowners would potentially have to wait centuries or even up to a millennium \u2013 at 2019 prices \u2013 before they would recoup the decorating fees in terms of reduced heating costs.",
      "\u201cIf someone brought me a paint that could save me 25% of my energy bill, it would be on my wall by the weekend,\u201d says Prof Fitton. He adds that he is currently working on a follow-up paper to the 2019 study, and would also be open to testing Thermglasst, or any other insulating paint, in the future.",
      "Paints that help to keep your house cool might be more effective. For years, researchers have pursued the idea of improving the reflectivity of paint on exterior walls or roofs, since this could help keep buildings cool on hot, sunny days. Such weather is becoming ever more common due to climate change.",
      "The principle is as old as the hills \u2013 consider the white painted houses of the Mediterranean. But paints designed to be significantly more reflective than standard white paint could heighten the effect. i2Cool in Hong Kong is one of several firms marketing such a product at present.",
      "In their case, the paint contains tiny nanoparticles inspired by the extremely reflective body of the Saharan silver ant \u2013 which must naturally cope with baking sunshine.",
      "Martin Zhu, chief executive and co-founder, says the paint made by i2Cool was tested on the roof of a shopping mall in Hong Kong \u2013 but only on one of its two buildings, in order to find out whether there was a noticeable effect in terms of reducing the costs of running that building\u2019s air conditioning (AC).",
      "\u201cWe used a power meter to measure the energy consumption of the AC system,\u201d says Dr Zhu. The cost of running the AC duly fell in the painted building, by 40%, he adds.",
      "Dr Zhu first began working on the paint while a doctoral student, and he mentions that early versions made around 2017 contained silver, which made it very expensive \u2013 more than $100,000 just to cover a small area. Years of development later, it now costs around $10 per square metre of coverage. It also now comes in a variety of light colours, including grey, yellow and green.",
      "Researchers have noted that highly reflective coatings for passive cooling applications need to be resistant to dirt and soiling, for example, to avoid their efficacy dropping overt time. And glare from ultra-reflective roofs risks heating up nearby darker structures, a 2020 paper suggested.",
      "The paint from i2Cool does not contain heavy metals and uses a water-based emulsion, and while it is not biodegradable, it can be recycled, says Dr Zhu.",
      "The company\u2019s latest major project is the Dubai Mall. The roof of this sprawling complex \u2013 the largest mall in the world by total area \u2013 will eventually be fully coated with the paint. A 1,000 sq m section has been completed to date.",
      "While not yet available in Europe, that could change, says Dr Zhu. \u201cWe are discussing with some distributors in the UK,\u201d he says.",

      "Aa a result, Wikwemikong Tourism has struggled to retain staff, a problem that\u2019s reflected across a Canada-wide tourism sector still said to be short of hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "These staffing shortfalls will have to be addressed if the Canadian government is successful in its new drive to increase visitor numbers to the country.",
      "The push, led by government body Destination Canada, comes as visitor numbers to Canada have failed to recover post-Covid to their 2019 peak of 22 million people. Last year the total was 18.3 million, 17% lower.",

      "Last year, loan terms were increased from 30 to 40 years and repayment threshold salaries were dropped from \u00a327,295 to \u00a325,000, meaning more graduates would be repaying their loans for longer.",
      "Tom Allingham, from the Save the Student money advice website, said that despite their \"dismay\" at the increase in fees, it would make \"little difference to overall levels of student debt, and will have no impact whatsoever on the amount a graduate repays each month\".",

      "Nudes are often considered standard for galleries, arts schools and life drawing classes, but Ms Harris said commercial galleries tend to avoid them.",
      "\"Most artists do life drawings. Life drawings are the life blood of any artist,\" she said.",

      "\"I think people were uncomfortable about the position of the woman but support for this exhibition has been really positive.\"",
      "The display now features a male full-frontal life drawing in the window, which Ms Harris said had sparked a very different response to the female drawing.",

      "\"You hear the odd snigger [at the male drawing] but I have not heard a parent or child talk about it or be offended by it,\" she added.",
      "Ms Harris is aiming to widen the conversation around the natural body, with an opinion book also available for viewers to leave their comments about the recent exhibition.",
      "The exhibition, called Slay Hay, features work from 30 artists who were selected from an open submission.",
      "It will run until 9 November but Ms Harris hopes to make the exhibition an annual event."

      "Kyran - who uses they/them pronouns - proudly performed their first show as drag persona Kyran Thrax in 2019, surrounded by friends at an open mic night in Vauxhall, London.",
      "But, as the drag artist explains, the Kyran Thrax persona was not born that night: \"This part of me, I feel, has been with me since everything happened when I was 13.\"",
      "As a teenager, Kyran fondly remembers going to school wearing platform shoes, black eyeliner and backcombed purple hair with \"the most orange foundation,\" which they say felt like an early expression of their drag persona.",
      "Kyran, 26, is now proud of being confident and uplifting others through drag, but says \"it did start as a defence mechanism, because it was a way for me to try and survive\".",
      "At the age of 13, Kyran had just come out as gay and had started talking to a 23-year-old man, who claimed to be a teenager, after meeting on social media.",

      "\"It can often lead to self-harm, eating disorders and can be something that actually impacts the rest of their life.\"",
      "Following their experience being groomed, Kyran says \"it was really hard, I hated myself, I really, really did.",
      "\"A way for me to try and survive was to convince myself that I did love myself,\" Kyran adds, explaining that saying daily affirmations and exploring drag became a way to rebuild confidence.",
      "During this difficult time in their life, Kyran says: \"I think [my drag persona, Kyran Thrax] was there, I think she's always been an expression for me.\"",
      "Kyran continued to develop their drag act at university, where they studied drama.",
      "With the encouragement of friends, Kyran began performing on stage and by graduation they were \"a full-time drag queen\".",
      "Now Kyran is taking part in the latest series of BBC series RuPaul's Drag Race UK. Kyran says watching themselves on screen felt like a dream.",
      "In episode five, Kyran tells fellow queen La Voix about their experience being groomed.",
      "\"It's a topic that I feel is still so taboo, so many people shy away from talking about it,\" Kyran says.",
      "Sharing their excitement for what the future holds, Kyran hopes their drag can \"provide fun, surreal experiences where people can come and they can forget about their problems and just have that escapism.",
      "\"I feel like that's why I'm here, is to perform.\"",

      "But after running up a $145,000 debt on a European tour, he took a day job with Mercury Records in 1961, becoming the first African-American vice-president of a major record label.",
      "While there, he discovered and produced the million-selling single It's My Party by Lesley Gore. He also released the Big Band Bossa Nova compilation album, which included his own infectious track Soul Bossa Nova, which has since become a staple of parties and film soundtracks, including Austin Powers.",

      "The album was not just the fulfilment of Jackson's talent, but the culmination of Jones's career, as he used his peerless musical expertise to define the 1980s with a sleek and polished fusion of R&B and pop.",
      "Jones listened to hundreds of songs to decide which nine should go on the album, and employed a dream team of musicians and songwriters that he had been assembling over the years.",
      "His choice of collaborators was one example of his knack for knowing how to make a good song great. For Beat It, he thought the single needed a rockier edge, so he recruited Eddie Van Halen to contribute a guitar solo. Legend has it that the solo was so explosive that a speaker caught fire in the studio.",
      "And when it came to the title track, Jones didn't like the original name Starlight, so he asked its writer, Rod Temperton, to come up with something different. Temperton renamed it Thriller and recast it with a spooky theme. Jones topped it off by asking his wife's friend, horror actor Vincent Price, to record a spoken-word outro.",
      "The album earned Jones and Jackson the Grammy Award for producer of the year, while Thriller was named album of the year and Beat It won record of the year.",
      "Jones used his winning formula in the 1980s with George Benson, Donna Summer and Patti Austin, and produced the decade's best-selling single when Jackson and Lionel Richie assembled 35 of America's biggest names for the 1985 charity song We Are the World.",
      "Jones famously posted a message on the studio entrance telling the stars: \"Check your egos at the door\".",
      "He had further success under his own name with his albums The Dude and Back on the Block. The latter, released in 1989, featured an all-star cast including many friends from his early career like Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Ray Charles.",
      "But as well as revisiting his past, he was also firmly in the present, enlisting rappers like Ice-T and Grandmaster Melle Mel to appear on the title track.",

      "\"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "And rap stars reciprocated his affection, looking on Jones as an inspirational elder statesman of black American music. Even Kendrick and Dr Dre were awestruck when meeting him for the Netflix documentary, which was titled Quincy and directed by his daughter, actress Rashida Jones.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 13:20:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The musician, who has died aged 91, was one of the most consequential producers in jazz and pop.",
    "story": [
      "\"Music is sacred to me,\" Quincy Jones once said. \"Melody is God's voice.\"",
      "He certainly had the divine touch.",
      "Jones, who has died at the age of 91, was the right-hand man to both Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson, and helped to shape the sound of jazz and pop over more than 60 years.",
      "His recordings revolutionised music by crossing genres, promoting unlikely collaborations and shaping modern production techniques.",
      "Here are 10 songs that showcase his versatility and brilliance in the studio, and his ability to draw the best out of the musicians he worked with.",
      "1) Michael Jackson - Billie Jean",
      "Michael Jackson met Quincy Jones on the set of the 1978 movie The Wiz, and asked him to produce his next album. That record was Off The Wall - a disco extravaganza that established Jackson as a solo star.",
      "They teamed up again for 1982's Thriller, which arguably remade the pop business. Not only did it produce seven top 10 singles; but it crossed racial barriers, appealing equally to black and white audiences.",
      "Key to the success was Billie Jean, a dark tale about the groupies Jackson met while touring with his brothers. As a producer, Jones wasn't keen on the track at first - arguing with Jackson about the long instrumental opening.",
      "\"I said, \u2018Michael we\u2019ve got to cut that intro,\u2019\u201d he later recalled.",
      "\"He said, \u2018But that\u2019s the jelly! That\u2019s what makes me want to dance.' And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That\u2019s what makes me want to dance,' well, the rest of us just have to shut up.\"",
      "With those words ringing in his ears, Jones kept the arrangement lean and funky. He even instructed sound engineer Bruce Swedien to create a drum sound with a \"sonic personality\" that no-one had ever heard before. The result is one of the most recognisable intros in the history of pop.",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "2) Frank Sinatra - Come Fly With Me (Live at The Sands)",
      "\"The friendship was so strong. You can't describe it,\" said Jones of his partnership with Frank Sinatra - which extended far beyond the recording studio.",
      "\u201cSeven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying.\"",
      "After establishing their relationship on 1964's It Might As Well Be Swing, Jones helped Sinatra re-arrange his signature songs for a four-week residency at the Copa Room in The Sands hotel, Las Vegas.",
      "\"It was probably the most exciting engagement I have ever done in my life, since I started performing,\" Sinatra later recalled.",
      "Accompanied by the Count Basie Orchestra, the star sounds perfectly at ease, breezing around standards like I've Got You Under My Skin, Fly Me To The Moon and You Make Me Feel So Young.",
      "But it's Come Fly With Me that most perfectly captures the vitality of Jones's new arrangements, especially in the charismatic interplay between Sinatra and the brass section.",
      "No wonder that it was chosen as the show's opening number - as captured on the award-winning live album, Sinatra At The Sands.",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "3) Lesley Gore - It's My Party",
      "Lesley Gore was just a teenager when her vocal demos made their way into Quincy Jones's hands in the early 1960s. Up to that point, he'd been working with jazz singers like Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan - but he heard something he liked on Gore's tape.",
      "\"She had a mellow, distinctive voice and sang in tune, which a lot of grown up rock \u2018n\u2019 roll singers couldn\u2019t do, so I signed her,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography.",
      "For their first session, Jones picked It's My Party out of a pile of 200 demos and got to work. He double-tracked Gore's voice, adding little flourishes of brass and unexpected chord changes that perfectly evoke the song's adolescent angst.",
      "He then rush-released the single, after discovering that Phil Spector had plans to record the same song with the Crystals. It duly topped the US charts and went to number nine in the UK.",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "4) Quincy Jones - Summer In The City",
      "Recorded by The Lovin' Spoonful, Summer In The City is a 1960s rock classic, full of ominous organ chords and powerful drum hits that capture the sticky filth of an oppressive heatwave.",
      "Quincy Jones version, recorded for his 1973 album You've Got It Bad Girl, is almost unrecognisable as the same song. Lazily chilled-out, the Hammond organ is played with a featherlight touch, and the drums are gently brushed.",
      "Most of the lyrics are excised and, when they arrive at the 2'30\" mark, they're sung with almost heavenly serenity by Valerie Simpson (of Ashford and Simpson fame).",
      "Originally released as a b-side, it's become one of Jones's most influential songs. According to WhoSampled.com, it's been sampled on 87 other songs, including tracks by Massive Attack, Eminem, Nightmares on Wax and The Roots.",
      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "5) Dinah Washington - Mad About The Boy",
      "Another example of how Jones's skill as an arranger could completely change a song.",
      "Mad About The Boy was written by Sir No\u00ebl Coward, for the 1932 revue Words and Music. In the original, it was sung by four different women, each expressing their love for an unnamed film star (rumoured to be Douglas Fairbanks Jr) as they wait in line to see one of his films.",
      "It's funny and quirky and clever - but when Dinah Washington covered the song in 1961, Jones slowed it down and switched the time signature from 4/4 to 6/8, allowing the singer to prowl through the lyrics with a newfound carnality.",
      "Overlooked at the time, it gained a new lease of life in 1992 when it was used to soundtrack a Levis advert and crept into the UK charts for the first time.",

      "6) Quincy Jones - Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Written in just 20 minutes, Soul Bossa Nova was inspired by an early-60s fad for Brazilian music, sparked by the success of Jo\u00e3o Gilberto and Stan Getz's Desafinado.",
      "Jones is in his element here - with chirruping flutes and big trombone slides that capture the joie de vivre of the carnival. He also makes prominent use of a cu\u00edca, the Brazilian drum that produces what sounds like a very happy monkey in the opening bars.",
      "The bossa-craze may have been short-lived, but Jones's song endured, most memorably in the opening dance sequence of Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery.",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "7) Michael Jackson - Beat It",
      "From the beginning, Jones and Jackson planned to make Thriller a blockbuster pop album.",
      "\"We went through 800 songs to get to nine,\" Jones said. \"That's not casual.\"",
      "The work was exhausting. At one point, they were working in three studios simultaneously... until the speakers caught fire.",
      "Beat It was crucial to the project - because it was designed to get Jackson played on US rock radio, an unheard of prospect in the heavily-segregated music industry of the 1980s.",
      "Jones had told Jackson to write \"a black version\" of The Knack's My Sharona - the 1979 hit song that sold more then 10 million copies. But Jackson was one step ahead. He had a demo that fit the bill, albeit without a hook or lyrics.",
      "While Jackson worked on those elements (you can hear his first, wordless attempt at the melody on his YouTube channel), Jones called on Eddie Van Halen to perform the guitar solo.",
      "\"He came in and he stacked up his Gibson [guitars],\" Jones later recalled.",
      "\"I said, 'I'm not going to sit here and try to tell you what to play... Let's try three or four takes. Some of it will be over-animated, some of it will be long, and we'll sculpt it.",
      "\"And he played his ass off.\"",
      "The song, with its West Side Story-inspired video, landed just as MTV took off, making Jackson a permanent fixture in living rooms across America.",
      "But for all the commercial focus of the Thriller project, Jones always maintained that the music came first.",
      "\"I've never, ever in my life done music for money or fame - because that's when God walks out of the room,\" he said.",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "8) The Brothers Johnson - Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Jones discovered guitarist George Johnson and bassist Louis Johnson when he heard them playing on a demo by Chaka Khan's sister, Taka Boom.",
      "He hired them to play on the soundtrack for the celebrated TV mini-series Roots, placed them in his touring band, and helmed their 1976 debut album Look Out For #1 (including a sublime cover of The Beatles' Come Together).",
      "But the brothers didn't achieve mainstream success until 1977, with the release of Strawberry Letter #23.",
      "Originally recorded by Shuggie Otis, Jones's version toughens up the production, with a strutting bassline and soaring backing vocals - but George Johnson struggled to recreate Shuggie's original guitar solo, which was full of complicated triplet notes.",
      "Frustrated, Jones called up session musician Lee Ritenour for help.",
      "\"Quincy was walking down the hallway tearing his hair out,\" Ritenour later recalled. \"He said, 'I'm going to lunch, Ritenour. Get it done.'",
      "Released in the middle of the punk and disco boom, the song's romantic psychedelia still found an audience - reaching number 13 in the charts. It was later re-popularised by Quentin Tarantino in the film Jackie Brown.",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "9) Sarah Vaughan - Misty",
      "Early in his career, Jones was one of the most in-demand arrangers in jazz, working with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee.",
      "In 1958, he recorded an entire album with Sarah Vaughan in Paris, backed by a 55-piece orchestra. Among the highlights is the lovestruck ballad Misty - originally recorded by pianist Erroll Garner, and made famous by Johnny Mathis.",
      "Unlike their syrupy and sentimental versions, Vaughan and Jones (along with producer Jack Tracy) give the lyrics some pathos. She might be \"as helpless as a kitten up a tree\", but you're never entirely convinced she's happy about the situation.",
      "Jones adds beguiling touches - from the cascading strings when Vaughan sings \"a thousand violins begin to play\", to the beautifully muted saxophone line, played by Zoot Sims.",
      "Vaughan died of lung cancer in 1990. In 2019, on what would have been her 95th birthday, Jones posted a tribute to the singer, using his pet name for her - Sassy.",
      "\"Dear sweet Sassy was all about sophistication and chord changes and, man, I\u2019m telling you she thought like a horn and SANG like a horn!\" he wrote on Facebook..",
      "\"We had quite the journey together, & I will never forget each moment we had, because every moment was a special one.\"",
      "Listen to Misty",
      "Listen to Misty",
      "10) USA For Africa - We Are The World",
      "\"Check your egos at the door,\" said the hand-written sign that Quincy Jones pinned to the door of his recording studio in 1985.",
      "The occasion was the recording of We Are The World - a star-studded charity single that aimed to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia.",
      "Written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, the record featured vocals from Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen, Dionne Warwick and Bob Dylan, all recorded in a single night.",
      "Herding the singers was a massive headache, as the recent Netflix documentary The Greatest Night In Pop revealed.",
      "At one point, Stevie Wonder insisted that some of the lyrics should be rewritten in Swahili - despite the fact that the people of Ethiopia, who would be the main beneficiaries of the famine-relief fundraiser, largely speak other languages.",
      "Jones oversaw the whole session with the patience and wisdom of a producer who'd seen it all.",
      "The results aren't particularly great - the song is sickly and overlong - but the fact that it's coherent at all is a testament to his skill as a producer, arranger, mentor and referee.",
      "In the end, the song raised more than $63m ($227m or \u00a3178m adjusted for inflation); and Jones looked back on it as one of his proudest achievements.",
      "\u201cI have never before or since experienced the joy I felt that night working with this rich, complex human tapestry of love, talent, and grace,\" he wrote in his 2002 autobiography.",

      "Jamie reportedly claimed to have trained at the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and that he worked his way up at United Agents, a top London agency. He wrote in emails that he was a member of the Personal Managers\u2019 Association - which has a code of conduct for agents to observe.",
      "The BBC contacted all three of these organisations. They all said they had no record of him.",
      "Audition questions",
      "Several ex-clients have told the BBC Jamie sent them audition opportunities that were never intended for them.",
      "Layla Shirley from Birmingham signed with the agency in June 2022.",
      "Jamie sent her a promising self-tape opportunity, where actors are chosen by production companies to record their auditions at home. It was for an advert with a well-known burger chain - despite the fact she is vegan.",
      "The production company later confirmed they had no record of making this request for Layla.",
      "\u201cSo many times with self-tapes, you get them the night before, and you've got to drop everything or cancel your plans to learn the lines, which is a sacrifice we make\u2026 If you\u2019ve done all that for nothing, it really is a kick in the teeth.\u201d",
      "Frustrated, Layla began speaking about her experience with other former clients and Alexa Morden, host of The 98%, a podcast which explores the reality of work for jobbing actors.",
      "The most important thing Layla wanted to draw attention to though, was the operation of Jamie\u2019s agency for child actors, Luna Kids Casting.",
      "Kids agency",
      "Luna Kids Casting held auditions in April, July and October 2023, with pop-up banners in the Wigan studio suggesting children signed by Jamie went on to work for Cbeebies, Sky, Disney and Fox.",
      "Sarah Wilson\u2019s 10-year-old daughter was successful during busy auditions and a photoshoot day was scheduled for those children asked to join the books.",
      "Parents were asked to pay \u00a3180 in cash to Jamie's Mum on the reception desk.",
      "While this was \u201cincredibly expensive\u201d, Sarah says she felt reassured by the amount of paperwork requested prior to signing her daughter up.",
      "But costs kept mounting. They included a \u00a366 charge for a child\u2019s details and images to be uploaded to the agency\u2019s website and a fee of \u00a3120 to sign them up to Spotlight, a platform where actors are submitted for jobs.",
      "Agreements also outline a monthly fee of \u00a314.40. These charges were described as non-refundable.",
      "According to the Agents of Young Performers Association, upfront fees should only be charged 30 days after a client and agency has entered into a contract.",
      "Sarah says she later discovered a fake credit added to her daughter\u2019s Spotlight profile. It said she had taken part in a stage production called As It Was, with Jamie\u2019s partner listed as the director.",
      "The BBC has searched for this production online and has found no record of its existence.",
      "Despite paying just under \u00a3500 to Luna Kids Casting, Sarah says only one audition opportunity was sent to them. She moved her daughter to another agency.",
      "\u201cIt wasted a year of opportunity [and] it raised her hopes, a little girl\u2019s dreams.\u201d",
      "Fake charity claims",
      "Jamie was not only running talent agencies, but a sister company called Access Workshops providing training for actors.",
      "When actors signed up to Bodhi, their welcome emails stated it was mandatory to attend sessions by Access Workshops.",
      "The workshops cost between \u00a355 and \u00a360 and involved actors learning scripts and performing in front of top industry professionals.",
      "Attendees say Jamie would begin by giving a talk, where he would mention a portion of the fee would be donated to charity, with the logos of Mind, Rainbow Railroad and the Oddballs Foundation visible in photos of the sessions posted on social media.",
      "In emails seen by the BBC, Jamie and his partner\u2019s signatures featured graphics that said Access Workshops donates a percentage of \u201coverall profits\u201d to organisations such as Tackle HIV.",
      "We contacted each organisation and none had any record of receiving any donation from the Bodhi Talent Agency or Access Workshops.",
      "'It makes you question everything'",
      "Actors like Alexa Morden have used the #BodhiGate scandal to call for change in an industry that seems glamorous on the surface.",
      "Her podcast, The 98%, refers to 2019 research by Queen Mary University of London, which references surveys that found that just 2% of actors in the UK make enough money to survive.",
      "When issues do arise, actors are scared to speak out or be seen as \u201ctroublemakers\u201d because of an uneven power dynamic, Alexa says.",
      "Those who have been left out of pocket, like Thea, feel \u201clet down\u201d by the industry.",
      "Equity had been working to bring a claim against Bodhi Talent Agency and Jamie Fisher to recover nearly \u00a340,000 on behalf of 10 members.",
      "But it told the BBC it was made aware Jamie has no assets, and none are held by the company.",
      "In a statement, Equity said: \u201cHaving taken legal advice, we have been told that there is no prospect of monies being returned to creditors and that they do not expect to be making any payments at all.",
      "\u201cThis outcome is hugely disappointing. Mr Fisher and his rogue agency have treated its clients appallingly, leading to the loss of significant amounts of money owed to them.\u201d",
      "Others have questioned the role of the platform Spotlight. In 2019, former employers warned Spotlight alleging that Jamie was submitting fake credits for his own clients, as well as \u201cconcocting\u201d productions that never existed.",
      "They claimed his \u201cconsistent fabrications\u201d could cause damage to the industry, but said they heard little back.",
      "In response, Spotlight told the BBC it was provided with verified references from casting professionals who had been positive about their business dealings with Jamie Fisher.",
      "It also said it had \u201cactively supported affected individuals during the agency's closure by offering one-to-one assistance and guiding them on how to address their concerns, including directing them to Equity and the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate (EASI)\u201d.",
      "While it does not regulate talent agencies, Spotlight says it can \u201cremove their services for misuse of our platform or for breaching our terms and conditions\u201d.",
      "The #BodhiGate scandal, first reported by Deadline, has also generated discussion about the limited regulation of UK entertainment, in contrast with the US, where 22 states require an agency licence.",
      "\u201cWe see from the US that a structure is possible which can give consumers much more protection and ensure that unscrupulous agents aren't able to practice in this arena and make promises that they can't fulfil - alongside charging unfair fees,\u201d Christopher Gabbitas, a commercial lawyer working in the creative sector, told the BBC.",
      "He suggests that actors should look for established agencies, read any contracts carefully and speak to current clients if looking for representation.",
      "Alongside Equity, actors we spoke to said they were in the process of, or had, submitted reports to the EASI, the government-backed watchdog which polices UK employment agencies. It has the power to bar individuals from practicing.",
      "The BBC understands it is currently investigating complaints around Luna Kids Casting and the Bodhi Talent Agency.",
      "In the meantime, Thea and Jack have been left wondering if they will ever see any of the money they say they are owed.",
      "\u201cIt really makes you question everything,\u201d Thea says, adding that she feels let down, most of all, by someone she once regarded as a friend.",
      "Jamie Fisher has not responded to any requests for comment by the BBC."

      "Despite this, singers, actors and influencers seem to be bringing smoking back into vogue - quite literally, with cigarettes making a return as on the New York Fashion Week runways earlier this year as accessories.",
      "So, why are cigarettes being glamorised again?",
      "Lucy, a 20-year-old university student, says she took up smoking recently because \"it's just what everyone does\".",
      "Almost all her friends also smoke and she says it's more than just a habit, it's an aesthetic.",
      "\"I definitely think everyone trying to be brat has influenced people to start smoking because Charli herself says you have to have a pack of cigs if you really want to embody the vibe.\"",
      "The 'cigfluencers'",
      "Charli XCX isn't the only celebrity to inadvertently become a so-called cigfluencer.",
      "There are now Instagram accounts which share snaps of hundreds of celebs like Dua Lipa, Chappell Roan and Anya Taylor-Joy smoking.",
      "The stereotypical image of a smoker may once have been an old, overweight man with rotting teeth, but that's now been replaced by the young and glamorous celebrities who pout at the camera mysteriously with a Marlboro Gold in hand.",
      "The aesthetic of these smoking celebs is reminiscent of the noughties when the likes of Kate Moss and Jennifer Anniston would step out in low-rise jeans and baby tees with a cigarette on their lips.",
      "Journalist Olivia Petter says the cigarette has become a symbol that represents our nostalgia towards a bygone era of carefreeness, frivolity and hedonism and it's making an comeback in pop culture.",
      "Emerald Fennell's seductive and scandalous thriller Saltburn perfectly encapsulated the mid-noughties and reminded us of a time where it was legal to smoke indoors.",
      "Not only were there promo pics for the film of Jacob Elordi\u2019s character smoking topless, but smoking was such an integral part that actor Archie Madekwe (who plays Farleigh) requested cigarette lessons because he had never smoked one before.",
      "According to Truth Initiative, a nonprofit health organisation against smoking, nine out of the 10 films nominated for the Oscars top prize earlier this year featured smoking, which is up from the seven in the year before.",

      "But, overall, the number of young people smoking is declining - official estimates show that fewer than one out of every 10 young adults in the UK smoke cigarettes \u2013 a steep drop from a quarter of 18-24-year-olds 12 years ago.",

      "In a recent video posted on TikTok, singer Addison Rae responded to a question about vaping by saying: \"Ew, I hate vaping. Smoke a cigarette!\"",
      "US-based doctor James Hook tells the BBC he has seen cases of young people taking up smoking after vaping.",
      "He thinks the way smoking is glamorised by celebrities means cigarettes  \"give young people a certain credibility those older than them do not have to work as hard for\".",
      "He adds that many of them are \"emulating older people that are considered sophisticated, trendy or appealing\".",

      "Female mosquitoes are the ones that spread diseases to people, and so trying to prevent them having babies would help reduce overall numbers.",
      "The team from the University of California, Santa Barbara, studied Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which spread viruses to around 400 million people a year.",

      "Dr Joerg Albert, from the University of Oldenburg in Germany, is an expert on mosquito mating and I asked him what he made of the research.",

      "Asked by the committee how a \u00a39.5bn shortfall could have happened, the OBR's Mr Hughes said \"the system very clearly broke down\", but insisted \"that kind of failure will not happen again\" because of processes put in place since.",
      "The OBR works closely with the Treasury. Its role is to assess the government's tax and spending plans and produce reports on whether the chancellors' plans are sound. Its judgements and forecasts are closely watched by financial markets to determine if the UK's economic plans are credible.",
      "Pushed on whether the Treasury broke the law over not disclosing an overspend, Mr Hughes said there may \"have been a misunderstanding of how the law ought to be interpreted\"",
      "\"There is no doubt in our minds that had that information been provided we would have had a materially different judgement,\" he added.",

      "The OBR has calculated that three quarters of the impact would be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "The watchdog's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "Prof Miles said the OBR estimated employers would only take around a quarter of the hit from the NI changes in terms of lower profits, and suggested that the rest would be felt by workers.",
      "He said part of the reason for this was the reduction of the threshold for employers paying the tax.",
      "However, he suggested that the personal impact for workers might see \"a bit of an offset\" with the increase to minimum wages announced in the Budget.",
      "The OBR's comments come after much debate around Labour's manifesto claim that there would be no tax rises on \"working people\" following its first Budget in 14 years.",

      "Is Labour's 2030 green energy goal realistic and how would it affect bills?",
      "Miliband asked the National Energy System Operator (NESO) to review ministers' clean energy plans after Labour's return to power at July's general election.",
      "The body was originally owned by National Grid, a private company, but transferred to government ownership last month.",
      "The government is expected to publish its action plan for modernising the grid in the coming months.",
      "Sources within government see its report, to be published on Tuesday, as a vindication of its pledge to deliver a net zero carbon electricity system in Great Britain by 2030, a key part of Labour's election manifesto.",
      "But it also highlights the scale of the task when it comes to increasing the supply of renewable energy, and connecting it to the grid.",
      "Meeting the pledge, it finds, would require a significant boost to offshore wind capacity, alongside increased electrification of heat, transport and industry.",
      "Nearly 1,000 km (620 miles) of new power lines would be required to connect new renewable energy to the grid, along with 4,800 km of undersea cables, it said.",
      "The report points out that this would be more than double over five years what has been built in total in the last 10, requiring many projects to begin construction in the next 6 months to two years.",
      "It added that this \"challenging\" timescale will require changes to the planning system to cut down the time new projects take to get approval.",
      "The construction of hundreds of miles of new pylons is also likely to run into political opposition, with a number of schemes facing fierce local opposition.",
      "'Ideological'",
      "The previous Conservative government had signalled it was open to the idea of making cash payments to households in the path of new large electricity pylons, alongside existing community compensation schemes paid through consumer bills.",
      "The 2030 target is five years ahead of that promised by the Tories before the election, with Claire Coutinho, shadow energy secretary under Rishi Sunak, branding it \"unrealistic\" and \"simply ideological\".",
      "There has also been some scepticism within the trade union movement about the potential impact on jobs.",
      "The GMB union, which represents oil and gas workers and donates to Labour, said any government plans to boost wind and solar power should come with a \"cast iron commitment to delivering quality jobs here\".",
      "Impact on bills",
      "NESO's report estimated that the 2030 clean energy plan would require an average of \u00a340bn in investment a year, most of it from the private sector, requiring a significant boost from current levels.",
      "It did not model the impact of its blueprint on consumer bills \"given the heavy dependence on policy choices\".",
      "But the report predicts wholesale energy prices are likely to fall with decreased reliance on gas, which often spikes unpredictably.",
      "The exact timing of any drop in costs depends on how quickly clean energy infrastructure can be built and related policy decisions, the report said.",
      "It argued that consumer costs were unlikely to rise, as fixed prices for renewable projects would offset reduced natural gas needs.",
      "It also said the 2030 target would depend on a four to fivefold expansion of its demand flexibility service, under which households and firms are encouraged to save money by using less electricity at busy times.",
      "The authority will also begin consulting on plans to overhaul the system for connecting new renewable power stations to the grid, to prioritise projects that are ready to be built.",

      "The National Union of Students called the tuition fees rise a \"sticking plaster\", but said higher maintenance loans \"will make a real difference to the poorest students\".",
      "For universities, the higher fees are a cash injection to assist with their most immediate financial challenges.",
      "However, the announcement only affects fees and loans in the 2025/26 academic year \u2013 and vice-chancellors will want to know what the government\u2019s plans are beyond that.",

      "She said the government was having to \"take the tough decisions needed to put universities on a firmer financial footing\".",

      "Maintenance grants, which were non-repayable, were scrapped in 2016.",
      "In their analysis of the changes, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the tuition fees increase would spare universities a further real-terms cut to their teaching resources.",
      "But they urged the government to say whether fees would continue to increase after next year, \"to provide some certainty to universities and prospective students alike\".",
      "They also said that, under current repayment terms, around a quarter of the extended loans would eventually be written off and paid by the taxpayer.",
      "Although students taking out the highest possible maintenance loans would be getting more money next year, the IFS said they would still be borrowing 9% less in real terms than they would have done in 2020/21.",

      "Personal finance expert Martin Lewis has said the tuition fee changes are \"likely to be trivial\", especially compared with students who started university in 2023.",
      "Last year, loan terms were increased from 30 to 40 years and repayment threshold salaries were dropped from \u00a327,295 to \u00a325,000, meaning more graduates would be repaying their loans for longer.",
      "Tom Allingham, from the Save the Student money advice website, said that despite their \"dismay\" at the increase in fees, it would make \"little difference to overall levels of student debt, and will have no impact whatsoever on the amount a graduate repays each month\".",

      "But Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said raising tuition fees was \"economically and morally wrong\" and that the government was \"taking more money from debt-ridden students\" to support universities.",

      "The government hopes that increasing maintenance support will help students with day-to-day living costs like food and accommodation.",

      "Appearing on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the chancellor was asked whether there was any chance she would rethink the NI rise for employers.",
      "\"I'm not immune to their criticism,\" Reeves said, \"but we've got to raise the money to put our public finances on a firm footing.\"",
      "Wednesday's Budget outlined policies to increase spending by almost \u00a370bn a year over the next five years.",
      "About half of this is being funded by tax increases, with the other half coming from a rise in borrowing.",
      "The NI rise for employers is set to raise \u00a320bn a year making it one of the biggest single tax-raising measures in history.",
      "From next April, employers will have to pay NI at 15% on salaries above \u00a35,000, instead of 13.8% on salaries above \u00a39,100 currently.",
      "The Institute of General Practice Management, which represents GP practice managers, has estimated the rise will put up the tax bill of the average surgery by around \u00a320,000 a year.",
      "Businesses are likely to respond by holding back on pay rises, influential think tanks, the government's independent forecaster and the chancellor herself have all said.",
      "\"It will mean businesses will have to absorb some of this through profits and it is likely to mean wage increases might be slightly less than they otherwise would have been,\" Reeves previously told the BBC.",
      "The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the rise in employer NICs will affect larger firms hiring people on low wages the most, while the Resolution Foundation think tank described the move as a \"tax on working people\".",
      "A growing political divide",
      "Also speaking to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Badenoch said the Conservatives would be thinking about the economy \"in a different way\", which would be \"completely the opposite\" of what Labour was doing.",
      "She criticised the rise in employers' NI contributions as being \"not coherent\" as most of the increase would be passed on through lower wages and higher prices, but she did not say whether or not she would reverse it.",
      "This goes to the core of the growing political divide in UK politics, following the first Labour budget in 15 years and Badenoch\u2019s victory.",
      "The new Conservative leader believes lower taxes will help boost economic growth, with the tax burden too high even under her own government.",
      "Labour has been willing to hike taxes because it believes without significant investment in the NHS, too many people of working age who have been ill will not be able to return to the labour market.",
      "It also thinks without a further boost to education, people will lack the skills needed in a modern economy.",
      "But the scale of the tax rises were never revealed before the election and the chancellor insists her hand has been forced because the public finances were worse than she anticipated when in opposition.",
      "Some in Labour\u2019s ranks feel she should \"lean in\" more to the arguments for greater borrowing and investment.",
      "But Reeves insisted her budget was not \"ideological\" despite increasing taxes on some inherited land, second homes and flights on private jets, as well as imposing VAT on private school fees - something Badenoch has committed to reversing, branding it a \"tax on aspiration that won't raise any money\".",
      "Reeves also denied that raising employer NI had been considered by Labour before they came to power.",
      "\"No, this was not something that was on the agenda before the election,\" she said.",
      "Asked if she had been wrong to say during the election that there would not be any extra taxes if Labour won, she replied: \"What I was wrong about was the mess that the previous government had left for us,\" citing the \u00a322bn black hole that Labour say the Tory party left them with.",

      "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",

      "Earlier on Sunday, in an interview with Sky News, Reeves said she was wrong to say higher taxes would not be needed during the election as she \"didn't know everything\".",
      "Reeves told the BBC the previous Conservative government cut NI contributions made by workers without the money to do so, but she had not reversed the move because it would be a \"direct breach\" of Labour's manifesto.",
      "The chancellor said Labour had had to make \"difficult choices\", but she believed the economy was now \"on a strong footing\".",
      "Asked if she could rule out putting up more taxes during this parliament, Reeves said she was \"not going to write four or five years' worth of Budgets\" on the programme.",
      "However, she said Labour's pledge \"not to increase for working people the key taxes they pay - income tax, National Insurance and VAT - that is a commitment for the duration of this parliament\".",

      "Rebecca Wilson, a fifth-generation farmer from Yorkshire, told the Laura Kuenssberg programme that their farm could be facing a tax bill of nearly \u00a31m when her parents died.",
      "Reeves said a farm owned by two people could pass on \"\u00a33m essentially tax-free\" and there would be 10 years to pay any tax owed.",
      "She added that only \"a very small number\" of farms would be affected, but said last year 40% of the tax relief fell to \"7% of the wealthiest land owners\".",
      "\"I don't think it is affordable to carry on with a relief like that when our public finances are under so much pressure.\""

      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on her first day in the job, Badenoch gave a first glimpse of her policy priorities, including on reversing the VAT hike for private schools.",
      "She said the Conservatives \"got a lot of things wrong\" ahead of their historic election defeat, including on immigration and tax, but refused to give a \"post-mortem\" of her predecessors and claimed the Partygate scandal was \"overblown\".",
      "With appointments to her shadow cabinet expected in the next couple of days, Badenoch said she wanted to show the party was united with a meritocratically selected front bench.",

      "\"We\u2019re not going to be able to oppose anything in terms of getting legislation through,\" she said, adding she could only \"make the argument that raising taxes in this way... is not going to grow our economy and will leave all of us poorer\".",
      "However, when asked directly whether she would reverse the VAT hike on private schools, Badenoch was definite, saying \"yes, yes, I would... because it\u2019s a tax on aspiration, but it won\u2019t raise any money\" and was therefore \"against our principles\".",
      "She also told Ms Kuenssberg that \"it is not the government that creates growth, it is business that creates growth\", adding that this is \"completely the opposite of what Rachel Reeves is doing\".",
      "Badenoch, who is the first black leader of a Westminster party, said she not only disagrees with Reeves' economic policies but also the way she has discussed being the UK's first woman chancellor in 800 years.",
      "She said: \"I think that the best thing will be when we get to a point where the colour of your skin is no more remarkable than the colour of your eyes, or the colour of your hair.",
      "\"I find it astonishing that Rachel Reeves keeps talking about how she\u2019s the first female chancellor, which in my view is a very, very low glass ceiling within the Labour Party, which she may have smashed.",
      "\"Nowhere near as significant as what other women in this country have achieved.\"",
      "She was also critical of her predecessor Rishi Sunak's leadership, saying he had lost trust with voters because \"promises on immigration and on tax were not kept and that is something that we need to change\".",
      "Badenoch resigned from Boris Johnson's cabinet over his handling of the Chris Pincher affair, which she said resulted in the public thinking \"we were no longer speaking for them or looking out them, we were in it for ourselves\".",
      "But in regards to the Partygate scandal, she said Johnson walked into \"a trap\".",
      "\"A lot of the stuff that happened around Partygate was not why I resigned - I thought it was overblown,\" she said.",
      "\"We should not have created fixed penalty notices... that was us not going with our principles.\"",
      "When asked to apologise for the economic turmoil under Liz Truss, Badenoch said she wanted to \"draw a line\" under the faults of previous leaders and refused to go through a \"post-mortem\" of every Conservative leader \"for the past 14 years\".",
      "Instead, Badenoch said her focus was on rebuilding trust and creating a perception of unity within the party, although she said that was \"very tricky\", particularly when \"not everybody wants to serve\".",
      "She added: \"The public didn\u2019t trust us for a whole bunch of reasons - not keeping promises but also looking disunited.\"",
      "Addressing the loss of Conservative voters to Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage at the last election, Badenoch denied she would only be offering voters \"more of the same\".",
      "She said: \"Nigel Farage and the success of Reform are a symptom of the Conservative party in my view, not being clear enough and consistent enough about values and about how we were using those Conservative values to deliver to the British people.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s like week zero,\u201d a government insider suggests. A new Conservative leader today. A whopper of a Budget on Wednesday.",
      "Add those two events together and it feels like this is the week that everything changed \u2013 the clock restarts.",
      "The tramlines are now set for the battles ahead, a member of the cabinet tells me. A Labour government that\u2019s now unabashed in the big choices it\u2019s made, the winners and losers they\u2019ve picked.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, the new Conservative boss, is unashamed in saying what the softer fringes of the Tory party has felt squeamish about until now.",
      "And maybe we\u2019ve entered a new era when the fabled centre ground of politics feels a bit emptier \u2013 and the differences between the two main parties are sharper.",
      "The consequences of the Budget are still emerging, and the real effect won\u2019t be clear for many months. There has been no huge unravelling, but ministers are still incredibly aware they\u2019ll still need to explain it.",
      "If your doorbell rings this afternoon and it\u2019s a grinning person with a red rosette and a leaflet, you\u2019ll know what they\u2019re up to.",
      "The party knows the decisions, particularly to whack billions on employers\u2019 national insurance, have caused some anxiety among some voters. This will also hit GP practices and charities, which have flagged fears about the cost of the change - and no government wants to go to war with them.",
      "No minister wants to have to defend a decision that looks to many voters and their rivals, like they were misled, after promises not to raise National Insurance in the election.",
      "The government rejects the charge - insisting they only promised to not raise the National Insurance paid by employees, rather than employers.",
      "But Labour is having to learn what it\u2019s like to take the flak. To wobble on the big decisions would be politically disastrous. And in Downing Street there\u2019s confidence the public is broadly onside.",
      "Insiders say No 10\u2019s focus groups - which have been asked about the Budget in the last few days - have understood the decisions, reporting some grumbles but not much sign of outrage.",
      "One government source says, \u201cpeople looked at the Budget and said, \u2018that makes sense\u2019. That is a platform we can build on.\u201d",
      "The decisions, and the government\u2019s true motivations \u2013 are out there now in black and white. The source says \u201cit\u2019s the first time \u2013 certainly in government, probably in the whole project \u2013 we have been able to show, rather than just tell.\u201d",
      "However, after all of Labour\u2019s schmoozing of the business world, and all their emphasis in the election of growing the economy, there\u2019s been some surprise that those arguments were a lot less prominent on Wednesday.",
      "Sources say phase one was concentrating on the public finances and public services, then the next part will be more emphasis on growth with a big speech from Rachel Reeves at the Mansion House in the City soon.",
      "How the Budget will affect you and your money",
      "Rachel Reeves doesn\u2019t mind if you don't like her Budget",
      "A senior business leader told me, \u201cthey\u2019ve done part one well, in a more traditional Labour way, but to get a real shape, they need a very strong part two... creating the vision, energy and specific incentives and plan for growth and wealth creation \u2013 that still needs work.\u201d",
      "On the other side, Labour\u2019s union backers are pleased with extra cash for some public services, and the tweaking of the borrowing rules so more money is available to spend on long-term projects.",
      "But there\u2019s concern, as one leader puts it, that the NI rise for employers will be \u201craised in every negotiating room\u201d, as an excuse for lowering wages. And unhappiness on the left about the two-child benefit cap, and the winter fuel allowance, remains - with a judicial review of the decision on those pensioner payments in the offing.",
      "But forget the inevitable skirmishes and stresses. The Budget has filled in many of the blanks about this government, answering part of that common question: what does Keir Starmer really stand for?",
      "And the response could almost be a line from a Gordon Brown Budget of days gone by \u2013 economic stability, more public spending, with schools and hospitals at the top of the list.",
      "Starmer\u2019s backers says the discipline on day-to-day spending - even cuts to some departments - makes it different to Labour Budgets of the past, claiming they have taken the Conservatives\u2019 mantle for being the party you can trust with public money.",
      "But no doubt the Budget illuminates the priorities of classic Labour instincts, not the mushy middle.",
      "A government source suggests none of it should really be a surprise.",
      "\u201cTraditional centre-left arguments were were all there in the election \u2013 ending non-doms, VAT on private schools - overall it passes the fairness test and that is the most important thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cLabour in its veins,\u201d says a cabinet minister. And in the next few weeks Labour will publish what\u2019s been described as a \u201cprogramme for government\u201d that will make it even more clear.",
      "New Conservative chapter",
      "The sharper shape makes life both easier and harder for the brand new Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch.",
      "It\u2019s more straightforward perhaps if Labour\u2019s stripes are more red, the Tories can portray themselves a deeper blue.",
      "Kemi Badenoch has been deliberately light on policy, but her principles are clear. She believes in free markets and a smaller state. It\u2019s not going to be hard for her to draw a contrast to the government. \u201cIt\u2019s back to the future,\u201d one Tory source tells me.",
      "\u201cWe can go back to first principles, as we did in the 70s and the early 2000s,\u201d opposing bigger government and bigger taxes.",
      "Another senior party figure suggests the Budget has already sketched out an obvious path telling me, \u201cthe government has positioned itself as distinctly post-new Labour.",
      "\u201cIt is workerist, it\u2019s not very nice to farmers or rural areas \u2013 with pensioners and farmers you see that you have a coalition where the Tories can get back to 250 seats.\u201d",
      "Badenoch\u2019s backers are sure that she can satisfy the first task of opposition, getting noticed. Opposition parties don\u2019t have an automatic right to get attention.",
      "One supporter was convinced that \u201cwhatever happens, she will be an attention-gatherer.\u201d But Labour reckons their Budget choices have sent plenty of traps for the brand new leader.",
      "It might seem natural to the Tories to vote against the government\u2019s tax rises in the Budget. But it\u2019s a lot less comfortable to oppose extra cash for public services.",
      "It\u2019s one thing to stand against charging private schools VAT. But will the Conservatives oppose the new teachers for state schools the tax rise is meant to support? That is a far harder argument to make.",
      "Labour\u2019s decisions mean, despite Badenoch\u2019s broad-brush approach, the Tories are going to be expected to have something to say about schools and hospitals - services the public relies on.",
      "A senior Conservative figure warns that this week has \u201cset up a public services Parliament \u2026 you can\u2019t go through a sustained period of time when you just rely on the vibes.\u201d",
      "As Chris has written, the task for Badenoch is massive. Not just because of the July\u2019s battering that depleted their numbers so much, but because the Conservatives have been in the groove of attacking each other for many years now.",
      "The party is described by sources as \u201cfractious\u201d, and  \u201cdeeply sceptical\u201d. Getting rid of leaders became almost the norm.",
      "One of the contenders for the job joked when courting votes they\u2019d even been told by one former minister: \u201cI\u2019m more interested in the leadership race in two years time.\u201d",
      "Badenoch has won a clear mandate, but by a smaller margin than in races that have gone before.",
      "There is no doubt she is a politician that stands out, another Conservative says, referencing an old TV ad: \u201cShe has the potential to be Heineken \u2013 reaching the parts of the electorate other Tories cannot.\u201d",
      "But her style has risks - \u201clike a can of Heineken, if shaken up too much, it can froth everywhere,\u201d and make a terrible mess.",

      "And an opposition with a new leader who believes in something completely different. Don\u2019t forget of course the smaller parties, Reform, the Lib Dems, the SNP and Greens, have important roles too.",
      "But the contours of the central contest feel sharper now.",
      "For years politicians, whether Labour or Conservative, have liked to suggest that we can drift towards lower taxes and still have the kind of public services of countries where the government spends much more cash.",
      "Perhaps this week might mark the moment when our politicians stop telling us we can have it all.",
      "A former cabinet minister suggests now we\u2019ll be much less like \u2018the stepping stone\u2019 between America and the rest of Europe. Politics is an ever-shifting kaleidoscope but Labour\u2019s enormous Budget has set new terms.",

      "It is a pledge she put at the heart of her Tory leadership campaign, which focused on changing the underlying mindset of the British state rather than setting out detailed policies.",
      "Born in Wimbledon in 1980, Olukemi Adegoke was one of three children of Nigerian parents. Her father worked as a GP and her mother was a physiology professor.",

      "She backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum before achieving her ambition of becoming an MP a year later, for the safe Conservative seat of Saffron Walden in Essex.",
      "Badenoch had spent three years bouncing around junior government roles when in 2022 she joined the rapid ministerial exodus which brought down Boris Johnson.",
      "To the surprise of many of her colleagues, Badenoch then joined the sprawling contest to succeed Johnson despite never having been in the cabinet.",
      "What began as a longshot campaign with the support mostly of loyal friends who also entered Parliament in 2017 quickly gained momentum, and heavyweight support in the form of Michael Gove.",
      "Badenoch ultimately came fourth with the backing of 59 MPs - more than the 42 MPs who were enough for her to finish top in the parliamentary stage of the current leadership election.",
      "Her direct approach, instructing her colleagues to \u201ctell the truth\u201d, won Badenoch a bigger role in the Conservative Party and it was inevitable that Liz Truss chose to appoint her to the cabinet - making her international trade secretary.",

      "To her supporters, that\u2019s the point: unlike other ministers she was willing to tell MPs what she believed and make the case for it forthrightly.",
      "On the eve of this year's party conference in Birmingham, she made headlines with a claim that not all cultures were \"equally valid\", citing as an example \"cultures where women are told that they should not work\".",

      "Despite the Tories being in office for 14 years, she argues that increases in government regulations and public spending have crippled economic growth and polarised the country.",
      "She rejected Robert Jenrick's call for key party policies to be settled now, saying the UK's \"system is broken\" and requires a reset.",

    "title": "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 19:47:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Estimates of the number of farms affected range from 100 to 70,000.",
    "story": [
      "There has been an outcry from many farmers following the changes to inheritance tax for farms announced in the Budget.",
      "From April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will have to pay inheritance tax at 20% - half the usual rate.",
      "We've seen a range of claims about how many farms will be affected.",
      "The largest estimate - 70,000 - relates to the total number that could ever be affected. But the number of farms likely to be impacted each year is likely to be around 500.",
      "Will 70,000 farms be affected?",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the government needed to \"listen to rural communities\" and reverse the change, claiming it would impact around 70,000 farms.",
      "That figure comes from the Country Land and Business Association. Its president, Victoria Vyvyan said: \"We estimate that capping agricultural property relief at \u00a31m could harm 70,000 UK farms, damaging family businesses and destabilising food security.\"",
      "That's not a figure for the number of estates that will have to pay inheritance tax each year, it's an estimate of the total number of farms worth enough to pay.",
      "There are a couple of ways to get to that.",
      "Yiorgos Gadanakis, associate professor of agricultural business management at University of Reading, Whiteknights pointed to various sources including Defra's Farm Business Survey, which suggest that between about 30 and 35% of farms in the UK could be valued at over \u00a31m.",
      "As there are about 209,000 farm holdings in the UK, that gives an estimate of between 62,700 and 73,150.",
      "An alternative way is to look at the number of farms that are bigger than about 200 acres (81 hectares), because at average land prices that would be enough to mean inheritance tax was due. That figure comes out at about 70,000.",
      "Sally Shortall, professor of rural economy at Newcastle University, points out they will not be evenly distributed across the country because of differing land values. \"Farms in England are likely to be the hardest hit,\" she said.",
      "But of course a farm will only be affected once it is inherited, so 70,000 is not necessarily the right number to use.",
      "Is it 500 farms a year?",
      "Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an independent economy think-tank, told Sky News: \"The changes will affect a remarkably small number of some of the most valuable farms.\"",
      "He added: \"[Farms are] still more generously treated, actually, than farms used to be in decades past.\"",
      "The Treasury estimates that 500 estates including agricultural land will be affected by the agricultural property relief reform per year.",
      "Dan Neidle, an independent tax expert, says the number of actual farms affected is likely to be below 500 per year.",
      "There were a total of 462 inherited farms valued above \u00a31m in 2021-22, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC):",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m37 above \u00a35m",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m",
      "80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m",
      "37 above \u00a35m",
      "Under the new rules, those 462 farms would be affected by the 20% inheritance tax on any value above \u00a31m (not on the whole value).",
      "However, as Mr Neidle points out, like for the rest of the population, there is no inheritance tax to be paid on the value of property up to \u00a3325,000, bringing the untaxed total to \u00a31.325m.",
      "If a farmer is married, his or her spouse would be able to pass on another \u00a31.325m tax free, taking the total untaxed amount to \u00a32.65m.",
      "There were 117 farms valued above \u00a32.5m in 2021-22, according to the HMRC figures.",
      "In addition, there is an \u00a3175,000 tax-free allowance on a main residence when it's being passed on to children or grandchildren. This brings the total untaxed amount for a farming couple to up to \u00a33m.",
      "Steve Reed, the secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, confirmed the \"vast majority\" of farmers will not be affected by changes. Writing in the Telegraph, he said \"only the richest estates will be asked to pay\".",
      "Farmers 'betrayed' by \u00a31m inheritance tax relief cap",
      "Farmers mull selling or protests over tax change",
      "How are the inheritance tax rules changing?",
      "How much could be raised?",
      "The chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, has said that the inheritance tax exemptions currently cost \"about \u00a31bn a year for taxpayers\".",
      "Now the Treasury expects that the changes to inheritance tax , as well as changes to Business Tax Relief, will raise \u00a3230m in 2026-27, the first year of their introduction. This rises to \u00a3520m by the end of the forecast in 2029-30.",
      "But the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warns that there is high uncertainty around these figures.",
      "Is the tax affordable?",
      "Sam Kirkham, who specialises in agriculture at Albert Goodman accountants, says \"people look at the value of farms and think the farmers must be wealthy\".",
      "But she says if the farm passes down to the next generation to continue to produce food, they never get to realise that capital.",
      "And she adds farm profits are insufficient to meet the additional cost of inheritance tax.",
      "Government figures suggest that the average return on capital for farms (which is the percentage return that they are making from things like land and machinery) is only about 0.5%, which is very low.",
      "UPDATE 4 November: The unit on a measure of area was corrected from hectares to acres. A sentence was added detailing the residence nil-rate band rate of inheritance tax.",

    "summary": "The Budget is about the long game on the economy and Reeves believes the current  pain is a price worth paying.",
    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves always knew she was going to spend many days explaining her Budget.",
      "The reaction of those paying the bills for this near-record increase in taxes was always going to be harsh. For the chancellor, her political pain for now is a price worth paying.",
      "The Budget is about the long game on the economy. This is not speed chess, to reference Reeves\u2019s favourite pastime.",
      "And in looking to reboot Britain\u2019s economic model, the chancellor\u2019s most helpful asset is the fact she has a landslide majority to credibly pass all of these policies in to law.",
      "This is one of the many differences from Liz Truss\u2019 mini budget and is sometimes underrated. During that budget in 2022, the markets were not just testing the economic credibility of a PM and chancellor, but their political credibility too, to get a rather different set of economic policies through the Commons.",
      "Look at France right now, which is trying to rein in its levels of government borrowing, but has a minority government made up of the third biggest party, trying to pass tough measures.",
      "The markets don\u2019t have as much confidence in a minority government as they would in a government like the UK, which has a big majority.",
      "Credibility",
      "Two critical assets for a new chancellor (that eluded Kwasi Kwarteng) are political credibility to pass Budgets, and financial credibility with markets.",
      "On the crucial government bond markets, which are a verdict on budgets, but also impact the rate of mortgage and business loans, it is fair to say there is more than an arched eyebrow now.",
      "While at the time of the Budget speech there was no response, the publication of the plans for the increase in the sale of government bonds has set off a marked rise in interest rates. This is because the government is borrowing more than the markets expected. The reaction now is notable, but remains orderly.",
      "UK borrowing costs at highest for a year after Budget",
      "How the Budget will affect you and your money",
      "Workers warned Budget tax rises will hit their wages",
      "This is partly a market repricing of the increased need for loans to the UK government, and the expectation that the Bank of England, facing more post-Budget inflationary pressures, will no longer cut interest rates quite as quickly.",
      "Rates might not fall below 4% next year, as previously expected. The next words from the Bank of England, when it releases its new inflation forecast next week, will be closely watched.",
      "Mammoth changes",
      "The response has been modest given the mammoth changes seen in Wednesday's Budget, with \u00a376bn a year in new spending, half funded by tax and half by borrowing.",
      "The chancellor\u2019s aides say the critical fact is that the borrowing is mostly for big long term UK investment in major capital projects.",
      "The plans increase investment by \u00a3105bn versus previous Conservative plans for significant cuts, leaving investment at the highest sustained level in half a century.",
      "This could be much better for long term economic growth, and not as inflationary. Clearly, it depends on what the money is spent on.",
      "The sums are significant and suggestive of Joe Biden\u2019s plans in the US which saw billions of government dollars invested into the economy.",
      "The Energy Secretary Ed Miliband was in the US last week visiting the key officials in charge of disbursing the record subsidies and loans made available in the $400bn Inflation Reduction Act. One lesson from the US is that it takes time to build up the pipeline of good government investments.",
      "While the US's private sector took an immediate cue from the massive government announcements, it took one to two years to get the state machine ramped up.",
      "The whole mammoth offer of Wednesday's UK Budget could be seen as a bet on the new government having the skills and the judgement to kick start high productivity investment and so get the growth that was lacking in the forecasts.",
      "Of course it is plausible that the Biden US strategy might not last the week, should Donald Trump return to the White House.",
      "But unlike Joe Biden, the PM, his chancellor and energy secretary have at least four years to try to deliver.",

      "At the Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves once again blamed the Conservatives for leaving a \"\u00a322bn black hole\" in the public finances.",
      "A report from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which makes forecasts for the government, found there had been information it should have been given by the Treasury, but only listed a \u00a39.5bn shortfall from February.",
      "Nonetheless, it said forecasts in March would have been \"materially different\" if it had known about all the previous government's spending plans.",
      "Conservative leader Rishi Sunak said the OBR had declined to support Reeves's claims of a \u00a322bn black hole, saying: \u201cIt actually appears nowhere in their report.\u201d",
      "Reeves said the \u00a322bn came from the \u00a39.5bn of spending plans reported by the OBR from February, another \u00a37bn before the March Budget, and a further \u00a35.6bn between March and the end of July, including public sector pay awards made by Labour.",
      "Government ministers have repeatedly used the figure to justify the decision to cut the winter fuel payment and raise taxes.",
      "Was there \u00a322bn of unknown spending?",
      "Accompanying a Budget that increased spending by \u00a370bn a year, the OBR published a report on 30 October looking at whether there had been information about pressures on spending that it should have known about in February when it was working on its forecasts to go with the March Budget.",
      "It asked the Treasury for an estimate of these pressures and was given a figure of \u00a39.5bn, which is considerably below the \u00a322bn in the July report.",
      "\"Had we known that information we would have had a materially different view about the level of public spending this year,\" OBR head Richard Hughes told BBC News.",
      "\"We can't say how different that would have been because we would have had to have had a different conversation with the Treasury in the light of that information.\"",
      "Reeves told BBC News that the rest of the \u00a322bn was overspent between the Budget and the 4 July election.",
      "Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank said Reeves \"may be overegging the \u00a322bn black hole\".",
      "What about the rest of the \u00a322bn?",
      "The government published a breakdown of how it had got from the Treasury's \u00a39.5bn shortfall in February to the \u00a322bn \"black hole\".",
      "It said that there was another \u00a37bn between February and the actual Budget in March, as departments found out about new spending pressures and the government spent more on the NHS and the Household Support Fund",
      "There was a final \u00a35.6bn between then and late July, which includes almost a month when Labour was in power.",
      "That was largely caused by increases in public sector pay.",
      "It was the Labour government that accepted the recommendations of the Pay Review Bodies (PRBs), but they said that the previous government should have budgeted for more than a 2% increase in public sector pay.",
      "Prof Stephen Millard from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank told BBC Verify: \"The 'political' question is whether you would count this as part of the fiscal black hole or not. If you do, then you get to the \u00a322bn figure;  if not, then you\u2019re left with around \u00a312.5bn to \u00a313.5bn.\"",
      "Row over 'black hole' in public finances continues",
      "Where does the \u00a322bn claim come from?",
      "The \u00a321.9bn figure was in an audit published by the Treasury at the end of July \u2013 just a few weeks after Labour came to power.",
      "The document looked at areas of public spending which are set to go over budget this year, including:",

      "At the time, the OBR wrote that it had not been made aware of the extent of overspends and said it would investigate.",
      "Was there a big overspend?",
      "To put those figure into context, in the Spring Budget it was expected that total public spending this year would be \u00a31,226bn. Either \u00a39.5bn or \u00a322bn would be a small proportion of that.",
      "But by the standards of government overspends, either would be unusually large.",
      "Spending was much higher than expected due to Covid in 2020 and 2021 and also almost \u00a310bn higher than expected in 2023 because of inflation caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",

    "published": "Thu, 31 Oct 2024 04:27:46 GMT",
    "summary": "Human-caused climate change made recent extreme weather events more intense and more likely, new analysis finds.",
    "story": [
      "Human-caused climate change made the ten deadliest extreme weather events of the last 20 years more intense and more likely, according to new analysis.",
      "The killer storms, heatwaves and floods affected Europe, Africa and Asia killing more than 570,000 people.",
      "The new analysis highlights how scientists can now discern the fingerprint of climate change in complex weather events.",
      "The study involved reanalysing data for some of the extreme weather events and was carried out by scientists from the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group at Imperial College London.",
      "\u201cThis study should be an eye-opener for political leaders hanging on to fossil fuels that heat the planet and destroy lives\u201d, said Dr Friederike Otto, co-founder and lead of WWA.",
      "\u201cIf we keep burning oil, gas and coal, the suffering will continue,\u201d she said.",
      "The researchers focused on the 10 deadliest weather events registered in the International Disaster Database since 2004.  That was when the first study was published linking a weather event \u2013 a heatwave in Europe - with our changing climate.",
      "The deadliest event of the last two decades was a drought in Somalia in 2011 which is reckoned to have killed more than 250,000 people.   The researchers found the low rainfall that drove the drought was made more likely and more extreme by climate change.",
      "The list includes the heatwave that hit France in 2015 killing more than 3,000 people, where researchers say high temperatures were made twice as likely because of climate change.",
      "How is climate change linked to extreme weather?",
      "Why is the world getting warmer?",
      "It also contains the European heatwaves of 2022, when 53,000 people died, and 2023, which led to 37,000 people losing their lives. The latter would have been impossible without climate change, the study finds.",
      "It says the deadly tropical cyclones that hit Bangladesh in 2007, Myanmar in 2008 and the Philippines in 2013 were all made more likely and intense by climate change.  That was also the case with the floods that hit India in 2013.",
      "The researchers say the real death toll from these events is likely to be significantly higher than the figures they quote.",
      "That is because fatalities linked to heatwaves do not tend to be recorded as such in much of the world, especially in poorer nations which are most vulnerable.",
      "The study was carried out before the storms in Spain left dozens dead this week.",
      "The link between climate change and weather events is only possible because the two scientists who founded the WWA - Dr Otto and a Dutch climatologist called Geert Jan van Oldenborgh \u2013 pioneered a way to track global warming in catastrophic weather events.",
      "They knew that weather records showed that extreme weather events were becoming more intense. What\u2019s more, a huge body of peer-reviewed science explained how warming the atmosphere can intensify extreme weather. What was missing was the link between a single event to rising global temperatures.",
      "\u200cFor years forecasters have been using atmospheric models to predict future weather patterns. Otto and Oldenborgh repurposed the models to run repeated simulations to work out how likely a weather event was in the current climate.",
      "\u200cThey also created parallel simulations which explored how likely the same event was in a world in which the industrial revolution had never happened. These computer models stripped out the effects of the billions of tonnes of CO2 that humans have pumped into the atmosphere.",
      "\u200cThe calculations meant they could compare how likely the same event was with and without the 1.2C of global warming that the world has already experienced since the industrial revolution.",
      "\u201cThe massive death tolls we keep seeing in extreme weather shows we are not well prepared for 1.3\u00b0C of warming, let alone 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C\u201d, said Roop Singh, of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre which supports the WWA.",
      "She said today\u2019s study showed the need for all countries to build their resilience to climate change and warned: \u201cWith every fraction of a degree of warming, we will see more record-breaking events that push countries to the brink, no matter how prepared they are.\u201d",

      "Their voice, opinions and world view would be extremely influential on an industry with such a devoted and zealous fanbase.",
      "But the fascination also stems from the fact that, as the holder of more than one million bitcoins, Satoshi would be a multi-billionaire, not least because the price of the coins is currently close to an all-time high.",

    "summary": "A growing global movement is seeing people object to data centres in their locality.",
    "story": [
      "Environmental campaigner Julie Bolthouse points out that Northern Virginia has the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centres. This is not something she is thrilled about.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re the Wall Street of the data centre industry,\u201d says Ms Bolthouse, who is a director of local Virginian charity and campaign group Piedmont Environmental Council.",
      "Data centres are vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Northern Virginia, the northern region of the state of Virginia, has been a key location for data centres since the 1990s. This is thanks to its immediate proximity to Washington DC, yet with historically cheap electricity and land prices.",
      "Centred on the city of Ashburn, which is 35 miles (56km) west of the US capital, there are more than 477 data centres in the state. This is by far the largest number in the US, with Texas in second place on 290, and California third with 283.",
      "In fact, some studies say that 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic goes through Ashburn and the surrounding area, which has been dubbed \u201cData Centre Alley\u201d.",
      "Thanks in large part to the continuing boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires more computing power, demand for data centres is rocketing. As a result, global data centre capacity is expected to double over the next five years, according to a recent study by business analysis firm Moody\u2019s.",
      "Ms Bolthouse and other environmentalists in Northern Virginia are opposed to the continuing expansion of the data centre sector in their region, saying it is already having a major negative impact on their quality of life.",
      "She points to new electricity cables being built over conservation land, parks and neighbourhoods, increased water demand, and the facilities\u2019 back-up diesel generators affecting air quality.",
      "Ms Bolthouse also cites the fact that households in Virginia and neighbouring Maryland are being expected to help pay for the electricity network upgrades that the data centres require.",
      "She and fellow campaigners are fighting back. \u201cWe\u2019re working directly on the ground, opposing each data centre application and working on the local zoning, and trying to educate our local planning commission and supervisors about the issues that we see. But we're also working at the state level.\u201d",
      "Similar campaigns against data centres are springing up all over the world, including in the Republic of Ireland, where such facilities use 21% of the country\u2019s electricity.",
      "\"Our main objections to data centres revolve around their potential negative impacts on our climate, their sustainability, and local infrastructure,\" says Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment. \"When data centres rely on fossil fuel, they potentially strain the electricity grid and can undermine national renewable energy commitments.\"",
      "The group is continuing to challenge plans for a new \u20ac1.2bn ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) data centre in County Clare on Ireland\u2019s west coast.",
      "Mr Lowes adds that while Friends of the Irish Environment would prefer to see data centre development halted altogether, there are various mitigations that might help, including sites prioritising renewable energy, and implementing energy and cooling efficiency measures.",
      "The big players in the global data centre industry are trying to allay people\u2019s concerns. This summer, for example, Microsoft launched its Data Center Community Pledge.",
      "Microsoft is promising that by next year it will procure 100% renewable energy globally. And that by 2030 it will \u201cachieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting\u201d, and become \u201cwater positive\u201d. The latter means that it aims for its data centres to return more water to the local supply than they use.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already uses recycled water for cooling in 20 of its 125 data centres around the world, and also says it will be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030.",
      "Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, which represents dozens of data centre operators including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, says that data centres are leading the way on clean energy use.",
      "\"For example, wind and solar capacity contracted to data centre providers and customers represented two-thirds of the total US corporate renewables market last year, and four of the top five purchasers of renewable energy in the US are companies that operate data centres,\" he says.",
      "\"The data centre industry is also unlocking greater energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users \u2013 everything from smart thermostats to grid-enhancing technologies require the digital infrastructure provided by data centres.\"",
      "The protests against data centres have also extended to South America, where campaigners say they have achieved successes.",
      "In Uruguay, for example, Google changed the design of a new facility now under construction. It was initially due to be water cooled, but the US giant switched to an air-cooled system.",
      "This followed protests in a country that has been experiencing droughts and a shortage of drinking water.",
      "\"Water use by Google in the initial proposal would have been equivalent to the daily consumption of drinking water by 55,000 people in our country,\" says Mar\u00eda Selva Ortiz of Friends of the Earth Uruguay.",
      "\"This threat to the right to water amidst a water crisis raised strong criticisms, leading Google to change the proposed technology to cool down its equipment, so the project was modified. Chillers will cool down with air instead of water.\u201d",
      "In Chile, meanwhile, Google has halted plans for a data centre over similar water use concerns.",
      "Back in Virginia, Ms Bolthouse says the firms need to do more to boost sustainability. In the long run, she says, it will be in the industry's own interests to improve data centres' environmental impact.",
      "\"What's going to happen if we continue with business as usual is that electrical prices are going to skyrocket for everybody, including the data centre industry - and that's their biggest bill, so that's going to impact them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe water scarcity issue is also going to impact them.",
      "\u201cSo I am optimistic that we're going to see a little bit of progress, but I think it's going to take time.\"",

      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 00:02:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Paints now promise to make your house cooler, warmer, or simply peel off.",
    "story": [
      "The door of Juan Botero\u2019s apartment in Houston, Texas is made of wood \u2013 with a classy, walnut-like finish.",
      "But, for Halloween, he planned an eye-catching change. \u201cI\u2019m going to paint my door orange,\u201d Mr Botero, founder and chief executive of Colombia-based Glasst, told the BBC last month. And he has kept his promise.",
      "However, the move is not as drastic as it sounds. Mr Botero\u2019s firm, an \u201cinnovation company\u201d, has designed the paint to be removable \u2013 once dry, you can peel it off like plastic wrap. If it works as intended, it shouldn\u2019t leave behind any marks or residue.",
      "Mr Botero had the idea for the product, called Unpaint, about five years ago and, initially, his investors weren\u2019t keen. \u201cThey said I was crazy,\u201d he recalls. Nevertheless, he insisted: \u201cPeople are looking for customisation in their lives.\u201d",
      "Glasst is just one of many firms that claim house paint can do more than look nice. Various products now on the market, their makers promise, will save you money, keep you comfortable during heatwaves, or transform your relationship with the walls of your home. But is it all too good to be true?",
      "Unpaint is due to launch in the US this November, and Mr Botero is convinced that there is a market for the stuff. He argues it will appeal to people living in rented accommodation, who can\u2019t make permanent changes to their decor.",
      "Glasst, unsurprisingly, declines to share details about how it makes the paint, but Mr Botero says it is a resin from a renewable source. I ask if he means trees and he confirms.",
      "Peelable paint already exists for car bodywork, but getting such a product to work reliably on softer home interiors is more challenging.",
      "There is a risk of damaging your existing, underlying paint when you eventually wrest Unpaint off your walls, but, if the permanent paint below is in good condition, this shouldn\u2019t happen, says Mr Botero.",
      "It does have an odd texture: \u201cA little bit rubbery,\" says Mr Botero. Plus, it is easier to scratch than water-based emulsion.",
      "Bringing the product to market hasn\u2019t been easy. Glasst posted a video about the paint to YouTube two years ago, but the launch was delayed until this year \u201cto align with the correct funding and resources needed,\u201d says Mr Botero.",
      "He mentions that Glasst is working on other coatings with unusual properties \u2013 including \u201cThermglasst\u201d, an insulating resin due to launch next year. Mr Botero claims that less than a millimetre of this coating will provide the same insulating effect as 40 millimetres of foam.",
      "There\u2019s no independent validation of that claim just yet, but there are already a range of insulating paints on the market that promise to reduce your heating bills and, it is fair to note, they have not always performed well in scientific evaluations.",
      "In 2019, Richard Fitton of the University of Salford and colleagues published a paper in which they investigated the efficacy of six thermal paints available on the UK market at the time. In short, they found that claims that such paints could reduce heating bills by up to 20% or 25% were impossible to validate.",
      "First, the researchers coated boards with the paints, which allowed them to measure the coatings\u2019 thermal resistance, or insulating values. Then, the team calculated the reduction in heating costs you would expect after applying each of these paints to the interior of a typical Victorian terraced house.",
      "The biggest cost saving measured was a mere 2.9%, and, given the price of the paints in question, homeowners would potentially have to wait centuries or even up to a millennium \u2013 at 2019 prices \u2013 before they would recoup the decorating fees in terms of reduced heating costs.",
      "\u201cIf someone brought me a paint that could save me 25% of my energy bill, it would be on my wall by the weekend,\u201d says Prof Fitton. He adds that he is currently working on a follow-up paper to the 2019 study, and would also be open to testing Thermglasst, or any other insulating paint, in the future.",
      "Paints that help to keep your house cool might be more effective. For years, researchers have pursued the idea of improving the reflectivity of paint on exterior walls or roofs, since this could help keep buildings cool on hot, sunny days. Such weather is becoming ever more common due to climate change.",
      "The principle is as old as the hills \u2013 consider the white painted houses of the Mediterranean. But paints designed to be significantly more reflective than standard white paint could heighten the effect. i2Cool in Hong Kong is one of several firms marketing such a product at present.",
      "In their case, the paint contains tiny nanoparticles inspired by the extremely reflective body of the Saharan silver ant \u2013 which must naturally cope with baking sunshine.",
      "Martin Zhu, chief executive and co-founder, says the paint made by i2Cool was tested on the roof of a shopping mall in Hong Kong \u2013 but only on one of its two buildings, in order to find out whether there was a noticeable effect in terms of reducing the costs of running that building\u2019s air conditioning (AC).",
      "\u201cWe used a power meter to measure the energy consumption of the AC system,\u201d says Dr Zhu. The cost of running the AC duly fell in the painted building, by 40%, he adds.",
      "Dr Zhu first began working on the paint while a doctoral student, and he mentions that early versions made around 2017 contained silver, which made it very expensive \u2013 more than $100,000 just to cover a small area. Years of development later, it now costs around $10 per square metre of coverage. It also now comes in a variety of light colours, including grey, yellow and green.",
      "Researchers have noted that highly reflective coatings for passive cooling applications need to be resistant to dirt and soiling, for example, to avoid their efficacy dropping overt time. And glare from ultra-reflective roofs risks heating up nearby darker structures, a 2020 paper suggested.",
      "The paint from i2Cool does not contain heavy metals and uses a water-based emulsion, and while it is not biodegradable, it can be recycled, says Dr Zhu.",
      "The company\u2019s latest major project is the Dubai Mall. The roof of this sprawling complex \u2013 the largest mall in the world by total area \u2013 will eventually be fully coated with the paint. A 1,000 sq m section has been completed to date.",
      "While not yet available in Europe, that could change, says Dr Zhu. \u201cWe are discussing with some distributors in the UK,\u201d he says.",

      "At the wheel of an ambulance, Samir El Chekieh drives with sirens wailing to the latest Israeli air strike in El Karak in the Bekaa Valley, eastern Lebanon.",
      "The 32-year-old firefighter and paramedic with the Lebanese Civil Defense Force (CDF) only got a few hours' sleep last night. It is now the middle of the afternoon and he still hasn\u2019t had breakfast.",
      "Since the escalation of the war between Israel and the Shia Muslim Hezbollah, the men and women of the CDF see little rest, and brace themselves for a mass casualty incident every day.",
      "This article contains graphic descriptions",
      "It is starkly different from the last war with Israel in 2006, Samir says. \u201cWe didn't have those kind of air strikes. Recently, a fire station was hit, and a church in the south, and our humanitarian colleagues have been killed.\u201d",
      "CDF workers say civilians, including women and children, are increasingly among the dead and injured when they attend a call out.",
      "The war between Israel and Hezbollah is spreading deeper and wider across Lebanon.",
      "An intense bombing campaign has broadened far beyond the country\u2019s southern border villages and the capital Beirut, to towns in the fertile Bekaa and the historic city of Baalbek, principally Shia areas, where Hezbollah was founded. The port cities of Sidon and Tyre have also seen an increase in attacks.",
      "Israel says it is only targeting Hezbollah fighters, weapons and infrastructure. Since its campaign against the militant group escalated, Israel estimates it has destroyed two-thirds of Hezbollah\u2019s rocket and missile stockpile.",
      "But Hezbollah is still firing rockets daily towards Israel.",
      "The BBC spent two weeks with Civil Defense Force crews in the Bekaa Valley, which stretches eastwards to the border with Syria. Permission from Hezbollah was required to visit the scene of Israeli attacks.",
      "In that time, the number and frequency of strikes in the area dramatically increased.",
      "On 28 October, there were more than 100 Israeli strikes, and in the past week alone 160 people were killed in the Bekaa, according to official figures. The Lebanese government does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.",
      "Samir and his men arrive in the Shia village of El Karak to find chaos and destruction - the air is thick with smoke and dust.",
      "Earlier at their station in the nearby city of Zahle, they had heard a powerful explosion - and from their balcony seen a plume of smoke in the distance. They jumped into their fire trucks and ambulances and headed straight there.",
      "A woman in chador sits on the pavement begging to be let into the smoking ruins of an apartment block, but men reason with her to stay put. It is too dangerous, a second Israeli air strike could be coming.",
      "The first body they find is of a man, blown across the ground by the explosion.",
      "There are survivors underneath the pancaked floors of the apartments and Samir goes deep in the rubble. He is not wearing plastic protective gloves as fire is still blazing inside, so when he finds a child, he can feel shattered bones beneath his fingertips. As he carefully retrieves the child, he realises it is only half a body.",
      "\u201cThe first victim I found was a child. I don't know if it's a girl or a boy,\u201d he tells me afterwards. \u201cSorry to explain that. But it's from the stomach and up - from stomach and down there is nothing.\u201d",
      "In the past, the CDF crew have received phone calls telling them to evacuate a site they are attending. They assume they are from the Israelis. No such call comes on this day, so for an hour Samir and others dig deeper into the ruin.",
      "Eventually they find a 10-year-old girl alive. She tells the rescuers that her eight-month-old brother, Mohammed, was next to her.",
      "\u201cAfter that, we started hearing the screaming of a small child,\u201d Samir says.",
      "Through a small crevice in the rubble they spot the trapped boy, trying to move his legs, his babygrow and a single blue sock visible to the rescue crew. They painstakingly remove the debris around him and he is gently cradled in Samir\u2019s hands and brought to safety. Mohammed is now being treated in Iraq for the head injury he suffered, his family says.",
      "The CDF works across Lebanon\u2019s sectarian divide. It does not discriminate, says Samir, who is Christian and is the head of operations at the station in Zahle - a predominantly Christian town, dominated by a statue of the Virgin Mary, which rises 54m above a hilltop.",
      "\u201cWe don't ask the sex of the victim. We don't ask if he's black, white. We don't ask if he's Christian or Muslim. We are humanitarians,\u201d Samir says.",
      "The UN estimates that every day in October at least one child was killed and 10 were injured in Israeli attacks. Those losses, combined with those of their colleagues killed in strikes, are taking their toll on Samir and his men.",
      "Almost 24 hours after they left the El Karak site, a second Israeli attack brought down the rest of the apartment building.",
      "In the early evenings, Hezbollah still fires rockets from nearby hillsides, targeting Israel. One salvo of at least six projectiles causes a brush fire near Zahle.",
      "In the town of Khodor, the Hezbollah flag is planted on the ruins of one of the many buildings that have been flattened by Israeli bombs. Children\u2019s toys have been arranged at its base. A large red Shia flag flaps in the wind nearby - it is almost the only sound in the largely abandoned town.",
      "With a bandaged head, Jawad Hamzeh takes me through the rubble of his home.",
      "His three daughters died in the attack, including 24-year-old Nada who was pregnant. He holds up another daughter\u2019s law books, she was studying to be a lawyer.",
      "There were no militants here, he says. \u201cWhere are the missiles, do you see them?\u201d he asks.",
      "The Iranian-backed Hezbollah began attacking Israel on 8 October 2023 in solidarity with its ally Hamas, which had carried out a devastating attack on Israel the day before. Months of cross-border exchanges followed, and then, in late September this year, Israel assassinated Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Hassan Nassrallah, and followed that with a ground invasion.",
      "Hezbollah is committed to Israel\u2019s destruction, but it is more than a militant group. It is the most powerful political force in Lebanon and a social movement which serves as a bulwark for Lebanon\u2019s long-discriminated Shia communities against other sects in the country.",
      "Tens of thousands of Israelis have been displaced by the year-long war. By attacking Hezbollah on multiple fronts, Israel hopes to degrade the group and let its people return home.",
      "Despite US-led ceasefire talks, neither side appears willing to back down.",
      "On 30 October, the Israeli military issued an evacuation order in the Bekaa city of Baalbek, which the UN described as the \u201clargest forced movement Lebanon has experienced in a single day\u201d since the start of the conflict. As many as 150,000 people were given only hours to flee another Israeli assault.",
      "There, not far from the magnificent Roman ruins with its towering temple of Bacchus, I met Hussein Nassereldine, 42, whose home had been destroyed in an Israeli strike the night before.",
      "\u201cNo terrorist or bad person lived here,\u201d he says. \u201cAll who lived here were decent people.\u201d He says it was home to families who had fled Beirut in 1982 during the country\u2019s civil war, including his own. \u201cWe were born here and lived here, and we will stay and won\u2019t leave here,\u201d he says.",
      "As I leave, men with pickaxes and shovels are making slow progress in the rubble and Hussein prepares to erect a tent on what was left of his home.",
      "Outside the city, at the Dar Al Amal hospital, the injured are recovering from Baalbek\u2019s deadliest day. Of the 63 people killed, two thirds of those were women and children according to the local governor. Israel says it struck 110 Hezbollah-linked targets.",
      "In a bare room, filled only with screams, three-year-old Selin\u2019s tiny hand reaches out for comfort. But there is no-one there. She has burns to her face, a fractured leg and wounds to her groin and side. Her mother, father, two sisters and brother were all killed in the Israeli air strike that left her broken and alone.",
      "Across the corridor of the intensive care unit, two-year-old Kayan Smeha has a fractured skull. His mother, Najat, 24, kisses him gently on his cheek and cradles him to quieten him.",

      "Gallant posted on social media that the \"security of the state of Israel was and will always remain the mission of my life\".",
      "The sacking has already prompted protests on the streets of Tel Aviv and political opposition leaders have called for wider public demonstrations.",
      "Netanyahu and Gallant have long had a divisive working relationship. Prior to the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, Netanyahu in March that year had fired Gallant over political differences before reinstating him following major public outcry.",
      "Since Israel began its military offensive against Hamas in Gaza, Gallant has been a key senior figure of the campaign.",
      "But on Tuesday Netanyahu said in a statement: \"In the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and the minister of defence.",
      "\"Unfortunately, although in the first months of the campaign there was such trust and there was very fruitful work, during the last months this trust cracked between me and the minister of defence.\"",
      "Netanyahu said that \"significant gaps were discovered between me and Gallant in the management of the campaign\".",
      "\"These gaps were accompanied by statements and actions that contradict the decisions of the government and the decisions of the cabinet,\" he added.",
      "Following his firing, Gallant only posted a short message on X, stating that the  security of Israel \"was and will always remain the mission of my life\".",
      "Katz will succeed Gallant as defence minister, while Gideon Sa'ar - who previously held no cabinet portfolio- becomes the new foreign minister, Netanyahu said.",
      "Gallant's removal will come into effect in 48 hours. The appointment of the new ministers requires the approval of the government and then the Knesset.",
      "Netanyahu first fired Gallant in March 2023 following their disagreement over controversial plans to overhaul the justice system.",
      "But he was forced to retract the sacking following massive public protests in several cities in Israel - an event that became known as \"Gallant Night.\"",
      "In May this year, Gallant voiced open frustration at the government\u2019s failure to address the question of a post-war plan for Gaza. Gallant wanted Netanyahu to declare publicly that Israel has no plans to take over civilian and military rule in Gaza.",
      "It was a rare public sign of divisions within Israel's war cabinet over the direction of the military campaign.",

      "Experts have pointed to the impact of the Covid pandemic as one possible reason for the drop.",

      "The results come after a separate survey earlier this year found that nearly half of marriages in Japan are sexless.",

      "Some researchers have suggested the population - currently at 125 million people - could fall to less than 53 million by the end of the century. A range of other contributing factors have been marked out as possible contributing factors - including rising living costs, more women in education and work, as well as greater access to contraception, leading to women choosing to have fewer children",

      "Named LignoSat, after the Latin word for wood, its panels have been built from a type of magnolia tree, using a traditional technique without screws or glue.",
      "Researchers at Kyoto University who developed it hope it may be possible in the future to replace some metals used in space exploration with wood.",
      "\"Wood is more durable in space than on Earth because there's no water or oxygen that would rot or inflame it,\" Kyoto University forest science professor Koji Murata told Reuters news agency.",
      "\"Early 1900s airplanes were made of wood,\" Prof Murata said. \"A wooden satellite should be feasible, too.\"",
      "If trees could one day be planted on the Moon or Mars, wood might also provide material for colonies in space in the future, the researchers hope.",
      "Along with its wood panels, LignoSat also incorporates traditional aluminium structures and electronic components. It has sensors on board to monitor how its wood reacts to the extreme environment of space during the six months it will orbit the Earth.",
      "Dr Simeon Barber, a space research scientist at the Open University in the UK, said: \"We have to be clear that this is not a satellite completely made of wood... but the basic premise behind the idea is really interesting.",
      "\"From a sustainability point of view, wood is a material that can be grown and is therefore renewable,\" he told the BBC.",

      "\"There's nothing wrong with using wood in space - it's using the right material for the right task.\"",
      "He pointed out that wood has properties that are hard to control.",
      "\"So from an engineering point of view it's quite a difficult material to work with... I think wood's always going to have a problem to make critical structures like parts of spacecraft where you need to predict how strong it's going to be.\"",

      "Experts have warned of the increasing threat of space junk falling to Earth, as more spacecraft and satellites are launched.",
      "Dr Barber acknowledged the space industry was under growing pressure over the amount of pollution it puts into the atmosphere but he was sceptical using wooden spacecraft could provide the answer.",

      "Boeing workers in the US have voted to accept the aviation giant's latest pay offer, ending a damaging seven-week-long walkout.",
      "Under the new contract, they will get a 38% pay rise over the next four years.",
      "Striking workers can start returning to their jobs as early as Wednesday, or as late as 12 November, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) union says.",
      "The walkout by around 30,000 Boeing workers started on 13 September, leading to a dramatic slowdown at the plane maker's factories and deepening a crisis at the company.",
      "IAM said 59% of striking workers voted in favour of the new deal, which also includes a one-off $12,000 (\u00a39,300) bonus, as well as changes to workers' retirement plans.",
      "\"Through this victory and the strike that made it possible, IAM members have taken a stand for respect and fair wages in the workplace,\" union leader Jon Holden said.",
      "The union had previously called for a 40% pay increase and workers had rejected two previous offers from the company.",
      "\"While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team,\" said Boeing's chief executive Kelly Ortberg.",
      "\"There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.\"",

      "Boeing has been trying to shore up its finances and end the strike, which has now cost it nearly $10bn, according to consulting firm Anderson Economic Group.",
      "In October, its commercial aircraft business reported operating losses of $4bn for the three months to the end of September.",
      "Last week, the firm launched a share sale to raise more than $20bn.",
      "It came after warnings that a prolonged strike could lead to downgrades of Boeing's credit rating, which would make it more expensive for it to borrow money.",
      "Last month, the firm said it would lay off around 17,000 workers, with the first redundancy notices expected to be issued in mid-November.",
      "The latest crisis at Boeing erupted in January with a dramatic mid-air blowout of a piece of one of its passenger planes.",
      "Its space business also suffered a reputational hit after its Starliner vessel was forced to return to Earth without carrying astronauts."

      "In the immediate aftermath of the floods, Valencia regional leader Carlos Maz\u00f3n of the conservative People\u2019s Party (PP) welcomed Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and thanked him for his government\u2019s support.",
      "It was an unusual sight in the context of Spain\u2019s deeply polarised politics, with Maz\u00f3n even calling S\u00e1nchez \"dear prime minister\".",
      "Valencia's regional leader has faced criticism for taking around 12 hours to respond to a red weather warning by Spain's national meteorological office (Aemet) on 29 October and issue an alert directly to people\u2019s phones, by which time the flood was already causing enormous damage.",
      "However, the national leader of the PP, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, questioned the information provided by the Aemet, which is supervised by the central government. He also complained that the prime minister's administration had not co-ordinated with the regional government.",
      "In the days since, pressure has mounted on Maz\u00f3n, with many commentators and political adversaries calling on him to resign for his actions on that day, as well as for eliminating the Valencia Emergency Unit (UVE) on taking office last year.",
      "In response, he has taken a more confrontational approach, in line with that of his party boss.",
      "That has included blaming the CHJ hydrographic agency, which is controlled by Madrid, for allegedly activating and then de-activating an alert on the day in question.",
      "\u201cIf the CHJ had re-activated the hydrological alert, the alarm message would have been sent immediately\u201d by the regional government, Maz\u00f3n said.",
      "The CHJ has responded by explaining that it provides data on rainfall and related matters but that it does not issue alerts of this kind.",

      "The head of the military emergency unit (UME), Javier Marcos, responded by saying that protocol dictated that the regional government had to request any such support.",
      "\u201cI can have 1,000 men at the door of the emergency but I can\u2019t go in, legally, without authorisation from the head of the emergency,\u201d he said, referring to the Valencia leader.",
      "Maz\u00f3n\u2019s comments about the military reportedly enraged the defence minister, Margarita Robles, who expressed her anger during a crisis meeting of ministers with King Felipe on Monday.",
      "Meanwhile, the political situation has been further complicated after calls by N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o for the prime minister to declare a national state of emergency, which would centralise management of the crisis in Madrid, wresting powers from Valencia\u2019s regional government.",
      "The leader of the far-right Vox party, Santiago Abascal, has also backed such a measure, which has been ruled out by the government.",
      "\u201cS\u00e1nchez is the one responsible for not activating all the state resources when lives could have been saved,\u201d he said, denouncing the \u201cevil and incompetence\u201d of the administration.",
      "The king, S\u00e1nchez and Maz\u00f3n were all hit by the blowback of public anger over the handling of the tragedy on Sunday, when people in the Valencian town of Paiporta, the worst hit by the floods, threw mud and jeered at them, calling them \u201cmurderers\u201d.",
      "As the scenes became increasingly violent, the prime minister\u2019s security detail led him away to his car. Maz\u00f3n stayed near the king and Queen Letizia, who both engaged with some of the local people in an effort to reassure them that everything possible was being done to help.",
      "While the wisdom of that visit has been widely questioned, Maz\u00f3n has since presented a \u20ac31.4bn proposal for the reconstruction of the flood-devastated areas, to be financed by the central government.",
      "S\u00e1nchez, meanwhile, has announced a separate initial aid package worth \u20ac10.6bn.",
      "\u201cWhat Spaniards want is to see their institutions, not fighting with each other, but working shoulder to shoulder,\u201d he said as he announced it."

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 00:00:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Will the new generation of Nigerian politicians deliver the change in attitudes that many had hoped for?",
    "story": [
      "Nigerian politician Alex Ikwechegh has caused outrage after he was caught on video slapping and verbally abusing a taxi driver delivering food to his house.",
      "\"Do you know who I am?... I can make you disappear in this whole country, and nothing will happen,\" Ikwechegh was heard saying in the video that went viral.",
      "The altercation apparently started after the driver asked Ikwechegh to go outside to collect the food, rather than him taking it inside.",
      "Shocked Nigerians shared the clip widely, forcing Ikwechegh, a member of the opposition All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) party who represents the south-eastern town of Aba in the House of Representatives, to issue a formal apology - a stark contrast to his arrogant and intimidating tone in the video.",
      "Unfortunately, it is common in Nigeria for officials and other \"big men\" to use their power to intimidate ordinary citizens with the familiar phrase: \"Do you know who I am?\" - a reminder of the untouchable status they believe they hold.",
      "Politicians, including many MPs, often also intimidate the public by travelling in large convoys, with police escorts and blaring sirens.",
      "Their convoys are given priority over regular traffic, with security officers sometimes reacting aggressively towards anyone who fails to make way for them.",
      "But this latest case is especially disappointing because Ikwechegh, at 42, is part of a younger generation of politicians.",
      "The \"Not Too Young to Run\" campaign was started a few years ago by civil society organisations to encourage more young people to become involved in Nigerian politics.",
      "With 70% of the country's population under 35, the initiative aimed to lower the age limits for running for office, allowing younger Nigerians to bring new ideas and a fresh approach to leadership.",
      "It succeeded in 2018, reducing the minimum age requirements for various offices and raising the number of young candidates from 6% to 27% in just one year.",
      "The age of running for the House of Representatives - the lower chamber of parliament - was reduced from 30 to 25, the Senate and governorship from 35 to 30, and president from 40 to 30.",
      "Since Nigeria's median age is only 18, many hoped younger leaders would break the old patterns of oppression and entitlement.",
      "But Ikwechegh's actions exhibit some of the same old behaviours that many young Nigerians had hoped would be left behind.",
      "Sadly, his case isn't unique. Two years ago, Nigeria's then-youngest senator, Elisha Abbo, who was 41 at the time, was filmed slapping a shop assistant after accusing her of \"insulting\" him.",
      "He threatened her with arrest, and even called over a police officer to carry it out.",
      "The incident was caught on CCTV and eventually led to Abbo, who is no longer a senator after losing elections last year, apologising. But it exposed just how deeply rooted this culture of abuse of power is.",
      "All this has left many Nigerians wondering if younger leaders are falling into the same traps as the older generation.",
      "The situation takes me back to my boarding school days, where senior students regularly bullied juniors.",
      "As juniors, my classmates and I would eagerly talk about what we'd do once it was our turn to be seniors, picturing the punishments we'd hand down to those younger than us.",
      "It felt like a right, something to look forward to - a small comfort amid the hardships of being a junior - that someday, we would be the ones with the power, not the ones on the receiving end.",
      "But by the time we made it to senior year, the school introduced new rules against bullying, and we felt robbed.",
      "We had waited our turn, and now that right was being taken from us. The school stuck with its new rules although many seniors still found ways to circumvent them.",
      "It feels like this same cycle is playing out on a national level.",
      "When a 42-year-old politician, active on social media, can slap a taxi driver - three times - on camera without a second thought, it forces us to wonder if the younger generation of politicians are simply waiting to inherit, rather than break, the cycle of privilege, whether they truly want a fresh start or are just waiting for their turn to wield power without any restraint.",
      "Nigeria's House of Representatives has referred Ikwechegh to its Ethics and Privileges Committee after he was accused of bringing it into disrepute.",
      "He has also been arraigned in court on charges of \"threats, assaults, and abuse of public office\".",
      "His behaviour is a sobering reminder that entitlement and impunity may be more deeply embedded in Nigerian culture than generational change alone can address.",

    "story": [
      "Voters in the US go to the polls on Tuesday to elect their next president.",
      "The election was initially a rematch of 2020 but it was upended in July when President Joe Biden ended his campaign and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris.",
      "The big question now is - will America get its first woman president or a second Donald Trump term?",

      "Follow live election updates",
      "All you need to know about election night",
      "When will we know who has won?",
      "Who is leading national polls?",
      "Harris has had a small lead over Trump in the national polling averages since she entered the race at the end of July and she remains ahead - as shown in the chart below with the latest figures rounded to the nearest whole number.",
      "Harris saw a bounce in her polling numbers in the first few weeks of her campaign, building a lead of nearly four percentage points towards the end of August.",
      "The polls were relatively stable in September and early October but they have tightened in the last couple of weeks, as shown in the chart below, with trend lines showing the averages and dots for individual poll results for each candidate.",
      "While national polls are a useful guide as to how popular a candidate is across the whole country, they're not the best way to predict the election result.",
      "That's because the US uses an electoral college system, in which each state is given a number of votes roughly in line with the size of its population. A total of 538 electoral college votes are up for grabs, so a candidate needs to hit 270 to win.",
      "There are 50 states in the US but because most of them nearly always vote for the same party, in reality there are just a handful where both candidates stand a chance of winning. These are the places where the election will be won and lost and are known as battleground states or swing states.",

      "What is the electoral college?",
      "Path to 270: The states Harris and Trump need to win",
      "Who is winning in swing state polls?",
      "Right now the leads in the swing states are so small that it's impossible to know who is really ahead from looking at the polling averages.",
      "Polls are designed to broadly explain how the public feels about a candidate or an issue, not predict the result of an election by less than a percentage point so it's important to keep that in mind when looking at the numbers below.",
      "It's also important to remember that the individual polls used to create these averages have a margin of error of around three to four percentage points, so either candidate could be doing better or worse than the numbers currently suggest.",
      "If you look at the trends since Harris joined the race, it does highlight some differences between the states.",
      "In Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina, the lead has changed hands a few times since the start of August but Trump has a small lead in all of them at the moment.",
      "In the three other states - Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - Harris had led since the start of August, sometimes by two or three points, but the polls tightened significantly in recent weeks and Trump has led in Pennsylvania at points.",
      "All three of those states had been Democratic strongholds before Trump turned them red on his path to winning the presidency in 2016. Biden retook them in 2020 and if Harris can do the same then she will be on course to win the election.",
      "In a sign of how the race has changed since Harris became the Democratic nominee, on the day that Biden quit the race he was trailing Trump by nearly five percentage points on average in the seven swing states.",
      "In Pennsylvania, Biden was behind by nearly 4.5 percentage points when he dropped out, as the chart below shows. It is a key state for both campaigns as it has the highest number of electoral votes of the seven and therefore winning it makes it easier to reach the 270 votes needed.",
      "How are these averages created?",
      "The figures we have used in the graphics above are averages created by polling analysis website 538, which is part of American news network ABC News. To create them, 538 collects the data from individual polls carried out both nationally and in battleground states by lots of polling companies.",
      "As part of its quality control, 538 only includes polls from companies that meet certain criteria, like being transparent about how many people they polled, when the poll was carried out and how the poll was conducted (telephone calls, text message, online, etc).",
      "You can read more about the 538 methodology here.",
      "Can we trust the polls?",
      "The polls have underestimated support for Trump in the last two elections and the national polling error in 2020 was the highest in 40 years according to a post-mortem by polling experts - so there\u2019s good reason to be cautious about them going into this year\u2019s election.",
      "The polling miss in 2016 was put down to voters changing their minds in the final days of the campaign and because college-educated voters - who were more likely to support Hillary Clinton - had been over-represented in polling samples.",
      "In 2020, the experts pointed to problems with getting Trump supporters to take part in polls, but said it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to know exactly what had caused the polling error, especially as the election was held during a pandemic and had a record turnout.",
      "Pollsters have made lots of changes since then and the polling industry \u201chad one of its most successful election cycles in US history\u201d in the 2022 midterm elections, according to analysts at 538.",
      "But Donald Trump wasn\u2019t on the ballot in the midterms and we won\u2019t know until after election day whether these changes can deal with the influx of irregular voters he tends to attract.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists believe they have found a quirky way to fight mosquito-spread diseases such as dengue, yellow fever and Zika - by turning male insects deaf so they struggle to mate and breed.",
      "Mosquitoes have sex while flying in mid-air and the males rely on hearing to chase down a female, based on her attractive wingbeats.",
      "The researchers did an experiment, altering a genetic pathway that male mosquitoes use for this hearing. The result - they made no physical contact with females, even after three days in the same cage.",
      "Female mosquitoes are the ones that spread diseases to people, and so trying to prevent them having babies would help reduce overall numbers.",
      "The team from the University of California, Santa Barbara, studied Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which spread viruses to around 400 million people a year.",
      "They closely observed the insects' aerial mating habits - that can last between a few seconds to just under a minute - and then figured out how to disrupt it using genetics.",
      "They targeted a protein called trpVa that appears to be essential for hearing.",
      "In the mutated mosquitoes, neurons normally involved in detecting sound showed no response to the flight tones or wingbeats of potential mates.",
      "The alluring noise fell on deaf ears.",
      "In contrast, wild (non-mutant) males were quick to copulate, multiple times, and fertilised nearly all the females in their cage.",
      "The researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara, who have published their work in the journal PNAS, said the effect of the gene knock-out was \"absolute\", as mating by deaf males was entirely eliminated.",
      "Dr Joerg Albert, from the University of Oldenburg in Germany, is an expert on mosquito mating and I asked him what he made of the research.",
      "He said attacking sense of sound was a promising route for mosquito control, but it needed to be studied and managed.",
      "\"The study provides a first direct molecular test, which suggests that hearing is indeed not only important for mosquito reproduction but essential.",
      "\"Without the ability of males to hear - and acoustically chase - female mosquitoes might become extinct.\"",
      "Another method being explored is releasing sterile males in areas where there are pockets of mosquito-spread diseases, he added.",
      "Although mosquitoes can carry diseases, they are an important part of the food chain - as nourishment for fish, birds, bats and frogs, for example - and some are important pollinators."

      "These two tribes exist in what appear to be parallel political ecosystems, across a deep partisan divide where opposing views are dismissed and the candidates inspire a devoted loyalty that goes beyond normal party affiliation.",
      "Voters have been given apocalpyptic warnings about what might happen if the other side wins. They've been told this election is about far more than who sits in the Oval Office for the next four years. Many believe it is an existential event that could have disastrous consequences.",

    "story": [
      "On Tuesday, Betsy Linkhorst, 18, will cast her very first vote not just for who should be in the White House, but on the issue of abortion.",
      "Her home state of Florida is one of 10 across the country that will have abortion on the ballot this election.",
      "If passed, Florida's measure - Amendment 4 - would overturn the six-week abortion ban currently in effect here and expand access to the point of foetal viability, which is about 24 weeks of pregnancy. It could also be later \"when necessary to protect the patient\u2019s health\", according to the measure's wording.",
      "Ms Linkhorst, who said she was \u201cnervous\u201d about living in a state with limited abortion access, told the BBC she was going to vote yes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to vote based on our rights,\u201d she said of her vote both for Kamala Harris and for expanding abortion access in Florida. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the government\u2019s right to police women\u2019s bodies.\u201d",

      "Election polls - is Harris or Trump ahead?",
      "The state was, for over a year, one of the last places that women in the southern part of the country could get a legal abortion, up to 15 weeks. But in May, Florida enacted an even more restrictive law, which banned abortions after six weeks - with few exceptions - which is before most women know they are pregnant.",
      "Polls suggest a majority of Florida voters are backing Amendment 4. But the amendment must reach a 60% threshold to pass \u2013 and surveys are indicating that while it has strong support, the campaign might not quite meet that bar in the fairly conservative state.",
      "If it did pass, that would be viewed as a huge victory for the abortion-rights movement.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the hardest place in the country to win,\u201d said Kelly Hall, a strategist who works on abortion rights ballot measures and executive director of the Fairness Project. \u201cIf we overcome that particular barrier, there\u2019s absolutely nothing holding us back from passing ballot measures everywhere it\u2019s legal.\u201d",

      "This is the first presidential election held since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, giving states the right to regulate abortion themselves. Since then, 17 states have enacted bans that restrict nearly all abortions within their borders.",
      "During the 2022 midterms, held months after the top court's decision, voters in conservative states Kentucky and Kansas voted against restricting abortion, sending a message that access to the procedure is broadly supported by the American people. The issue is also credited with helping the Democrats do better than expected in congressional races.",
      "Now, Democrats hope again that abortion measures in key battleground states like Arizona and Nevada will drive their voters to the polls to back abortion rights \u2013 and while they\u2019re at it, propel Vice-President Harris to the White House and their down-ballot candidates to victory.",
      "In a sign of how salient the issue of abortion has been for voters, Republican White House nominee Donald Trump, a resident of Florida, has tried to back away from his once-hardline stance against abortion. Now, he says he thinks the decision on how it should be regulated ought to be left up to states, and voters.",
      "Last August in an interview with NBC, he seemed to indicate he would vote in favour of Amendment 4. But after outcry from his anti-abortion supporters, he said he would vote against it.",

    "summary": "He was in a gang as a child but became Michael Jackson and Frank Sinatra's favourite collaborator.",
    "story": [
      "Quincy Jones lived for 50 years after attending his own memorial service.",
      "When the musician suffered a brain aneurysm in 1974, his chances of survival were said to be so slim, and his stature so high, that his famous friends started planning a tribute concert.",
      "Then aged 41, Jones had already made an indelible mark on American music as a performer, arranger, songwriter, producer, soundtrack composer and record executive.",
      "He started out in the jumping jazz clubs of the 1950s; mastered soul, swing and pop on recordings by Dinah Washington, Frank Sinatra and Lesley Gore; and reached the top 10 in his own right.",
      "Some of the biggest entertainers in America agreed to perform at his memorial.",
      "When he pulled through, the show went ahead anyway.",
      "Jones went along, accompanied by his neurologist, who gave strict instructions not to get too excited.",
      "\"That was hard to do with Richard Pryor, Marvin Gaye, Sarah Vaughan and Sidney Poitier singing your praises,\" he told Newsweek in 2008.",
      "Even more exciting things were yet to come.",
      "Jones went on to forge an era-defining partnership with Michael Jackson; oversee 1985's We Are the World, one of the biggest-selling songs of all time; craft hits for acts like Chaka Khan and Donna Summer; and work with the biggest names in hip-hop.",
      "Few branches of American popular music were immune to his influence.",
      "Jones had always been a survivor.",
      "He grew up in the shadow of the Great Depression in the 1930s on the South Side of Chicago. His mother was taken to a psychiatric institution when he was seven and his father worked as a carpenter for notorious gangsters the Jones Boys.",
      "Young Quincy wanted to be a gangster too. \"You want to be what you see, and that's all we ever saw,\" he said.",
      "He and his brother were \"street rats\" and, when he strayed into the wrong neighbourhood at the age of seven, a rival gang member \"nailed my hand to a fence\". Another injury came from an ice pick to the face.",
      "His father took the family to Washington state, where one night Quincy and some friends broke into a community centre, looking for food. Inside, there was a piano.",
      "\"I touched it and every cell in my body said, this is what you'll do [for] the rest of your life,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Front Row in 2016.",
      "The encounter \"changed my life\", he said in conversation with rapper Kendrick Lamar for a 2018 Netflix documentary, adding that, \"I would have been dead or in prison a long time ago\" if he hadn't discovered music.",
      "Quincy immediately began experimenting with instruments at school, settling on the trumpet, and began playing in nightclubs.",
      "At the age of 14, he made friends with another then-unknown musician called Ray Charles, who became a lifelong collaborator.",
      "He also played with Billie Holiday at 14, and got taken under the wings of bandleader Count Basie and trumpeter Clark Terry. He went on to accompany Dizzy Gillespie and appeared in the band during Elvis Presley's first TV appearance.",
      "After showing a talent for arranging songs while touring the world with Lionel Hampton's big band, he was soon in demand in that capacity, too.",
      "But after running up a $145,000 debt on a European tour, he took a day job with Mercury Records in 1961, becoming the first African-American vice-president of a major record label.",
      "While there, he discovered and produced the million-selling single It's My Party by Lesley Gore. He also released the Big Band Bossa Nova compilation album, which included his own infectious track Soul Bossa Nova, which has since become a staple of parties and film soundtracks, including Austin Powers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sinatra had been impressed with Jones's work and called on him to arrange and conduct two of his albums in the 1960s. The pair formed a fertile partnership, with Sinatra calling him \"a giant\" and \"one of the finest musicians I've ever known\".",
      "The pair became firm friends outside the studio, too. \"Seven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying,\" Jones recalled.",
      "Jones also worked with many other big names of the age, including Aretha Franklin, Louis Armstrong and Sammy Davis Jr, while his solo album Body Heat reached the US top 10.",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "Quincy Jones, giant of US music, has died aged 91",
      "Meanwhile, he was forging a career writing soundtracks for TV shows and films including In Cold Blood, The Italian Job and Roots.",
      "In Cold Blood's author Truman Capote reportedly tried to have Jones removed from the film because he was black. But he remained, and the score earned Jones the first of seven Oscar nominations.",
      "Another soundtrack was The Wiz, the 1978 film musical version of the Wizard of Oz, which starred Diana Ross and a 19-year-old Michael Jackson, who was looking to branch out after finding childhood fame in The Jackson 5.",
      "Jones saw a superstar quality in Jackson and became his producer and mentor, first on 1979's Off the Wall, which was a major hit, and then 1982's Thriller, which reached new heights of commercial and critical success, and made Jackson the undisputed King of Pop.",
      "The album was not just the fulfilment of Jackson's talent, but the culmination of Jones's career, as he used his peerless musical expertise to define the 1980s with a sleek and polished fusion of R&B and pop.",
      "Jones listened to hundreds of songs to decide which nine should go on the album, and employed a dream team of musicians and songwriters that he had been assembling over the years.",
      "His choice of collaborators was one example of his knack for knowing how to make a good song great. For Beat It, he thought the single needed a rockier edge, so he recruited Eddie Van Halen to contribute a guitar solo. Legend has it that the solo was so explosive that a speaker caught fire in the studio.",
      "And when it came to the title track, Jones didn't like the original name Starlight, so he asked its writer, Rod Temperton, to come up with something different. Temperton renamed it Thriller and recast it with a spooky theme. Jones topped it off by asking his wife's friend, horror actor Vincent Price, to record a spoken-word outro.",
      "The album earned Jones and Jackson the Grammy Award for producer of the year, while Thriller was named album of the year and Beat It won record of the year.",
      "Jones used his winning formula in the 1980s with George Benson, Donna Summer and Patti Austin, and produced the decade's best-selling single when Jackson and Lionel Richie assembled 35 of America's biggest names for the 1985 charity song We Are the World.",
      "Jones famously posted a message on the studio entrance telling the stars: \"Check your egos at the door\".",
      "He had further success under his own name with his albums The Dude and Back on the Block. The latter, released in 1989, featured an all-star cast including many friends from his early career like Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Ray Charles.",
      "But as well as revisiting his past, he was also firmly in the present, enlisting rappers like Ice-T and Grandmaster Melle Mel to appear on the title track.",
      "It earned Jones another album of the year award at the Grammys.",
      "Although he was in his 50s, he embraced rap music because he saw similarities with the energy of bebop jazz, and because may of its stars had risen out of hardship on the streets.",
      "\"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "And rap stars reciprocated his affection, looking on Jones as an inspirational elder statesman of black American music. Even Kendrick and Dr Dre were awestruck when meeting him for the Netflix documentary, which was titled Quincy and directed by his daughter, actress Rashida Jones.",
      "Jones used his status to try to stem the violence in the hip-hop world, convening the Quincy Jones Hip-Hop Symposium in 1995, where he addressed a room full of the nation's rap stars.",
      "\"I want to see you guys live at least to my age,\" he told them.",
      "For Jones, social activism went hand-in-hand with his music.",
      "He met Martin Luther King in 1955, and \"from then on, my life was never the same\", he said.",
      "\"Civil rights work and political involvement was no longer an activity to do on the side. It became an essential part of life and humanity.\"",
      "He set up the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation and launched the We Are the Future project, among support for other causes.",
      "Elsewhere, his redoubtable work ethic saw him launch a record label and hip-hop magazine Vibe, as well as producing films like The Color Purple and TV shows including The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.",
      "With that workload, and an accompanying longstanding drink problem, his family life and his health both suffered.",
      "He married and divorced three times, having a nervous breakdown after splitting from third wife Peggy Lipton. To recover, he went to stay on the Pacific island owned by actor Marlon Brando, whom he first met in a jazz club at the age of 18.",
      "Jones was also in a relationship with actress and model Nastassja Kinski in the 1990s, and he had seven children in total.",
      "In 2015, he went into a diabetic coma for four days, and the following year went to hospital with a blood clot.",
      "His death on Sunday at the age of 91 has left the music world in mourning.",
      "If there's to be a second Quincy Jones memorial concert, stars will be queuing up to celebrate the full achievements of a singular talent."

    "summary": "Start-up firms are looking for ways to dye clothes using less water and heat.",
    "story": [
      "In a small corner of rural Taiwan, set amongst other dye houses and small factories, the start-up Alchemie Technology is in the final phase of rolling out a project it claims will upend the global apparel industry and slash its carbon footprint.",
      "The UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\u2019s first digital dyeing process.",
      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",
      "NTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\u2019s interview request.",
      "Kirsi Niinim\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \u201cquite promising\u201d \u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.",
      "But even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.",
      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",
      "The company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.",
      "They will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.",
      "Big fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.",
      "And that\u2019s just one company - there will be many, many more in need.",

      "Online bidding has started and will continue through Dec. 7, Heritage Auctions in Dallas announced in a news release Monday.",
      "The auction company received the sequin-and-bead-bedazzled slippers from Michael Shaw, the memorabilia collector who originally owned the footwear at the heart of the beloved 1939 musical. Shaw had loaned the shoes in 2005 to the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota.",
      "That summer, someone smashed through a display case and stole the slippers. Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018.",
      "\"It's become an infamous thing for us,\" said Janie Heitz, executive director of the Judy Garland Museum. \"We will forever be known as a place where the ruby slippers were stolen, which comes with a lot of bad but can also come with some good because it put us on the map.\"",
      "Now the museum is among those vying for the slippers, which were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only four remain.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 13:31:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music legend who collaborated with everyone from Michael Jackson to Frank Sinatra, has died at 91, his family announced.",
    "story": [
      "Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson's historic \"Thriller\" album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.",
      "Jones' publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family.",
      "\"Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones' passing,\" the family said in a statement. \"And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.",
      "\"He is truly one of a kind and we will miss him dearly; we take comfort and immense pride in knowing that the love and joy, that were the essence of his being, was shared with the world through all that he created. Through his music and his boundless love, Quincy Jones' heart will beat for eternity.\"",
      "Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary music catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song.",
      "For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who didn't own at least one record with his name on it or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who didn't have some connection to him.",
      "Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for \"Roots\" and \"In the Heat of the Night,\" organized President Bill Clinton's first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of \"We Are the World,\" the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa.",
      "Lionel Richie, who co-wrote \"We Are the World\" and was among its featured singers, would call Jones \"the master orchestrator.\"",
      "Jones' work with Michael Jackson",
      "In a career that began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 RPM, the top honors he received are likely the ones for his productions with Jackson: \"Off the Wall,\" \"Thriller\" and \"Bad\" were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones' versatility and imagination helped set off Jackson's explosive talent as he transformed from child star to the \"King of Pop.\" On such classic tracks as \"Billie Jean\" and \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,\" Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For \"Thriller,\" some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing \"Beat It\" and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.",
      "\"Thriller\" sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles' \"Greatest Hits 1971-1975\" among others as the best-selling album of all time.",
      "\"If an album doesn't do well, everyone says 'it was the producers fault'; so if it does well, it should be your 'fault,' too,\" Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. \"The tracks don't just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.\"",
      "The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography \"Q\", including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for \"Roots.\" He also received France's Legion d'Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, \"Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones\" and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author.",
      "Music as Jones' savior",
      "Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, once telling Oprah Winfrey that \"There are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don't. Nothing's in between.\" Jones' mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem \"senseless\" for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting.",
      "\"They nailed my hand to a fence with a switchblade, man,\" he told the AP in 2018, showing a scar from his childhood.",
      "Music saved him. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano.",
      "\"I went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,\" he wrote in his autobiography. \"That's where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.\"",
      "Within a few years, he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band.",
      "\"We had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,\" Jones later told Musician magazine. \"That's when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.\"",
      "Jones, the businessman",
      "As a music executive, he overcame racial barriers by becoming a vice president at Mercury Records in the early '60s. In 1971, he became the first Black musical director for the Academy Awards ceremony. The first movie he produced, \"The Color Purple,\" received 11 Oscar nominations in 1986 but, to his great disappointment, no wins.",
      "In a partnership with Time Warner, he created Quincy Jones Entertainment, which included the pop-culture magazine Vibe and Qwest Broadcasting. The company was sold for $270 million in 1999.",
      "\"My philosophy as a businessman has always come from the same roots as my personal credo: Take talented people on their own terms and treat them fairly and with respect, no matter who they are or where they come from,\" Jones wrote in his autobiography.",
      "Jones, the epitome of versatility",
      "He was at ease with virtually every form of American music, whether setting Sinatra's \"Fly Me to the Moon\" to a punchy, swinging rhythm and wistful flute or opening his production of Charles' soulful \"In the Heat of the Night\" with a lusty tenor sax solo. He worked with jazz giants (Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, Duke Ellington), rappers (Snoop Dogg, LL Cool J), crooners (Sinatra, Tony Bennett), pop singers (Lesley Gore) and rhythm and blues stars (Chaka Khan, rapper and singer Queen Latifah).",
      "On \"We are the World\" alone, performers included Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen. He co-wrote hits for Jackson - \"P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing)\" - and Donna Summer - \"Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger) - and had songs sampled by Tupac Shakur, Kanye West and other rappers. He even composed the theme song for the sitcom \"Sanford and Son.\"",

    "story": [
      "For 42-year-old Kieran Culkin, visiting the building in Manhattan's Yorkville neighborhood where he spent the first eight years of his life brings back unusual memories. \"I remember my mom baking a cake and it would come out slanted because the whole apartment was on a slant,\" he said. \"We used to put cars on one end of the kitchen and let go and see them roll!",
      "\"We lived in a tight space where it was just seven of us running around. It was like a sort of little wolf-pack mentality,\" he said.",
      "His father \"Kit,\" himself a former actor, and mother Patricia, a telephone operator, raised their seven kids in a four-room apartment. Kieran came fourth in the birth order. \"Whenever the door would open to let the kids in, I used to stand aside and make sure, and I used to count to make sure all six of them got in before I got in,\" he said. \"That's how I remember growing up, too, was I couldn't fall asleep until they all fell asleep. Like, I only existed because they did around me.\"",
      "He got into acting because neighbors of theirs ran an off-off-Broadway theater on the Upper East Side: \"And they knew that there was this family that had a bunch of kids. And whenever they needed a kid they were like, 'Uhm, you know, we might need a kid for this show.' And my parents were more or less like, 'Okay, yeah, what gender? What age? We got a whole bunch.'\"",
      "Soon enough, Macaulay, two years older than Kieran, became world famous as the star of \"Home Alone.\" Kieran also had a small role in that movie, and a year later played Steve Martin's son in \"Father of the Bride.\"",
      "Kieran was cute and charismatic. But making it as a grownup actor meant learning how to act. He says when he was 18 and starring in the movie \"Igby Goes Down,\" the director, Burr Steers, wanted to break him of his \"kid acting habits\" \u2013 to unlearn the tricks that had served him so well as a child.",
      "\"He really didn't like kid actors, and he was like, 'You still have a few bad habits,'\" Culkin said. \"He was like, 'You're doing something with your eyes.' He would say, 'Soulful eyes.' Or sometimes he would say, you know, 'That was Nickelodeon,' or something like that. 'You're doing kid stuff.'\"",
      "And when that didn't work, \"He bought me a six-pack of beer and he goes, 'I want you to take this beer and do the scene in front of the mirror.' And I was like, 'I don't think I can do that \u2026 I'm gonna be too self-conscious.' He goes, 'That's what the beer's for.'\"",
      "Culkin got praise for \"Igby.\" But he wasn't sure he wanted to keep acting. For one thing, he was worried about becoming famous. \"Definitely. I feel like any rational person [who] got to experience fame second-hand, they would not pursue it. It's not a nice thing.\"",
      "His brother, Macauley, has become an international movie star at a young age. \"And I saw that and went, 'Oh, I got it. That's awful. Let's never do that!'\"",
      "Kieran worked on stage and only sporadically on film for years, before landing the part he's best known for: Roman Roy, the filterless, fast-talking middle child scheming to inherit a media empire in \"Succession.\"",
      "Even as a member of the fictional Roy family, though, Culkin's real family played a role. Back in 2008, his older sister, Dakota Culkin, was struck and killed by an automobile. He said, \"After a couple seasons on 'Succession,' I realized there was some stuff that Roman did that I was like, 'Oh, that's my sister. That was her sense of humor.' She could find exactly what the right thing to make fun of you was that would get to you, but be really funny and make the room laugh. That was her.\"",
      "Sixteen years later, the loss of his sister is still devastating. \"I only knew who I was because of who my siblings are,\" Kieran said. \"So, to lose one was losing a big piece of myself. Losing one of my favorite people in the world, it doesn't get easier. But you get used to it.\"",
      "Culkin's newest project is also about family. In the movie \"A Real Pain,\" he and Jesse Eisenberg (who wrote and directed) play cousins on a trip to Poland to see where their late beloved grandmother was raised \u2013 and the concentration camp she survived.",
      "Culkin's character, Benji, is a charming but rudderless man-child \u2026 a contrast to Eisenberg's straitlaced family man.",

      "Indeed, Culkin is not \"that guy.\" He's been married to his wife Jazz for 11 years. The couple has two children.",
      "Asked what he likes about being a dad, Culkin said, \"Oh, man, everything. Everything except dinnertime. Dinnertime's a terror. I've seen some kids sit and eat dinner, it's great. My kids sit and eat breakfast, they'll eat lunch, but dinner is just throwing things around the house, and it's very stressful.\"",
      "Kieran Culkin may be at the top of his game, but he says he's still figuring it out.",
      "\"There's different versions of success. I think for many years success, for me, was, like, working on projects I really like [that] nobody really sees. Fly under the radar, but keep getting to do what I do. And now I'm like, 'Well, now I gotta figure out how to do the jobs I want but also make money.' It's really hard to find the way to do that!\"",

      "The faint of heart should think twice before setting foot in a haunted house for Halloween. The same could be said for those considering getting into business of running a haunted house.",
      "\"The barriers of entry are so much higher to get into the haunted house attraction business \u2014 rules, regulations and the expense to get in, even what people perceive as entertainment,\" said Billy Messina, co-creator of Netherworld, an attraction that has been scaring people in Stone Mountain, Georgia, for nearly 30 years. \"A bunch of teenagers that say 'Boo!' \u2014 that won't fly anymore,\" Messina told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Unlike the haunted house fundraisers run by civic organizations such as the United States Junior Chamber, also known as the Jaycees, Netherworld is among the dozen or so haunted houses that can be likened to full-scale Broadway productions. And, unlike the neighborhood house that is haunted by volunteers, these Halloween attractions are professional outfits staffed throughout the year, even though the window to turn a profit is far smaller, just a month or two around Halloween.",
      "\"Our revenue cycle is very short, the lion's share of our revenue is in a 2- to 3-month window,\" said Chris Stafford, CEO and founding partner of Thirteenth Floor Entertain Group. Based in Denver, Colorado, Thirteenth Floor operates 32 attractions including haunted houses and Halloween festivals across the country, selling hundreds of thousands of tickets each year.",

      "\"It's a tough business with a staff and a mortgage that is open all year long, and then you have 20 to 30 days to make sure you get to cover all of those basic expenses. It's a challenge,\" said Messina, who started out in the film industry as a makeup and special effects artist. Still, \"it's pretty amazing to be able to do this for a living,\" he added.",
      "Both share a passion for haunted houses that took hold in childhood.",
      "\"I worked at a local haunted house with a friend from high school. I just really loved everything about it, some of my best memories are from there,\" said Stafford, recalling his experiences as a 15-year-old working at a family-run haunted house in Denver.",
      "Growing up in New York City, Messina recalls seeing commercials on television for haunted houses on the Jersey Shore and yearning but unable to go.",
      "Like many other businesses, Messina and Stafford list labor as a huge challenge.",
      "With a full-time staff of about 15, Netherworld also hires about 500 seasonal workers as parking attendants, food and customer service employees and, of course, to scare folks. \"For new employees, the hiring push starts sometime in August, and really kicks up in mid-September. We have college students all the way up to white-collar professionals that just want to be part of it,\" said Messina.",
      "Netherworld's base pay starts at $8.50 an hour. \"People aren't there for the money, working as a scare actor,\" said Messina.",
      "Thirteenth Floor has full-time staff in marketing and finance, and \"then comes the season and we ramp up and literally hire thousands of people to work \u2014 probably the greatest challenge is staffing up a workforce that large in that short a time,\" offered Stafford. \"Most of our scare actors are not professional actors, but interested in learning,\" he added of the positions which pay just above minimum wage.",
      "A large percentage of the seasonal workforce returns each year, both men relayed.",
      "Ticket sales keep Netherworld afloat, and outside factors including the weather and sports can have an impact beyond Messina's control. \"Rain is devastating to attendance, or if the [Atlanta] Braves are in the [National Baseball League] playoffs,\" he offers as examples. \"Concessions and the gift shop are not enough to keep the lights on. We don't lose money on that stuff, but they are by no means a cash cow,\" Messina noted.",
      "Both men listed Netflix as the primary competition. \"Just getting people off the couch \u2014 it's hard,\" Stafford said, adding that Thirteenth Floor strives to give people a reason to come together socially. \"Too much of our lives are lived digitally, behind the screen,\" he said.",

      "Louise Mcloughlin found out when she was 13 that she had been conceived by a sperm donor. She said when her parents told her, it \"felt like the rug was just pulled from underneath my entire life.\"",
      "McLoughlin was raised in Dublin as an only child. When at-home genetic testing became available in 2006, she signed up, and she discovered that she had a half-sister. Not long after that, there was another match.",
      "\"I just went, oh my God. We found our biological dad,\" she told CBS News. Within a few hours McLoughlin found a website belonging to her biological father and, later that same day, she called him.",
      "\"I know I've caught you off guard,\" McLoughlin told the man on the other end of the phone line. \"I have a million questions. You may have a million questions.\"",
      "Her biological father said the call came unexpectedly, but he did acknowledge donating sperm at a clinic in London years earlier. He said he thought the donation would remain anonymous, but he told McLoughlin that he welcomed her call.",
      "\"To hear this man say, 'you're very welcome,'\" McLoughlin told CBS News, \"I feel guilty, because I know that's not the happy ending that everyone gets.\"",
      "McLoughlin now hosts a podcast called You Look Like Me, which explores the lives of donor-conceived people. Some have faced the discovery of hundreds of half-siblings.",
      "A recent Netflix documentary highlighted the case of one prolific sperm donor from the Netherlands, Jonathan Jacob Meijer, who has fathered hundreds of children. Some of his donations may have reached the United States.",
      "Meijer told CBS News he believes he has about 550 children, but admitted it could be many more. The sperm banks he's used do not need to inform him how many children have resulted from his donations.",
      "In 2023, a court in the Netherlands banned a man, identified only as Jonathan M. under Dutch privacy laws, from donating any more sperm, saying he had fathered about 550 children. The court noted that under national guidelines, donors are allowed to produce a maximum of 25 children with 12 mothers, and the judge said the man had \"deliberately lied about\" the extent of his donations \"to persuade the parents to take him as a donor.\"",
      "\"Donor conceived people have been sounding the alarm on this for years,\" McLoughlin said. \"We are seeing men who are donating hundreds and thousands of times. They're doing it in small areas. They're doing it within the same kind of years. So you're ending up with kids who are growing up knowing each other or meeting each other in later adulthood, which is just incredibly, incredibly dangerous.\"",
      "One of the dangers is that donor offspring can end up in incestuous relationships without knowing.",
      "One Connecticut woman revealed last year that she unknowingly had a relationship with her half-brother in high school, saying her mother was a victim of fertility fraud having been inseminated by her doctor with his own sperm. More than 50 fertility doctors in the U.S. have been accused of using their own sperm to inseminate patients.",
      "\"We regulate gasoline more comprehensively, driving more comprehensively. And yet, here we're actually creating lives,\" Indiana Law Professor Jody Madeira said. She's trying to get a law passed in Indiana that would make fertility fraud a felony.",
      "Madeira said the U.S. was like the Wild West compared to European countries in terms of regulating sperm donations.",
      "\"If you think that something like, a guy with a thousand kids, donor conceived kids, is possible in Europe, then the chances are exponentially higher in the United States,\" she told CBS News.",
      "There are several known prolific sperm donors in America, including New Yorker Ari Nagal, who's said he has 165 kids, and is still counting.",
      "There are no national databases tracking sperm donations in America, nor is there a legal limit on how many donations a person can make. There is also no requirement for donors to disclose genetic medical conditions that could affect offspring.",
      "Madeira said it is possible to regulate sperm donations, but \"in the United States, our cultural orientation just prioritizes the market, and the industry, and the wishes of parents. Whereas in Europe, they prioritize the rights of donor conceived individuals.\"",

    "story": [
      "The future of Medicare, America's sweeping health insurance program for older adults, continues to come up on the campaign trail from both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump during this final stretch leading up to the 2024 presidential election.",
      "This year's voting comes at a time when the 67.5 million Americans enrolled in Medicare plans are starting to see significant changes, largely resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act that Vice President Kamala Harris cast a tie-breaking vote for in 2022.",
      "Harris has touted the law's more generous prescription spending benefits for seniors, which Biden administration officials say have not resulted in feared premium spikes or cutbacks for most drug plans.",
      "Some of that \"stabilization\" is the result of billions poured into premium-lowering efforts, which Republicans have voiced frustration over as an \"election year stunt.\" Premiums for Medicare Part B are also continuing to grow, up to an estimated $185 monthly in 2025.",
      "The act has also offered some respite for lawmakers grappling with the program's long-running insolvency crisis, as spending is still outpacing the taxes that fund it. Medicare's trust fund now has until 2036 before it is set to run out, thanks in large part to savings from the law and an economic rebound following the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Harris wants to expand Medicare benefits",
      "Harris has made her proposal to expand Medicare's coverage\u00a0for home health care aides a common part of her stump speech in recent weeks. The plan also calls for adding coverage for hearing and vision benefits to Medicare.",
      "Expanding the new benefits could be paid for by a separate Harris proposal to expand the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The price caps program under its current design will be too small to cover the expanded benefits Harris wants. But the campaign has pointed to estimates suggesting that billions more could be recouped by a more aggressive approach to its price caps and other drug cost reforms, if Congress signs off.",
      "Former President Donald Trump's campaign responded to the Harris announcement by pointing to their own promises in the Republican platform this year, including \"shifting resources back to at-home care.\"",
      "They also cited changes Medicare made during the COVID-19 pandemic under Trump, like expanding access to telehealth providers.",
      "Trump wants to block Medicare age increases",
      "A frequent applause line at Trump's rallies is his pledge to block any increases to the eligibility age for Medicare coverage, which is currently set at 65 years old, and to eliminate income taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "\"I will fight for and protect Social Security and Medicare. There will be no cuts, and we won't be raising the age, like they're going to end up doing,\" Trump told supporters at a Pennsylvania rally on Oct. 9.",
      "Those promises could add to the steep challenges facing Congress, as it navigates the thorny solutions to Medicare insolvency. Though the deadline for Medicare running out of money has been pushed back, officials have warned Congress that delaying action now to shore up the fund will force even more painful changes down the road.",
      "While Trump has painted his pledge as a broadside against his Democratic rival, the retirement age issue was actually a point of division within his own party during the GOP primary. House Democrats have also railed against some of their GOP colleagues over a plan that suggested \"modest adjustments to the retirement age\" down the road.",
      "Harris accuses Trump of backing cuts to Medicare",
      "Democrats have accused Trump of backing cuts to Medicare for years, despite his repeated vows not to cut the program's funding.",
      "The Harris campaign has revived attacks from Trump's first term, which claimed his proposed budgets were cutting \"Medicare support for hospitals and other providers under the guise of eliminating wasteful spending.\"",
      "\"Now Donald Trump has a different approach. He tried to cut Medicare and Social Security every year he was president,\" Harris said on Oct. 29, in remarks near the White House that the campaign billed as her closing argument.",
      "At the time, Trump White House officials defended the savings as good government reforms and said Medicare's funding would still grow under the budget. The changes largely echoed recommendations by a nonpartisan advisory commission to improve the program, and outside budget watchdogs agreed it would not directly impact beneficiaries.",
      "Harris has also claimed that her Republican opponent would cut Medicare and overturn provisions the Inflation Reduction Act added, like the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. As evidence, she cites proposals in the Heritage Foundation's \"Project 2025\" platform, written by Trump allies, despite his own disavowal of the document.",
      "Trump accuses Harris of \"bankrupting\" the program",
      "On the trail, Trump most often brings up Medicare when accusing Harris of \"bankrupting\" the program. He frames the attack the same way he did against President Biden earlier this year, before Mr. Biden dropped out, claiming a surge of migrants was \"destroying\" Medicare.",
      "\"They're allowing millions of these people to go into Social Security, Medicare. They're going to destroy it,\" Trump said on Oct. 29, in remarks from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.",
      "Under current law, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicare. Only some \"lawfully present immigrants\" can get premium-free Medicare, typically only after those seniors have paid payroll taxes in enough years.",
      "A more nuanced version of Trump's attack,\u00a0published by his campaign, points to Harris' support for an \"earned pathway to citizenship\" for immigrants. The Trump campaign claims this could \"make millions of low-wage migrants into US citizens\" and threaten the survival of the program.",
      "This echoes a similar claim that has come up in Washington for years. A failed immigration reform effort\u00a0in 2013 that sought to carve out a \"pathway to citizenship\" was projected to result in higher Medicare spending to cover the additional people, though it was also projected to bring in more tax revenue that could outweigh the increased expenses.",

      "Former President Donald Trump\u00a0is among the wealthiest Americans ever to serve as president of the United States, with an estimated overall net worth of $3.7 billion at the time of his inauguration in 2016, according to Forbes. But he's an outlier, according to presidential historian Barbara A. Perry, who noted that most \"presidents after the Civil War were not wealthy business people \u2014 they didn't come from money.\"",

      "2. John F. Kennedy ($1.3 billion).\u00a0Most of Kennedy's wealth was inherited, presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told CBS MoneyWatch. His father, Joseph Kennedy, made a large fortune as an investor, and also was appointed by Franklin Delano in 1934 Roosevelt as the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "3. George Washington ($708.5 million).\u00a0Like many early presidents, George Washington was a wealthy land owner. \"Our first president was rich, he owned a lot of real estate,\" Brinkley said.",
      "Other traits also set the nation's founder apart, according to Perry. \"In Washington's case, he was very astute about farming and rotating his crops. He grew tobacco and corn, and used corn to make whiskey, which is where a lot of his wealth came from,\" she said.",
      "4. Thomas Jefferson ($285.8 million).\u00a0Thomas Jefferson's wealth was inherited through land from his father.",

      "Home Depot co-founder and philanthropist Bernard \"Bernie\" Marcus has died at 95, the home improvement chain announced Tuesday.",
      "\"The entire Home Depot family is deeply saddened by the death of our co-founder Bernie Marcus. We owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude to Bernie. He was a master merchant and a retail visionary,\" Atlanta-based Home Depot said in a statement. \"But even more importantly, he valued our associates, customers and communities above all. He's left us with an invaluable legacy and the backbone of our company: our values and culture.\"",
      "He died on Monday at his home in Boca Raton, Florida, surrounded by his family, a company spokesperson said.",
      "The billionaire, a major donor to Republican politicians, accumulated his fortune by starting The Home Depot with Arthur Blank in 1978, with the two building the hardware store into a giant retail chain that now operates 2,300 stores and employs more than 500,000.",
      "Marcus was the CEO of Home Depot until 1997 and served as its chairman until he retired in 2002. Bank retired from Home Depot in 2001 after serving as president, CEO and co-chairman.",
      "Marcus had a net worth of $7.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "An outspoken supporter of former President Donald Trump, Marcus and his spouse contributed $7 million to committees backing Trump's 2016 campaign and nearly $8 million to Republicans in the 2018 midterms. As of September, he gave more than $1.8 million to back Trump in the current cycle.",
      "Marcus in 2022 told the Financial Times he was worried about the future of capitalism, telling the newspaper he faulted \"socialism\" in America for people not wanting to work. \"Nobody gives a damn. 'Just give it to me. Send me money. I don't want to work \u2014 I'm too lazy, I'm too fat, I'm too stupid'.\"",
      "He founded the Jerusalem-based Israel Democracy Institute in 1991, and in 2003 gave $250 million to the state of Georgia to finance its aquarium in Atlanta.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 12:35:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Harris and Trump both have proposed historically large tax overhauls. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are both proposing tax changes that would rank among the largest in U.S. history, but their plans would impact very different groups of Americans by providing tax credits and cuts to some taxpayers, while raising taxes on others.",
      "While taxes are always on the ballot during an presidential election, the 2024 race has even more at stake given that many provisions in Trump's signature tax legislation, the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, will expire at the end of 2025. If Trump wins, he's expected to extend many of those provisions, while Harris has vowed to only keep those that help people earning under $400,000.",
      "At the same time, both candidates have sought to curry favor with some groups of voters by promising specific tax cuts and credits, such as Harris' plan to introduce a $6,000 Child Tax Credit for parents of newborns. Trump, meanwhile, has dangled a host of tax cuts to everyone from senior citizens (promising to get rid of income taxes on Social Security) to tipped workers (vowing to eliminate taxes on tips).",
      "But Trump is also proposing across-the-board tariffs on all imports, a plan that would effectively act as a sales tax on American consumers. That's because the countries that manufacture products imported to the U.S. do not pay tariffs; rather, tariffs are added to the prices of imported products that American consumers purchase.",
      "Here's what to know about how their tax plans stack up.",
      "Would Trump cut or raise your taxes?",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts \u2014 including cutting the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21% \u2014 would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "However, Trump's tax cuts would require Congressional approval, which could prove to be a hurdle if at least one of the chambers is controlled by Democrats.",
      "If Trump is unable to enact his tax cuts but adds his proposed tariffs \u2014 which don't need a Congressional greenlight \u2014 he would instead be introducing the seventh-biggest tax increase since 1940, the Tax Foundation says. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by U.S. consumers, with the typical household paying about $1,700 more each year in additional costs, according to one estimate.",
      "Meanwhile, income taxes would decline under Trump for all income groups, but the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Their analysis includes Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.",
      "Would Harris cut or raise your taxes?",
      "Harris is proposing a mix of tax cuts, tax increases and expanded tax credits that together would rank as the 15th largest tax increase since 1940, according to the Tax Foundation.",
      "However, the impact would be greater on higher-income households, given that she has vowed to not raise taxes on those earning less than $400,000. Her tax increases would also be targeted at businesses, as she wants to boost the corporate tax rate to 28% from its current 21%.",
      "Most low- and middle-income households would actually get a tax break under her proposals, but high-income households would pay substantially more in income taxes than they currently do, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model.",
      "The top 0.1%, or those earning more than $14 million a year, would see their taxes increase by about $167,000 a year.",
      "What are Harris and Trump proposing for families?",
      "Harris wants to expand the Child Tax Credit from its current $2,000 to $6,000 for children up to a year old, $3,600 for kids between 1 to 6, and $3,000 for those between 6 to 17.",
      "Low-income households with kids would receive an additional $2,750 on average from Harris' expanded CTC, according to a Tax Policy Center\u00a0analysis.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's vice presidential candidate, JD Vance, has floated the idea of a $5,000 CTC, but the campaign hasn't introduced more details, according to the Tax Policy Center. If Trump extends the TCJA, the CTC would remain at $2,000 per eligible child.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for taxes on Social Security?",
      "Harris hasn't proposed any tax cuts for Social Security beneficiaries, while Trump has floated eliminating federal income taxes on the retirement payments.",
      "Trump's plan would mostly help middle- and high-income retirees, given that low-income retirees often don't make enough to pay federal income tax on their benefits, according to tax experts. The biggest boost would go to retirees earning between $63,000 and $200,000, the Tax Policy Center estimates.",
      "At the same time, Trump's tax cut would likely hasten the insolvency of the Social Security trust fund, which relies on those income taxes for funding, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Retirees would also be facing a bigger benefit cut, up to 33% of their monthly checks rather than the 23% currently forecast, when the trust fund is exhausted, the group estimates.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for business taxes?",
      "Harris wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from its current 21%.",
      "By comparison, Trump wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%.",
      "\"Nowhere do the candidates' tax plans differ more,\" noted Howard Gleckman, senior fellow of the Tax Policy Center, in a November 1 blog post.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for taxes on overtime and tips?",
      "One place where the candidates converge is on cutting taxes for people who work for tips. Both have portrayed the idea as helping workers with families.",
      "But Trump is also proposing other tax cuts for workers, such as a plan to get rid of federal income taxes on overtime income.",
      "What other tax changes are Harris and Trump proposing?",
      "Harris wants to help people buy homes and start businesses by creating a new $25,000 first-time homebuyers credit and expanding the deduction for startup business expenses from $5,000 to $50,000.",
      "Trump has also proposed making the interest for auto loans tax deductible, a move that would primarily help higher-income taxpayers who itemize their deductions.",

      "U.S. lawmakers have come a long way since making $6 a day in 1789, but their six-figure annual salary has remained frozen in time since 2009.",
      "The current annual salary for a U.S. senator \u2014 as well as members of the U.S. House of Representatives \u2014 is $174,000. The government-paid salary, set in 2009, reflects a $4,700 pay bump from 2008, but has not been raised since.",
      "Nevertheless, the income is still more than double the median household income which currently stands at $82,207, according to MotioResearch.",
      "By comparison, majority and minority leaders in both chambers receive $193,400. The speaker of the House receives $223,500 annually.",
      "Unlike individuals in other professions, Congress essentially has direct control over the salary of its members, in the sense that any raise or decrease in member compensation must be \"ascertained by Law\" according to\u00a0Article I, Section 6\u00a0\u00a0of the U.S. Constitution. Checks and balances in the legislative process surrounding compensation, however, keep members from giving themselves million-dollar pay raises each year.",
      "\"A change in salary must be done via a bill or joint resolution, both of which are presented to the President for a signature. Thus, the President could veto a bill changing Members' salaries if he thought it inappropriate,\" explains a 2019 report from the Congressional Institute.",
      "That said, perhaps the most powerful protection against inflated salaries in Congress is the ballot box, and the voting public's general skepticism toward increases in Senate pay.",
      "\"Members know constituents are skeptical of congressional pay increases, so they hate voting for them,\" according to the Congressional Institute.",
      "Do senators get a cost of living adjustment?",
      "In spite of public scrutiny, Congress has managed to keep itself among the highest paying professions.",
      "After public outrage quashed a brash attempt by Congress to increase member pay by 51% in early 1989, a more modest hike of 10% was passed through The Ethics Reform Act of 1989, signed into law by President George Bush on Nov. 30, 1989.",
      "Described by CQ Almanac at the time as \"the most sweeping rewrite of the congressional code of conduct in 12 years,\" the legislation allowed salaries for congressional members to reach $125,000 in 1991, a nearly 40% increase from the $89,500 salary that had been set in 1987.",
      "The ethics reform also established an annual automatic cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for members of Congress\u00a0based on the previous year's Employment Cost Index, an increase they have refused since 2009 \u2014 likely to avoid blowback from voters.",
      "If Congress had accepted each of those increases over the years, their annual salary would have reached $208,000 in 2023, as previously\u00a0reported by CBS News. Meanwhile, a report by Congressional Research Service\u00a0 estimates senators are actually making 29% less than they were in 2009 because of inflation.",
      "How rich is the typical senator?",
      "But pay raises can come in less obvious forms, such as subsidies. As reported last January by the New York Times, a provision passed by Congress in late 2022 allowed lawmakers to claim reimbursements for gas, food and lodging while on official business in Washington \u2014 the equivalent of a $34,000 tax-free pay raise, according to the Times.",
      "Most senators built their fortunes before becoming members of Congress, according to Investopedia. A 2019 financial disclosure showed that half of the members of Congress were millionaires, according to\u00a0Open Secrets. Senators are required by Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to disclose their financial assets each year.",

      "For now, that experience includes a 48-hour average wait for fans to have their tickets restored after notifying the company of their disappearance. As an added precaution, Ticketmaster is limiting ticket transfers to 72 hours before Eras Tour concerts and requiring two-factor authentication for some transactions.",
      "\"It's a very small percent, less than a tenth of one percent,\" said Henrich, \"but obviously for that one fan who's going through that, it's a really stressful situation.\"",

    "summary": "Members of Congress haven't given themselves a raise since 2009, but House lawmakers still earn six figures.",
    "story": [
      "Serving in the U.S. House of Representatives comes with a six-figure salary, along with perks including paid\u00a0travel and housing costs.",
      "While the $174,000 annual pay likely doesn't sound too shabby to those living in a country where the median individual wage comes to just over $59,000 a year, members of Congress are earning wages that were set in 2009. They haven't gotten an automatic cost-of-living adjustment since 2009.",
      "In getting elected\u00a0as Speaker of the House in October of 2023, Louisiana Republican Mike Johnson's annual salary jumped to $223,500. Louisiana Republican Steve Scalise and New York Democrat Hakeem Jeffries each make $193,4000 a year as the House majority and minority leaders, respectively.",
      "Members of Congress are not allowed to continue in their prior jobs while working on Capitol Hill, although their net worth continues to increase through investments. Indeed, many Washington, D.C., lawmakers were\u00a0already millionaires when they began their political careers, especially in the Senate.",
      "Although pensions are increasingly uncommon for most American workers, the perk is alive and well for lawmakers. Since 1946, members of Congress with at least five years of service or federal employment are eligible for \"a generous pension that pays two to three times more than pensions offered to similarly salaried workers in the private sector,\" according to the National Taxpayers Union Foundation.",
      "The value of the pension benefit is determined based on when a lawmakers was elected to office, time served and the average of the three years of their highest salary, noted NTUF, an affiliate of the National Taxpayers Union.",
      "A lesser-known congressional benefit is the practice of leaving death gratuity payments to the heirs of members who die while serving in office. Equal to the member's yearly congressional salary, the payments are provided regardless of how wealthy the deceased lawmaker was. From 2000 to 2021, the payments have cost taxpayers $5 million, the nonprofit research group found.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. president hasn't been given a raise in more than 20 years.",
      "That means Kamala Harris or Donald Trump will earn the same salary as their predecessor: $400,000 a year, as specified in Title 3 of the U.S. Code, paid monthly. The president also gets an additional $50,000 for expenses (non-taxable), a $100,000 travel account and a $19,000 entertainment budget.",

      "Between 1969 and 2001, the last time Congress boosted the chief executive's pay, the president earned $200,000 annually. In a 1999\u00a0hearing on the proposed pay raise, it was noted that compensation for \"one of the most difficult, demanding and important jobs on the face of the earth\" had not risen in three decades, while the salaries of private-sector chief executive officers were soaring.",
      "Government reform expert Paul C. Light testified that he supported a presidential salary increase \"if only to signal that the American political system values its chief executive enough to occasionally boost the base salary.\"",
      "How much did U.S. presidents earn in the past?",
      "Historically, the president's annual salary was worth a lot more when taking inflation into account.",
      "Here's what presidents made per year during previous historical periods, according to the University of Michigan, citing Congressional Quarterly's \"Guide to the Presidency.\" How much that pay is worth in today's dollars, after adjusting for inflation and based on calculations from Officialdata.org, is noted in parentheses:",

      "More money in memoirs",
      "It's worth noting that presidents remain on the federal government's payroll after leaving The White House too. Since 1958, former presidents have earned an annual pension, which now amounts to more than $200,000. They also get office space in a place of their choosing and travel expenses, according to the Former Presidents Act of 1958.",

    "summary": "How the U.S. election plays out could have a major impact on the millions of Americans enrolled in Medicare. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "On the campaign trail, both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are eager to portray themselves as guardians of Medicare. Each presidential candidate accuses the other of backing spending cuts and other policies that would damage the health insurance program for older Americans.",
      "But the election's outcome could alter the very nature of the nearly 60-year-old federal program. More than half of Medicare beneficiaries are already enrolled in plans, called Medicare Advantage, run by commercial insurers, and if Trump wins, that proportion is expected to grow \u2014 perhaps dramatically.",
      "Trump and many congressional Republicans have already taken steps to aggressively promote Medicare Advantage. And Project 2025, a political wish list produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation for the next presidency, calls for making insurer-run plans the default enrollment option for Medicare.",
      "Such a change would effectively privatize the program, because people tend to stick with the plans they're initially enrolled in, health analysts say. Trump has repeatedly tried to distance himself from Project 2025, though the document's authors include numerous people who worked in his first administration.",
      "Conservatives say Medicare beneficiaries are better off in the popular Advantage plans, which offer more benefits than the traditional, government-run program. Critics say increasing insurers' control of the program would trap consumers in health plans that are costlier to taxpayers and that can restrict their care, including by imposing onerous prior authorization requirements for some procedures.",
      "\"Traditional Medicare will wither on the vine,\" said Robert Berenson, a former official in the Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton administrations who's now a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning research group.",
      "While the fate of Medicare has gotten scant attention so far in the campaign, the different visions under Trump versus Harris indicate the high stakes.",
      "A candidate's position on protecting Medicare and Social Security is the most important health care issue, or among the most important, in determining 63% of Americans' vote in the presidential election, according to a September poll by Gallup and West Health, a family of nonprofit and nonpartisan organizations focused on health care and aging.",
      "Medicare, which covers about 66 million people, is funded largely by payroll taxes. At age 65, most Americans are automatically enrolled in Medicare coverage for hospitalization and doctor visits, known as Part A and Part B, though others must sign up. Consumers must also sign up for other aspects of Medicare, specifically drug coverage (Part D) and supplemental plans from insurers that pay for costs that aren't covered by traditional Medicare, such as extended stays in skilled nursing facilities and cost sharing.",
      "People on Medicare pay premiums plus as much as 20% of the cost of their care.",
      "Medicare Advantage plans typically combine coverage for hospital and outpatient care and prescriptions, while eliminating the 20% coinsurance requirement and capping customers' annual out-of-pocket costs. Many of the plans don't charge an extra monthly premium, though some carry a deductible \u2014 an amount patients must pay each year before coverage kicks in.",
      "Sometimes the plans throw in extras like coverage for eye exams and glasses or gym memberships.",
      "However, they control costs by limiting patients to networks of approved doctors and hospitals, with whom the plans negotiate payment rates. Some hospitals and doctors refuse to do business with some or all Medicare Advantage plans, making those networks narrow or limited. Traditional Medicare, in comparison, is accepted by nearly every hospital and doctor.",
      "Medicare's popularity is one reason both candidates are pledging to enhance it. Last month, Harris released a plan that would add benefits including care for hearing and vision, and long-term in-home health care. The costs would be covered by savings from expanding Medicare's negotiations with drugmakers, reducing fraud, and increasing discounts drugmakers pay for certain brand-name drugs in the program, according to Harris' campaign.",
      "Trump's campaign said he would prioritize home care benefits and support unpaid family caregivers through tax credits and reduced red tape.",
      "The Trump campaign also noted enhancements to Medicare Advantage plans during his tenure as president, such as increasing access to telehealth and expanding supplemental benefits for seniors with chronic diseases.",
      "But far less attention has been paid to whether to give even more control of Medicare to private insurers. Joe Albanese, a senior policy analyst at Paragon Health Institute, a right-leaning research group, said \"a Trump administration and GOP Congress would be more friendly\" to the idea.",
      "The concept of letting private insurers run Medicare isn't new. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, asserted in 1995 that traditional Medicare would fade away if its beneficiaries could pick between the original program and private plans.",
      "The shift to Medicare Advantage was accelerated by legislation in 2003 that created Medicare's drug benefit and gave private health plans a far greater role in the program.",
      "Lawmakers thought private insurers could better contain costs. Instead, the plans have cost more. In 2023, Medicare Advantage plans cost the government and taxpayers about 6% \u2014 or $27 billion \u2014 more than original Medicare, though some research shows they provide better care.",
      "The Trump administration promoted Medicare Advantage in emails during the program's open enrollment period each year, but support for the privately run plans has become bipartisan as they have grown.",
      "\"It helps inject needed competition into a government-run program and has proven to be more popular with those who switch,\" said Roger Severino, lead architect of Project 2025's section on the Department of Health and Human Services. He served as director of HHS' civil rights office during the Trump administration.",
      "But enrollees who want to switch back to traditional Medicare may not be able to. If they try to buy supplemental coverage for the 20% of costs Medicare doesn't cover, they may find they have to pay an unaffordable premium. Unless they enroll in the plans close to the time they first become eligible for Medicare, usually at age 65, insurers selling those supplemental plans can deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of preexisting conditions.",
      "\"More members of Congress are hearing from constituents who are horrified and realize they are trapped in these plans,\" said Andrea Ducas, vice president of health policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy organization.",
      "[Correction: This article was updated at 10:20 a.m. ET on Nov. 4, 2024, to correct the amount Medicare Advantage plans cost the government and taxpayers last year compared with original Medicare.]",

      "Vice President Kamala Harris' wealth comes from her decades in public service, book royalties and investments.",
      "Harris, 60, and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, also 60, are worth about $8 million, according to an\u00a0estimate\u00a0by Forbes.",
      "Day jobs",
      "The Democratic nominee for president spent most of her adult life in government, starting out as district attorney in San Francisco, before serving as California's attorney general and then as a U.S. senator before becoming President Joe Biden's running mate in 2020.",
      "Harris was San Francisco's district attorney from 2004 to 2010, making about $200,000 a year by the end of her tenure, according to Forbes. She took a pay cut when she became California's attorney general, earning $159,000 a year.",
      "Harris was elected to the Senate in 2016, a job that comes with a salary of $174,000 a year. As vice president, Harris\u00a0makes $235,100 a year.",
      "Emhoff was an entertainment lawyer for three decades before\u00a0giving up\u00a0a lucrative career to support Harris.",
      "Public disclosures",
      "The vice president has regularly disclosed her income and assets in forms filed with the Office of Government Ethics.",
      "Released by the White House in May, the latest public disclosure\u00a0report\u00a0for 2023 shows Harris taking a hands-off approach to investing, with the vice president's portfolio holding millions in passively managed index funds.",
      "The form shows eight different funds that Harris is invested in as part of two deferred compensation plans accrued during the period she was employed in California, while also a participant in certain defined benefit pension plans. Those pensions are worth less than $1 million, according\u00a0to\u00a0Forbes.",
      "Emhoff listed 30-plus investments, most passively managed as well.",
      "The form showed asset ranges for each fund, instead of the specific amounts invested.",
      "Both Harris and Emhoff disclosed cash holdings that could total $850,000 or more, based on the ranges shown.",
      "An\u00a0analysis\u00a0by Barron's pegged the couple's holdings \u2014 including retirement accounts, other investments and cash \u2014 at between $2.9 million and $6.6 million.",
      "The disclosure also shows Harris and Emhoff holding a family trust called The KDH/DCE Family Trust.",
      "A gift that keeps giving: Beyonc\u00e9",
      "Illustrating an investment style dubbed \"boring\" and relatively free of financial conflicts by financial experts interviewed by CNBC, the most tantalizing detail of the form could be a gift valued at $1,655.92 from Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter: tickets to a concert by the superstar singer. (Beyonc\u00e9's \"Freedom\" is Harris' campaign song, and the musician\u00a0has endorsed\u00a0her candidacy.)",
      "Harris was also gifted tickets by ESPN to a football game between Florida A&M University and her alma mater, Howard University,\u00a0 worth $1,890.00.",
      "Harris has\u00a0earned more than $500,00 in royalties from books she's authored, including \"Smart on Crime,\" the 2019 children's book \u00a0\"Superheroes are Everywhere,\" and her 2019 memoir, \"The Truths We Hold.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 02 Nov 2024 10:00:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Jasmine Adeoye, an account manager based in Austin, Texas, said she became addicted to kratom drink \"Feel Free Classic,\" after she sought an alcohol alternative.",
    "story": [
      "When Jasmine Adeoye, an account manager based in Austin, Texas, decided to stop drinking in June 2022, she turned to a kratom beverage advertised as an alcohol alternative. Within a year and a half, Adeoye said she was addicted to the drink, \"Feel Free Classic,\" lured by what she calls the company's deceptive marketing tactics.",
      "The 29-year-old account manager based in Austin, Texas, said her favorite podcasters promoted the drink, which the company Botanic Tonics manufactures and sells, as \"a miracle\" beverage that could help people trying to overcome addiction and embrace sobriety. Having struggled with binge drinking in the past, Adeoye was intrigued.",
      "She said she was unaware the drink contained kratom, a plant native to Southeast Asia that can produce feelings of energy, ease anxiety and reduce pain\u2014 but carries a risk of addiction, seizures, and very rarely, death. Since kratom is unregulated in the U.S., some products are sold in highly concentrated forms and could contain contaminants like heavy metals and harmful bacteria, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.",
      "Eventually, Adeoye says she was drinking up to 10 two-ounce bottles a day and spending around $100 daily. The company recommends consumers drink no more than a bottle daily. By then, she said, her life revolved around the drink and she needed to make sure she had access to it wherever she went.",
      "A drink advertised an #alcoholalternative",
      "Then came the withdrawals, which some consumers compare on social media to withdrawing from an opioid.",
      "\"When I would wake up, I'd be 'dope sick', essentially, and need to go straight to the gas station and go buy Feel Free to immediately feel better,\" Adeoye said.",
      "This past March, after one bout of withdrawal symptoms was so severe, she sought medical care close to her home in Austin. She hadn't told the doctors she was struggling with kratom use, she said, and they chalked her symptoms up to a virus.",
      "\"All of a sudden, it just spirals out of control and you get to a point where you feel like you can't live without them,\" she said. \"And you become just a shell of a person.\"",
      "Adeoye, who was trying to stay sober from alcohol, said she unwittingly found herself in the throes of addiction \u2014 and she's not the only one.",
      "A forum on the social network Reddit called r/quittingkratom has more than 45,000 members while a forum dedicated exclusively to quitting Feel Free has nearly 3,000. There are podcasts, support groups and books dedicated to quitting kratom.",
      "In 2023, a class action lawsuit was filed in California against Botanic Tonics alleging that the drink was advertised as a safe alternative to alcohol. The company used social media to reach its \"desired customer base,\" the lawsuit states, which included individuals who had struggled with addiction. According to the 2023 suit, Botanic Tonics posted over a thousand advertisements on Instagram using the hashtag #alcoholalternative. The suit also says that advertisements on Instagram omitted any mention of kratom or potential side effects.",
      "CBS News spoke with another consumer about their experience with Feel Free Classic who also described the drink's appeal as an alcohol alternative, and said they had become addicted to the beverage and eventually experienced withdrawal symptoms.",
      "The company told CBS News in a statement it \"fell short of the high standards of transparency and consumer education that our company now champions.\" And they've taken steps for \"continuous improvement and doing what's right for consumers.\"",
      "Botanic Tonics said they'd implemented changes including enhanced labeling, raised age restrictions to 21 and over, investing in clinical research, expanded consumer education resources and maintained rigorous manufacturing standards in FDA-registered, cGMP-certified facilities.",
      "CBS News found through an internet search that Feel Free Classic was featured in at least 22 podcasts. The company's founder, JW Ross, has spoken openly with podcast hosts about his previous struggles with alcohol, and how Feel Free Classic was developed as an alternative.",
      "\"We make a powerful product. That product works for a lot of people, but it doesn't work for everyone,\" Botanic Tonics said in a statement to CBS News. \"Our priority as a company is making sure it gets into the right hands, which is why it's so important for us to focus on informing people who have issues with substance abuse that it isn't for them.\"",
      "Upon the lawsuit's settlement in September, Botanic Tonics said it would issue clear labels and warnings \u2014 but around the time Adeoye began taking Feel Free Classic and ultimately became hooked, the website advertised the drinks to be \"used for productivity enhancement or as a healthy alcohol alternative.\" As recently as January 2024, a banner on the website read \"cheers to a dry January.\"",
      "Kratom risks not fully known by the public",
      "Kratom is used by an estimated 2 million to 15 million Americans. As kratom's use rises in the U.S., so do the risks. The FDA warns the public against consuming kratom for medical use due to the risk of liver toxicity, seizures and substance use disorder; the DEA classifies it as a \"drug of concern\" and warns that it can lead to addiction. Botanic Tonics said, \"while leaf kratom can lead to physical dependence, its risk profile is significantly lower compared to many other commonly used substances.\" The company pointed CBS News to comparative safety practices and FDA studies available on the Global Kratom Coalition website, an advocacy group promoting the use of kratom.",
      "It is rare to overdose from kratom alone \u2013 a vast majority of the overdoses typically include an accompanying substance like alcohol or cocaine. But it does happen.",
      "Wrongful death suits in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington followed. The family of a Florida woman whose death in 2021 was attributed to a chemical compound found in kratom was awarded $11 million in a wrongful death lawsuit. Last year, $2.5 million was awarded in the first kratom wrongful death trial in the United States. A kratom company based in Washington State was found liable for negligence among other claims relating to the death of a 39-year-old who was found dead in his living room after consuming kratom.",
      "Despite kratom's potential for addiction and subsequent withdrawal symptoms, it has gained a reputation among the online sobriety community as a method to self-manage opioid withdrawal \u2014 which has not yet been scientifically proven.",
      "Adeoye said even though information about the dangers of kratom was readily available, she didn't understand the associated risks. If she could go back two years, she said, she would have researched the ingredients \"as heavily as possible.\"",
      "\"To my knowledge, it was something that was similar to matcha, like a tea or a coffee,\" Adeoye said. \"So, thought it was completely harmless.\"",
      "Scrutiny grows around kratom marketing",
      "Botanic Tonics isn't the only kratom product company that has come under scrutiny.",
      "In July, the FDA issued a warning advising consumers against using OPMS Black Liquid Kratom, which \"has been linked to serious adverse health effects, including death,\" according to the agency. Shot of Joy, which sells kratom shots, was issued a warning letter by the FDA in 2023 stating the company markets their products for the \"treatment or cure of opioid addiction\"\u2014 a claim the FDA says has not been determined by the agency. In a series of Instagram advertisements viewed by CBS News, Shot of Joy promotes their beverage as an alcohol alternative. The FDA has issued warning letters to ten companies that sell kratom products between 2019 and 2023.",
      "After nearly two years of silently struggling, Adeoye told her mom, and then her husband following that medical visit. She was ready to quit.",
      "She spent the next few days detoxing at home.",
      "\"I couldn't eat anything. My mom had to force me to eat,\" she said, noting that she had to have someone with her \"around the clock.\"",
      "Though the physical withdrawals tapered off after about three days she says it took six months to feel regulated mentally.",
      "\"It's very depressing to feel this emptiness,\" Adeoye said of quitting kratom. \"You feel like life is never going to be the same.\"",
      "Botanic Tonics'\u00a0 FAQ page now includes a section addressing past marketing practices.",
      "\"Our marketing strategy has changed dramatically in the past year, but not as a reaction to the lawsuit filing,\" the statement reads. \"As our business has grown, specifically in retail, we've shifted marketing focus accordingly.\"",

      "The controversies surrounding the so-called King of YouTube began snowballing this summer.

      "Unemployment in October held steady at 4.1%. The lackluster report reflects a dent in hiring attributed to Hurricanes Milton and Helene, and the Boeing machinists strike, which temporarily prevented some people from working in Florida and North Carolina.

      "But in a conference call with investors Thursday, the company said those closures will be offset by new restaurant openings. Wendy's said it plans to open between 250 and 300 restaurants this year.",
      "Wendy's President and CEO Kirk Tanner said the restaurants that are closing are underperforming compared to others.",
      "\"They're just in locations that don't build our brands,\" Tanner said. \"You look at a brand that's 55 years old and some of those restaurants are quite out of date.\"",
      "Dublin, Ohio-based Wendy's didn't provide a list of the locations to be closed. But Tanner said they are spread out all over the country.",

      "U.S. restaurant sales have seen little growth this year as many consumers pushed back against rising menu prices. Wendy's same-store sales \u2013 or sales at locations open at least a year \u2013 were up less than 1% in the U.S. in the first half of this year.",

    "story": [
      "For the first time ever, cryptocurrency could play a role in choosing the next U.S. president. As digital currencies have become more mainstream, crypto investors are emerging as a key new voting bloc.",
      "Anywhere from 7% to 21% of Americans own crypto \u2014 that equates to 18 million on the low end, and roughly 50 million on the high end. According to research from crypto exchange Gemini, 73% say a political candidate's stance toward the industry will influence their vote.",
      "The potential for crypto voters to move the needle is particularly noteworthy in swing states. Organizations like Stand with Crypto, a pro-crypto Political Action Committee are signing up \"crypto advocates\" in critical battleground states. In fact, Arizona and Georgia each have three times as many of these advocates than the number of votes President Biden won by in 2020.",
      "\"More and more people are getting into digital assets every year. The product is here and not going away,\" said Patrick Gerhart, president of banking operations for digital bank Telcoin. \"Understanding voters and their needs will be vital to any politician.\"",
      "That growing influence is a reality the crypto industry is looking to capitalize\u00a0on this election. FairShake, a PAC supported by big digital asset players like Coinbase and Ripple, has raised over $200 million to help elect pro-crypto candidates. The next four years will play a crucial role in shaping regulation, so the industry is spending big.",
      "\"Ideally, the administration is not only pro-crypto, but also knowledgeable,\" Gerhart said. \"An administration that is savvy in this realm will not only help the day-to-day users of digital assets, but also the regulators.\"",
      "The presidential candidates are taking notice. Donald Trump is actively courting the community, styling himself as the first pro-crypto leader. While he once labeled the space a scam, the former president has pledged to establish a bitcoin reserve and ease regulations. Trump even headlined the largest bitcoin conference in the world, though some crypto advocates question whether he will make good on these promises.",
      "In contrast, the Biden-Harris administration is generally viewed as anti-crypto. Regulatory action and vetoed bipartisan legislation have raised concerns among advocates, who feel the current leadership does not fully understand or support the industry's potential.",
      "\"The Biden administration will likely be remembered as one of the most politically unfriendly toward the crypto industry,\" said Todd Ruoff, the CEO of Autonomys, a decentralized data network. \"A lack of clear regulatory guidelines has created uncertainty, stifled innovation and driven some businesses out of the U.S.\"",
      "Although Vice President Kamala Harris has engaged with crypto industry leaders, she has not announced any campaign policies. It has left many in the sector feeling uncertain what a Harris presidency would mean for the future of crypto.",
      "\"Trump has struck a recurring and more favorable tone,\" Ruoff said. \"Neither candidate may be the crypto industry's dream, but it remains hopeful one might be less of a nightmare than the other.\"",
      "While the 2024 election might be the first time the crypto vote matters, it is unlikely to be the last. Candidates who embrace the shift could find themselves shaping both the future of the industry and their political fortunes.",

    "summary": "Starbucks to bring back ceramic mugs and messages written in Sharpie pens to revive a coffeehouse vibe at its nearly 40,000 stores.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks is looking to turn its business around by being less of a fast-food chain and more of a neighborhood coffee house.",
      "Brian Niccol, the struggling company's new CEO, on Thursday shared his vision of Starbucks becoming \"a welcoming coffee house where people gather and where we serve the finest coffee.\"",
      "Talking to analysts for the first time since taking the job on September 9, Niccol laid out his plan to reverse a trend illustrated in the company's fiscal fourth-quarter results, which had same-store sales down 7%, the third straight such drop. For the full year, Starbucks said its revenue rose less than 1% to $36 billion.",
      "The Seattle-based coffee giant released the bad financial news last week and said that it would suspend financial guidance for its 2025 fiscal year to give Niccol time to assess the business.",
      "\"It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers and return to growth,\" said Niccol, who labeled the earnings report as \"very disappointing.\"",
      "Looking to placate customers turned off by higher prices and longer wait times, Niccol said Starbucks would not hike its prices during its current fiscal year, which began at the end of September, and is taking steps to deliver orders in less than five minutes.",
      "\"We probably have about 50% of our stores or 50% of our transactions already happening less than 4 minutes. So we know it's very doable,\" Niccol said. \"We just need to do it in all our stores in every transaction.\"",
      "Starbucks is also working out kinks in its staffing levels as its baristas contend with in-store, drive-thru and online orders, not to mention ceaseless customization choices, the CEO said.",
      "The coffee giant plans to cut back on its overly complex menu and focus on fewer but tastier offerings, while taking steps to \"better separate mobile order pickup from the cafe experience,\" Niccol said.",
      "Starbucks will discontinue its Oleato olive-oil infused beverages from most locations starting early next month, axing what longtime Starbucks leader Howard Schultz called a \"transformational idea\" when he introduced it in Italy early last year.",
      "Starbucks will stop charging extra for nondairy milk",
      "As of next Thursday, November 7, Starbucks will stop charging more for nondairy milks at its corporate owned and operated cafes across North America. The option to pick oat, soy or coconut milk is the company's most popular customization after an extra shot of expresso, Niccol said. Once in place, nearly half of those that pay for a modifier could see a price reduction of 10% or more when they choose a nondairy milk, according to the executive.",
      "At a Starbucks in Michigan, for instance, it cost 70 cents to switch to almond milk in a medium Pumpkin Spice Latte.",
      "The switch comes after a lawsuit earlier this year\u00a0by three California residents who claimed the extra charge for nondairy substitutes marked a form of discrimination against people who are lactose intolerant or have other dietary restrictions.",
      "Starbucks also plans to bring back self-serve condiment coffee bars in all of its cafes by early 2025. The company had moved its milk, sugar and simple drip coffee behind the bar during the early days of COVID-19, but the switch back should give its baristas more time to craft the lattes, macchiatos and other less straight-forward drinks.",
      "Further, Starbucks plans to offer ceramic mugs to those looking to drink their hot beverages at Starbucks, and provide more comfortable seating to make its locations appealing to people who want to sit, work and meet. It also plans to bring back Sharpie pens so baristas can write a message on a customer's order.",
      "\"While we are confident in the strategy, we anticipate that the turnaround will take time, as Starbucks faces persistent challenges across key markets, including China, alongside rising competition, high prices, long wait times, and staffing shortages/turnover,\" Arun Sundaram, equity analyst at CFRA Research, wrote in a note.",
      "While early in its turnaround, much of what Niccol laid out seems sensible, according to Neil Saunders, managing director, retail, at GlobalData.",
      "\"One of the big issues a lot of customers have with Starbucks is the wait time for drinks and the queue lengths in some stores,\" Saunders said. \"Generally, most people want a quick coffee fix when they're on the go \u2013 that makes timeliness and efficiency paramount. Starbucks has faltered on delivering this over the past couple of years,\" according to the analyst. \"This is a critical fix if Starbucks wants to rebuild sales.\"",
      "At the same time, Starbucks also needs to consider customers who want to linger, as it is \"increasingly competing with independent coffee shops which often have a great vibe,\" Saunders said.",
      "Niccol stepped into his new role weeks after the caffeine purveyor ousted Laxman Narasimhan, whose 18-month stint at the helm was marked by sluggish sales, and amid a waning fondness for the brand, particularly among Americans.",
      "A restaurant executive for 20 years, Niccol is credited with reviving Taco Bell's image and for turning things around at Chipotle after a series of food-safety issues.",
      "There are nearly 40,000 Starbucks stores worldwide, and roughly 17,000 locations in the U.S.",

      "Some of the earliest U.S. presidents were also the wealthiest when they entered office. In the modern era, presidents historically have amassed most of their wealth through media deals and appearance fees after leaving office.",
      "Former President Donald Trump\u00a0is among the wealthiest Americans ever to serve as president of the United States, with an estimated overall net worth of $3.7 billion at the time of his inauguration in 2016, according to Forbes. But he's an outlier, according to presidential historian Barbara A. Perry, who noted that most \"presidents after the Civil War were not wealthy business people \u2014 they didn't come from money.\"",
      "As examples, she pointed to Bill Clinton, the 42nd president, and Barack Obama (No. 44,) neither of whom came from money or had much personal wealth when they entered office.",
      "\"They came from nothing. They're not elite,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They made their own way in the world through scholarly prowess and came to the White House with very little in their pockets in terms of money.\" Each has made tens of millions since leaving office, however.",
      "Here is how the richest former U.S. presidents rank in terms of their peak personal wealth, according to a 2023 report from 24/7 Wall St.\u00a0The report calculates former presidents' individual net worth based on their incomes, real estate holdings, spouses' wealth and inheritances. All figures are adjusted for inflation.",
      "Richest U.S. presidents ever",
      "1. Donald J. Trump ($3.7 billion).\u00a0Trump's current net worth is even higher today, pegged at $5.5 billion, according to Forbes. It comprises his earnings through real estate investments and holdings, plus his stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, which has experienced\u00a0wild swings in its market value this month.",
      "2. John F. Kennedy ($1.3 billion).\u00a0Most of Kennedy's wealth was inherited, presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told CBS MoneyWatch. His father, Joseph Kennedy, made a large fortune as an investor, and also was appointed by Franklin Delano in 1934 Roosevelt as the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "3. George Washington ($708.5 million).\u00a0Like many early presidents, George Washington was a wealthy land owner. \"Our first president was rich, he owned a lot of real estate,\" Brinkley said.",
      "Other traits also set the nation's founder apart, according to Perry. \"In Washington's case, he was very astute about farming and rotating his crops. He grew tobacco and corn, and used corn to make whiskey, which is where a lot of his wealth came from,\" she said.",
      "4. Thomas Jefferson ($285.8 million).\u00a0Thomas Jefferson's wealth was inherited through land from his father.",
      "5. Theodore Roosevelt ($168.6 million).\u00a0Theodore Roosevelt also came from a wealthy family, and inherited money.",
      "6. Andrew Jackson ($160.1 million).\u00a0Andrew Jackson was a wealthy plantation owner. Slavery was the primary source of the seventh president's personal wealth, according to the White House Historical Association.",
      "7. James Madison ($136.7 million).\u00a0James Madison was born to wealthy, plantation-owning parents.",
      "8. Lyndon B. Johnson ($131.9 million).\u00a0The main source of Lyndon B. Johnson's wealth came from his wife, Lady Bird Johnson's family, who owned a television and radio station business.",
      "9. Herbert Hoover ($100.1 million).\u00a0Herbert Hoover became a multimillionaire through his ownership of Burmese silver mines, and by earning royalties from sales of a textbook on mining engineering, according to the Miller Center at University of Virginia.",
      "10. Bill Clinton ($91.6 million).\u00a0Bill Clinton became wealthy upon leaving The White House in 2001, at the end of his second term.",
      "\"Bill Clinton came from nothing, and didn't make a lot of money in office,\" Brinkley said. \"He didn't own a residence for his eight years as president,\" Brinkley said. \"The windfall came ex-presidency.\"",

      "Although former President Donald Trump was convicted earlier this year in a Manhattan court of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, the Republican presidential nominee can still vote in the 2024 presidential election.",
      "Trump cast his ballot Tuesday in Palm Beach County, along with his wife, Melania.",
      "Why can Donald Trump vote even though he was convicted of a felony?",
      "While the state of Florida generally makes it challenging for people convicted of felonies to vote until they have served out their full sentence, Trump benefits from the fact that he was convicted outside of the state.",
      "Florida law specifies that people convicted outside of the state are subject to the voting laws of whichever state they were convicted in \u2013 New York, in this case. Trump can thank a 2021 New York state law\u00a0for his voting privileges in this election, one that allows felons to vote if they are not currently incarcerated.",
      "In Trump's case, he was convicted in New York in May, but has yet to be sentenced. This makes him an eligible voter in the state of Florida.",
      "He was originally scheduled to be sentenced in the case on Sept. 18, however his attorneys asked on Aug. 14 for his sentencing to be pushed back until after the presidential election. They argued a delay is necessary to resolve ongoing legal challenges to his conviction.",
      "In early September, Justice Juan Merchan issued an order delaying sentencing until Nov. 26, after the election.",
      "Merchan wrote that he made the decision \"to avoid any appearance \u2014 however unwarranted \u2014 that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching Presidential election in which the Defendant is a candidate.\"",
      "What felonies was Trump convicted of?",
      "Trump was convicted in May by a unanimous jury on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records tied to hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 election. Prosecutors stated that Trump signed off on a scheme to hide reimbursements to a lawyer who wired a $130,000 \"hush money\" payment to the adult film state just days before the 2016 presidential election. Trump has denied the allegations and he pleaded not guilty.",
      "\"A jury of 12 New Yorkers swiftly and unanimously convicted Donald Trump of 34 felony counts,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in early September after Trump was convicted.",
      "Merchan has a broad range in determining Trump's sentence. The charges carry a maximum sentence of up to four years in jail, but Merchan can also hand down a sentence that involves a variety of alternatives to incarceration, including probation. Most legal observers expect Trump to avoid jail time, given his status as a first-time offender and sentences handed down for the same crime in other cases.",
      "Trump has denied all allegations in this case, as well as four other criminal cases, two of which revolve around his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and one, which was dismissed, where he was charged for taking confidential documents from the White House at the end of his presidency.",
      "Where these go from here could very well depend on whether Trump is elected.",

      "Waves of election results will begin coming in Tuesday night after polls close throughout the country, but in many key states it may take a while to know who has won \u2014 and much longer to get official, certified results.",
      "There are a number of reasons it can take longer for ballots to be counted in some states, including the rise of mail-in voting, an option taken by nearly one-third of voters nationwide during the 2022 midterm elections, according to the MIT Election Lab. Some states allow mail-in ballots to be counted before Election Day, while others do not allow poll workers to start counting those ballots until in-person voting has come to an end.",
      "CBS News considers seven states to be battleground states in the 2024 presidential election. Here's a breakdown of those states' rules around official ballot counts and certification.",
      "Arizona",
      "Polls close in Arizona at 7 p.m. local time (9 p.m. ET).",
      "Arizona has allowed voting by mail for over two decades, and approximately 80% of voters in the state vote by mail. Ballot processing and tallying in the state can begin when the ballots are received by election workers, but results may not be released before all precincts have reported or one hour after the polls close on Election Day, whichever is sooner. Releasing information earlier is a felony in Arizona.",
      "University of Arizona professor Christopher Weber, who leads the Arizona Voter Project, said it could be nearly two weeks before every vote is tallied in the state's most populous county.",
      "\"The polls are really close in Arizona, and Maricopa [County] is expecting 10 to 13 days to count all votes,\" Weber said. \"I \u2013 like others \u2013 anticipate delays. Though we may have predictions beforehand, it's really difficult to say. I don't remember a time in which polling was so close.\"",
      "County elections officials are responsible for the counting of ballots in federal, state and county elections, according to the state elections website. Early and provisional ballots first undergo signature verification at a county recorder's office, and counties can begin tabulating votes once early voting has begun. Most early ballots will be counted before Election Day, while those that are received on Election Day will be tabulated in the days immediately afterward.",
      "An automatic recount is triggered if the margin of the votes between two candidates is 0.5 percentage points or fewer. Recounts may not be requested in Arizona.",
      "Since 2020, the state has been the epicenter of a campaign among Trump supporters to undermine trust in the nation's election systems, leading elections officials in the state's largest county to erect a veritable fortress to defend the center where votes are counted.",
      "Georgia",
      "Polls close in Georgia at 7 p.m. ET.",
      "Absentee ballot voting in Georgia plummeted after the 2020 election, when more than 1.3 million residents availed themselves of that option. During the 2022 midterm elections, that figure was below 300,000, a figure advocates blamed on a controversial 2021 law that reduced access to ballot drop boxes, increased restrictions on mailed ballots and introduced other rules like banning food and drink distribution to voters in line by non-poll workers.",
      "That legislation was among a string of changes implemented in the last four years by the state's Republican-dominated government. In September, Georgia's State Election Board approved a requirement that the total number of ballots \u00a0be counted by hand after machines run their tallies. But that and other recently adopted rules were blocked by Georgia judges who concluded they were adopted too close to Election Day.",
      "Emory University professor Andra Gillespie said if the race is close, once again it may take time for it to become clear who's won.",
      "\"In general, I want to prepare people for the possibility that it may take a couple of days to count, and just because it may take a couple of days, that doesn't mean people are manipulating the system,\" Gillespie said.",
      "Georgia law requires that the vote be certified \"not later than 5:00 P.M. on the Monday following\" the election, but since this year that Monday falls on Nov. 11, Veterans Day, that deadline has been moved to the following day, Tuesday, Nov. 12.",
      "The deadline for either candidate to request a recount is two days later, Thursday, Nov. 14. In Georgia, a losing candidate may petition for a recount when results are within 0.5% of total votes cast for the office.",

      "Oakland University professor David Dulio said it can be hard to predict when the state's winner will be apparent, because \"elections in Michigan are very decentralized.\"",
      "\"Our elections are run by 1,600 different local clerks who all have to do all of that work and then send it up the chain. That has the potential to slow things down,\" Dulio said. He added that the state's largest city, Detroit, \"is notoriously slow,\" and its third largest city, Warren, will not be taking advantage of a relatively new state law allowing clerks to pre-process absentee ballots up to eight days before Election Day.",
      "County boards of canvassers have up to 14 days after the election to complete their official counts, which are then turned over to a state board. The Secretary of the Board of State Canvassers must announce a winner by Nov. 25.",

      "Either candidate can demand a recount by Nov. 18, and that recount must begin within a day and be completed within five days, Nov. 24 at the latest. That's because on the fourth Tuesday of the month \u2014 Nov. 26 \u2014 the secretary of state is required to meet with Nevada's Supreme Court justices to conduct a statewide canvass. The governor then certifies the election.",

      "The North Carolina State Board of Elections approved emergency measures on Oct. 7 with the goal of improving access to voting for residents of 13 counties affected by the storm.",
      "County election boards are required by state law in North Carolina to meet at 11 a.m. on Nov. 15 to complete their canvases. The State Board of Elections is required to meet on the Tuesday three weeks after the election, Nov. 26. If there are no protests to the results, that board must issue a certification of the election six days later.",
      "A mandatory recount is triggered if the two candidates are separated by less than half a percent, and one of the candidates formally requests to have the votes counted again. That request must be made by noon on Nov. 17, two days after the county-level canvass.",
      "Pennsylvania",

In 2020, that was the beginning of a laborious process to log more than 2.7 million votes returned by mail. Full returns are processed beginning at 9 a.m. on the third day after the election, or Nov. 8 this year.",
      "The state, viewed by many as a crucial must-win for both candidates, was beset by lawsuits in 2020 \u2014 most of which were dismissed or dropped \u2014 as Trump and his allies sought to stymie his growing deficit in the hours and days after polls closed and ballots were counted.",
      "This year, Pennsylvania's Supreme Court in August issued an order expediting election-related cases. The order shortened the window in which a lower court decision can be appealed, from 10 days to three.",
      "University of Pennsylvania professor Marc Meredith said the vast majority of ballots will be counted relatively quickly.",
      "\"We'll get our first vote reports from many counties quite quickly after polls close. These will often be all of the mail ballots that people were able to get through by then,\" Meredith said. \"Nearly all Election Day votes should mostly be reported by early Wednesday morning.\"",

    "summary": "Harris and Trump both have proposed historically large tax overhauls. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are both proposing tax changes that would rank among the largest in U.S. history, but their plans would impact very different groups of Americans by providing tax credits and cuts to some taxpayers, while raising taxes on others.",
      "While taxes are always on the ballot during an presidential election, the 2024 race has even more at stake given that many provisions in Trump's signature tax legislation, the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, will expire at the end of 2025. If Trump wins, he's expected to extend many of those provisions, while Harris has vowed to only keep those that help people earning under $400,000.",
      "At the same time, both candidates have sought to curry favor with some groups of voters by promising specific tax cuts and credits, such as Harris' plan to introduce a $6,000 Child Tax Credit for parents of newborns. Trump, meanwhile, has dangled a host of tax cuts to everyone from senior citizens (promising to get rid of income taxes on Social Security) to tipped workers (vowing to eliminate taxes on tips).",
      "But Trump is also proposing across-the-board tariffs on all imports, a plan that would effectively act as a sales tax on American consumers. That's because the countries that manufacture products imported to the U.S. do not pay tariffs; rather, tariffs are added to the prices of imported products that American consumers purchase.",
      "Here's what to know about how their tax plans stack up.",
      "Would Trump cut or raise your taxes?",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts \u2014 including cutting the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21% \u2014 would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "However, Trump's tax cuts would require Congressional approval, which could prove to be a hurdle if at least one of the chambers is controlled by Democrats.",
      "If Trump is unable to enact his tax cuts but adds his proposed tariffs \u2014 which don't need a Congressional greenlight \u2014 he would instead be introducing the seventh-biggest tax increase since 1940, the Tax Foundation says. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by U.S. consumers, with the typical household paying about $1,700 more each year in additional costs, according to one estimate.",
      "Meanwhile, income taxes would decline under Trump for all income groups, but the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Their analysis includes Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.",
      "Would Harris cut or raise your taxes?",
      "Harris is proposing a mix of tax cuts, tax increases and expanded tax credits that together would rank as the 15th largest tax increase since 1940, according to the Tax Foundation.",
      "However, the impact would be greater on higher-income households, given that she has vowed to not raise taxes on those earning less than $400,000. Her tax increases would also be targeted at businesses, as she wants to boost the corporate tax rate to 28% from its current 21%.",
      "Most low- and middle-income households would actually get a tax break under her proposals, but high-income households would pay substantially more in income taxes than they currently do, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model.",
      "The top 0.1%, or those earning more than $14 million a year, would see their taxes increase by about $167,000 a year.",
      "What are Harris and Trump proposing for families?",
      "Harris wants to expand the Child Tax Credit from its current $2,000 to $6,000 for children up to a year old, $3,600 for kids between 1 to 6, and $3,000 for those between 6 to 17.",
      "Low-income households with kids would receive an additional $2,750 on average from Harris' expanded CTC, according to a Tax Policy Center\u00a0analysis.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's vice presidential candidate, JD Vance, has floated the idea of a $5,000 CTC, but the campaign hasn't introduced more details, according to the Tax Policy Center. If Trump extends the TCJA, the CTC would remain at $2,000 per eligible child.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for taxes on Social Security?",
      "Harris hasn't proposed any tax cuts for Social Security beneficiaries, while Trump has floated eliminating federal income taxes on the retirement payments.",
      "Trump's plan would mostly help middle- and high-income retirees, given that low-income retirees often don't make enough to pay federal income tax on their benefits, according to tax experts. The biggest boost would go to retirees earning between $63,000 and $200,000, the Tax Policy Center estimates.",
      "At the same time, Trump's tax cut would likely hasten the insolvency of the Social Security trust fund, which relies on those income taxes for funding, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Retirees would also be facing a bigger benefit cut, up to 33% of their monthly checks rather than the 23% currently forecast, when the trust fund is exhausted, the group estimates.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for business taxes?",
      "Harris wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from its current 21%.",
      "By comparison, Trump wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%.",
      "\"Nowhere do the candidates' tax plans differ more,\" noted Howard Gleckman, senior fellow of the Tax Policy Center, in a November 1 blog post.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for taxes on overtime and tips?",
      "One place where the candidates converge is on cutting taxes for people who work for tips. Both have portrayed the idea as helping workers with families.",
      "But Trump is also proposing other tax cuts for workers, such as a plan to get rid of federal income taxes on overtime income.",
      "What other tax changes are Harris and Trump proposing?",
      "Harris wants to help people buy homes and start businesses by creating a new $25,000 first-time homebuyers credit and expanding the deduction for startup business expenses from $5,000 to $50,000.",
      "Trump has also proposed making the interest for auto loans tax deductible, a move that would primarily help higher-income taxpayers who itemize their deductions.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 12:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Congress has control over its own members' salary, but has kept their pay frozen for 15 years.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. lawmakers have come a long way since making $6 a day in 1789, but their six-figure annual salary has remained frozen in time since 2009.",
      "The current annual salary for a U.S. senator \u2014 as well as members of the U.S. House of Representatives \u2014 is $174,000. The government-paid salary, set in 2009, reflects a $4,700 pay bump from 2008, but has not been raised since.",
      "Nevertheless, the income is still more than double the median household income which currently stands at $82,207, according to MotioResearch.",
      "By comparison, majority and minority leaders in both chambers receive $193,400. The speaker of the House receives $223,500 annually.",
      "Unlike individuals in other professions, Congress essentially has direct control over the salary of its members, in the sense that any raise or decrease in member compensation must be \"ascertained by Law\" according to\u00a0Article I, Section 6\u00a0\u00a0of the U.S. Constitution. Checks and balances in the legislative process surrounding compensation, however, keep members from giving themselves million-dollar pay raises each year.",
      "\"A change in salary must be done via a bill or joint resolution, both of which are presented to the President for a signature. Thus, the President could veto a bill changing Members' salaries if he thought it inappropriate,\" explains a 2019 report from the Congressional Institute.",
      "That said, perhaps the most powerful protection against inflated salaries in Congress is the ballot box, and the voting public's general skepticism toward increases in Senate pay.",
      "\"Members know constituents are skeptical of congressional pay increases, so they hate voting for them,\" according to the Congressional Institute.",
      "Do senators get a cost of living adjustment?",
      "In spite of public scrutiny, Congress has managed to keep itself among the highest paying professions.",
      "After public outrage quashed a brash attempt by Congress to increase member pay by 51% in early 1989, a more modest hike of 10% was passed through The Ethics Reform Act of 1989, signed into law by President George Bush on Nov. 30, 1989.",
      "Described by CQ Almanac at the time as \"the most sweeping rewrite of the congressional code of conduct in 12 years,\" the legislation allowed salaries for congressional members to reach $125,000 in 1991, a nearly 40% increase from the $89,500 salary that had been set in 1987.",
      "The ethics reform also established an annual automatic cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for members of Congress\u00a0based on the previous year's Employment Cost Index, an increase they have refused since 2009 \u2014 likely to avoid blowback from voters.",
      "If Congress had accepted each of those increases over the years, their annual salary would have reached $208,000 in 2023, as previously\u00a0reported by CBS News. Meanwhile, a report by Congressional Research Service\u00a0 estimates senators are actually making 29% less than they were in 2009 because of inflation.",
      "How rich is the typical senator?",
      "But pay raises can come in less obvious forms, such as subsidies. As reported last January by the New York Times, a provision passed by Congress in late 2022 allowed lawmakers to claim reimbursements for gas, food and lodging while on official business in Washington \u2014 the equivalent of a $34,000 tax-free pay raise, according to the Times.",
      "Most senators built their fortunes before becoming members of Congress, according to Investopedia. A 2019 financial disclosure showed that half of the members of Congress were millionaires, according to\u00a0Open Secrets. Senators are required by Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to disclose their financial assets each year.",
      "Among the richest senators,\u00a0according\u00a0to Quiver Quantitative: Sen. Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, whose net worth is estimated at $548 million; Sen. Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia ($246 million); and Utah Republican Mitt Romney ($235 million).",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 11:57:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Election results that look like victory for one candidate at 10 p.m. could shift the other way at 11:30 p.m., or even later. And it may take days to find out who won.",
    "story": [
      "As polls close across six time zones on election night, millions will be watching to see who the 47th U.S. president will be. But the wait is likely to be a long one for a few reasons that may not be readily apparent. Election results that look like victory for one candidate at 10 p.m. could shift the other way at 11:30 p.m., or even later. And it may take days to find out who won.",
      "The reasons why election watchers may see sudden changes in Kamala Harris' or Donald Trump's standing in the most competitive states is largely influenced by two factors: how absentee ballots are processed and the population density of an area.",
      "That's why CBS News' live coverage will show its whole state models, including exit polls and where there are outstanding votes.",
      "Absentee ballot processing differs by state",
      "It may seem pretty straightforward \u2014 only seven battleground states are considered to be in play in the election: Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, and these are the states likely to determine the winner.",
      "But every state has different rules governing when absentee ballots can be processed and counted. In the early hours of election night, there may be an incomplete picture of who's winning a state because absentee ballots will take longer in some states than others to appear in the count.",
      "Arizona and North Carolina require all ballots to be received on or before Election Day,\u00a0 and both states allow ballots to be processed early, which suggests vote totals on election night should include many mail ballots early on after polls close.",
      "Michigan is among the states that begins processing votes early and requires all ballots to be in on Election Day, so the ballot totals are likely to include the absentee ballots.",
      "Nevada also allows early processing of absentee ballots, but ballots may also be received after Election Day; they must be postmarked by Nov. 5 or received in the Election Department by Nov. 8 if they do not have postmarks. In May, Nevada's secretary of state released guidance aimed at speeding up the release of election results.",
      "\"Releasing results sooner will increase transparency, help us combat misinformation and alleviate pressure on election officials,\" said Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar in a statement at the time.",
      "Early in-person and mail ballots can begin to be counted at 8 a.m. PT on Election Day, By 6 p.m. PT (9 p.m. ET) on Election Day, county clerks are to provide their first election results to the secretary of state, which expects to release unofficial results as soon as polls close. Previously, no counting began before polls closed, according to the secretary of state.",
      "Wisconsin and Pennsylvania both require all ballots to be received by Election Day, but they largely ban processing and counting of absentee ballots until the morning of Election Day. Some of the mail ballots may appear in initial results, but it will take some time for election workers to count these ballots. About 1.8 million people voted absentee in Pennsylvania this year.",
      "In 2020, it was Pennsylvania that clinched the presidency for Joe Biden, but the state did not have a projected winner until four days after the election. Absentee voting was higher that year, however, because of the pandemic. Also new this year, Pennsylvania is requiring all ballots to be submitted by Election Day. It is no longer accepting ballots postmarked on Election Day and\u00a0 received within three days afterward.",
      "Generally, more Democrats have voted early than Republicans, though Republicans made a concerted effort this year to convince their voters to vote by mail or early in person, and appear to have had some success. If they did, it will be in spite of the mixed messages from Donald Trump, who still rails against mail voting.",
      "Urban vs. rural county election results",
      "In the first couple of hours Tuesday night after polls close, there may be a lot of red showing up on the map for Trump and other Republicans, but that may be a function of population density.",
      "Polling precincts in smaller regions often tabulate and report results faster than their urban counterparts simply because there are fewer votes to process. Across the key battleground states in the 2024 presidential election, some of the biggest cities \u2014 population centers associated with heavy Democratic majorities \u2014 are expected to be among the latest to report full results, experts say. Fulton County, Georgia \u2014 home to much of Atlanta \u2014 \"has a notorious reputation for being slow,\" said Emory University professor Andra Gillespie.",
      "\"Fulton County is also the largest county in the state,\" Gillespie said. \"It's not like a county that can turn around after just 10,000 or 15,000 votes.\"",
      "\"Notorious\" is also how a professor in another battleground, Michigan, described the vote processing in that state's biggest city.",
      "\"Detroit is notoriously slow,\" said Oakland University professor David Dulio. And Warren, the state's third-largest city, is also likely to be slower than other areas because it chose not to pre-process absentee ballots. A new law allowed municipalities in the state to begin processing those ballots up to eight days before the election.",
      "\"They're not going to have any of those absentees processed at all before Tuesday,\" Dulio told CBS News.",
      "Experts had similar warnings about election returns for major cities in Arizona, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.",
      "Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Paulina Guti\u00e9rrez told Wisconsin Public Radio recently she expects that city's results to be in after midnight.",
      "\"We are the largest city in the state of Wisconsin,\" Guti\u00e9rrez told the radio station. \"We follow the same laws that everyone else follows here in the state of Wisconsin. We just have a lot more to do.\"",
      "The Supreme Court on Friday left in place a ruling by Pennsylvania's highest court requiring officials to count provisional ballots made by voters whose mail-in ballots were rejected. In a particularly tight race, that could mean a significant delay.",
      "The processing of those votes could follow a similar pattern, taking longer in Philadelphia and other cities than in less populous regions, says University of Pennsylvania professor Marc Meredith.",
      "\"Provisional ballots typically are reported out in smaller counties on Thursday, through Monday in the larger counties,\" Meredith said.",

      "According to Pew Research, the number of Black eligible voters in the U.S. is estimated to be more than 34 million, which is up 7% from the last presidential election in 2020. Black voters account for 14% of all eligible voters.",

      "Sen. Tammy Baldwin is fighting to hold onto her Senate seat in a tight race against Republican Eric Hovde in the battleground state of Wisconsin.",
      "The seat is one of several up for election in 2024 that are seen as crucial for control of the Senate, as Republicans work to build a majority. The race in the Badger State, among the most competitive this cycle, has been a bruising one as the two candidates each sought to portray the other as coastal elites out of step with Wisconsinites.",
      "Baldwin, 62, was first elected to the Senate in 2012 after representing Wisconsin in the House for more than a decade. She has a long history of courting rural voters in the state \u2014 in her last race, she won counties that had supported Trump, despite her progressive politics.",
      "Hovde, 60, also sought the GOP nomination in 2012, but it went to former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, who went on to lose the election to Baldwin. As chairman and CEO of Utah-based Sunwest Bank, Hovde is one of a number of Republican Senate candidates recruited in part for their ability to fund their own campaigns this cycle.",
      "On the campaign trail, Baldwin painted Hovde as an out-of-touch wealthy businessman. He campaigned on issues like immigration and criticized Baldwin for her record in Washington.",
      "The race grew personal in the campaign's final stages, as Republicans ads raised innuendoes about Baldwin's long-term partner, a financial adviser, and her business ties. While Republicans have demanded that Baldwin disclose her partner's assets, claiming in advertisements that Baldwin is \"in bed with Wall Street\" and dubbing her the \"third senator from New York,\" Democrats accused the GOP of trying to draw attention to her sexuality. Baldwin is the first openly LGBTQ senator in history.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats worked to highlight Hovde's connections to California. They've also zeroed in on a number of controversial comments by Hovde, including the suggestion that people in nursing homes don't have the capacity to vote.",
      "The Cook Political Report rated the race as a toss-up heading into Election Day, shifting its rating from lean-Democrat in early October as the state appeared to tighten. Baldwin was considered the most vulnerable of the Democratic Senate candidates in the \"blue wall\" states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, and Hovde saw some momentum in the late stages of the campaign.",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Jacky Rosen and Republican challenger Sam Brown are facing off in Nevada, as Democrats fight to hold onto the seat and their narrow majority in the Senate.",
      "Polls showed Rosen leading in the race, her first reelection bid, as Election Day approached. But the state has historically posed polling difficulties, and was home to the closest Senate race in the country in 2022.",
      "Republicans haven't won a Senate race in the Silver State since 2012, but they flipped the governor's mansion in the last election, which suggested that the Senate seat could be in play in 2024.",
      "Brown is a West Point graduate and combat veteran who was awarded a Purple Heart for his service in Afghanistan, where a roadside bomb explosion left him with third-degree burns. He went on to become a small business owner, and has campaigned on border security and economic issues. Republicans poured money into advertising in the state in the final weeks of the campaign seeking to boost Brown amid heavy Democratic investment in advertising \u2014 especially on abortion.",
      "Democrats hammered Brown over abortion throughout the campaign, as the issue has galvanized voters nationwide since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Abortion is also on the ballot this year in Nevada, with a measure that would enshrine abortion as an individual right in the state constitution.",
      "Outside of abortion, economic issues have also been especially salient in Nevada this cycle. With an economy largely based around tourism and hospitality surrounding Las Vegas, Nevada is home to a significant working class population. The state's economy was among the most impacted by pandemic closures in 2020, leading to a much slower recovery than in other states, and spurring frustration with Democrat-led policies. Brown seized on the issue during the campaign, along with immigration \u2014 two issues on which Republicans have been taking aim at the Biden-Harris administration's policies.",
      "Still, for Rosen \u2014 a 67-year-old former computer programmer and synagogue president \u2014 the race appeared to swing in her favor after Vice President Kamala Harris kicked off her presidential campaign. While President Biden had struggled to garner support in the state, Harris' entrance seemed to shrink the margin by which Democrats had to overperform the top of the ticket. That dynamic was especially pronounced in Nevada, the Cook Political Report noted in an analysis, changing its rating from a toss-up to lean Democrat in August.",

      "Sen. Sherrod Brown is fighting for reelection in Ohio, facing a serious challenge from Republican Bernie Moreno as the GOP targets the long-held Senate seat.",
      "Brown, 71, is the sole Democrat holding statewide office in Ohio and has been among the key targets for Republicans in the 2024 election\u00a0as they look to build a majority in the Senate.",
      "As one of two Democrats facing reelection this year in states former President Donald Trump won in 2020, the three-term incumbent and his Senate colleagues have expended significant effort to bolster his campaign in a race that became the most expensive of the cycle.",
      "Brown's opponent, Moreno, is a Trump-backed Republican who has embraced election denialism and won the nomination over more traditional conservatives in the state. The\u00a0 57-year-old businessman, who was born in Colombia, campaigned on issues that the GOP has seized on nationally, like immigration and the economy, while painting his opponent as an establishment politician out of touch with Ohoians.",
      "Moreno came under fire for legal troubles related to his automotive business, and sustained criticism over comments about abortion, when video footage of the candidate saying he doesn't think abortion is \"an issue\" for women who are \"past 50\" circulated online. At the time, even former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley expressed dismay, saying in a post on X, \"Are you trying to lose the election?\"",
      "Brown hammered Moreno over abortion throughout the campaign, highlighting his openness to restrictions despite the state approving a measure safeguarding abortion access in 2023. And despite Brown's progressive politics, he worked to highlight areas where he and Republican leaders overlap \u2014 like on cracking down on fentanyl.",
      "Brown, who chairs the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs in the Senate, has maintained a strong working-class brand in the state and has historically appealed to ticket-splitters. Weeks ahead of Election Day, even former Ohio Gov. Bob Taft, a Republican, threw his support behind Brown, calling him an \"effective, experienced advocate in the U.S. Senate.\"",

    "story": [
      "Two-term Republican Sen. Deb Fischer is defending her Senate seat in a contest that's grown unexpectedly competitive in Nebraska, a reliably red state, with polls indicating a tight race against independent candidate Dan Osborn in the lead-up to Election Day.",
      "Osborn is a 49-year-old political newcomer, a Navy veteran, mechanic and union leader who led the strike at Omaha's Kellogg plant in 2021. His campaign received a surge of outside funding that forced Republicans to redouble their efforts in a race that was thought to be an easy win. Osborn billed his challenge against Fischer as offering a change to the status quo, painting his opponent as an establishment politician controlled by corporate interests. He has pledged not to caucus with either Democrats or Republicans in the Senate if elected.",
      "During her time in the Senate, Fischer, 73, has served on the powerful armed services and appropriations committees. She has a background as a cattle rancher and has seen easy victories in two previous contests against Democratic opponents. This cycle, she has described her independent challenger as a \"Democrat in disguise\" in the final weeks of the campaign, while leaning on an endorsement from former President Donald Trump.",
      "Osborn has expressed positions generally shared by moderates, including opposition to national abortion restrictions, support for \"reasonable gun safety measures\" and stronger border security, while leaning into a populist message. In a recent ad, he likened his Republican opponent to Hillary Clinton, while highlighting areas where he is \"with Trump\" \u2014 on China, the border and \"draining the swamp.\"",
      "Senate bids from independent candidates under similar conditions in red states have previously fallen short, like in Utah in 2022 and Alaska in 2020. Nebraska is a solidly red state, with nearly twice as many registered Republicans as Democrats. But it's also home to a large share of nonpartisan voters. And without a Democrat in the race to draw the party's votes, the race appeared to be within striking distance for Osborn heading into Election Day.",
      "The outcome of the race has implications for the makeup of the Senate. Democrats were\u00a0 fighting to hang onto their narrow 51-49 majority, with few opportunities for pickups and a long list of states to defend.",

      "Rep. Ruben Gallego and Republican Kari Lake are facing off in battleground Arizona in a high-profile Senate race as Democrats seek to hang onto their narrow control of the chamber at large.",
      "Gallego and Lake have been duking it out for the open seat after Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a former Democrat turned independent, opted not to seek reelection. The seat is among a number that Democrats have been fighting to hang onto this cycle, with a Senate map that's put them on defense across a handful of races\u00a0in 2024.",
      "Gallego, 44, is a Marine combat veteran who was first elected to the House in 2014 and represents a district that includes parts of Phoenix and Glendale. In his campaign for Senate, the progressive lawmaker has worked to court voters in the middle, while painting his opponent as extreme. Gallego would be the first Latino senator to represent Arizona.",
      "Lake, who narrowly lost a hard-right campaign for governor in 2022, is a former TV news anchor and close ally of former President Donald Trump. The 55-year-old, who has widespread name recognition in the state, has been a vocal election denier regarding the outcome of both her own gubernatorial race and Trump's 2020 matchup against President Biden. But she often reeled in that message during the Senate campaign. In the lead-up to Election Day, Lake launched personal attacks at Gallego, including about the circumstances of his divorce.",
      "Until Sinema won her Senate race in 2018, a Democrat hadn't been elected to the Senate in Arizona in three decades, though Sinema went on to leave the party. Then in 2020, Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat, won a competitive Senate race to serve the remainder of Sen. John McCain's term after his death, becoming the first Democrat to hold the seat since 1962.",
      "The historically Republican state has been a key battleground this cycle, and as a border state, has seen immigration become particularly salient for voters \u2014 an issue that has tended to be more favorable for Republicans.",

Although the 68-year-old has fended off previous challenges, shifting demographics and political dynamics in the state appeared to enhance the pickup opportunity for Republicans in the 2024 election.",
      "Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL and founder of an aerial firefighting company, received his party's backing as the candidate to take on Tester. The 38-year-old worked to draw a contrast with Tester, portraying himself as an outsider during the campaign while painting the Democrat as an establishment candidate with deep ties to Washington. He also touted bringing jobs to Montana with his business, which made him wealthy enough to help fund his campaign.",
      "Sheehy, who grew up in Minnesota, has faced criticism for lacking the deep roots that Tester has in the state. He has also faced questions about discrepancies in his story of how he sustained a gunshot wound. Meanwhile, Tester sought to portray his opponent as an out-of-touch carpetbagger, likening the GOP candidate to rich out-of-staters who have flocked to Montana in recent years.",
      "Tester is a third-generation Montana farmer. First elected to the Senate in 2006, his brand is well known in the state, and despite its more conservative politics, he's won reelection twice as a moderate Democrat.",
      "But Montana's political landscape has changed. In 2020, Donald Trump won Montana by more than 16 points, and trends suggest that an influx of new residents in the state is made up largely of Republicans. The state's changing dynamics posed a serious hurdle for Tester \u2014 the sole Democrat serving in statewide office in Montana.",

      "The \"Election Integrity Community,\" which launched in late October, has hundreds of new posts each day, many of which contain misleading or false claims, CBS News found. Misinformation experts are concerned that mobilizing people to gather unverified claims of election fraud is fueling the spread of false narratives that undermine trust in election security.",
      "CBS News reached out Saturday to representatives for Musk's America PAC for comment.",
      "Musk has become a prominent voice in the 2024 election with his outspoken public and financial support of former President Donald Trump, and he frequently uses his X account to amplify election misinformation. A CBS News investigation found that half of Musk's posts on election security this year contained false or misleading claims.",
      "Many of the claims originate elsewhere on X and are reposted onto the community page. Some of the posts falsely claimed that voting machines are \"flipping votes\" from Trump to Harris. Other posts reshared a\u00a0fabricated video\u00a0that officials say was likely created by a Russian troll farm. Another recirculated a debunked claim that Michigan voters were casting multiple ballots.",

A county executive told NBC News the postal worker was being harassed as a result of the video.",

      "Trump cast his ballot Tuesday in Palm Beach County, along with his wife, Melania.",
      "Why can Donald Trump vote even though he was convicted of a felony?",
      "While the state of Florida generally makes it challenging for people convicted of felonies to vote until they have served out their full sentence, Trump benefits from the fact that he was convicted outside of the state.",
      "Florida law specifies that people convicted outside of the state are subject to the voting laws of whichever state they were convicted in \u2013 New York, in this case. Trump can thank a 2021 New York state law\u00a0for his voting privileges in this election, one that allows felons to vote if they are not currently incarcerated.",
      "In Trump's case, he was convicted in New York in May, but has yet to be sentenced. This makes him an eligible voter in the state of Florida.",
      "He was originally scheduled to be sentenced in the case on Sept. 18, however his attorneys asked on Aug. 14 for his sentencing to be pushed back until after the presidential election. They argued a delay is necessary to resolve ongoing legal challenges to his conviction.",
      "In early September, Justice Juan Merchan issued an order delaying sentencing until Nov. 26, after the election.",
      "Merchan wrote that he made the decision \"to avoid any appearance \u2014 however unwarranted \u2014 that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching Presidential election in which the Defendant is a candidate.\"",
      "What felonies was Trump convicted of?",
      "Trump was convicted in May by a unanimous jury on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records tied to hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 election. Prosecutors stated that Trump signed off on a scheme to hide reimbursements to a lawyer who wired a $130,000 \"hush money\" payment to the adult film state just days before the 2016 presidential election. Trump has denied the allegations and he pleaded not guilty.",
      "\"A jury of 12 New Yorkers swiftly and unanimously convicted Donald Trump of 34 felony counts,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in early September after Trump was convicted.",
      "Merchan has a broad range in determining Trump's sentence. The charges carry a maximum sentence of up to four years in jail, but Merchan can also hand down a sentence that involves a variety of alternatives to incarceration, including probation. Most legal observers expect Trump to avoid jail time, given his status as a first-time offender and sentences handed down for the same crime in other cases.",
      "Trump has denied all allegations in this case, as well as four other criminal cases, two of which revolve around his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and one, which was dismissed, where he was charged for taking confidential documents from the White House at the end of his presidency.",
      "Where these go from here could very well depend on whether Trump is elected.",

    "title": "Here's how Harris and Trump's tax plans would impact your taxes",
    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 12:35:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Harris and Trump both have proposed historically large tax overhauls. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are both proposing tax changes that would rank among the largest in U.S. history, but their plans would impact very different groups of Americans by providing tax credits and cuts to some taxpayers, while raising taxes on others.",
      "While taxes are always on the ballot during an presidential election, the 2024 race has even more at stake given that many provisions in Trump's signature tax legislation, the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, will expire at the end of 2025. If Trump wins, he's expected to extend many of those provisions, while Harris has vowed to only keep those that help people earning under $400,000.",
      "At the same time, both candidates have sought to curry favor with some groups of voters by promising specific tax cuts and credits, such as Harris' plan to introduce a $6,000 Child Tax Credit for parents of newborns. Trump, meanwhile, has dangled a host of tax cuts to everyone from senior citizens (promising to get rid of income taxes on Social Security) to tipped workers (vowing to eliminate taxes on tips).",
      "But Trump is also proposing across-the-board tariffs on all imports, a plan that would effectively act as a sales tax on American consumers. That's because the countries that manufacture products imported to the U.S. do not pay tariffs; rather, tariffs are added to the prices of imported products that American consumers purchase.",
      "Here's what to know about how their tax plans stack up.",
      "Would Trump cut or raise your taxes?",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts \u2014 including cutting the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21% \u2014 would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "However, Trump's tax cuts would require Congressional approval, which could prove to be a hurdle if at least one of the chambers is controlled by Democrats.",
      "If Trump is unable to enact his tax cuts but adds his proposed tariffs \u2014 which don't need a Congressional greenlight \u2014 he would instead be introducing the seventh-biggest tax increase since 1940, the Tax Foundation says. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by U.S. consumers, with the typical household paying about $1,700 more each year in additional costs, according to one estimate.",
      "Meanwhile, income taxes would decline under Trump for all income groups, but the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Their analysis includes Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.",
      "Would Harris cut or raise your taxes?",
      "Harris is proposing a mix of tax cuts, tax increases and expanded tax credits that together would rank as the 15th largest tax increase since 1940, according to the Tax Foundation.",
      "However, the impact would be greater on higher-income households, given that she has vowed to not raise taxes on those earning less than $400,000. Her tax increases would also be targeted at businesses, as she wants to boost the corporate tax rate to 28% from its current 21%.",
      "Most low- and middle-income households would actually get a tax break under her proposals, but high-income households would pay substantially more in income taxes than they currently do, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model.",
      "The top 0.1%, or those earning more than $14 million a year, would see their taxes increase by about $167,000 a year.",
      "What are Harris and Trump proposing for families?",
      "Harris wants to expand the Child Tax Credit from its current $2,000 to $6,000 for children up to a year old, $3,600 for kids between 1 to 6, and $3,000 for those between 6 to 17.",
      "Low-income households with kids would receive an additional $2,750 on average from Harris' expanded CTC, according to a Tax Policy Center\u00a0analysis.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's vice presidential candidate, JD Vance, has floated the idea of a $5,000 CTC, but the campaign hasn't introduced more details, according to the Tax Policy Center. If Trump extends the TCJA, the CTC would remain at $2,000 per eligible child.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for taxes on Social Security?",
      "Harris hasn't proposed any tax cuts for Social Security beneficiaries, while Trump has floated eliminating federal income taxes on the retirement payments.",
      "Trump's plan would mostly help middle- and high-income retirees, given that low-income retirees often don't make enough to pay federal income tax on their benefits, according to tax experts. The biggest boost would go to retirees earning between $63,000 and $200,000, the Tax Policy Center estimates.",
      "At the same time, Trump's tax cut would likely hasten the insolvency of the Social Security trust fund, which relies on those income taxes for funding, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Retirees would also be facing a bigger benefit cut, up to 33% of their monthly checks rather than the 23% currently forecast, when the trust fund is exhausted, the group estimates.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for business taxes?",
      "Harris wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from its current 21%.",
      "By comparison, Trump wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%.",
      "\"Nowhere do the candidates' tax plans differ more,\" noted Howard Gleckman, senior fellow of the Tax Policy Center, in a November 1 blog post.",
      "What are Harris and Trump's plans for taxes on overtime and tips?",
      "One place where the candidates converge is on cutting taxes for people who work for tips. Both have portrayed the idea as helping workers with families.",
      "But Trump is also proposing other tax cuts for workers, such as a plan to get rid of federal income taxes on overtime income.",
      "What other tax changes are Harris and Trump proposing?",
      "Harris wants to help people buy homes and start businesses by creating a new $25,000 first-time homebuyers credit and expanding the deduction for startup business expenses from $5,000 to $50,000.",
      "Trump has also proposed making the interest for auto loans tax deductible, a move that would primarily help higher-income taxpayers who itemize their deductions.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. lawmakers have come a long way since making $6 a day in 1789, but their six-figure annual salary has remained frozen in time since 2009.",
      "The current annual salary for a U.S. senator \u2014 as well as members of the U.S. House of Representatives \u2014 is $174,000. The government-paid salary, set in 2009, reflects a $4,700 pay bump from 2008, but has not been raised since.",
      "Nevertheless, the income is still more than double the median household income which currently stands at $82,207, according to MotioResearch.",
      "By comparison, majority and minority leaders in both chambers receive $193,400. The speaker of the House receives $223,500 annually.",
      "Unlike individuals in other professions, Congress essentially has direct control over the salary of its members, in the sense that any raise or decrease in member compensation must be \"ascertained by Law\" according to\u00a0Article I, Section 6\u00a0\u00a0of the U.S. Constitution. Checks and balances in the legislative process surrounding compensation, however, keep members from giving themselves million-dollar pay raises each year.",
      "\"A change in salary must be done via a bill or joint resolution, both of which are presented to the President for a signature. Thus, the President could veto a bill changing Members' salaries if he thought it inappropriate,\" explains a 2019 report from the Congressional Institute.",
      "That said, perhaps the most powerful protection against inflated salaries in Congress is the ballot box, and the voting public's general skepticism toward increases in Senate pay.",
      "\"Members know constituents are skeptical of congressional pay increases, so they hate voting for them,\" according to the Congressional Institute.",
      "Do senators get a cost of living adjustment?",
      "In spite of public scrutiny, Congress has managed to keep itself among the highest paying professions.",
      "After public outrage quashed a brash attempt by Congress to increase member pay by 51% in early 1989, a more modest hike of 10% was passed through The Ethics Reform Act of 1989, signed into law by President George Bush on Nov. 30, 1989.",
      "Described by CQ Almanac at the time as \"the most sweeping rewrite of the congressional code of conduct in 12 years,\" the legislation allowed salaries for congressional members to reach $125,000 in 1991, a nearly 40% increase from the $89,500 salary that had been set in 1987.",
      "The ethics reform also established an annual automatic cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for members of Congress\u00a0based on the previous year's Employment Cost Index, an increase they have refused since 2009 \u2014 likely to avoid blowback from voters.",
      "If Congress had accepted each of those increases over the years, their annual salary would have reached $208,000 in 2023, as previously\u00a0reported by CBS News. Meanwhile, a report by Congressional Research Service\u00a0 estimates senators are actually making 29% less than they were in 2009 because of inflation.",
      "How rich is the typical senator?",
      "But pay raises can come in less obvious forms, such as subsidies. As reported last January by the New York Times, a provision passed by Congress in late 2022 allowed lawmakers to claim reimbursements for gas, food and lodging while on official business in Washington \u2014 the equivalent of a $34,000 tax-free pay raise, according to the Times.",
      "Most senators built their fortunes before becoming members of Congress, according to Investopedia. A 2019 financial disclosure showed that half of the members of Congress were millionaires, according to\u00a0Open Secrets. Senators are required by Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to disclose their financial assets each year.",

    "summary": "Election results that look like victory for one candidate at 10 p.m. could shift the other way at 11:30 p.m., or even later. And it may take days to find out who won.",
    "story": [
      "As polls close across six time zones on election night, millions will be watching to see who the 47th U.S. president will be. But the wait is likely to be a long one for a few reasons that may not be readily apparent. Election results that look like victory for one candidate at 10 p.m. could shift the other way at 11:30 p.m., or even later. And it may take days to find out who won.",
      "The reasons why election watchers may see sudden changes in Kamala Harris' or Donald Trump's standing in the most competitive states is largely influenced by two factors: how absentee ballots are processed and the population density of an area.",
      "That's why CBS News' live coverage will show its whole state models, including exit polls and where there are outstanding votes.",
      "Absentee ballot processing differs by state",
      "It may seem pretty straightforward \u2014 only seven battleground states are considered to be in play in the election: Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, and these are the states likely to determine the winner.",
      "But every state has different rules governing when absentee ballots can be processed and counted. In the early hours of election night, there may be an incomplete picture of who's winning a state because absentee ballots will take longer in some states than others to appear in the count.",
      "Arizona and North Carolina require all ballots to be received on or before Election Day,\u00a0 and both states allow ballots to be processed early, which suggests vote totals on election night should include many mail ballots early on after polls close.",
      "Michigan is among the states that begins processing votes early and requires all ballots to be in on Election Day, so the ballot totals are likely to include the absentee ballots.",
      "Nevada also allows early processing of absentee ballots, but ballots may also be received after Election Day; they must be postmarked by Nov. 5 or received in the Election Department by Nov. 8 if they do not have postmarks. In May, Nevada's secretary of state released guidance aimed at speeding up the release of election results.",
      "\"Releasing results sooner will increase transparency, help us combat misinformation and alleviate pressure on election officials,\" said Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar in a statement at the time.",
      "Early in-person and mail ballots can begin to be counted at 8 a.m. PT on Election Day, By 6 p.m. PT (9 p.m. ET) on Election Day, county clerks are to provide their first election results to the secretary of state, which expects to release unofficial results as soon as polls close. Previously, no counting began before polls closed, according to the secretary of state.",
      "Wisconsin and Pennsylvania both require all ballots to be received by Election Day, but they largely ban processing and counting of absentee ballots until the morning of Election Day. Some of the mail ballots may appear in initial results, but it will take some time for election workers to count these ballots. About 1.8 million people voted absentee in Pennsylvania this year.",
      "In 2020, it was Pennsylvania that clinched the presidency for Joe Biden, but the state did not have a projected winner until four days after the election. Absentee voting was higher that year, however, because of the pandemic. Also new this year, Pennsylvania is requiring all ballots to be submitted by Election Day. It is no longer accepting ballots postmarked on Election Day and\u00a0 received within three days afterward.",
      "Generally, more Democrats have voted early than Republicans, though Republicans made a concerted effort this year to convince their voters to vote by mail or early in person, and appear to have had some success. If they did, it will be in spite of the mixed messages from Donald Trump, who still rails against mail voting.",
      "Urban vs. rural county election results",
      "In the first couple of hours Tuesday night after polls close, there may be a lot of red showing up on the map for Trump and other Republicans, but that may be a function of population density.",
      "Polling precincts in smaller regions often tabulate and report results faster than their urban counterparts simply because there are fewer votes to process. Across the key battleground states in the 2024 presidential election, some of the biggest cities \u2014 population centers associated with heavy Democratic majorities \u2014 are expected to be among the latest to report full results, experts say. Fulton County, Georgia \u2014 home to much of Atlanta \u2014 \"has a notorious reputation for being slow,\" said Emory University professor Andra Gillespie.",
      "\"Fulton County is also the largest county in the state,\" Gillespie said. \"It's not like a county that can turn around after just 10,000 or 15,000 votes.\"",
      "\"Notorious\" is also how a professor in another battleground, Michigan, described the vote processing in that state's biggest city.",
      "\"Detroit is notoriously slow,\" said Oakland University professor David Dulio. And Warren, the state's third-largest city, is also likely to be slower than other areas because it chose not to pre-process absentee ballots. A new law allowed municipalities in the state to begin processing those ballots up to eight days before the election.",
      "\"They're not going to have any of those absentees processed at all before Tuesday,\" Dulio told CBS News.",
      "Experts had similar warnings about election returns for major cities in Arizona, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.",
      "Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Paulina Guti\u00e9rrez told Wisconsin Public Radio recently she expects that city's results to be in after midnight.",
      "\"We are the largest city in the state of Wisconsin,\" Guti\u00e9rrez told the radio station. \"We follow the same laws that everyone else follows here in the state of Wisconsin. We just have a lot more to do.\"",
      "The Supreme Court on Friday left in place a ruling by Pennsylvania's highest court requiring officials to count provisional ballots made by voters whose mail-in ballots were rejected. In a particularly tight race, that could mean a significant delay.",
      "The processing of those votes could follow a similar pattern, taking longer in Philadelphia and other cities than in less populous regions, says University of Pennsylvania professor Marc Meredith.",

      "\"The No.1 tip I could give to fans to protect themselves is to make sure they have a secure, unique password, that they are not using on other platforms,\" Kaitlyn Henrich, head of global at Live Nation Entertainment, parent company of Ticketmaster, told Qurashi.",
      "Asked if the company has failed its customers, Henrich added, \"We are constantly striving to look at what's going on and improve the experience.\"",
      "For now, that experience includes a 48-hour average wait for fans to have their tickets restored after notifying the company of their disappearance. As an added precaution, Ticketmaster is limiting ticket transfers to 72 hours before Eras Tour concerts and requiring two-factor authentication for some transactions.",
      "\"It's a very small percent, less than a tenth of one percent,\" said Henrich, \"but obviously for that one fan who's going through that, it's a really stressful situation.\"",

      "According to a recently unsealed\u00a0criminal complaint, Philippi allegedly told multiple undercover sources from the FBI that he wanted to blow up multiple energy stations to \"shock the system\" and lead to the collapse of the nation's power grid. He also allegedly talked about other attacks, including a mass shooting at at YMCA facility and a plan to derail a train in Tennessee. Philippi allegedly told the FBI sources that he was affiliated with multiple white supremacist groups and said he believed a conspiracy theory about the 9/11 attacks.",

Later in the month, he allegedly said he wanted to target two substations in the Nashville area.",

Then, they were buried.",
      "Among them was a veteran held at a Confederate prison known as Andersonville. Several were wounded in combat and others fought in critical battles including Gettysburg, Stones River and the Atlanta campaign. One man survived being shot thanks to his pocket watch - which he kept until his death - and another deserted the Confederate Army and joined the Union forces.",

In 2016, a volunteer motorcycle group escorted the remains of one veteran cross country from Oregon to the final resting place in Maine. In South Carolina, the remains of 21 Confederate soldiers recovered from forgotten graves beneath the stands of a military college's football stadium were reburied in 2005.",
      "Sometimes reburials spark controversy.

After his remains were delivered to Pawtucket City Hall, he was buried with military honors at his family's plot in Oak Grove Cemetery.",
      "Pawtucket Mayor Donald R. Grebien said Johnson's burial service was the right thing to do.",

      "The task of piecing together Johnson's life story was left to Amelia Boivin, the constituent liaison in the Pawtucket mayor's office. A history buff, she recalled getting the call requesting the city take possession of his remains and bury them with his family. She got to work and Johnson's story became the talk of City Hall.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 06:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "When people cast ballots in the 2024 presidential election, their votes translate into Electoral College representation. Many wonder why the system still exists, and if it should.",
    "story": [
      "Until polls close on Election Day, millions of people across the United States are casting ballots for their preferred candidates to succeed President Biden in the White House. But determining the winner is not as simple as totaling up how many people voted for Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump, because of the Electoral College.",
      "The Electoral College is a controversial step in the U.S. election process that dates back to the 18th century. While there's a growing movement to\u00a0try to get rid of it, others defend the system that gives some states more weight in presidential elections.",
      "Why was the Electoral College created in the first place?",
      "Whether the Electoral College is fair or necessary is subject to fierce debate that in some ways dates back to its founding.",
      "The concept emerged during the Constitutional Convention, which took place over a four-month period in 1787 to address issues with the early system of government in the United States. State delegates who attended the convention were divided in their views on how the country should elect its president, with some suggesting Congress should choose the executive and others advocating for direct democracy, where citizens would vote to elect their leader. At the time, the right to vote was almost entirely restricted to White men who owned property.",
      "What to do about the method for selecting a president became a lingering debate at the convention, said Michael Thorning, director of the Bipartisan Policy Center's democracy project, who told CBS News the issue was finally passed off to a group tasked with resolving prior disagreements over certain areas of the Constitution. It was called the Committee on Unfinished Parts.",
      "Committee members settled on the Electoral College as a compromise.",
      "\"There were some attendees of the Constitutional Convention who did not trust the popular will as much,\" said Thorning. \"They were concerned that you would be asking people with very little political experience, knowledge of the candidates, understanding of their platforms, to select someone that they may not know. And so they may just vote only for the person whose name they recognize, versus the most competent candidate. So, this was a bargain.\"",
      "Population size was a major point of contention. Delegates who attended the convention came from large states, like New York and Pennsylvania, and small states, like New Jersey and New Hampshire. While some of the larger states would have favored an election system driven by the popular vote, which would give them a greater say in the election than a state with fewer voters, Thorning said delegates from some smaller states had concerns about being \"overrun\" by more populous neighbors.",
      "Other large states that sent delegates to the Constitutional Convention had institutionalized slavery. At the time, hundreds of thousands of people were enslaved across the South, amounting to about 40% of the Southern population. Under the notorious \"three-fifths compromise\" decided during the same convention \u2014 which allowed Southern states to count three-fifths of their enslaved populations in their total census \u2014 slave-holding states could have considerable power in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College, even though only a fraction of their residents were allowed to vote.",
      "Why do electoral votes matter for presidential elections?",
      "Elements of the Electoral College have changed since the Constitution was drafted, since voting rights expanded and citizens choose their state's electors. But its fundamental role in picking the president has remained.",
      "\"We have 50 state elections all individually happening,\" said Thorning. \"What's important is who wins each of the 50 state elections.\"",
      "Electors are allocated to each state roughly based on its population, with the number of electors equal to the state's total number of U.S. senators and House members in Congress. That means even the least-populated states get three, while many states have a dozen or more; the state with the largest population, California, currently has 54.",
      "In most states, it's a winner-take-all system where all of the electoral votes go to whichever candidate won a majority of the popular vote in the sate. Only Maine and Nebraska have slightly different systems for dividing up their electors based on who won at the congressional district level.",
      "There are 538 electors who will case votes in the Electoral College, and a presidential candidate needs to secure at least 270 of those votes in order to win.",
      "It's possible to win the popular vote nationwide but still lose the election, if states with enough electoral votes go the other way.",
      "This system also means candidates end up focusing a disproportionate amount of their time and funds on campaigning in a small number of battleground states that could tip the balance in their favor.",
      "Why do we vote if there is an Electoral College?",
      "When voters cast their presidential ballot, they're actually choosing the group of electors who on good faith will represent the political party is affiliated with their preferred candidate. The people who fill these roles are selected by their party and are typically local officials or committed political supporters.",
      "Thorning called the popular vote for president \"a really unofficial gauge of the election.\"",
      "\"While voters go to the polls and see a presidential candidate on the ballot, they are actually voting for electors who represent those people,\" he said. \"Whoever the prevailing electors are in those elections, they are the people who ultimately cast the Electoral College votes. So, the post-election period, really, is a process of translating these many popular vote elections into the Electoral College.\"",
      "After the November election, the electors gather in each state in December to formally cast their votes for their state's winner.",
      "Why do some critics want to get rid of the Electoral College?",
      "Critics of the Electoral College primarily take issue with the fact it leaves open the possibility that the outcome may not reflect the results of the popular vote. This happened most recently in 2016, when Trump won the presidency with a majority of Electoral College votes despite Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, winning the nationwide popular vote by almost 3 million.",
      "Similar conundrums played out in a handful of presidential elections before, including in 2000, when George W. Bush won the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote to then-Vice President Al Gore. In that race, the popular vote split between Bush and Gore by a very small margin \u2014 much narrower than in 2016.",
      "\"Over time, the world has evolved, even while the Electoral College has not evolved so much,\" said Thorning. \"I think by some standards, the idea that it is not a direct popular vote for president in modern times does strike some people as not being democratic.\"",
      "Under one proposed alternative, called the\u00a0National Popular Vote Compact, states would agree to give their electoral votes to whichever candidate wins the national popular vote \u2014 even if it doesn't match the outcome in their state.",
      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris' vice presidential running mate, recently\u00a0spoke out against the Electoral College, saying \"we need a popular vote\" during a campaign event in California.",
      "\"I think all of us know the Electoral College needs to go,\" Walz said. \"But that's not the world we live in. So we need to win Beaver County, Pennsylvania. We need to be able to go into York, Pennsylvania, and win. We need to be in western Wisconsin and win. We need to be in Reno, Nevada, and win.\"",
      "The Harris-Walz campaign followed up with a statement saying his comments did not reflect their official position on the issue.",
      "Thorning pointed out that while the Electoral College system is partly enshrined in the Constitution, it can be amended.",
      "\"I think we should continue to debate aspects of our democracy and what's in our Constitution,\" Thorning said. \"But at the end of the day, this is the system so far that we've agreed to, and so we have to conduct our politics through the system that we have, and conduct change to that system through the system that we have. There is a way to make that change, if there is support for it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump may have joined the ranks of America's richest people through his real estate holdings, from golf courses to hotels, but it's his stake in the fledgling Trump Media & Technology Group that has more than doubled his net worth to $5.5 billion this year.",
      "The money-losing social media company, which trades under the ticker symbol DJT, the same as Trump's initials, has had a volatile year since going public in March. An initial surge in the market value of Trump Media in March made the former president's 57% stake worth\u00a0$5.2 billion, but that tumbled to $1.4 billion when the stock hit a low of $11.75 in September.",
      "The wild swings in Trump Media shares has prompted comparisons to meme stocks, or companies that trade on social media buzz rather than revenue or profit growth, investors' favored yardsticks. Trump Media, whose main asset is the Truth Social platform, has\u00a0declining revenue and large losses, with University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter telling CBS MoneyWatch that the \"stock is incredibly overvalued.\"",
      "Even so, Trump's wealth dwarfs that of his rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, who with her husband, Douglas Emhoff, is worth about $8 million, according to an estimate by Forbes. Harris' wealth stems from her decades in public service, book royalties and investments.",

      "Despite the roller coast in DJT shares, Trump's stake in the social network has helped lift his overall net worth to $5.5 billion, more than double his $2.4 billion in wealth at the start of 2024, according to Forbes.",
      "His stake in DJT shares, worth about $3.5 billion based on its November 1 closing price, remains his single largest financial asset. That's down from $5.9 billion when the shares touched a recent high of $51.51 on October 29. Since then, DJT stock has shed half its value.",
      "Because Trump has vowed not to sell\u00a0any DJT shares, his stock market wealth for now remains largely on paper.",
      "Where does Trump's wealth come from?",
      "Despite his billions in DJT stock, Trump's original fortune stems from real estate, spanning residential buildings in New York City to golf courses and hotels around the globe.",
      "Trump got his start working for his father, Fred Trump, a New York City real estate developer who built more than 27,000 apartments and row houses in Queens and Brooklyn, according to the New York Times. Trump claims his dad's loan of $1 million helped him build his own business, which now includes holdings such as the Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and the Trump Tower in Manhattan.",
      "One of his largest assets is his $500 million stake in 1290 Avenue of the Americas, an office building in Manhattan, while his Trump National Doral Miami Golf Resort is worth about $300 million, according to Bloomberg News.",
      "Trump's earnings from crypto, NFTs and Bibles",

      "A $59.99 Bible that Trump endorsed in partnership with singer Lee Greenwood earned him $300,000 in royalties, while he booked $4.5 million for \"Letters to Trump,\" a 2023 collection of letters sent to Trump over the years from celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey.",
      "The financial disclosure forms also show that Trump continues to earn money from the reality show \"The Apprentice\" and his 1987 book \"The Art of the Deal.\" He receives a pension from the Screen Actors Guild of more than $90,000 annually.",
      "Despite the investments in crypto and NFTs, Trump's investments are largely held in stocks, index funds and bonds, including U.S. Treasuries, according to the form. He also owns at least $100,000 in gold bars.",
      "Trump's liabilities",
      "The disclosure forms, which are required of all presidential candidates, outlined liabilities including several mortgages on Trump Tower and other properties, as well as newer debts related to legal judgments.",
      "Trump is appealing a trio of judgments against him for more than half a billion dollars. They include a combined $88.3 million from two cases in which juries found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation of the writer E. Jean Carroll, as well as a New York State case in which a judge ruled that Trump owes more than $450 million, including interest, for a fraud scheme.

      "In the early days of the war, Israel's leadership presented a unified front as it responded to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. But as the war dragged on and spread to Lebanon, key policy differences have emerged. While Netanyahu has called for continued military pressure on Hamas, Gallant had taken a more pragmatic approach, saying that military force has created the necessary conditions for a diplomatic deal that could bring home hostages held by the militant group.",

An American company is working to change that, and their innovation is a contender for this year's annual Earthshot Prize, an award handed out by Britain's Prince William to highlight solutions to the climate crisis.",
      "Like most 12-year-olds, Dimakatso Ngcobo isn't a fan of household chores. She wasn't shy about telling CBS News so as she scrubbed an old pot, a few plastic plates and two old peanut butter jars that she and her mom use as cups.",
      "Last year, her mom couldn't afford the rent at their home in Soweto, outside Johannesburg, so they were evicted. The mother and daughter walked to the community of Kokotela, a few miles further south, to buy a tiny dirt patch of land for $200. There, they put up a new one-room home made of metal sheeting.",
      "Ngcobo told CBS News that while there's no running water and no toilet, what she missed the most was electricity.",
      "\"It is a bit hard. We don't have much. We don't afford that much,\" she said, adding on a more positive note: \"At least the school nearby is OK, as I want to be a doctor one day.\"",
      "She was also grateful for her world getting just a little bit brighter recently, thanks to the U.S. company d.light, which was created by two co-founders who met at Stanford University's school of design. The company has now connected more than 180 million people in 70 countries to a clean source of energy from solar power.",
      "\"We are very focused on making these products as affordable as possible, and the way we do that is by pay-as-you-go financing, where customers can pay 20 cents a day or 30 cents per day, similar to what they would spend on kerosene or diesel for the diesel generator,\" said d.light co-founder Nedjip Tozun. \"But instead of literally burning away that money, they can invest it into an asset that they are going to own that is going to deliver power for many years.\"",
      "D.light is one of the 15\u00a0finalists in the running for a 2024 Earthshot Prize. Winners will be chosen Wednesday in five categories: Protect and Restore Nature, Clean Our Air, Revive Our Oceans, Build a Waste-Free World and Fix our Climate. The winner in each category will be awarded 1 million U.K. pounds, or about $1.3 million, intended to help scale-up their respective projects.",
      "William, the Prince of Wales and future British monarch, has said he took inspiration from President John F. Kennedy's 1962 \"Moonshot\" challenge to land a man on the moon within 10 years when he created the Earthshot Prize four years ago with the ambition of finding and elevating innovative global climate solutions. The Earthshot initiative's ambitious goal since it launched has been to repair the planet within 10 years.",
      "The Earthshot award ceremony has come to the African continent for the first time this year, with Cape Town in South Africa playing host.",
      "Delegates at the Earthshot awards in Cape Town told CBS News ahead of Tuesday's U.S. national election that they've been disappointed that climate change didn't emerge as a central theme in the presidential race, and they worry it could fall even further from the focus of U.S. policy conversation.",
      "New Yorker Shantha Bloemen, CEO of Mobility for Africa, a start-up that provides green mobility services to rural women in Africa using custom-built electric tricycles and bespoke solar powered batteries, was nominated for an award this year but didn't make the finalist list. She said she was still hoping to find partners in Cape Town this week to help her scale up her company's operations.",
      "\"We need urgent action and strong political leadership to unlock the financing to combat this crisis,\" she told CBS News. \"There are many of us with proven solutions to mitigate the worst impact on those living on the front line of the crisis, but without strong U.S. political leadership, it will be difficult to unlock the finance needed to scale quickly to succeed. Time is not on our side.\"",
      "Prince William acknowledged the networking aspect of the prize initiative Tuesday at an event in Cape Town. Panel host Wanjira Mathia teased the British royal as he sat for a panel discussion, calling the prize \"a large dating service to bring together climate innovators.\"",
      "\"The prize is about visibility, but it's also about scale,\" he said. \"What we hear a lot from innovators is, 'I have a solution and no idea how to scale,' and businesses and leaders who say, 'I have money but don't know where to put it.' So, that's where we created a launchpad, which is a dating service which matches the funder with the solution, and vice versa. And I think this collaboration is key \u2014 if you put all of this into one melting pot, then sparks will fly.\"",
      "\"It's wonderful to see those many brilliant minds and changemakers in a room,\" he said, addressing the audience.",
      "Back in Kokotela, south of Johannesburg, Muriel Nobela can now power her TV, radio and lights thanks to a d.light solar panel on her roof. The panel feeds electricity to an outside light and to a storage battery inside her home, and it all costs her just over $250, which she's paying off in small monthly instalments.",
      "Her neighbor Portia Msomi had always been forced to rely on gas to cook and candles for light in the evenings. Now, it's just a flip of a switch.",
      "\"Aha!\" said Portia, giggling as she hit her new d.light switch to illuminate her home. \"You see, isn't it wonderful!\"",
      "Tozun told CBS News it's that kind of reaction that drives d.light's work.",
      "\"The name of our company is d.light, and that is the emotion that gets us really excited to see in our customers,\" he said, adding: \"There are 2 billion people in the world who have unreliable electricity access, and about 750 million with no access to electricity at all, our goal is\u00a0 to transform the lives of one billion people by 2030.\"",
      "Portia takes a lot of pride in her new solar system. With a huge amount of effort she climbed onto a large trunk to stretch her hand onto her metal roof to grab her solar panel and clean it meticulously. She told CBS News it took her only four months to pay off the $150 cost of the system.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 08:12:04 -0500",
    "summary": "While Vice President Kamala Harris has promised to keep current limits on asylum, former President Donald Trump has vowed to seal the southern border altogether.",
    "story": [
      "Nogales, Mexico \u2014 Migrants from all corners of the globe, from Latin America to far-flung countries in Africa and Asia, come to a shelter in this northern Mexican city hoping to enter the U.S. and escape economic hardship and, in some cases, deadly danger.",
      "\"They tried to kill us,\" said Rosa Benalcazar, a migrant staying at the House of Mercy and all Nations, one of the biggest shelters for migrants on the Mexican side of the Arizona-Mexico border.",
      "Benalcazar said she journeyed to the U.S. after criminal gangs threatened to harm her and her family in Ecuador, which has seen record numbers of its citizens flee amid mounting violence and insecurity.",
      "Like the other migrants at the shelter in Nogales, Benalcazar has been trying to get an appointment to enter America through a U.S. government phone app known as CBP One. Designed to discourage illegal border crossings, the Biden administration program allows migrants in Mexico to request a time to be processed at a legal entry point. The wait times, however, can extend for months due to an extraordinarily high demand.",
      "\"I haven't had luck,\" Benalcazar said in Spanish, noting she's been attempting to secure a CBP One appointment each day for seven months straight.",
      "Sister Lika Macias, the shelter's director, said many migrants feel that luck may soon become harder to find, given the presidential election in the U.S.",
      "\"The politics in the United States,\" affect \"migration policy\" at the U.S.-Mexico border, Macias said.",
      "Vice President Harris has promised to continue current Biden administration policies that sharply limit asylum for those who cross the southern border without waiting for a CBP One appointment. But former President Donald Trump has vowed to seal the U.S.-Mexico border altogether, including by ending the CBP One process and other programs that allow migrants to enter the country lawfully.",
      "\"There's a lot of concern\"",
      "On a recent morning, immigration attorney Alba Jaramillo sought to ease the confusion and anxiety among those at the shelter. The American election could go \"either way\" and there's no telling who will win, she told a group of migrants, most of them mothers with children.",
      "Jaramillo urged the migrants to be patient and to avoid listening to social media rumors about a sudden, overnight U.S. policy change.",
      "\"There's a lot of concern about what's going to happen,\" said Jaramillo, the co-director of the Immigration Law and Justice Network, a pro-immigrant group. \"They're very scared. They think that the asylum system is going to close.\"",
      "Jaramillo said she also urged migrants to follow the legal process and refrain from crossing the U.S. border illegally with the help of smugglers. Crossing the Arizona desert, she said, is not only dangerous, and potentially deadly, but would also disqualify migrants from asylum under an executive action by President Biden in June.",
      "After Mr. Biden enacted those broad restrictions on asylum, illegal border crossings, which had soared to record levels late last year, plunged to a 4-year low. While unauthorized crossings have remained at that low level for the past few months, U.S. officials worry the results of the presidential election could disrupt the lull.",
      "A Trump victory, some U.S. officials believe, could prompt large numbers of migrants to try to cross into the country illegally before he takes office in January. In addition to promising to shut down the CBP One app process, Trump has vowed to reinstate his hardline immigration policies, militarize the border and oversee the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "\"It's nerve-racking\"",
      "Roughly half the migrants at the shelter are children, according to Macias, the facility's director. While their parents desperately await the results of the election, fearing dramatic changes in American border policy, the kids' only focus is being kids.",
      "After all, for the children, there's little to fear at the Nogales shelter, where they can learn English and mathematics and enjoy outdoor activities like soccer and basketball, as well as occasional treats.",
      "Still, parents like Areli Doral, a young mother from Guerrero, Mexico, remain deeply concerned about what could happen following the American election.",
      "\"Yes, I'm scared,\" Doral said in Spanish, while holding her two-year-old son, Edgar.",
      "\"If they close the (CBP One) application, what are we going to do? We already waited 10 months,\" she said. \"It's nerve-racking.\"",
      "Doral said returning to her hometown is not an option, noting it would be dangerous for her son.",
      "\"There's a lot of crime,\" she said. \"It's become more difficult where I'm from.\"",

      "Mexico's National Guard fatally shot two Colombians and wounded four others in what the Defense Department claimed was a confrontation near the U.S. border.",
      "Colombia's foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday that all of the victims were migrants who had been \"caught in the crossfire.\" It identified the dead as a 20-year-old man and a 37-year-old woman, and gave the number of Colombians wounded as five, not four. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy. The victims were identified by the foreign ministry as Yuli Vanessa Herrera Marulanda and Ronaldo Andr\u00e9s Quintero Pe\u00f1uelas.",
      "Mexico's Defense Department, which controls the National Guard, did not respond to requests for comment Monday on whether the victims were migrants, but it said one Colombian who was not injured in the shootings was turned over to immigration officials, suggesting they were.",
      "If they were migrants, it would mark the second time in just over a month that military forces in Mexico have opened fire on and killed migrants.",
      "On Oct. 1, the day President Claudia Sheinbaum took office, soldiers opened fire on a truck, killing six migrants in the southern state of Chiapas. An 11-year-old girl from Egypt, her 18-year-old sister and a 17-year-old boy from El Salvador died in that shooting, along with people from Peru and Honduras.",
      "The most recent shootings happened Saturday on a dirt road near Tecate, east of Otay Mesa on the California border, that is frequently used by Mexican migrant smugglers, the department said in a statement late Sunday.",
      "The Defense Department said a militarized National Guard patrol came under fire after spotting two vehicles -- a gray pickup and a white SUV -- in the area, which is near an informal border crossing and wind power generation plant known as La Rumorosa.",
      "One truck sped off and escaped. The National Guard opened fire on the other truck, killing two Colombians and wounding four others. There was no immediate information on their conditions, and there were no reported casualties among the guardsmen involved.",
      "One Colombian and one Mexican man were found and detained unharmed at the scene, and the departments said officers found a pistol and several magazines commonly used for assault rifles at the scene.",
      "Colombians have sometimes been recruited as gunmen for Mexican drug cartels, which are also heavily involved in migrant smuggling. But the fact the survivor was turned over to immigration officials and that the Foreign Relations Department contacted the Colombian consulate suggests they were migrants.",
      "Cartel gunmen sometimes escort or kidnap migrants as they travel to the U.S. border. One possible scenario was that armed migrant smugglers may have been in one or both of the trucks, but that the migrants were basically unarmed bystanders.",
      "The defense department said the three National Guard officers who opened fire have been taken off duty while the incident is being investigated.",
      "Former president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office Sept. 30, gave the military an unprecedentedly wide role in public life and law enforcement; he created the militarized Guard and used the combined military forces as the country's main law enforcement agencies, supplanting police. The Guard has since been placed under the control of the army.",
      "But critics say the military is not trained to do civilian law enforcement work. Moreover, lopsided death tolls in such confrontations - in which all the deaths and injuries occur on one side - raise suspicions among activists whether there really was a confrontation.",
      "For example, the soldiers who opened fire in Chiapas - who have been detained pending charges - claimed they heard \"detonations\" prior to opening fire. There was no indication any weapons were found at the scene.",

    "story": [
      "Seoul \u2014\u00a0North Korea fired a salvo of short-range ballistic missiles early Tuesday, Seoul's military said. It was Pyongyang's second launch in days and it came just hours before Americans were set to vote for a new president.",
      "The nuclear-armed North last week test-fired what it said was its most advanced and powerful solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). That was Kim Jong Un's first weapons test since he was accused by U.S. and Ukrainian officials of sending soldiers to help support Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "North Korea, which has denied the deployment, is under growing international pressure to withdraw its troops from Russia, with Seoul warning Tuesday that thousands of soldiers were being deployed to front-line areas, including the Russian region of Kursk, which Ukrainian troops pushed into months ago.",
      "Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected the launch of \"several short-range ballistic missiles\" at around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday (5:30 p.m. Eastern, Monday) into waters east of the Korean peninsula. The missiles flew approximately 248 miles and Seoul's military said it had tracked the launch in real time while sharing information with Tokyo and Washington.",
      "\"In preparation for additional launches, our military has strengthened surveillance and alertness,\" it added. Seoul was set to get more U.S. help in monitoring the North's missile launches, meanwhile, with the State Department in Washington announcing Monday the approval of a new military aid package worth almost $5 billion.",
      "That package includes the potential sale of airborne early warning and control systems to South Korea, with the approval of four E-7 Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C) aircraft, 10 jet engines, and other systems and support elements, at an estimated total cost of $4.92 billion.",
      "The early warning and control aircraft, known as Wedgetails, would enable South Korea to detect missiles and other threats more swiftly and from greater distances than ground-based radar systems.",
      "\"This proposed sale will improve the Republic of Korea's ability to meet current and future threats by providing increased intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and airborne early warning and control capabilities,\" the State Department said. \"It will also increase the ROK Air Force's command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) interoperability with the United States.\"",
      "On Sunday, South Korea, Japan and the United States conducted a joint air drill involving a U.S. B-1B bomber, South Korean F-15K and KF-16 fighter jets, and Japanese F-2 jets, in response to the ICBM launch. Such joint drills infuriate Pyongyang, which views them as rehearsals for invasion.",
      "Pyongyang called its latest launch \"a direct response to the trilateral aerial exercises over the weekend,\" Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defense Industry Studies told AFP. \"Given it was a salvo of short-range missiles, the North is indicating that it not only has long-range missiles capable of reaching the U.S., but also short-range ones to target all bases in South Korea and Japan.\"",
      "Kim Yo Jong, sister of the country's leader and a key spokesperson, called the U.S.-South Korea-Japan exercises an \"action-based explanation of the most hostile and dangerous aggressive nature of the enemy toward our Republic.\"",
      "In a statement carried Tuesday by the official Korean Central News Agency, she said the drill was \"absolute proof of the validity and urgency of the line of building up the nuclear forces we have opted for and put into practice.\"",
      "Seoul has long accused the nuclear-armed North of sending weapons to help Moscow fight Kyiv and alleged that Pyongyang has moved to deploy soldiers en masse since Kim signed a mutual defense deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June.",
      "\"More than 10,000 North Korean soldiers are currently in Russia, and we assess that a significant portion of them are deployed to front-line areas, including Kursk,\" Jeon Ha-gyu, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry, said Tuesday.",
      "Seoul, a major weapons exporter, has said it is reviewing whether to send weapons directly to Ukraine in response, something it has previously resisted due to longstanding domestic policy that prevents it from providing weaponry into active conflicts.",
      "With its recent testing spate, \"Pyongyang is showing that its contribution of weapons and troops to Russia's war in Ukraine does not curtail its military activities closer to home,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. \"On the contrary, cooperation with Moscow appears to enable blatant violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\"",
      "On Monday, Robert Wood, U.S. deputy ambassador to the U.N., slammed the North's advancing ballistic missile program and said Russia and China were preventing the U.N. from holding Pyongyang to account.",
      "Beijing and Moscow \"have repeatedly shielded the DPRK, contributing to the normalization of these tests and emboldening the DPRK to further violate this Council's sanctions and resolutions,\" he said, referring to the North by its official name.",

      "Maumere, Indonesia\u00a0\u2014 Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency said Monday that at least 10 people had died as a series of volcanic eruptions widens on the remote island of Flores. The eruption at Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki around midnight spewed thick brownish ash as high as 6,500 feet into the air and hot ashes hit several villages, burning down houses including a convent of Catholic nuns, said Firman Yosef, an official at the Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki monitoring post.",
      "Yosef said volcanic material was thrown up to 3.7 miles from the volcano's crater, blanketing nearby villages and towns with tons of volcanic debris and forcing residents to flee.",
      "Rescuers were still searching for more bodies buried under collapsed houses, said Abdul Muhari, the National Disaster Management Agency's spokesperson. Muhari said all the bodies, including a child, were found with a 2.4-mile radius of the crater. He said at least 10,000 people had been affected by the eruption in six villages.",

      "In a video conference on Monday, Muhammad Wafid, the head of Geology Agency at the Energy and Mineral Resources ministry said there was a different character between January's eruption and Monday's eruption due to a blockage of magma in the crater, which reduced detectible seismic activity while building up pressure.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 10:05:50 -0500",
    "summary": "President Biden lauds Moldovan incumbent Maia Sandu's reelection, saying \"Russia sought to undermine\" the country's democratic institutions for months.",
    "story": [
      "Moldova's pro-European Union incumbent President Maia Sandu won a tense presidential runoff election Sunday, beating a rival backed by a pro-Russian party in what she called as a \"lesson in democracy.\"",
      "The election in the small ex-Soviet republic, which lies sandwiched between war-torn Ukraine and the European Union, was overshadowed by allegations of meddling by Moscow. The key vote took place just two weeks after a referendum saw Moldovans back their country's bid to join the EU by a razor-thin margin.",
      "Sandu won 54.94 percent of the vote compared to 45.06 percent for Alexandr Stoianoglo, who was supported by the pro-Russian Socialists party and whom Sandu fired as prosecutor general last year, according to near-complete results published by the country's election commission.",
      "\"Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books.... Freedom, truth, and justice have prevailed,\" Sandu declared. \u00a0 Her rival Stoianoglo, 57, urged people \"to remain calm, regardless of the figures,\" but the Socialists party that backed him was quick to release a statement Monday questioning the results and calling her \"illegitimate,\" without offering any specific evidence.",
      "\"Maia Sandu is an illegitimate president, recognized only by her sponsors and supporters abroad. The people of Moldova feel betrayed and robbed,\" the party claimed in a statement, decrying \"blocking of voters' access\" and other alleged irregularities in the vote, in which Sandu benefitted from strong support from the country's large diaspora.",
      "Biden says democracy won, \"Russia failed.\"",
      "In a statement issued Monday morning by the White House, President Biden said the Moldovan people \"went to the polls and voted in favor of President Sandu's vision for a secure, prosperous, and democratic Moldova.\"",
      "\"For months, Russia sought to undermine Moldova's democratic institutions and election processes. But Russia failed,\" Mr. Biden said. \"The Moldovan people have exercised their democratic right to choose their own future, and they have chosen to pursue a path aligned with Europe and democracies everywhere.\"",
      "EU chief Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Sandu on her re-election victory and the country's \"European future,\" saying it took \"a rare kind of strength to overcome the challenges you've faced in this election.\"",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said democracy had \"triumphed over all interference and all manuevers.\"",
      "Sandu's victory was also applauded by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday. His country, which Russia launched its ongoing full-scale invasion of almost three years ago, surrounds Moldova on three sides.",
      "\"Moldovans have made a clear choice,\" Zelenskyy said Monday. \"They chose a path toward economic growth and social stability.\"",
      "He vowed to strengthen Ukraine's ties with Moldova and noted that both countries had applied to join the EU in the wake of Russia's February 2022 invasion.",
      "\"Only true security and a peaceful, united Europe can guarantee each person and every family the confidence to face tomorrow with hope and certainty,\" he said.",
      "Accession negotiations for Moldova to join the EU formally opened in June. In the October 20 referendum, 50.35 percent of voters backed EU membership, with Sandu blaming \"foreign interference\" for the narrow result in the country of 2.6 million people.",
      "\"Attacks, provocations and attempts at destabilization\"",
      "Like in Georgia, another ex-Soviet country where the ruling party won a contested parliamentary election last weekend, Russia has been accused of seeking to sway voters. Moscow has denied the allegations.",
      "Police said after the EU referendum that they had uncovered a Russian vote-buying scheme that could have affected up to a quarter of the ballots, and Moldovan authorities reported \"attacks, provocations and attempts at destabilization\" on Sunday.",
      "Police said they were investigating Russia's alleged use of \"organized transportation\" to Belarus, Azerbaijan and Turkey so people living in Russia could vote at Moldovan missions in those countries.",
      "Cyberattacks and fake bomb threats also targeted out-of-country voting operations, authorities said.",
      "A deeply divided Moldova",
      "Turnout was higher than in the first round on October 20, when Sandu came out ahead with 42.5 percent and runner-up Stoianoglo got 26 percent.",
      "Casting his vote on Sunday, Stoianoglo said he had \"no relations with the Kremlin.\"",
      "While he's said he also favors joining the EU, he boycotted the referendum.",
      "Moldova is deeply polarized. A large diaspora and the capital mostly favor joining the EU, while rural areas and the pro-Russian separatist regions of Transnistria and Gagauzia are against it.",
      "Sandu lost in the territory of Moldova itself, election results showed, with her owing her victory to the diaspora.",
      "\"This is what tipped the election,\" said Florent Parmentier, a political scientist at Paris-based Sciences Po, noting Sandu's \"dependence on the outside.\"",
      "To maintain its pro-EU course, Moldova needs \"a lot of help\" given \"the hybrid war waged by Russia,\" according to Andrei Curararu, an analyst at the Chisinau-based WatchDog think tank.",
      "\"It will not succeed on its own,\" he said, earlier citing \"unprecedented pressure\" with more than $100 million estimated to have been spent on \"destabilization activities.\"",

      "The joint Egyptian-American mission excavating the necropolis found coffins for five women, two men and three children, suggesting that it was a family tomb used for generations during the 12th Dynasty and the beginning of the 13th Dynasty, said Mohamed Ismail Khaled, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt.",
      "He said ancient floods destroyed most of the burials' wooden coffins and linen wrappings.",
      "However, some items such as jewelry in women's burials were found intact, including a finely crafted necklace with 30 amethyst beads and two cylindrical agate beads framing a hippo-head amulet, according to the statement.",
      "Catherine Blakeney, chief American archeologist with the mission, said they found two copper mirrors, one with a lotus-shaped handle, and the second with a unique design of Hathor, goddess of the sky, women, fertility and love in ancient Egypt.",
      "The South Asasif Conservation Project, which led the dig, said in a news release that a green-blue glazed faience fertility figurine was also an \"important find.\"",
      "\"It is well-modeled and decorated with a variety of jewelry and lozenge markings on the legs and torso,\" the group's director, Dr. Elena Pischikova, said in a statement. \"Her cropped hair is painted black. The head is pierced with holes arranged in three sections. The holes were intended for the attachment of 'hair.' Almost 4,000 mud beads found next to the figurine constituted her original hair.\"",
      "The discovery came as Egypt has doubled efforts to attract more tourists, a significant source of foreign currency for the cash-strapped North African country. Tourism, which depends heavily on Egypt's rich Pharaonic artifacts, suffered a long downturn after the political turmoil and violence that followed a 2011 uprising.",
      "Last month, the Grand Egyptian Museum, a mega project near the famed Giza Pyramids, opened 12 halls exhibiting Pharaonic artifacts for visitors as a trial ahead of the yet-unannounced official opening.",

      "In East Lansing, Michigan, she addressed the issue soon after beginning her remarks. \"As president I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza, to bring home the hostages, end the suffering in Gaza, ensure Israel is secure and ensure the Palestinian people can realize their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination,\" she said.",
      "Some students in East Lansing voiced their opposition Sunday with audible calls for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war. At least one attendee was escorted out after the cease-fire calls.",
      "Meanwhile, Israeli forces continued an offensive in the northern Gaza Strip, where the military has said it is battling Hamas fighters who regrouped there.",
      "Shell fire hit Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, injuring patients, including children, hospital director Hossam Abu Safiya said in a statement to the media. He said the shells hit the hospital's nursery, dormitory and water tanks just after a delegation from the World Health Organization ended a visit.",
      "Kamal Adwan and two other nearby hospitals have been hit by Israel several times during the fighting. Earlier this month, Israeli troops stormed Kamal Adwan, detaining a large number of people, including much of the staff, Abu Safiya said at the time of the raid. The military said those detained included members of Hamas, without providing evidence, and said weapons were found in the facility.",
      "But the Israel Defense Forces in a statement denied striking Kamal Adwan on Sunday, blaming \"an explosive device planted by the terrorist organizations in Gaza\" for the attack.",
      "\"Attacks on civilians, including humanitarian workers, and what remains of Gaza's civilian facilities and infrastructure must stop,\" UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement Saturday. \"The entire Palestinian population in North Gaza, especially children, is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine, and the ongoing bombardments.\"",
      "In southern Gaza, an Israeli strike hit a group of people gathered outside in an eastern district of Khan Younis, killing at least eight Palestinians, including four children and a woman, the territory's Health Ministry's emergency services said. The city's Nasser Hospital, which received most of the bodies, confirmed the figures.",
      "Palestinian officials said an Israeli drone strike on Saturday hit a clinic in northern Gaza where children were being vaccinated for polio, wounding six people including four children. The Israeli military denied responsibility.",
      "Dr. Munir al-Boursh, director general of the Gaza Health Ministry, told The Associated Press that a quadcopter struck the Sheikh Radwan clinic in Gaza City early Saturday afternoon, just a few minutes after a United Nations delegation left the facility.",
      "UNICEF and WHO, which are jointly carrying out the polio vaccination campaign, expressed concern over the reported strike. Rosalia Bollen, a spokesperson for UNICEF, said the strike occurred when a \"humanitarian pause\" agreed to by Israel to allow vaccinations was in effect.",
      "Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said that \"contrary to the claims, an initial review determined that the (Israeli military) did not strike in the area at the specified time.\"",
      "It was not possible to resolve the conflicting accounts. Israeli forces have repeatedly raided hospitals in Gaza over the course of the war, saying Hamas uses them for militant purposes, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials. Hamas fighters are also operating in the north, battling Israeli forces.",
      "Northern Gaza has been encircled by Israeli forces and largely isolated for the past year. Israel has been carrying out another offensive there in recent weeks that has killed hundreds of people and displaced tens of thousands.",
      "A scaled-down campaign to administer a second dose of the polio vaccine began Saturday in parts of northern Gaza. It had been postponed from Oct. 23 due to lack of access, Israeli bombings and mass evacuation orders, and the lack of assurances for humanitarian pauses, a U.N. statement said.",
      "Administration of the first doses was carried out in September across the Gaza Strip, including the north.",
      "At least 100,000 people have been forced to evacuate from areas of north Gaza toward Gaza City in the past few weeks, but around 15,000 children under the age of 10 remain in northern towns, including Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, which are inaccessible, according to the U.N.",
      "The final phase of the polio vaccination campaign had aimed to reach an estimated 119,000 children in the north with a second dose of the oral polio vaccine, the agencies said, but \"achieving this target is now unlikely due to access constraints.\"",
      "They say 90% of children in every community must be vaccinated to prevent the spread of the disease.",
      "The campaign was launched after the first polio case was reported in Gaza in 25 years \u2014 a 10-month-old boy, now paralyzed in the leg. The World Health Organization said the presence of a paralysis case indicates there could be hundreds more who have been infected but aren't showing symptoms.",
      "The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel's offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities, who do not say how many were combatants but say more than half were women and children.",

      "The 18th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season\u00a0was gaining strength Tuesday morning after forming in the Caribbean. Tropical Storm Rafael was forecast to grow steadily, if not rapidly as it churns past Jamaica's west coast on a path for Cuba, where it's expected to arrive later in the week as a hurricane.",
      "Rafael was becoming more organized as the center of the storm passed south of western Jamaica, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory issued at 10 a.m. EST.",
      "A hurricane warning was in effect for the Cayman Islands and a hurricane watch was issued for parts of Cuba as Rafael continued moving northwest. A tropical storm warning was in effect for Jamaica and the Florida Keys.",
      "The Miami-based hurricane center said the system was expected to approach the northwest part of Cuba around the time it reaches hurricane strength. A map charting Rafael's projected path through the Caribbean, created by CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan, shows the storm nearing Cuba Wednesday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour.",
      "\"Steady to rapid intensification is forecast over the next 24 to 36 hours, and Rafael is forecast to become a hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean near the Cayman Islands with further strengthening before it makes landfall in Cuba,\" forecasters said in an update early Tuesday morning.",
      "As of 10 a.m. Eastern on Tuesday, Rafael was about 65 miles southwest of Montego Bay, on Jamaica's northwest coast, and about 200 miles southeast of Grand Cayman in the Cayman Islands. The storm was moving northwest at 13 mph with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, the hurricane center said. Maximum sustained winds of 74 mph are needed for a storm to be\u00a0classified as a hurricane.",
      "The hurricane center said the heaviest rainfall was forecast to hit Jamaica on Tuesday, with Cuba likely to face a strengthened storm by Wednesday. Rainfall will likely be accompanied by hurricane conditions in the Cayman Islands by Tuesday afternoon and possibly in western Cuba and the Isle of Youth by Wednesday.",
      "\"Heavy rainfall will impact areas of the Western Caribbean through early Thursday, particularly across Jamaica and the Cayman Islands into southern and western portions of Cuba where rainfall totals between 3 to 6 inches are expected,\" the hurricane center said Tuesday morning, adding that \"isolated higher totals up to 10 inches\" could be seen in some parts of Jamaica and Cuba.",
      "Heavy rainfall was expected to spread north into Florida and elsewhere in the southeast U.S. by the middle or end of the week, with as much as 3 inches forecast for the lower and middle Florida Keys.",
      "CBS News meteorologist Nicolette Nolan said forecasting models weren't clear enough as of Monday to predict where Rafael would head once it reaches the Gulf of Mexico, \"but the Gulf coasts from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida need to be on alert for impacts at the end of the week.\"",

      "An Iranian-American journalist who once worked for a U.S. government-funded broadcaster is believed to have been detained by Iran for months now, authorities said Sunday, further raising the stakes as Tehran threatens to retaliate over\u00a0an Israeli attack on the country.",
      "The imprisonment of Reza Valizadeh, acknowledged to CBS News and the Associated Press by the U.S. State Department, came as Iran marked the 45th anniversary of the American Embassy takeover and hostage crisis on Sunday. It also followed Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatening both Israel and the U.S. the day before with\u00a0\"a crushing response\"\u00a0as long-range B-52 bombers reached the Middle East in an attempt to deter Tehran.",
      "Valizadeh had worked for Radio Farda, an outlet under Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that's overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media. In February, he wrote on the social platform X that his family members had been detained in an effort to see him return to Iran.",
      "The State Department told CBS News on Sunday that they are \"aware of reports that his U.S.-Iranian citizen has been arrested in Iran,\" when asked about Valizadeh.",
      "\"We are working with our Swiss partners who serve as the protecting power for the United States in Iran to gather more information about this case,\" a spokesperson said. \"Iran routinely imprisons U.S. citizens and other countries' citizens unjustly for political purposes. This practice is cruel and contrary to international law.\"",
      "The spokesperson said the State Department is \"unable to provide additional comment due to privacy considerations.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty told CBS News in a statement on Saturday that it is aware of Valizadeh's detainment in Iran and has no official confirmation of charges against him. They said Valizadeh stopped working with them in November 2022.",
      "\"We are profoundly concerned about the continued arrest, harassment and threats against media professionals by the Iranian regime,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In August, Valizadeh apparently posted two messages suggesting he had returned to Iran despite Radio Farda being viewed by Iran's theocracy as a hostile outlet.",
      "\"I arrived in Tehran on March 6, 2024. Before that, I had unfinished negotiations with the (Revolutionary Guard's) intelligence department,\" the message read in part. \"Eventually I came back to my country after 13 years without any security guarantee, even a verbal one.\"",
      "Valizadeh added the name of a man who he claimed belonged to Iran's Intelligence Ministry. The AP could not verify if the person worked for the ministry.",
      "Rumors have been circulating for weeks that Valizadeh had been detained. The Human Rights Activists News Agency, which monitors cases in Iran, said that he had been detained on arrival to the country earlier this year, but later released.",
      "He was then rearrested and sent to Evin prison, where he now faces a case in Iran's Revolutionary Court, which routinely holds closed-door hearings in which defendants face secret evidence, the agency reported. Valizadeh had faced arrest in 2007 as well, it said.",
      "Iran has not acknowledged detaining Valizadeh. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Voice of America, another U.S. government-funded media outlet overseen by the Agency for Global Media, first reported the State Department was acknowledging Valizadeh's detention in Iran.",
      "Since the 1979 U.S. Embassy crisis, which saw dozens of hostages released after 444 days in captivity, Iran has used prisoners with Western ties as bargaining chips in negotiations with the world. In September 2023,\u00a0five Americans detained for years in Iran were freed in exchange\u00a0for five Iranians in U.S. custody and for $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets to be released by South Korea.",
      "Valizadeh is the first American known to be detained by Iran in the time since.",
      "Meanwhile, Iranian state television aired footage Sunday of different cities across the country marking the anniversary of the embassy takeover.",
      "Gen. Hossein Salami, the head of the Guard, also spoke in Tehran, where he repeated a pledge made the day before by Khamenei.",
      "\"The resistance front and Iran will equip itself with whatever necessary to confront and defeat the enemy,\" he said, referring to the militant groups like Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah backed by Tehran.",
      "In Tehran, thousands at the gate of the former U.S. Embassy chanted \"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel.\" Some burned flags of the countries and effigies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",

      "Venezuela has been producing oil since 1914, but what's known as \"the resource curse\" really set in when the charismatic and controversial Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was elected president in 1998. When he took office, the price of oil was $7 a barrel, Neuman said: \"Within several years, it gets to over $120 a barrel, so Ch\u00e1vez was very fortunate, because he comes in just at the beginning of this great commodities boom.\"",

      "Maduro met public discontent with repression, and millions left the country.",
      "Looking at the map of the Venezuelan exodus since 2014, the United States is fourth among destinations. Just over 750,000 have either been granted temporary protected status in the U.S., or have applied. So, Venezuela's crisis is here, at our doorstep, in our cities.",

      "On Thursday, North Korea launched the newly developed Hwasong-19 ICBM in the country's first test in almost a year.",
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered the missile test and was at the launch site, calling the launch \"an appropriate military action\" to show North Korea's resolve to respond to its enemies' moves that have threatened the North's safety, according to its Defense Ministry.",
      "The missile flew higher and stayed in the air longer than any other missile North Korea has fired.",

However many experts say North Korea still has some technological issues to master to acquire functioning ICBMs that can deliver nuclear strikes on the U.S. mainland. The experts say the Hwasong-19 shown in North Korea's state media photos and videos looked too big to be useful in a war.",
      "The ICBM test was seen as an effort to grab American attention ahead of the U.S. presidential election this week and respond to international condemnation of North Korea's reported\u00a0dispatch of thousands of troops to Russia\u00a0to support its war against Ukraine, observers say.",

      "Vice President Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, headlines a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Nov. 4, 2024. (Fox News - Paul Steinhauser)",
      "On the final day before election day, Trump campaigned in both eastern and western Pennsylvania and Harris devoted the entire day to stops across the state. Vice presidential candidates Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Democrat Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have similarly been making stops in Pennsylvania throughout the campaign.",
      "\"Both campaigns see the path to the White House running through Pennsylvania,\" said Berwood Yost, the director of the national survey group the Center for Opinion Research. Similarly, he said the path to victory in Pennsylvania runs through Bucks, Erie and Northampton counties.",
      "Bucks is a primarily suburban county just north of Philadelphia. Erie, which is situated in far northwestern Pennsylvania on Lake Erie, is primarily rural and significantly smaller in terms of population. Finally, Northampton in eastern Pennsylvania is suburban and home to Lehigh University, a private research college.",
      "According to Yost, all three mirror many of the key demographics, such as racial composition, educational attainment and population density, that make Pennsylvania so competitive.",

      "President Biden won Pennsylvania by a narrow 1.17 percent margin in 2020. The margins in Bucks (4.37), Erie (1.03) and Northampton (0.72) were similarly close.",
      "Yost said that like the rest of the country, people in these counties are \"generally dissatisfied\" with the economy and want to see some kind of change, something that is a positive indicator for Trump. However, he said \"the closest to the closeness of the race makes it seem that they haven't been able to take advantage of that.\"",
      "\"I think part of the reason the race is so close is that that message has not been consistently articulated by the top of the ticket,\" he said. \"Those distractions have raised some concerns among some voters.\"",
      "Yost said the race will come down to what independents and traditional Republicans who are not enthusiastic about Trump decide at the ballot box.",
      "\"That to me is really going to be the inflection point of this election,\" he said. \"If they're wobbly, and they think it's the economy, that's a plus for Trump. If they go into the voting booth, and they think about something else, that's a negative for the Trump campaign.\"",

      "With most of your life attached to these nine numbers, your Social Security number (SSN) is incredibly important to keep safe. That\u2019s why it is crucial to pay attention to signs that your SSN may have been compromised. While preventing the misuse of your SSN is paramount, there are action steps you can take if it does fall into the wrong hands.",

      "Top signs someone might be using your Social Security number",
      "Are you concerned that your Social Security number may have gotten into the wrong hands? Check below to see if you are experiencing any of these signs:",
      "Americans are granted free credit reports every 12 months from the three major consumer reporting companies. Regularly culling through these reports can help you spot potential fraud, which might signal that your Social Security number has been compromised. Any hard inquiries you didn\u2019t request on your credit report are a strong indicator that someone tried to open a credit card or another line of credit with your SSN.",
      "While most people know they should check their credit report and scores, you can see your Social Security statement by creating an account on the official Social Security Administration website. Because only one account can be created per SSN, it is safer if you claim it so that no one else can by piecing together your personal information (along with your SSN) to claim it fraudulently. Make sure it is connected to a secure email account that you check frequently. This account also provides up-to-date data on earnings and benefit distributions so you can see if anything is \"off.\"",

      "BEWARE OF THIS SOCIAL SECURITY SCAM BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU",
      "While it might seem natural to toss a pile of \"junk\" mailers or ignore calls from random debt collectors or advertisers, it may be an indicator that someone has gotten a hold of your Social Security number and has begun opening accounts under your number. It\u2019s important to make note of the patterns and follow up with these collectors should it become more and more apparent that your SSN might have been misused. Oftentimes, consumers start getting more credit offers when new credit cards are opened. Additionally, if you start receiving bills under someone else\u2019s name at your address, it might be time to follow up with these notices.",
      "If you start receiving notices about your Social Security number being used to file someone else\u2019s taxes or inappropriately use your health insurance, it is definitely a sign that someone may have compromised your SSN. While receiving a notice from the IRS or Medicare can feel scary, it is imperative that you reach out to the corresponding agency to notify them of the fraudulent activity so that you can stop further damage.",

      "Put your Social Security number card in a very safe place, such as a safe, bank safe or a filing cabinet that can be locked. Because it is used so frequently, those nine digits are worth memorizing. If your wallet is lost or stolen, and you keep your SSN card in there, it will be messier than losing just money or your ID. Don\u2019t carry your Social Security card in your wallet or purse.",
      "Skip jotting down your Social Security number on in-person forms. When your SSN is jotted down on paper, it is hard to control how the information gets used or disposed of. If you can submit forms online, you can skip the risk of having your SSN getting into the wrong hands. If you mail in forms that denote your SSN, you risk having that piece of mail stolen or lost.",
      "Even though your SSN is requested on some forms, it is not always necessary. If a future employer is requesting your SSN, double-check why they need it. They would most likely need it to run a background check, which you should know about anyway. Additionally, some establishments allow you to provide the last four digits of your SSN until you are finalizing a screening process, etc.",
      "Open accounts for your children's Social Security numbers because you want to claim them for them early and be able to monitor any movement related to their SSN.",
      "Some records that contain your Social Security number are important to keep on hand, such as income tax filings.

Keep offline documents with SSNs in a safe or shred instead of throwing them away.",

Earlier versions did this by prompting users to call the bank from within an app that impersonated the financial institution, as reported by\u00a0Bleeping Computer. However, the latest version, analyzed by\u00a0Zimperium, sets itself as the default call handler.",

      "2) Download apps from reliable sources:\u00a0It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources, like the Google Play Store. The FakeCalls malware infects your phone when you download an app from an unknown link. As an Android user, you should only download apps from the Play Store, which has strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Also, never trust download links that you receive through SMS.",
      "3) Be cautious with app permissions: Always review the permissions requested by apps before installation. If an app requests access to features that seem unnecessary for its function, it could be a sign of malicious intent. Do not give any app Accessibility permissions unless you really need to. Avoid granting permissions that could compromise your personal data.",
      "4) Regularly update your device\u2019s operating system and apps: Keeping your software\u00a0up to date is crucial, as updates often include security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware like FakeCalls.",
      "5) Monitor financial activity regularly: Check your bank and credit card statements often for unauthorized transactions. Set up alerts for any account activity, which can notify you immediately if suspicious activity occurs.",
      "6) Limit sensitive transactions on mobile: Whenever possible, avoid performing high-risk transactions (like large money transfers) on your mobile device, especially if you\u2019re in\u00a0public or connected to unsecured Wi-Fi. Use a secure computer or contact your bank directly from a verified number.",

      "The new\u00a0iMac now comes with accessories that use USB-C charging ports instead of Lightning. All USB-C ports also support the fastest Thunderbolt 4 standard, which means you can transfer large videos and other files faster. The display is still a 24-inch panel with 4.5K resolution, but Apple is now offering a \"nano-texture glass\" option for an extra $200, designed to reduce reflections and glare.",
      "There are a few other updates, too. The base RAM has doubled to 16GB from the previous model, with an option to go up to 32GB on the higher-end version. The new iMac also includes a 12MP webcam and introduces Apple Intelligence features, which are finally rolling out. These include AI-powered writing and editing tools and a redesigned Siri, now powered by ChatGPT.",
      "The\u00a0M4 iMac now comes in new colors, including green, yellow, orange, pink, and purple. Silver remains an option too. It\u2019s available for preorder now, with shipping starting Nov. 8.

      "As the name suggests, the\u00a0Mac Mini\u00a0is a compact computer that can handle some serious workloads. First announced in 2005, it retained the same design until 2010, but Apple finally changed it with the latest model. They\u2019ve shrunk the case, reducing the computer\u2019s volume by half. The new Mini is now a five-inch by five-inch box that\u2019s just two inches tall, while the older model measures 7.75 inches by 7.75 inches and is 1.41 inches thick.",
      "The main upgrade for the new computer is the inclusion of Apple\u2019s latest chips, either the M4 or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro. The\u00a0M4 Mini\u00a0comes equipped with two USB-C ports and a headphone jack on the front. These front USB-C ports support USB 3, with speeds of up to 10Gbps.",
      "On the back, you\u2019ll find three USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports (up to 40Gbps), along with Ethernet and HDMI connections. The higher-end M4 Pro model also features Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, which offers transfer speeds of up to 120Gbps and the ability to connect up to three displays.",
      "The starting price of the\u00a0Mac Mini remains the same at $599. This baseline model comes with the M4 chip featuring 10 CPU cores and 10 GPU cores, along with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. For $799, you can double the SSD to 512GB, while the $999 model bumps the RAM up to 24GB. These are solid prices, which isn\u2019t something I say often about Apple products.",

The entry-level 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro still starts at $1,599, but Apple has upped the starting RAM to 16GB (a welcome boost from the previous 8GB).

But if you\u2019re just using an\u00a0iMac for general tasks like browsing or light work, you might be better off with an older model to save some cash. The M4 Mac Mini, though, is a great value option with a competitive price and an extra $100 education discount. For those needing even more power, the new M4 MacBook Pros feature both M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, with base RAM now starting at 24GB on the Pro models and 16GB on the entry-level 14-inch version.",
      "What\u2019s also worth mentioning is Apple Intelligence, which Apple announced way back in May but is only now rolling out. I tried some of these features, and while I found them useful, they\u2019re not exactly earth-shattering.",

      "HOW TO SEND SPAM CALLS DIRECTLY TO VOICEMAIL ON YOUR PHONE",
      "How data brokers collect your information",
      "Data brokers collect, aggregate and sell your personal information, including your phone number, with the intent to sell it to interested parties. They can get your information in many ways, by accessing public information like government records or gathering data from loyalty card programs, surveys and social media. Mobile apps can also share your personal information with data brokers. Even your online browsing habits are valuable to data brokers. Your data profile can be sold to many different buyers, including targeted advertising and marketing companies, as well as\u00a0government agencies.",
      "How a data broker uses your information",
      "Some data brokers offer personal profiles directly to consumers, and you might be surprised by how much information they have about you. Have you ever tried searching for someone on a \"people search\" website? These sites let you enter a name and find out all sorts of information about that person. Try searching for yourself or someone you know. You might find out who used to live at your current address, how much money you make and who your relatives are.",
      "Where do people search sites get their information?",
      "People search sites get their information from public records like court documents and voter registration forms. They usually offer some basic information for free, but if you want more details, you\u2019ll have to sign up for a free trial. And when you do, they\u2019ll probably ask for even more information about you.",
      "The scary thing is that anyone with a computer can access this information, including identity thieves. With just a few key pieces of information, they can call your bank, reset your passcodes and take over your financial accounts.",
      "Even cyberstalkers and blackmailers can use people search sites to find out more about you. Sure, most sites make users promise not to use the information for illegal purposes, but there\u2019s no real way to enforce that. It\u2019s all based on the honor system.",
      "Taking control: removing your information from data brokers",
      "Don\u2019t worry though; there\u2019s something you can do about it. You can request that data brokers remove your information.\u00a0 But with hundreds of them in the U.S. alone, it can be a daunting task. That\u2019s where removal services come in.",
      "Invest in data removal services",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "The persistence of robocalls: why are they still a problem?",
      "While it\u2019s important to take steps to protect your personal information, such as removing it from data broker sites, there are still other threats to our privacy and security. For example, despite efforts to crack down on robocalls, scammers are constantly finding new ways to evade detection and continue their operations. Furthermore, as technology improves, robocallers are able to use more sophisticated methods, such as \"spoofing\" their phone numbers to make it appear as though they are calling from a different location or entity.",
      "Moreover, spam callers are becoming so sophisticated that they have started to add conversational speech to their scripts to further convince their unsuspecting victims to go along with their scams. For instance, the caller may stumble on their words, use \"umm\" a lot, and sometimes even use slang to signal to the listener that the caller is not a robot but an ordinary person, but beware! While some robocalls can range from harmless reminders, most are malicious scams, leaving many frustrated and vulnerable to fraud.

      "The BSF operates through a combination of bending movements and pressure sensing. When pressurized, its air chambers expand, causing the finger to bend inward. This bending action allows the robotic finger to perform palpation on model tissues effectively. In tests, the BSF successfully identified model lumps and accurately measured pulses in human participants. The researchers noted that this robotic finger can \"feel\" stiffness and perform safe and precise palpation similar to that of a human doctor.",

      "1. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Activate two-factor authentication (2FA) for an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. Two-factor authentication requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "2. Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud.",
      "3. Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Landmark hackers obtained your bank and credit card information, which they could use to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you.",
      "You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification. You can even freeze your credit if need be.",
      "4. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0In light of these ongoing data breaches, protecting personal data has become essential. One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites.\u00a0These services employ advanced tools and techniques to identify and eliminate your data from people search sites, data brokers and other platforms where your information might be exposed. By using a data removal service, you can minimize the risk of identity theft and fraud, especially after a data breach. Additionally, these services often provide ongoing monitoring and alerts, keeping you informed of any new instances of your data appearing online and taking immediate action to remove it.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Have strong antivirus software: As cyberthreats grow in frequency and sophistication, strong antivirus software is also crucial to fend off malware and phishing scams, both of which could expose your sensitive information if left unguarded.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Use strong, unique passwords: Secure access to your accounts is paramount. Using strong, unique passwords for each account is an effective barrier against unauthorized access, especially when data breaches place your information at heightened risk. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts. A strong password typically has a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters and is at least 12 characters long. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to help generate and store complex passwords securely.",
      "7. Keep your software updated: Outdated software can have vulnerabilities that hackers exploit. Ensure your operating systems, apps and browsers are\u00a0updated to the latest versions to close any security gaps.",
      "8. Limit sharing of personal information online: Be mindful about sharing personal information on social media or other platforms, as hackers can use this data in phishing schemes. Make sure to adjust\u00a0privacy settings on your social media accounts so only trusted friends can view your profile information.",
      "9. Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions: Public Wi-Fi networks are often less secure and can be vulnerable to hackers. When accessing sensitive accounts, use a VPN or wait until you're on a trusted, secure network.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",
      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Landmark data breach is just one of several data breaches I\u2019ve covered this year. While it\u2019s still unclear what type of cyberattack hackers used to break into the insurance company\u2019s systems, one thing is certain \u2013 they accessed sensitive data. Even more concerning is that hackers got into Landmark\u2019s system not once but twice, hinting at some major cybersecurity gaps.

While taking a ballot selfie is technically prohibited in New Jersey, Secretary of State spokesperson Trudi Gilfillian said poll workers may simply ask people to stop if they are found taking a selfie in the booth and do not to enforce the law if they find images posted on social media.",

      "Only 86 of the state's 159 counties participated in the survey, which showed that about 65% of crimes committed in those counties were carried out by gang members. Regardless, the nonprofit stated, the numbers show that gang activity has surged over the past six years.",

      "Although Latino gangs like MS-13 and Tren de Aragua are a growing problem, he said, the Bloods are still the group with the highest membership nationwide. The high number of gangs recorded by the survey can also be attributed to the fact that Georgia law defines any group of three or more people engaging in organized crime as a gang.",

      "The Netzarim Corridor splits Gaza in half, and has been the scene of heavy fighting between IDF forces, Hamas and other terror groups. (Video: IDF Spokesman's Unit.)",
      "Cease-fire talks continued last week as Israel, the U.S., Egypt and Qatar looked to find a solution to free the hostages and stop the war, yet life in the trenches goes on. Fox News Digital spoke with an IDF colonel based in the explosive Netzarim corridor in Gaza.",
      "The Netzarim Corridor splits Gaza in half, and it's here where IDF Col. Amir Ofri\u00a0organizes his troops in a fight against terrorists. The atmosphere is tense, he says, and describes a recent incident where a Gazan woman stumbled toward his unit checkpoint, her movements erratic, suggesting disorientation. As she approached, he recalls her repeatedly glancing over her shoulder, seemingly reluctant to come closer. He says it was clear to him that she was under the influence of drugs.",
      "\"We try to assess whether she poses a threat or is armed,\" Ofri tells Fox News Digital. But as the woman gets closer, it becomes obvious she is being directed by someone behind her. The decision is made to send her back, but as they do, his soldiers identify Hamas spotters in a nearby school in the refugee camp of Al-Bureij.

      "On the morning that Hamas attacked Israeli communities and settlements close to Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, Col. Ofri was with his family in the north to celebrate his 46th birthday. A seasoned officer, he immediately reported for duty to a base in the Negev Desert a little more than 30 kilometers from the border. By the next day, his reserve armored brigade was positioned at the Gaza fence, ready for whatever lay ahead. \"We were the first to enter Gaza on Oct. 21,\" he recalls.",
      "The responsibility he bears weighs heavily on him. \"It's been over nine months since I\u2019ve seen my wife and children for more than a fleeting moment,\" he says. Before the war, he directed a company with factories in Israel, Spain and the U.S. \"My partner in Oklahoma was one of the first to call me after Oct. 7.

      "The Netzarim Corridor is pivotal in the Gaza Strip. With the onset of the ground campaign, IDF forces established a four-kilometer wide corridor to split Gaza in two, from its eastern border to the Mediterranean Sea. Key towns sit along the route \u2013 Jabalia and Zeitoun to the north, and Al-Bureij and Nuseirat to the south.",
      "The other side, Hamas, doesn\u2019t account for the population; they exploit them. The terrorists we eliminate often wear civilian clothes. Some are disguised as women.\"",
      "Fifteen years after Gaza was last under Israel\u2019s military control, this strategic route is again being held by the IDF. The majority of Gaza\u2019s population has been evacuated south, allowing the IDF to maintain nearly full control over significant parts of the Strip.

      "\"All the convoys we needed to pass did pass, and then we saw Hamas setting up roadblocks, stopping and looting them,\" he says, elaborating on the complicated dynamics on the ground. \"Hamas targets specific trucks rather than looting indiscriminately. We observed them unloading supplies quickly, moving items into warehouses. We even saw armed Hamas vehicles leaving those locations, with guards at the entrances.\"",

As someone who approves all operations for the brigade, I state clearly that no fire is intentionally directed at women or children. Not a single shell or airstrike is executed without assessing potential collateral damage.\"",

      "\"The problem lies in Hamas's cynical use of the population,\" Ofri says. He blames the terror organization for the loss of so many civilian lives. \"We witnessed this during the recent Iranian attack. As soon as the Iranian assault began, on October 1, Hamas operatives attacked us. We were on the southern side of the corridor when they used short-range mortars to exploit the situation, pushing civilians toward our position.

While many speculate that Sinwar\u2019s death may lead to a turning point in the conflict, Ofri remains dubious. \"In my view, he was just another terrorist who deserved to die. He\u2019s just another obstacle in the effort to release hostages. I understand we won\u2019t be able to free them through military means alone. However, I believe military pressure is the only strategy that has led to the first hostage deal.\"",
      "And it is because of the hostages that Israel must continue fighting, he says. \"There are 101 hostages left, many of whom are relatives of our soldiers. Oct. 7 affected us all. I lost friends that day as well,\" Ofri says. \"That\u2019s why we come together time and again, although it gets harder and harder. If you ask any soldier, they will tell you it\u2019s about the hostages.\"",

      "Nash: East of Raleigh, Nash has been decided by razor-thin margins in the past few presidential elections (Trump won it in 2016 while Biden won it in 2020). It's also home to a competitive congressional race.",
      "Wake: Home to Raleigh in the fast-growing Research Triangle, Democrats have been building up their leads here and will need to continue to do so if they want to flip North Carolina.",
      "Pennsylvania (8 p.m.)",
      "Bucks: One of the key collar counties in the Philadelphia suburbs, it's one where, as Dave Wasserman, senior editor and elections analyst at The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter (and an NBC News Decision Desk contributor), notes in a recent analysis is \"Trump\u2019s best opportunity to make progress in the Philly suburbs\" because of a higher share of non-college-educated whites.",
      "Erie: Smack dab in the middle between Buffalo and Cleveland, this blue-collar swing county (north of Pittsburgh on Lake Erie) backed Trump in 2016 by 2 points before Biden won it by 1 point in 2020.",
      "Lackawanna: This Scranton-area county swung away from Democrats from 2012 to 2016 before shifting back a bit in 2020 (Barack Obama +28, Clinton +3, Biden +8). The 2024 margin here might be telling as to whether Biden, a Scranton native, was uniquely able to stem the Democratic erosion.",
      "Northampton: Northampton has served as one of the best bellwether counties in recent memory, picking the presidential winner for decades.",
      "Arizona (9 p.m.)",
      "Maricopa: The massive focus on Maricopa isn't a surprise, considering it's home to more than half the state's residents. Democrats have made gains here as they've made the state more competitive by bringing moderate Republican and Hispanic voters into their coalition. While Trump won it by 3 points in 2016, Biden won Maricopa by 2 points four years later.",
      "Michigan (9 p.m.)",
      "Kent: Home to Grand Rapids, Romney won this once-reliable Republican county with 53% of the vote in 2012. Trump narrowly won it in 2016 with 48%, but Biden flipped it four years later with 42%. If Trump can make Kent look more like 2016 or 2012 again, he could be in for a good night in the state.",
      "Wayne: An obvious point of emphasis for both campaigns, as the county is home to Detroit and will be a proving ground for how Harris can perform with Black and Arab American voters. Neither Clinton nor Biden could match Obama's 2012 mark of 73% there.",
      "Grand Traverse: Home of Traverse City, this wealthy area of northwest Michigan has been trending toward the Democrats. Trump would like to reverse that trend this go-around.",
      "Wisconsin (9 p.m.)",
      "Dane: Home to Madison and the University of Wisconsin, this county is all about the Democratic intensity in highly educated college towns. Biden netted 181,327 votes over Trump here in 2020 \u2014 up from Clinton\u2019s 146,422 in 2016. And that Democratic gain helped the party flip Wisconsin in 2020, given that Biden won the state by just 20,000 votes.",
      "Ozaukee: North of Milwaukee, it\u2019s the \"O\" in the \"WOW\" counties, the nickname for the three suburban counties in the state that have served as an ancestral home for Republicans. Biden\u2019s 43% there in 2020 was the best a Democrat performed there since 1964, as Ozaukee and Waukesha have drifted a bit away from the GOP in recent years.",
      "Washington: The only county of the three \"WOW\" counties in which Trump increased his vote share between 2016 and 2020, Washington is pushing back on the trend that's affected its neighboring counties. Trump needs to hold firm here and make sure any slippage in the suburbs elsewhere doesn't take hold in Washington."

      "For the second time in a decade, a Democratic woman is running against Donald Trump in a presidential race. And once again, the former president is facing a persistent gender gap. It is unusual that both Republican and Democratic presidential campaigns are focused on the same slice of voters, but as the race narrows, both Harris and Trump have found themselves pulling out the stops to mobilize women.",
      "Going into Election Day, female voters are much more likely to say they support Harris, with some polls showing the vice president holding a double-digit advantage. In an outlier poll from J. Ann Selzer for the Des Moines Register, Harris has leaped ahead of Trump in Iowa, a state he won in 2016 and again in 2020. According to the survey, which does not disclose how it is weighted to party affiliation, the shift is in part driven by women voters aged 65 and over, who are breaking for Harris by a two-to-one margin.",
      "\u201cHarris is showing a clear lead with\u00a0women, the question for tomorrow is whether it will be a historic one for a Democrat candidate,\u201d a pollster for J.L. Partners Scarlett Maguire said. \u201cIndeed, we have found that amongst undecided voters the biggest hesitation about voting Trump relates to concerns about what a conservative influence on his agenda would mean for women\u2019s rights.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, surveys show that Trump has built a solid lead with men. He has in particular sought to court young male voters, appearing on the popular \u201cAll-in Podcast\u201d and others hosted by Joe Rogan; the Nelk Boys; MIT-affiliated computer scientist Lex Fridman; and others.",
      "Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway has a name for the phenomenon that goes both ways: \u201cIt\u2019s a double gender gap.\u201d",
      "The gender gap is wide among both younger and older voters. An aggregate of three recent NBC News polls, conducted in July, September and October, found that Gen Z men are supporting Trump over Harris by 10 points (51% to 41%) while Gen Z women are going for Harris by over 40 points (68% to 26%). According to the same polls, boomer men supported Trump over Harris 57% to 39% while boomer women chose Harris 52% to 43%.",

      "Asked about his\u00a0message to women voters who might be thinking about voting for Harris, Trump told NBC News over the weekend that a vote for Harris risks economic catastrophe, responding:\u00a0\u201cThat you\u2019re voting for the wrong person, and we\u2019ll end up in a depression, and you\u2019re not going to be safe.\u201d",
      "Trump's campaign is making its own pitch to women voters in the waning days of the race by hosting events featuring Lara Trump, his daughter-in-law and the Republican National Committee co-chair; former NASCAR driver Danica Patrick; South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem; Morgan Ortagus, a former senior official from the first Trump administration, and others.\u00a0On Monday, Trump, at a battleground on the eve of Election Day, invited Lara Trump and his daughter Tiffany to the stage.",
      "His campaign has also enlisted onetime foes and campaign rivals, with Megyn Kelly announcing Monday that she would appear at a Pittsburgh rally for Trump to explain why she is voting for him, an appeal that comes after Kelly expressed concern that his campaign wasn\u2019t making sufficient inroads with women voters. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published this afternoon, Nikki Haley urges Americans who, like her, may not \u201cagree with Mr. Trump 100%\u201d of the time to vote for him over Harris, with whom she disagrees \u201cnearly all the time.\u201d\u00a0Trump and Haley haven't appeared together on the campaign trail in the final weeks, in spite of much speculation.",
      "This comes as Trump has at times veered off message as he barnstorms the country in the final days of the campaign, and attacked his political adversaries, including Cheney, whom he called a \"radical war hawk\" \u2014 and a chicken hawk \u2014 during a rally last week, wondering how the former Republican would feel on the front lines of a war.",
      "The final national NBC News poll shows how even a slight shift in turnout could deliver a different outcome for each party.",
      "The poll shows Harris getting support from 49% of registered voters while Trump gets an identical 49%. Just 2% of voters say they are undecided. The poll, conducted between Oct. 30 and Nov. 2, finds women backing Harris by a 16 percentage-point margin (57%-41%) and men supporting Trump by 18 points (58%-40%).",
      "Other outcomes based on slightly different turnout scenarios offer a different picture of what the election\u2019s results could be. In conditions slightly more favorable for Republicans \u2014 with more men turning out to vote, as well as white voters and voters without a college degree \u2014 Trump gains an edge over Harris.",
      "A small increase in turnout by women voters, white voters with college degrees and voters of color, delivers a result that puts Harris in the lead over Trump.",
      "The Trump campaign has been pointing to partisan turnout numbers as evidence that he is building an advantage with early voting. In a memo released Monday, the campaign cites data from veteran Democratic political strategist Tom Bonier to argue that numbers are down among women voters.",
      "Comparing 2024 to 2020 is difficult because in the previous contest Covid scrambled many voters practices and Trump was actively discouraging voting by mail more than he is doing this time.",
      "Asked by NBC News why they think the gender gap is playing out, two Arizona voters, a Democrat and Republican, both suggested the reason boils down to abortion rights that were enshrined in Roe v. Wade, which Harris has vowed to restore since the early days of her campaign.",
      "\u201cIt exists because a lot of men don\u2019t ever think about who brought them into this world,\u201d said Lala Johnson, a telemed assistant supporting Harris.",
      "\u201cWell, reproductive rights have a lot to do with it, but I really don\u2019t know,\u201d said Ned McCarthy, 70, who\u2019s supporting Trump.",
      "The gender gap isn\u2019t new. Since 1980, nearly every presidential election has seen a split, which in recent decades has shown Democrats winning with women voters. This was the case in 2016, when Hillary Clinton led women by double digits, and in 2020, when President Joe Biden won women voters as well.",
      "A Democratic official said that if women turn out to vote, the race is Harris\u2019 to lose.\u00a0As of Monday afternoon, women accounted for 53% of the roughly 77 million people who have voted early or by mail, according to NBC News data, while men make up just 44%.",
      "At the same time, a Trump campaign official granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly told NBC News that their feeling about the race remains \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d Trump is aided by the two-thirds of voters who say the nation is moving in the wrong direction, a persistent advantage on the economy and cost of living, and a rosy assessment of his presidency.",
      "Harris is ahead by just 9 points among Latino voters, 53%-44%, according to NBC News\u2019s poll, however the sample size is small and it includes a larger margin of error compared to the overall survey."

    "published": "Wed, 30 Oct 2024 13:29:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Exit polls, large-scale studies of voters, now include phone calls to early and mail voters as well as interviews outside polling places on Election Day.",
    "story": [
      "On Election Day, as votes are being tallied and news organizations await results and race projections that can be reported, exit polls are a critical tool providing an early look at who is voting and what\u2019s motivating their choices.",
      "An exit poll is a survey of voters taken as they leave (or exit) their voting location. It\u2019s the only national survey of known voters in the country. It allows news organizations, researchers and voters to understand what\u2019s happening in an election as the results flow in.",
      "Here\u2019s how exit polling works, where they are conducted and how NBC News will be using the exit poll results on election night and the days after.",
      "Who conducts the exit poll?",
      "Since 2003, Edison Research, a firm that specializes in collecting election data, has conducted exit polls on behalf of the National Election Pool. The NEP is a consortium of media networks \u2014 ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC News \u2014 that pools together resources for one collective vote count and exit poll operation. NBC News independently analyzes and reports on the exit poll results.",

      "How votes get counted and reported on election night \u2014 and how NBC News gathers and checks the data",
      "Inside NBC News' Decision Desk: When will we know who won the presidential race?",
      "What questions are asked?",
      "The exit poll asks voters which candidates they supported for president and in other races. But a number of other attitudinal and issue-based questions are usually included, such as: \u201cWhat is the most important issue to your vote?\u201d The other key component of an exit poll is asking about a voter\u2019s demographics such as age, gender, race, education. These types of questions help illustrate how different groups voted and what mattered to them, and they are also used to weight the exit poll \u2014 that is, to make sure that the exit poll properly reflects the demographic composition of the electorate as well as the election results.",
      "Follow live updates on the 2024 election",
      "Members of each news organization in the NEP jointly determine in which states the exit polls will be conducted (in addition to the national exit poll survey), and they work together to decide what questions are included on the national and state questionnaires. The exit poll questionnaires include about 25 questions and take around 5 minutes to complete.",
      "How are exit polls conducted?",
      "The exit poll is then conducted in a random sample of selected polling places across the country and in states with their own exit polls (more on that later). At least one interviewer is assigned to each polling place on Election Day. This year, interviewers will be stationed at 600 polling locations throughout the country, with each of them following local rules about where they can stand in relation to the polling location. The interview is self-administered, meaning the respondent fills out the survey on their own. Then, the interviewers call in their results throughout the day, and the results are reported to news organizations.",
      "What about state exit polls?",
      "In addition to a national exit poll, which captures voters across the country, there are exit polls specifically for states that are pivotal to winning the presidency or include important down-ballot races, such as Senate or governor. This year, NBC News will have coverage of state exit polls in Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. The exit poll will be conducted in 40 balloting locations in each state.",
      "How does the exit poll capture the growing percentage of people voting early or by mail?",
      "The exit poll supplements in-person Election Day interviews by contacting early voters through a telephone poll of people on voter lists in all 50 states, as well as by collecting interviews during early in-person voting periods.",
      "This year, the exit poll is conducting interviews at early in-person voting locations in Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada and Ohio. All voters in a given state, regardless of whether they vote early or on Election Day, are asked the same questions.",
      "Are exit polls anonymous?",
      "Yes. In person, voters are handed a piece of paper and pencil to fill out a paper questionnaire and they answer anonymously. When they are done, they put their folded questionnaire into a box, much like casting a ballot. Interviews conducted by telephone do not retain any personal information about the voter who was interviewed.",
      "How many people are interviewed?",
      "The national exit poll will include approximately 20,000 interviews in total, including in-person on Election Day, in-person during early voting and via telephone to capture other early voters, including those who cast their ballots by mail. For each state exit poll in Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin, there will be sample sizes of 1,500 to 2,500 respondents per state.",
      "How do we use exit polls?",
      "The NBC News Decision Desk uses some exit poll data to help project election results. However, the exit poll is primarily used as a reporting tool on election night.",
      "The data gives viewers and readers a look into what issues are motivating voters, how they feel about the country and who they are. It\u2019s the nation\u2019s first look into what the electorate looks like and how voters are feeling about the election, the candidates and their choices.",
      "What data do news organizations report and when?",
      "Participants in the NEP do not report any exit poll results before 5 p.m. ET on Election Day, and no exit poll results that can be indicative of the outcome of a race get reported until after all the polls are scheduled to close in a state. As election night goes on and interviewers on the ground call in more exit poll results, the data is updated and re-weighed in real time."

      "Last week, a flurry of litigation in Pennsylvania clarified the rules for mail balloting there. In short, mail ballots will still be rejected in the key battleground state if voters fail to properly date the affidavits that accompany their ballots \u2014 but voters who make any mistake with their mail ballots will be able to vote by provisional ballot instead on Election Day.",
      "The NBC News Decision Desk examined how many mail ballots remain outstanding in the state, as well as how many counties have already identified as deficient. In the event of a close race in Pennsylvania, provisional ballots and their counting will get a lot of attention after Tuesday night.",
      "Voters with outstanding mail ballots will need to ensure that election officials receive them by 8 p.m. Tuesday for them to count. But voters with outstanding or deficient mail ballots can also go to their polling places to vote in person.",
      "The data make it clear that most provisional ballots are likely to come from voters with outstanding mail ballots, rather than voters who\u2019ve already returned deficient mail ballots. And they also make it clear that those provisional ballots may favor Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party.",
      "The data on mail ballots and potential provisional ballots",
      "Overall, about 2.2 million Pennsylvanians have had approved mail ballot applications, according to public data from the state secretary of state. So far, about 82% have returned their mail ballots, according to the latest figures Monday. That means roughly 390,000 mail ballots are outstanding.",
      "If Pennsylvania\u2019s 2024 election follows the same trend we observed in 2022, that means about 150,000 more mail ballots will arrive in time to be counted, via either the mail or drop boxes. The remaining people with outstanding mail ballots will need to vote in person on Election Day to have their votes count. If these voters show up and surrender their mail ballots, they could vote with regular ballots; if they do not, they\u2019ll vote with provisional ballots, which election officials will count only after they confirm the initial mail ballots were not counted.",
      "In 2022, about a third of voters who requested but did not return their mail ballots ultimately voted in person. Taking 2022 as a guide, we would expect around 90,000 to vote in person, with about 35,000 using provisional ballots.",
      "Given that the outstanding mail ballots are disproportionately held by registered Democrats, we expect those provisional ballots to net Democratic candidates some additional votes that will not be reflected in vote totals until a few days after Election Day.",
      "It is more difficult to estimate how many mail ballots will be rejected once election officials start to canvass them Tuesday. Not only does Pennsylvania reject mail ballots if voters did not sign or correctly date the affidavits on the outside of the return envelopes or enclose the ballots in inner secrecy envelopes, but it also forbids counties from \u201ccanvassing,\u201d or opening up, mail ballots before Election Day.",
      "Some counties identify mail ballots with deficient affidavits or missing secrecy envelopes before Election Day without opening them, but some leave the task for Election Day. As a result, in some counties we cannot tell the true status of mail ballots.",
      "Overall, our panel of the available statewide data by day show 5,524 deficient mail ballots as of Monday \u2014 2,258 are missing signatures, 2,471 are missing dates or are misdated, and 795 lack secrecy sleeves. The data also shows that about 4,400 voters have taken advantage of county-specific polices to \u201ccure,\u201d or fix, their problematic mail ballots.",
      "In counties where we expect election officials to have checked mail ballots returned to date for any affidavit or secrecy issues, about 0.8% of mail ballots have ever been recorded as deficient. If that holds true, we\u2019d expect a little fewer than 20,000 deficient mail ballots statewide \u2014 but the deficiency rate may be higher in other counties.",
      "Voters who have returned deficient mail ballots and have yet to fix them can vote on Election Day, typically by provisional ballot. Those provisional ballots will be counted, according to the state Supreme Court\u2019s decision last week.",
      "However, at least in 2022, relatively few voters took advantage of that option. Meanwhile, as mentioned above, an estimated 35,000 might cast provisional ballots after having not returned their mail ballots at all.",
      "Looking ahead, we expect there to be a lot of discussion on election night and in the days after about provisional ballots cast by people who had requested mail ballots. There may well be future litigation revisiting, yet again, whether to count provisional ballots cast by people who previously returned deficient mail ballots. But from the perspective of the margin of victory in Pennsylvania, it is important to keep in mind that many more provisional ballots will be cast by people who never return their mail ballots at all."

      "Donald Trump has more than just the presidency on the line Nov. 5 \u2014 the outcome of his various legal troubles hinges on the election, as well.",
      "A win in the election he\u2019s dubbed \u201cthe most important\u201c in the history of the country would likely result in the federal criminal cases against him being dismissed, with state criminal cases possibly being frozen until he leaves office and additional delays in the various pending civil cases against him.",
      "A loss to Vice President Kamala Harris, however, could see Trump facing a potential jail sentence later in the month for his criminal conviction in New York and the possibility of additional criminal trials in 2025. It could also leave him open to additional civil trials in the near future, while he\u2019s already appealing $500 million in civil judgments against him.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot more arrows in the quiver when you\u2019re the president,\u201d said NBC News legal analyst Chuck Rosenberg.",
      "Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung predicted Trump would prevail at the ballot box and said all of the cases should be tossed. The \u201cwitch hunts against President Trump have imploded\u201d and \u201cshould all be dismissed in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s historic decision on immunity and other vital jurisprudence,\u201d Cheung said in a statement.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at where the legal cases against the Republican presidential nominee currently stand, and how they may \u2014 or may not \u2014 be affected by a Trump win or loss.",
      "Hush money case",
      "Win or lose, Trump\u2019s biggest immediate challenge after the election is his potential sentencing on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in New York. He is tentatively scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 26 \u2014 three weeks after Election Day.",
      "New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan twice postponed the proceeding to give Trump and his attorneys more time to argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s July ruling on the scope of presidential immunity should result in the conviction being thrown out. They also want the charges against Trump either dropped or for him to get a new trial that omits evidence they argue shouldn\u2019t have been allowed in light of the high court\u2019s ruling.",
      "Merchan is supposed to decide on that request by Nov. 12. Trump\u2019s attorneys are expected to immediately appeal if he rules against their client.",
      "If the sentencing proceeds, Merchan could potentially sentence Trump to prison, which would also be immediately appealed. Rosenberg told NBC News in May, after Trump\u2019s conviction, that jail time was unlikely but possible considering the former president spent much of the trial insulting the judge and defying his gag order.",
      "An election victory would give Trump additional fodder for an appeal to stave off jail time; his attorneys have argued in another case that the Constitution bars the president from being restricted from carrying out his official duties.",
      "Federal election interference case",
      "If Trump loses, special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election interference case is also on the horizon.",
      "The case, which charges Trump with conspiracy to defraud the United States for illegally trying to overturn the 2020 election results, was initially slated to go to trial earlier this year but was paused for several months while the Supreme Court weighed Trump\u2019s arguments that he was mostly protected from allegations of wrongdoing because of presidential immunity.",
      "Prosecutors are expected to continue moving forward with the case even if Trump is elected in November, but it\u2019s likely that whoever Trump names to head the Justice Department will fire Smith and scuttle the case.",
      "In an interview last week with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump suggested he might not wait for his new AG. \u201cI would fire him within two seconds,\u201d Trump said, referring to Smith.",
      "Even with Smith out of the picture, the Justice Department would still have to move to have the judge dismiss the case \u2014 a request judges don\u2019t always necessarily grant.",
      "Georgia election interference case",
      "The sprawling case charging Trump and more than a dozen others with illegally conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results is on hold until December when an appeals court will weigh whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and her office should be allowed to remain on the case.",
      "If she is, that could allow the long-stalled case to proceed. Trump\u2019s loss could pave the way for Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee to set a trial date for the case. However, if Trump loses, he is still likely to appeal the case further, which Willis brought against him in 2023, which could pose more delays.",
      "If Willis and her office are booted from the case, that would cause additional delays as well. The process of finding another prosecutor can be lengthy; it took almost two years to name one in another case involving Willis.",
      "If Trump wins the election, those delays could be even longer. At a court hearing in December of last year, McAfee asked Trump attorney Steve Sadow when his client could stand trial if he\u2019s elected.",
      "\u201cThe answer to that is I believe that under the supremacy clause and his duties as president of the United States, this trial would not take place at all until after he left his term in office,\u201d Sadow replied.",
      "Barbara McQuade, an NBC News legal analyst and a former federal prosecutor, said she believes it\u2019s possible both state criminal cases could be stayed during Trump\u2019s time in office and \u201cwould resume upon the expiration of his term.\u201d",
      "Classified documents case",
      "In July, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the criminal case charging Trump with lying and scheming to\u00a0mislead federal investigators\u00a0to retain sensitive classified materials after he left the White House, finding Smith\u2019s appointment as special counsel was illegal.",
      "Smith is appealing the decision, arguing that there\u2019s plentiful precedent for his appointment and that the case should be allowed to proceed.",
      "As with the federal election case, Smith\u2019s office is expected to proceed with business as usual in the appeal even if Trump is elected, although the special counsel\u2019s office would likely be quickly shut down and the appeal dropped.",
      "E. Jean Carroll appeals",
      "Cases that likely won\u2019t be affected by a Trump win or loss are his pending appeals of civil judgments against him totaling more than  $500 million.",
      "The former president is appealing the largest award \u2014 more than $478 million and growing by more than $111,000 a day \u2014 in a civil fraud case in New York state court. During arguments before the state Appellate Division, three members of the five-judge panel indicated they thought the award was too large.",
      "A lawyer for the state attorney general\u2019s office argued that the award is appropriate because the amount of fraud Trump and his company were found responsible for was sizable and went on for an extended period of time.",
      "It\u2019s unclear when the panel will rule.",
      "Trump is also appealing a pair of jury awards totaling about $88 million that he has to pay writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "Carroll filed two suits against Trump, one for allegedly sexually assaulting her in the 1990s and defamation and another for defaming her while he was president.",
      "The appeals court is expected to rule in the sexual assault case first, and that ruling could come at any time.",
      "Jan. 6 suits",
      "Trump is facing eight pending\u00a0civil suits\u00a0related to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including by injured police officers. Similar to the criminal cases, Trump has argued that his actions were protected by presidential immunity.",
      "A federal appeals court allowed the cases to proceed last year after the plaintiffs contended that Trump\u2019s actions weren\u2019t official presidential acts because he was acting as a candidate for the office.",
      "Trump, they noted, would have the opportunity to push back on that stance as the case proceeds.",
      "No trial date has been set in the cases, and with the likelihood of appeals the immunity issues could take months or longer to be determined.",
      "The process could become even more drawn out if Trump wins, because he could attempt to get the Justice Department involved in his defense. He could also try to delay trials in those cases by arguing that they should come after his criminal trial in Georgia, since they cover similar ground and could affect his right against self-incrimination.",
      "\u201cCivil cases are often stayed for that reason,\u201d McQuade said.",
      "\u2018Exonerated 5\u2019 suit",
      "Trump is facing another defamation suit brought against him this month by members of the so-called Central Park Five, who now call themselves the Exonerated Five.",
      "During last month\u2019s presidential debate, Trump incorrectly said that the men, who are Black and Latino, pleaded guilty in a criminal case in which they\u2019d been charged with assaulting and raping a white woman jogging in New York\u2019s Central Park in 1989. He also said they \u201ckilled a person ultimately\u201d although the woman is still alive.",
      "The five, who were teenagers when they were convicted, said they were coerced into confessions by police, and pleaded not guilty to the charges. They were convicted at trial and served lengthy prison sentences while maintaining their innocence.",
      "They were exonerated in 2002 after a review by prosecutors that included DNA evidence that found the jogger had been attacked by a serial rapist who confessed to the crime after the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "That suit is not expected to be affected by Trump\u2019s election given a Supreme Court ruling during the Clinton years that presidents aren\u2019t immune from civil suits that aren\u2019t related to their time in office.",
      "McQuade said she believes the case \u201ccould proceed, just as the Paula Jones case did against Bill Clinton.\u201d"

    "summary": "Several key states are perennially slow vote counters. Others have invested in speeding up the process. But if it\u2019s a very close race, don\u2019t expect a quick resolution.",
    "story": [
      "Americans have two big questions as they head into another election with a deeply divided electorate: who will win, and when will they know it?",
      "In 2020, election week replaced election night: Joe Biden wasn\u2019t declared the winner until Saturday. This year, it could go either way. It may take as long as a week for the NBC News Decision Desk to project a presidential winner, or it could happen as early as Wednesday, even by Wednesday morning.",
      "The truth is the Decision Desk cannot know until election night which scenario will unfold, regardless of how carefully we have analyzed the polls, early vote, and other election-related data. The answer depends not only on how states count their votes but on the unknowable factor of how close the margins will be.",
      "One thing is clear: The days of projecting a winner on election night itself are almost certainly over.",
      "Read more election explainers from the NBC News Decision Desk",
      "How the NBC News Decision Desk projects races on general election night 2024How votes get counted and reported on election night \u2014 and how NBC News gathers and checks the data How exit polls work and how NBC News uses them on election night",

      "How votes get counted and reported on election night \u2014 and how NBC News gathers and checks the data",
      "How exit polls work and how NBC News uses them on election night",
      "Projecting a presidential winner as early as Wednesday would require that the key battleground states, particularly Pennsylvania, are not essentially tied. There would need to be a large enough spread between the first and second place to be able to project a winner.",
      "Races that are nearly tied, like the presidential race in Georgia and Arizona in 2020 (Joe Biden\u2019s winning margins in these states were 11,779 and 10,457 votes, respectively), require essentially all the vote to be counted before NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk can project a winner. This can take days.",
      "But let\u2019s go through the battleground states where Wednesday calls are at least possible.",
      "How the critical 'blue wall' states count their votes \u2014 and how it\u2019s different from 2020",
      "Any path to winning the White House will likely go through the \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. In 2020, Pennsylvania was the pivotal Electoral College state to call the presidency, and there is a decent chance it plays that role again. But in 2020, it took four days after Election Day for the NBC News Decision Desk to be able to declare a winner.",
      "It may well happen much earlier this year. This is because 98% to 99% of the vote in Pennsylvania will likely be counted by Wednesday morning.",
      "How Pennsylvania counts its vote remains largely unchanged since 2020, but the process should be more efficient this year. Key counties like Allegheny (home of Pittsburgh) and Philadelphia have invested heavily in new voting machines and have added more personnel to help process ballots. Also, remember that this election is not being administered amid a global pandemic that required strict social distancing between election officials, slowing the count.",
      "We expect several Pennsylvania counties to release large counts of early votes shortly after polls close, followed by the in-person Election Day vote. That would leave the early votes received on Election Day, along with provisional ballots, still to count on Wednesday.",
      "If 99% of the total vote is counted quickly, a Wednesday projection is very possible in Pennsylvania, unless the race is razor tight. In 2022, we had about 90% of the vote counted in Pennsylvania when the NBC News Decision Desk projected Democrat John Fetterman as the winner of the state\u2019s Senate race at 12:51 a.m. ET.",
      "In Wisconsin and Michigan, the bulk of the vote could also be counted by Wednesday if past reporting patterns hold.",
      "Based on those patterns, in Wisconsin, the amount counted by Wednesday morning should be over 99%. In Michigan, it should be more than 95%. An important note in Michigan: For the first time, municipalities with more than 5,000 residents can begin pre-processing absentee ballots \u2014 opening envelopes, verifying voter signatures and so on \u2014 several days before the election, which could lead to more efficient counting on election night.",
      "On the other hand, the introduction of early in-person voting in Michigan could add some difficulty in quickly counting the vote. Regardless of these changes, both Michigan and Wisconsin count almost all of their votes quickly. So, unless the races are extremely close, there is a decent chance the NBC News Decision Desk would be able to make a projection sometime on Wednesday.",
      "If the races are that close, however, it could take days or perhaps even a week, depending on the margins.",
      "How the Sun Belt battlegrounds count their votes",
      "Outside of the blue wall, the critical swing states of Georgia and North Carolina are among the best in the nation when it comes to efficiently processing and counting their votes.",
      "These two states are also extremely good at making their data available to the public electronically. In Georgia, over 99% of the vote will be counted on election night. In fact, almost all the vote has been counted in recent past elections by 1 a.m. ET. However, Georgia was so close in 2020 that it took days to call the race.",
      "North Carolina has a similar pattern in how it reports out the vote, with 99% of the vote counted by midnight in past elections. Still, any chance of an election night projection in either of these closely divided states depends on a wide enough spread between the two candidates.",
      "The one electoral vote awarded to the winner in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd Congressional District could also be pivotal in the path to 270. With no significant changes in how votes are counted in Nebraska, around 90% of the vote can be expected to be counted by Wednesday morning, which again could lead to a projection if there is enough spread between the candidates.",
      "The last two battleground states, Arizona and Nevada, almost certainly won\u2019t be called quickly. If the presidency comes down to one of these states, forget any thoughts of a Wednesday resolution.",
      "In 2020, NBC News did not project a winner in Arizona until Nov. 12, nine days after Election Day. And unlike some other close states, it wasn\u2019t just because the margin was so thin.",
      "Typically, Arizona has as much as 20% of its vote still to count after election night \u2014mainly late-arriving mail ballots. And there are very substantial differences between Republicans and Democrats in terms of who votes when (early versus on Election Day). This makes it nearly impossible to project a winner in Arizona on election night.",
      "Nevada is a state that has a large amount of early voting, both absentee and in person, that is not counted on election night. In the past, nearly a quarter of the vote is still not counted by the Wednesday morning after Election Day.",
      "Given that the state has been historically close in presidential elections, the probability of calling a close race with a large amount of uncounted vote is very low.",
      "The bottom line: In Arizona and Nevada, it will likely take a few days, perhaps longer, to know the winner."

    "summary": "After Donald Trump claimed victory in the early morning hours after election night in 2020, his campaign and supporters turned to the courts to make that claim a reality.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 After Donald Trump claimed victory in the early-morning hours after election night in 2020, his campaign and supporters turned to the courts to make that claim a reality. The Trump campaign and surrogates began filing lawsuits the very same day, challenging the results on a variety of grounds well before the final votes were counted.",
      "The legal process and tactics may provide insight into how Trump or his allies could launch similar efforts should he lose again this time.",
      "Over the remainder of November and into December, Trump and his Republican allies filed dozens of lawsuits in key swing states that, if successful, would have given Trump the Electoral College votes needed to remain in the White House. Their efforts stretched from local county courts all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and were supported by solo practitioners and state attorneys general alike.",
      "Of the more than 60 lawsuits filed in the post-election period, Trump obtained a favorable ruling in only one case \u2014 the remainder were eventually either dismissed, settled or voluntarily withdrawn.",
      "Approximately 12 hours after Trump declared victory in a 2 a.m. speech from the White House, the campaign filed lawsuits seeking to stop the counts in Michigan and Georgia. Later that day, a third lawsuit was filed in Pennsylvania seeking to prevent voters from \u201ccuring\u201d mail-in ballots that lacked proof of identification.",
      "More lawsuits from the campaign and Republican allies swiftly followed in those states and other heated battlegrounds. In Arizona, voters and the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit alleging thousands of people in Maricopa County had their ballots disqualified because of ink-bleed caused by Sharpies. In Nevada, Trump electors sued alleging that faulty signature matching machines cast doubt on over 100,000 Clark County mail-in votes. In Wisconsin, Trump filed a lawsuit alleging widespread voter fraud and demanding a recount, which ultimately reaffirmed Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the state.",
      "Over the following days and weeks, all these lawsuits ended in losses for Trump, with the exception of his initial lawsuit in Pennsylvania. That resulted in an order finding that the Pennsylvania secretary of state overstepped by extending the deadline for voters to provide missing proof of identification for mail-in ballots received after Election Day and enjoining counties from counting any ballots \u201ccured\u201d during that time. Even with that ruling, Biden still won Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes.",
      "On Nov. 19, 2020, nearly two weeks after all major media outlets had called the election for Biden, Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis held a press conference in Washington, D.C., to present evidence they claimed showed widespread fraud and election interference by foreign countries.",
      "\u201cThe number of voter fraud cases in Philadelphia could fill a library,\u201d Giuliani said.",
      "\u201cWhat we are really dealing with here, and uncovering more by the day, is the massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba and likely China in the interference with our elections here in the United States,\u201d Powell said.",
      "Powell\u2019s claims at that press conference went too far even for Trump, who behind the scenes dismissed her as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cunhinged,\u201d according to filings in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s criminal election interference case against Trump.",
      "The rate of new lawsuits slowed significantly in December, but Trump and his allies hadn\u2019t given up. One week into the month, Texas sought leave at the U.S. Supreme Court to file a lawsuit against Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin arguing that officials in those states had made illegal changes to election laws and again raising allegations of fraud. Seventeen Republican attorneys general would go on to add their support to Texas\u2019 case. The justices ultimately declined to hear the case, stating that Texas had not shown a \u201cjudicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court, with the exception of justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, never showed any real appetite for taking up other election cases that rose to their level. The justices disposed of a handful of post-election challenges from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin with no further explanation in an order a month after Biden was inaugurated.",
      "\u201cThese cases provide us with an ideal opportunity to address just what authority nonlegislative officials have to set election rules, and to do so well before the next election cycle,\u201d Thomas wrote in a dissent. \u201cThe refusal to do so is inexplicable.\u201d",
      "The legal efforts to keep Trump in power had failed, but the ramifications of these challenges would continue to unfold for their participants over the following years. The federal indictment against Trump mentions these baseless lawsuits as proof of his corrupt intent to remain in power despite knowing he lost the election. Giuliani has been disbarred in New York and D.C., indicted in Georgia and Arizona and has been ordered to turn over his Manhattan apartment and other property to two Georgia election workers he defamed.",
      "Powell and Ellis were indicted in Georgia and have both pleaded guilty. Ellis was also indicted in Arizona and has since agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for her charges being dropped. And dozens of ethics complaints against local attorneys who filed election challenges are still pending nationwide."

      "The 2024 election looks extremely close in the polls. And if the actual results are that close after Election Day, it's possible the results in a key state could hinge on a recount.",
      "The rules about when recounts happen and the procedures they include vary from state to state, since elections are administered locally. Those rules were in the spotlight in 2020, after Joe Biden won a handful of key battleground states by a razor-thin margin.",
      "Former President Donald Trump requested, and was granted, recounts in a few of these states, but none of them changed the outcome of the election there. Typically, recounts only slightly change the final margin of a race, but when the vote is close enough, they can have a real effect.",
      "Ahead of Election Day, here's a refresher of the recount rules in the states expected to be the closest in the presidential race.",
      "Arizona",
      "Candidates don't request recounts in Arizona, but the state requires an automatic recount if a race is decided by a margin within (or equal to) less than 0.5% of votes cast in a race. The threshold was lower in 2020 (0.1%), but since then, the state enacted a law raising the automatic recount threshold to 0.5%.",

Those two changes are expected to speed up tabulation, but it could still take days to get a full picture of the election results.",

      "Georgia",
      "Mail ballots: Georgia starts processing mail ballots on Oct. 21, and they can be dropped off until polls close on Election Day.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 10:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The close and uncertain battle for the White House has taken center stage this year.",
    "story": [
      "The close and uncertain battle for the White House has taken center stage this year. But Congress will play a major role in implementing (or blocking) the next president\u2019s agenda \u2014 and the fight for the legislative branch is coming down to the wire.",
      "Both parties only need to net a handful of seats to flip each chamber, with Republicans currently controlling the House and Democrats controlling the Senate with slim majorities.",
      "Senate Republicans need a net gain of two seats to win the majority outright or just one seat if former President Donald Trump also wins the White House, since the vice president casts tie-breaking votes in the Senate.",
      "In the House, Democrats need to net just four seats to take control of the chamber, and it is possible they could win the House even if Vice President Kamala Harris loses the White House. Control of the House could also be unclear for days, with several battleground seats in slow-counting California.",
      "As the battle for Congress comes to a close, here are five things to watch:",
      "1. Will there be ticket-splitters?",
      "Both parties will be relying on the dwindling group of voters who split their tickets between the presidential race and down-ballot contests.",
      "In the Senate, two Democrats are running for re-election in states Trump is expected to carry: Montana\u2019s Jon Tester and Ohio\u2019s Sherrod Brown. Both have relied on ticket-splitters in the past, leveraging their own personal brands and appeals to working-class voters.",
      "But Republicans are betting that both states have shifted too far to the right for Tester and Brown to defeat their respective Republican opponents, former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy and businessman Bernie Moreno.",
      "(West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice is expected to pick up a Senate seat for Republicans easily in his state, where Democratic-turned-independent Sen. Joe Manchin decided not to run for re-election.)",
      "Ticket-splitters could also play an outsize role in the battle for the House, where a slew of competitive districts are in states that are not presidential battlegrounds, like New York and California. There are 16 Republicans running for re-election in districts President Joe Biden won in 2020. While there are some signs Trump may be outperforming his 2020 margins in these districts, particularly in blue states like New York, Republicans will likely have to hang on to some Harris districts to hold the House majority. Five Democratic incumbents are also running in districts Trump carried in 2020, making them top GOP targets this year.",
      "2. What impact could the presidential race have down-ballot?",
      "The race for the White House is expected to have a significant impact on down-ballot races, especially in perennial battlegrounds.",
      "Democrats are defending five Senate seats in presidential battlegrounds, including two open-seat races in Arizona and Michigan. Pennsylvania\u2019s Bob Casey, Wisconsin\u2019s Tammy Baldwin and Nevada\u2019s Jacky Rosen are also running for re-election.",
      "Their fates could be closely tied to the presidential race. In 2020, just one senator, Maine Republican Susan Collins, won re-election as her state voted for the opposite party for president. In 2016, every state supported the same party for president and for Senate.\u00a0And this year, Harris and Biden have been key themes in congressional Republicans\u2019 closing-argument ads. (More on that below.)",
      "Some candidates, like Casey and Republican Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania, have been trying to strike a balance with the top of their respective tickets by appearing with their parties\u2019 presidential nominees on the campaign trail while also highlighting areas of disagreement.",
      "Several of these Senate candidates, like Rosen in Nevada, have been able to run ahead of Harris, as their GOP opponents have struggled to gain traction. But Senate contests in these battlegrounds have largely tightened in recent days, as the presidential races in these states are coin flips.",
      "These battlegrounds are also hosting competitive House races, such as Pennsylvania\u2019s 7th District anchored in Allentown, which is also a presidential bellwether, and the 10th District in Harrisburg, where a former Freedom Caucus leader is on defense.",
      "3. Which issues will win out?",
      "Like the race for president, congressional races have centered on issues that voters often list as crucial to their votes: the economy, immigration, abortion and democracy. But in the waning days of the election, both parties have focused their closing arguments on two distinct issues.",
      "Democratic candidates in the most competitive House and Senate races focused many of their closing ads on abortion, looking to leverage an issue that has boosted the party since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade more than two years ago. Democrats also believe ballot initiatives enshrining abortion rights in some crucial battlegrounds could boost their candidates, even as polling has shown a wide gap between those measures and Democratic candidates.",
      "The second-most mentioned topic in Democrats\u2019 closing ads last week was immigration, as Democrats look to rebut GOP attacks on the issue, followed by health care, bipartisanship and taxation.",
      "Republicans\u2019 most mentioned topic on the airwaves last week was immigration, often mentioned alongside other topics like transgender women playing women\u2019s sports, as they try to paint Democrats as extreme. Other frequently mentioned topics include Harris, taxation, Biden and character, underscoring how Republicans have tried to nationalize these congressional races.",
      "4. Can Republicans overcome Democrats\u2019 massive financial advantage?",
      "Republicans have long been concerned about Democrats\u2019 massive fundraising advantage in House and Senate races. Democrats saw a fundraising boon when Harris took over the ticket, which flooded down-ballot campaigns with cash as she also broke fundraising records.",
      "That\u2019s allowed Democratic candidates to dominate the airwaves, pushing out their positive messages and launching early attacks against their GOP opponents. While Republicans have gotten a boost from outside groups, those groups are charged higher rates for ads, so their money does not go as far.",
      "Nearly $1.6 billion has been spent on ads in Senate races since Labor Day, with Democrats spending $803 million and Republicans spending $758 million, according to AdImpact.",
      "In each of the competitive Senate contests, the Democratic candidate has outspent their opponent in campaign ads. But Republicans have harnessed big-spending outside groups to take the lead in spending in some key races, like in Ohio\u2019s tight race, where Republicans have spent a combined $185 million to Democrats\u2019 $143 million.",
      "More than $1 billion has also been spent on ads in House races since Labor Day, with Democrats spending $615 million to Republicans\u2019 $448 million, according to AdImpact. And Democratic candidates and outside groups have outspent Republicans in 17 of the 20 House races that have seen the most ad spending this fall.",
      "5. Will there be any surprises?",
      "House and Senate contests could also see some surprise results on election night.",
      "One of the most surprising developments on the Senate map has been a competitive race in Nebraska, where independent Dan Osborn is taking on GOP Sen. Deb Fischer.",
      "The race has led to some late spending in the Cornhusker State, with Republicans looking to prop up Fischer as she tries to close the gap with Trump, who is expected to easily win the state.",
      "Since Labor Day, Osborn has spent $9.8 million on ads and Fischer has spent $3.5 million. And outside groups have ramped up their spending since Labor Day, with independent PAC Retire Career Politicians spending more than $13 million.",
      "Democrats have continued to invest in Texas, where Democratic Rep. Colin Allred is facing GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, and they\u2019re also eyeing a possible pickup in Florida, where former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is challenging GOP Sen. Rick Scott.",
      "Allred has led the race in ad spending since Labor Day, shelling out more than $50 million to Cruz\u2019s $27 million. Senate Majority PAC, the main Democratic outside group involved in Senate races, has contributed $12.2 million in the race so far through its affiliated group WinSenate in an effort to bolster Allred\u2019s campaign by focusing ads on abortion.",
      "In the Maryland Senate race, Republicans have tried to pull off an upset by recruiting former GOP Gov. Larry Hogan to run for the open seat. Hogan has made the race unusually competitive\u00a0for the typically blue state, but Democratic candidate Angela Alsobrooks has trounced Hogan in ad spending, pouring more than $10 million onto the airwaves, with Hogan spending roughly $3.2 million.",
      "Republicans have ramped up their ad spending in Maryland since Labor Day, thanks largely to the pro-Hogan super PAC Maryland\u2019s Future, which has spent more than $25 million boosting Hogan on the airwaves."

But they warned that delays in the counting or a tight race in which a single state decides the presidency could lead to a divisive legal battle.",
      "The longer the race remains unresolved, experts predicted, the more time domestic and foreign actors will have to spread disinformation that will sow doubt, discord and division over the results.",
      "Danielle Tomson, research manager at the University of Washington\u2019s Center for an Informed Public, predicted an increase in rumors on Election Day \u201cas more people go to the polls and encounter both real and perceived problems with voting.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe problem is when political actors or influencers take one real problem,\u201d Tomson said, \u201cand misleadingly exaggerate its impact or scope to indicate some larger coordinate fraud or mass conspiracy.\u201d",

      "A flood of disinformation and legal claims",
      "In Seattle, 25 researchers at the Center for an Informed Public will work in shifts to document rumors as they arise on Election Day and beyond. It is one of a few large-scale academic projects\u00a0still studying election disinformation\u00a0\u2014 several prominent others shuttered or were weakened in response to a conservative attack on such research.",
      "In\u00a0published primers, the researchers have said to expect a steady stream of rumors throughout the day \u2014 potentially hundreds of videos, photos and statements purporting to capture suspected irregularities, conspiracy theories or concerns Trump and his allies may present as evidence of voter fraud.",
      "Already, this election season has been shaped by online content alleging\u00a0voting machine malfunctioning, unfair\u00a0ballot ordering and noncitizens\u2019\u00a0illegally voting, as well as false conspiracy claims\u00a0involving the news media\u00a0and other viral videos that have had to be debunked by election officials, secretaries of state and federal agencies.",
      "Conservative groups pushing election conspiracy theories have also signaled their intention to paint any irregularities or routine processes as fraud, like longer count times in states that don\u2019t allow workers to pre-process mail-in or absentee ballots.",
      "A misleading advertisement from the Election Integrity Network says \u201cThe Glitch Is In\u201d alongside a carousel of news coverage of such procedural Election Day issues. The Election Integrity Network\u2019s founder, Cleta Mitchell,\u00a0promotes\u00a0her thousand-strong group as a kind of \u201cnational neighborhood watch.\u201d",
      "Researchers also point to a new kind of infrastructure around documenting and sharing such rumors on Election Day. Whereas in years past, they were more likely to appear organically on social media platforms, this year, official channels have been built to shepherd the so-called evidence into channels where it can be used.",
      "Videos are already flooding X, specifically on a channel that X owner Elon Musk, a major Trump backer, has promoted via his America PAC. The community described as \u201cdedicated to sharing potential instances of voter fraud and irregularities that Americans are experiencing in the 2024 Election,\u201d has over 60,000 members, and is already a hub for baseless rumors.",
      "The top posts in that community on Tuesday included videos from political activists known for misleading content: including one from the Heritage Foundation claiming voters were registering with illegal addresses in Maricopa County, Ariz and James O\u2019Keefe, suggesting noncitizens were voting in Philadelphia.",
      "That public depository joins other existing clearinghouses that election deniers claim prove widespread cheating. Election conspiracy theorists, including MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and activists with True the Vote, offer apps to collect purported evidence of fraud.",
      "Beyond fearmongering, experts expect such content from voters, poll watchers, influencers and operatives to become the stuff of lawsuits contesting the results.",

      "Part of the effort to challenge the results of the 2020 election, and the midterms two years later, Berwick said, was based on affidavits and declarations from eyewitnesses who say they believe they saw something illegal.",
      "\u201cIn every instance, it turned out that the person who signed the affidavit misunderstood what they saw, or in some cases, it was just truly made up,\u201d Berwick said. \u201cThe lawsuits in 2020 were rejected in part because there was absolutely no evidence for the claims that there was any wrongdoing. I am sure that this time around, there is going to be an effort to come to court with more quote, unquote evidence, right?",
      "\u201cWhatever they can get their hands on, that they can twist to look like some kind of conspiracy or fraud or even error,\u201d he added, \u201cwhatever they can get their hands on, they will use.\u201d",

Gallant was scheduled to meet with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, in Washington in early October \u2014 a trip Gallant initiated \u2014 but it was postponed at Netanyahu\u2019s request.",

      "\"With Gallant ... it is not possible to achieve absolute victory,\" Ben-Gvir wrote in a post on X.",
      "In a nationally televised statement in May, Gallant challenged Netanyahu over his refusal to discuss a cease-fire and hostage deal. He said that would force Israel to have to rule over the Palestinian enclave again.",
      "\u201cWe must make tough decisions for the future of our country, favoring national priorities above all other possible considerations, even with the possibility of personal or political costs,\u201d Gallant said over the summer.",

      "Apart from ethical issues, Musk\u2019s commercial investments abroad \u2014 particularly in China \u2014 combined with his company\u2019s sensitive federal contracts for the U.S. military\u2019s space program raise serious questions about conflicts of interest that could jeopardize America\u2019s national security, according to current and former U.S. officials and experts.",
      "Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla heavily relies on China, now seen by both political parties as the primary security threat and economic rival to the United States. Tesla depends on China as a production base and as a crucial market for its vehicles. During a visit to China earlier this year, Musk echoed Beijing\u2019s line on Taiwan, describing it as an \u201dintegral part\u201d of China.",
      "Unlike some tycoons or corporate chiefs, Musk has not shied away from weighing in on geopolitics even when it is at odds with U.S. foreign policy, advocating positions on the war in Ukraine that aligned with the Kremlin\u2019s stance. Musk has had telephone conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a source with knowledge of the matter, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Some lawmakers who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the conversations worry that Musk could try to push U.S. policy in a direction favorable to his financial interests. They are concerned that Musk could undercut America\u2019s goal of preventing China from gaining access to cutting-edge technology that can be used to build up its military and intelligence capabilities.",
      "Experts say Musk\u2019s potential leverage over the U.S. government stems from the influential role SpaceX has. The company, where Musk serves as CEO, has been called a \u201cde facto monopoly\u201d by analysts because of its dominant market share in sending commercial and government satellites to space.",
      "Musk stands to intensify his companies\u2019 business with the government through his now deep connection with Trump, and potentially target rivals in the aerospace world, such as Boeing, through Trump\u2019s efficiency efforts. Musk has previously criticized Boeing, which has massive government contracts in partnership with other defense giants.",
      "Musk has criticized the types of \u201ccost-plus\u201d government contracts awarded to large defense companies that he says stymie innovation and provide no incentive for companies to finish the work. Such a move would set off a frenzy among lawyers and lobbyists in Washington, whom rival contractors would hire to fight Musk\u2019s efforts.",
      "Trump has given conflicting accounts about how Musk might fit into his administration, telling Fox News in an interview last month that he\u2019d like Musk to be his \u201csecretary of cost-cutting\u201d but also \u201cnot in the Cabinet.\u201d",
      "Musk said at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally Oct. 27 that he wants to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget \u2014 more than the discretionary budget of $1.7 trillion. Musk didn\u2019t specify what he\u2019d cut.",
      "Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign senior adviser, said in a statement to NBC News on Sunday that Trump wants Musk to lead a \u201ccommission\u201d that will \u201censure our government works more efficiently and uses America\u2019s taxpayer dollars effectively.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs President Trump has said, Elon Musk is a genius, an innovator, and has literally made history by building creative, modern, and efficient systems,\u201d Hughes said.",
      "Rather than shy away from potential conflicts of interest, Musk has talked openly about his desire to see Trump directly help his businesses by slashing regulations.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing with SpaceX, Tesla and whatnot is that the sort of regulatory oppression year after year is worse and worse,\u201d he said at a town hall event in Pennsylvania on Oct. 18.",
      "Trump, in turn, has promised to assist, pledging his support for Musk\u2019s desire to send a rocket to Mars.",
      "\u201cI love Elon Musk,\u201d Trump said at a rally in July. \u201cWe have to make life good for our smart people. And he\u2019s as smart as you get.\u201d In March, Trump said he already helped Musk in unspecified ways when he was in the White House.",
      "Trump has also said that his administration will have \u201cthe lowest regulatory burden\u201d for all major companies and manufacturers.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how Musk and Trump would navigate the ethical questions around a possible government role for the tech billionaire. In his first term, Trump jettisoned traditional norms around presidents walling off their personal interests and instead retained his business holdings \u2014 including a Washington, D.C., hotel where foreign leaders booked rooms. (The Trump Organization sold the hotel in 2022.)",
      "Musk and representatives for his businesses did not respond to a request for comment on the stakes for them in the election.",
      "When it comes to taxes, Trump has been transparent about his desire to keep taxes low for corporations and wealthy individuals like Musk. In April, Trump told wealthy donors at a gathering in Palm Beach, Florida, that he wanted to extend his prior administration\u2019s tax cuts. His 2017 tax law slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Vice President Kamala Harris has called for rolling that tax rate back halfway, to 28%.",
      "And while tax liability for specific corporations and individuals will vary based on an array of factors including deductions and tax planning, Trump\u2019s tax plan would keep a rate cut for the highest-income earners. His 2017 law dropped the top rate from 39.6% to 37%.",
      "Harris, by contrast, has proposed raising tax rates for the wealthy. She has called for a return to the 39.6% top income tax rate, and she has proposed raising the long-term capital gains tax rate from 20% to 28% for those earning more than $1 million a year.",
      "The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive advocacy group, said in a report in September that if the Trump tax cuts were extended for 10 years past their 2025 expiration, 41% of the benefits would go toward high-income households through rate cuts, special deductions and cuts on inheritance tax. (The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for a response to that report.)",
      "Musk has a net worth of $268 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His annual taxable income is not known.",
      "There\u2019s more transparency, though, around how Musk stands to benefit from Trump\u2019s regulatory posture.",
      "Musk, the world\u2019s wealthiest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has been engaged in recent years in at least 19 separate regulatory or legal battles with the Biden administration and independent federal agencies related to his sprawling business empire, according to a tally by NBC News. And 10 of those are ongoing, with the result possibly in the hands of the next president\u2019s administration.",
      "The 19 separate fights between Musk and the federal government have involved 12 different government entities and touched on a broad cross-section of everyday life: from a wildlife refuge in Texas near a SpaceX launch site to alleged racial harassment at a Tesla factory in California to Tesla\u2019s decision to market driver-assistance software as \u201cfull self-driving\u201d even though it requires human supervision.",
      "Separate from Musk\u2019s business empire, his America PAC has been entangled in a legal battle, with Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner over the super PAC\u2019s $1 million daily prize giveaways. On Monday, a judge declined to halt the cash prizes.",
      "Enforcement of federal laws and regulations generally falls to presidential appointees, and experts say it\u2019s not difficult to predict how Musk would fare under Trump\u2019s picks.",
      "\u201cHe would be in much less trouble in a Trump administration because Trump shares his hostility to regulation and regulators,\u201d Richard Pierce, a law professor at George Washington University specializing in government regulation, told NBC News in an interview earlier this year.",
      "Musk\u2019s business interests are sprawling. On top of Tesla and SpaceX, he\u2019s the largest shareholder in X and the founder of three other notable startups: brain science firm Neuralink, tunnel builder The Boring Co. and artificial intelligence business xAI.",
      "Each of those six companies has a complex relationship with the federal government \u2014 in terms of regulations, contracts or both \u2014 that could pivot based on who\u2019s in the White House.",
      "\u201cA second Trump term could very well shift the administrative and regulatory state in ways that would benefit Musk\u2019s companies,\u201d said Angela Aneiros, an assistant professor of law at Gonzaga University and a co-director of the university\u2019s Center of Law, Ethics & Commerce.",
      "\u201cA second term, if it happens, will result in federal agencies\u2019 shifting their focus away from investigations into regulatory compliance issues,\u201d Aneiros said. Instead, she added, the focus of a Trump return would most likely be different priorities, such as immigration enforcement.",
      "While some of the 19 recent fights between Musk\u2019s companies and the federal government have ended, there are at least 10 ongoing, from regulatory lawsuits to criminal investigations:",
      "\u2022 Tesla safety: Tesla is under investigation by the Justice Department and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration over its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features. Musk has defended the features, saying they make Teslas safer than manually driven cars.",
      "\u2022 Tesla benefits: Federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been investigating whether Tesla improperly paid for a house for Musk, according to a report last year in The Wall Street Journal. Tesla emphasized in a securities filing a year ago that it wasn\u2019t aware of any finding of wrongdoing related to the investigation. There\u2019s been no public indication of a resolution to the inquiry since.",
      "\u2022 SpaceX hiring: The Justice Department is suing SpaceX, alleging it discriminated against asylum-seekers and refugees in hiring. SpaceX countersued, saying the regulatory system violates the Constitution, and it won a temporary stay a year ago. A Texas federal judge is weighing motions in the case.",
      "\u2022 Alleged racial harassment: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is suing Tesla, alleging that it tolerated the harassment of its Black employees at a California plant. Tesla has said the complaint lacks details to support its argument. A California judge is overseeing pretrial discovery.",
      "\u2022 Tesla union fight: Tesla is fighting the National Labor Relations Board over a finding that the company and Musk violated the rights of workers to form a union at the same plant in California. Musk had tweeted in 2018 that unionized workers would lose stock options. Tesla\u2019s lawyers say his tweet was protected \u201cemployer speech.\u201d Last month, a federal appeals court sent the matter back to the NLRB.",
      "\u2022 SpaceX firings: SpaceX faces a complaint from one of the NLRB\u2019s regional offices, alleging that it unlawfully fired eight workers for circulating a letter calling Musk a \u201cdistraction and embarrassment.\u201d SpaceX responded with a lawsuit saying the structure of the NLRB is unconstitutional. An appeals court is scheduled to hear oral argument Nov. 18.",
      "\u2022 Twitter acquisition fallout: The SEC is investigating whether Musk or anyone else committed securities fraud in 2022 as he accumulated stock in Twitter before he acquired the company, now called X. After a magistrate ruled that Musk must testify in the case, Musk did so on Oct. 3 at the SEC\u2019s Los Angeles office.",
      "\u2022 Satellite internet: The Federal Communications Commission voted in December to deny an award of $886 million to SpaceX\u2019s Starlink for rural broadband service, even though Starlink won a 2020 auction process. SpaceX called the decision indefensible, and Musk continues to talk about reversing it in comments as recent as last month.",
      "\u2022 SpaceX licensing: The Federal Aviation Administration said in September that it was pursuing $633,009 in civil penalties against SpaceX related to safety requirements for two launches in 2023. Musk said that SpaceX would sue the FAA for \u201cregulatory overreach.\u201d",
      "\u2022 Tesla workplace injuries: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is investigating the death in August of a worker at Tesla\u2019s manufacturing plant in Austin. Tesla has not commented on the death, which is also the subject of a lawsuit by the worker\u2019s family.",
      "The arguments put forward by Musk\u2019s lawyers could have far-reaching effects. They have said in court filings that parts of three federal agencies \u2014 the SEC, the NLRB and the Justice Department \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be allowed to operate as they do because Congress set them up in a way that violates the Constitution.",
      "On the campaign trail, Musk has at times dramatized the stakes of the election for himself. In an October appearance with talk show host Tucker Carlson, he alleged that Harris might want to exact \u201cvengeance\u201d on him personally if she wins the election.",
      "\u201cIf he loses, I\u2019m f----d,\u201d Musk told Carlson, referring to Trump.",
      "Laughing, Musk added, \u201cHow long do you think my prison sentence is going to be?\u201d",
      "Musk has not been charged with any crimes. Of the 19 fights that he\u2019s waged with the Biden administration or independent federal agencies, two have involved questions from criminal prosecutors: an inquiry into Tesla\u2019s marketing of self-driving capabilities, according to Reuters, and an investigation into personal benefits that Tesla paid to Musk, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment on the status of those two investigations.",
      "Regardless of who wins the White House, Musk\u2019s SpaceX is expected to continue reaping billions of dollars a year in government contracts including with the Defense Department and NASA. The company is currently the only option for transporting NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station, due to problems with Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft.",
      "SpaceX has $3.6 billion in contracts with federal agencies this year, according to government data, and that number has risen every year of the Biden administration, despite their rocky relationship.",
      "Harris has also praised SpaceX, calling it \u201ca company whose innovation and agility has revolutionized the commercial space industry\u201d in a White House ceremony last year. As chair of the White House National Space Council, Harris has left federal space policy largely unchanged. That policy includes NASA\u2019s behind-schedule Artemis program, which has a long-term goal of a human trip to Mars.",
      "But it\u2019s possible that SpaceX could fare differently under a Trump presidency than under Harris.",
      "Musk has said he expects different treatment depending on who\u2019s in the White House. Referring to the FCC vote against including SpaceX\u2019s Starlink in a rural broadband program, Musk told Carlson last month: \u201cThey take away every contract they possibly can.\u201d",
      "And he has said his dream of colonizing Mars is possible only under Trump, who has been more vocal than Harris in endorsing the idea of humans traveling to Mars \u2014 a project that could involve a heightened partnership between SpaceX and the federal government.",
      "\u201cWe will never reach Mars if Kamala wins,\u201d Musk posted on X in September.",
      "Musk has not laid out the basis for his belief that Harris would oppose a Mars mission, but it may come down to his prior experience with regulations: Musk has repeatedly blamed the FAA or other agencies for launch delays.",
      "Trump told Fox News in October that he\u2019s committed to the Mars idea: \u201cI want him to send a rocket up to Mars. He made a promise he\u2019ll get to Mars before the end of my administration.\u201d"

      "Tropical Storm Rafael is passing south of western Jamaica and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane possibly by Tuesday evening.",
      "Rafael, which formed Sunday and was previously known as Potential Tropical Cyclone 18, is located about 65 miles southwest of Montego Bay, Jamaica, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph and moving north-west at 13 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center's 10 a.m. ET Tuesday update.",
      "Forecasters said Rafael is \u201cgetting better organized\u201d as its center passes Jamaica. It\u2019s expected to undergo \u201csteady to rapid intensification\u201d over the next 24 to 36 hours, and is expected to become a hurricane as it passes near the Cayman Islands this evening and tonight, the NHC said.",
      "Rafael is the 17th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, and it will be the 11th hurricane if it strengthens further, as expected. The season lasts until Nov. 30, though peak activity is usually around Sept. 10.",
      "The storm system is expected to approach the U.S. later in the week, the hurricane center said. A tropical storm watch was issued Monday afternoon for the lower and middle Florida Keys and for the Dry Tortugas, which was later upgraded Tuesday morning to a tropical storm warning.",
      "It\u2019s too soon to determine what, if any, impacts Rafael could bring to portions of the northern Gulf Coast, however, tropical storm winds are possible for the Florida Keys and south Florida on Wednesday afternoon. Rafael is also forecast to rapidly weaken as it is approaching landfall on the Gulf Coast.",
      "A hurricane warning has been issued for the Cayman Islands, and the Cuban government has upgraded all areas previously covered by hurricane watches to hurricane warning status, which indicates hurricane conditions are likely in 36 hours, the hurricane center said.",
      "Havana is among the areas under a hurricane warning, the  center said.",
      "Forecasters expect the weather system to move near Jamaica late Monday, then to be near or over the Cayman Islands by late Tuesday, when it may be near or at hurricane intensity. It is then forecast to approach Cuba on Wednesday.",

      "\"Rafael is expected to become a hurricane as it passes near the Cayman Islands with further strengthening before it makes landfall in Cuba,\" the hurricane center said Tuesday morning.",

      "Minor coastal flooding is possible in Jamaica on Monday evening, and storm surge up to 3 feet is expected in the Cayman Islands on Tuesday, the NHC said. Flooding and mudslides could also occur in parts of Jamaica and Cuba.",
      "This hurricane season has proven to be an active one. Parts of the Southeast are still reeling from hurricanes Helene and Milton, which hit two weeks apart in late September and early October.",
      "Forecasters predicted an exceptionally busy hurricane season, in part because of record-high sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic.",

      "\"The entire Home Depot family is deeply saddened by the death of our co-founder Bernie Marcus,\" the company said. \"We owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude to Bernie. He was a master merchant and a retail visionary. But even more importantly, he valued our associates, customers and communities above all. He\u2019s left us with an invaluable legacy and the backbone of our company: our values.",
      "Marcus\u2019 death was first reported by CNN.",
      "Born to Russian-Jewish immigrants in 1929, Marcus grew up in Newark, New Jersey, according to a biography shared by Home Depot. He eventually enrolled in pharmacy school and graduated from Rutgers University.",
      "At age 49, Marcus formed Home Depot with Arthur Blank, the Atlanta Falcons owner and a billionaire supporter of Democrats, in Atlanta in 1978 after both were fired from another home improvement firm. They were assisted with financing from Ken Langone, another major philanthropist and Republican donor.",
      "In a statement, Blank said he was \u201cheartbroken at the passing\u201d of his \u201cdearest friend.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, I\u2019ve lost a father-figure, mentor, brother and business and life partner,\u201d Blank said. \u201cWhile this loss is profoundly painful, I am grateful for the close to 60 years we spent together, navigating challenges and celebrating successes, and I am honored to have been part of Bernie\u2019s remarkable life.\u201d",
      "In 2023, Marcus announced his support of Donald Trump for president. On Tuesday, Trump posted a statement on his Truth Social app mourning Marcus's death.",
      "\"I just learned of the passing of legendary entrepreneur and political genius Bernie Marcus,\" Trump wrote. \"He was my supporter from the beginning and was always there when I needed help or advice. He strongly endorsed me for this election, as well as my other runs, and I will never forget him for that. He was an extraordinary man and I look forward to powerfully honoring him in the future. Warmest condolences to his wonderful family, and all of his many friends!\"",
      "In 1981, Home Depot was listed on the Nasdaq exchange for $12 a share. Today, the company's shares are worth $395, equating to a market cap of about $392 billion. Home Depot now employs almost half a million workers.",
      "Marcus served as CEO for about the first two decades of the company, and as chairman until he retired in 2002. According to Forbes, Marcus had a net worth of about $11 billion at the time of his death.",

      "A longtime booster of Atlanta civic projects, Marcus donated $250 million to help build the Georgia Aquarium, among the largest in the world.",
      "In the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, Marcus initially donated to a political action committee that supported candidates such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. He eventually threw his support behind Donald Trump, writing in an online op-ed that his experience turning Home Depot into a multibillion-dollar business meant he could not support the policies being advocated by Hillary Clinton, who competed with Trump in that election.",
      "In 2023, Marcus endorsed Trump again. In another online op-ed, he said that while he had been \"frustrated\" at times by Trump's behavior, \"we cannot let his brash style be the reason we walk away from his otherwise excellent stewardship of the United States during his first term in office.\"",
      "\"Now is the time for unity to save The American Dream for future generations,\" he wrote."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 War in the Middle East and Europe. Rising far right in Europe. Economic uncertainty. And even the climate emergency. Around the world, discussion of these crises invariably turns back to a common refrain: \u201cWell, a lot depends who wins the United States presidential election.\u201d",
      "This week, the world is anxiously awaiting the answer.",
      "The \u201cleader of the free world\u201d always holds a huge sway over the 7.9 billion people who don\u2019t get a vote. But this time, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are so diametrically opposed \u2014 in style, substance, policy and beyond \u2014 that the victor could shape global events for years, if not decades, to come.",
      "\u201cThis is an extremely important election for the world,\u201d said Thomas Shannon Jr., former U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs, the third-highest-ranking role in the State Department. Particularly, \u201cbecause it comes at a time of debate within the American public about the purpose of American power in the world.\u201d",
      "A Harris administration \u201cwould be more predictable, and one in which both our adversaries and allies feel they have an understanding of what we might be doing,\u201d said Shannon, a veteran career diplomat who has served senior, nonpolitical roles under presidents Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s approach would be more unpredictable \u2014 which would be unsettling\u201d for both adversaries and allies, he added.",
      "Friends, allies and foes",
      "The feeling of anticipation is palpable in Washington\u2019s great rival, Beijing.",
      "The election \u201cwill have significant implications virtually for everyone in the world \u2014 for good or evil,\u201d said Dong Wang, an international studies professor at Peking University.",
      "Trump and Harris have \u201ccompletely different competing visions of the global order,\u201d said Wang, executive director at the university\u2019s Institute for Global Cooperation and Understanding. Harris would bring \u201cmore continuity and predictability,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we cannot assume she will be Biden 2.0. Whereas Trump would mean \u201cmore unpredictability for many countries in the world \u2014 for friends, allies and foes alike.\u201d",
      "Many in Beijing see peril in both candidates at a time when China hawkishness is about the only issue of bipartisan consensus in Washington.",
      "Despite the sluggishness of China\u2019s economy and America\u2019s strong performance by comparison, the Asian giant is still forecast to overtake the U.S. economically at some point in the next two decades. And so influential Chinese observers see Trump as one who brings unwelcome chaos and unpredictability \u2014 as well as his beloved tariffs.",
      "During his first term, he started a trade war with Beijing, imposing $360 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods. He promises to go further this time, vowing a flat tariff of at least 60% on anything coming in from China \u2014 threatening to hike these levies to 150% or 200% if China invades Taiwan, the self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own."

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday fired his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, a long rumored move that was announced on Election Day in the United States. Netanyahu and Gallant had repeatedly clashed over the conduct of the war in Gaza and Lebanon.",
      "Gallant will be replaced by Foreign Minister Israel Katz, Netanyahu said in a statement. Gideon Saar, a former Netanyahu opponent, will become foreign minister and cement support for the fragile ruling coalition keeping the embattled Israeli leader in power.",
      "\u201cIn the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and the minister of defense,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cUnfortunately, although in the first months of the campaign there was very fruitful work, during the last months this trust cracked between me and the minister of defense.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu added that there were significant \u201cgaps\u201d between what the Cabinet had decided and what he termed \u201cthe campaign.\u201d",
      "He added that most members of the government and the Cabinet shared a \u201ccrisis of trust\u201d with Gallant.",
      "Gallant, in response Tuesday, said, \u201cThe security of the State of Israel always was, and will always remain my life\u2019s mission.\u201d",
      "Signs of strains in the Gallant-Netanyahu relationship appeared over the last months. Gallant was scheduled to meet with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, in Washington in early October \u2014 a trip Gallant initiated \u2014 but it was postponed at Netanyahu\u2019s request.",
      "Gallant, who has spent decades in the military,\u00a0has been critical of Netanyahu\u2019s approach to the conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah.",
      "His firing drew immediate criticism from opposition leader Benny Gantz, who said it was \u201cpolitics at the expense of national security.\u201d",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, in a statement, expressed its \"deep concern\" about the decision and about how it would affect \"the fate of 101 hostages held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza for nearly 400 days.\"",
      "Netanyahu's decision was welcomed by his ultranationalist National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who congratulated the prime minister on the move.",
      "\"With Gallant ... it is not possible to achieve absolute victory,\" Ben-Gvir wrote in a post on X.",
      "In a nationally televised statement in May, Gallant challenged Netanyahu over his refusal to discuss a cease-fire and hostage deal. He said that would force Israel to have to rule over the Palestinian enclave again.",
      "\u201cWe must make tough decisions for the future of our country, favoring national priorities above all other possible considerations, even with the possibility of personal or political costs,\u201d Gallant said over the summer.",
      "In the days after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terror attacks, which Israeli officials say killed more than 1,200 people, Gallant announced a \"complete siege\" of Gaza.",
      "\"No electricity, no food, no water, no gas \u2014 it's all closed,\" Gallant said at the time, adding that his military was fighting against \"human animals\" in Gaza, where local officials say more than 43,000 people have been killed.",
      "Netanyahu fired Gallant in March 2023, after he publicly disagreed with the government and pushed to stop a controversial plan to overhaul the judicial system. The move prompted mass protests and led Netanyahu to reverse the decision."

    "story": [
      "An Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza has killed at least 20 people, mostly women and children, Palestinian officials said Tuesday, as Israel wages a nearly monthlong air and ground operation in what was already\u00a0the most isolated and heavily destroyed\u00a0part of the territory.",
      "The strike late Monday hit a home where several displaced families were sheltering in the town of Beit Lahiya, near the border with Israel, according to Hossam Abu Safiya, the director of\u00a0the recently raided and barely functioning\u00a0Kamal Adwan Hospital, which received the casualties.",
      "The dead included eight women and six children, according to a list provided by the Gaza Health Ministry\u2019s emergency service.\u00a0Separate strikes elsewhere in Gaza\u00a0early Tuesday killed another 10 people, according to health officials.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.",
      "Israel launched the offensive in the north after saying Hamas militants had regrouped there. The army has returned to several areas of Gaza multiple times after previous operations, as Hamas continues to carry out hit-and-run attacks on troops and fire occasional rockets into Israel.",
      "The military has ordered the complete evacuation of Beit Lahiya, the nearby town of Beit Hanoun and the urban Jabaliya refugee camp, and has allowed almost no humanitarian aid into the area for over a month. That has\u00a0drawn rebukes from the Biden administration, which has warned that U.S. laws might force it to curb military aid to Israel if more aid is not allowed in.",
      "Tens of thousands of people have fled to nearby Gaza City in\u00a0the latest wave of displacement\u00a0within the besieged territory. Around 90% of the population of 2.3 million have fled during the war, often multiple times.",
      "The three hospitals serving the area have been largely inaccessible because of the fighting, and ambulances have stopped operating. Israeli troops raided Kamal Adwan Hospital last month, saying Hamas militants were sheltering there, allegations denied by Palestinian health officials.",
      "The offensive has raised fears among Palestinians that Israel is implementing\u00a0a surrender-or-starve plan\u00a0for northern Gaza proposed by former generals, in which civilians would be ordered out, aid would be cut off and anyone remaining would be considered a fighter.",
      "The Israeli military has denied receiving such orders, but the government has not said whether it is adopting part or all of the plan.",
      "Palestinian officials said a separate wave of Israeli strikes early Tuesday killed 10 people, including four children and two women.",
      "One strike hit a house in the Tufah neighborhood in Gaza City, killing two children and their parents, according to the Health Ministry\u2019s emergency service. Two other children were wounded, it said.",
      "In the central town of Zuweida, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent where a displaced family was sheltering, killing four people, including a mother and her two children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah. Another strike hit a house in Deir al-Balah, killing two people, the hospital said. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue.",
      "The Israeli military says it only targets militants and accuses them of hiding among civilians. It rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, taking another 250 people hostage. Around 100 captives are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its toll but says over half of those killed were women and children."

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 14:17:30 GMT",
    "summary": "An Israeli court on Sunday partially lifted a gag order on a case investigating leaks of classified Gaza documents suspected to involve one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s media advisers.",
    "story": [
      "Arrests. Classified documents. And suspected leaks that may have harmed efforts to free hostages held by Hamas in order, critics say, to give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu public cover for failing to agree to a cease-fire deal. Netanyahu was engulfed in scandal Monday over a case involving one of his aides that has sent shock waves across the country.",
      "The firestorm \u2014 brought into public view when an Israeli court loosened a gag order Sunday night \u2014 has enraged Netanyahu's political opponents and hostages\u2019 families. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and distanced himself from the case, but critics have alleged that he put hostages' lives and national security at risk to buttress his hard-line position in stalled cease-fire talks by leaking Gaza documents to friendly media outlets.",
      "In a ruling Sunday, the Rishon Le-Zion Magistrates\u2019 Court\u00a0said an investigation had been launched after suspicions arose within the Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Security Agency, or the Shin Bet, that \"classified and sensitive intelligence\" had been illegally taken from IDF systems.",
      "The action, the court said, may not only have caused \u201cserious harm to state security and the endangerment of intelligence sources,\" but it also could have harmed \"the goal of releasing the hostages\" who were taken captive during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.",
      "The court identified the central suspect in the case as Eliezer Feldstein, reported by Israeli media to have been one of Netanyahu\u2019s media advisers.",
      "In addition to Feldstein, three other people the court described as \"detainees involved in the activities\" were questioned. The court has yet to publicly identify them.",
      "Israeli media have reported that the information suspected of being leaked formed the basis of multiple articles on Hamas' approach to the hostage situation, including an article published by the London-based Jewish Chronicle that was later withdrawn after widespread criticism. NBC News was not immediately able to independently confirm that reporting.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle article had suggested that Hamas planned to move hostages out of Gaza through Egypt, while a separate article published by the German newspaper Bild reported that Hamas was drawing out negotiations for a cease-fire deal as a form of psychological warfare on Israel.",
      "Both articles drew skepticism from Israeli observers given their timing and the apparent cover they gave Netanyahu as he was accused of deliberately sabotaging cease-fire negotiations.",
      "\u201cThere was something very fishy about them. Also about the timing of everything,\u201d Mairav Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle and Bild did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The reports emerged as Netanyahu insisted on Israeli control over the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt, a demand that became a major sticking point in cease-fire talks. They also came as Netanyahu faced mounting outrage from hostages\u2019 families and much of the country's public over his failure to agree to a cease-fire deal after six hostages were killed in Hamas' captivity.",
      "While Israeli media had reported some details of the probe and the gag order had been partially lifted last week, it was not until Sunday that crucial and explosive allegations were revealed.",
      "In a statement before the ruling, Netanyahu's office said the materials suspected of being leaked had never reached the prime minister's office from the Military Intelligence Directorate and that Netanyahu had learned about the document in question from the media.",
      "It added that the aide implicated in the suspected leaks had \"never participated in security discussions, was not exposed or received classified information, and did not take part in secret visits.\"",
      "But political opponents, hostages\u2019 families and critics expressed outrage over the potential involvement of one of Netanyahu's aides.",
      "\"It\u2019s left me yet again disappointed but not surprised by this government,\" said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui was taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7.",
      "\"I feel utterly betrayed, not just as a hostage father but as an Israeli citizen,\" he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "Dekel-Chen said that if the allegations raised in the investigation are true, it would be the latest in a \"long series\" of moments when Netanyahu's government has \"invented reasons to not move forward in the negotiation process.\"",
      "Gil Dickmann's cousin Carmel Gat was one of six hostages killed in Hamas captivity \u2014 an incident that sparked national outrage not long before the media reports were published.",
      "He noted the timing but said that if the intention was to sway public opinion, \"it didn't work,\" as he pointed to major demonstrations in the following days pressuring Netanyahu to secure a cease-fire.",
      "In a statement, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of those still in Hamas captivity, expressed \u201coutrage and deep concern\u201d at the possibility that at least one Netanyahu aide may have \u201cworked to undermine public support\u201d for a deal.",
      "Benny Gantz, who resigned from Netanyahu's now-dissolved war Cabinet in June, said on X that \"if sensitive security information was stolen and used as a tool in a political survival campaign, it\u2019s not just a criminal offense; it\u2019s a national crime.\"",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid rejected claims from Netanyahu's office that Netanyahu had been previously unaware of the materials alleged to have been leaked.",
      "\"If Netanyahu didn\u2019t know that his close aides were stealing documents, planting spies within the IDF, forging documents, exposing intelligence sources, and passing classified documents to the foreign press to stop the hostage deal\u2014what *does* he know?\" Lapid said on X.",
      "Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said that even if Netanyahu was not directly involved, the suspected leak would have emerged from a \u201cwell-oiled machine that is already accustomed to taking sensitive information and manipulating it for political purposes.\u201d",
      "But she said that would not \"come as a surprise at all.\"",
      "\"I think for the people who are already convinced that Netanyahu was playing with the public's consciousness and wasn't interested in a hostage deal, this is kind of just further proof,\" she said."

The ban does not refer to operations in the Palestinian territories or elsewhere.",

    "story": [
      "It is clear what Russia stands to gain from an influx of some 10,000 North Korean troops to aid its war in Ukraine. Less apparent is what might be in it for Kim Jong Un.",
      "Pyongyang\u2019s seemingly imminent entry into Moscow\u2019s war is a watershed moment that further complicates the international web of interests entangled in a conflict that is fast approaching its thousandth day. To many observers, it risks escalating the conflict by connecting rising tensions in Europe and the Asia-Pacific.",
      "Kim has spent months issuing mounting threats against his southern neighbors and working to enhance his nuclear arsenal, while Russian President Vladimir Putin has engaged in his own saber-rattling with the West as his military lost scores of men to make battlefield gains. Now the two are intensifying their partnership, alarming the United States and its allies.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea might be getting combat experience with drones and some real combat experience in a 21st century war,\u201d Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, told NBC News. \u201cBut that is secondary to the strategic capabilities that they might obtain from Russia \u2014 and I think that the concern on the South Korean side is exactly driven by this.\u201d",
      "The Pentagon on Monday confirmed that around 10,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia for training and are presumed to be joining the fight against Ukraine within \u201cthe next several weeks.\u201d Some of those units have already started making their way West toward Ukraine, and may join the Kremlin\u2019s forces struggling to expel Ukrainian forces from Russia\u2019s Kursk region, according to the Pentagon.",
      "It\u2019s not hard to see why Moscow seems happy to have drawn international ire with this extraordinary invite.",
      "Ukrainian forces penetrated Russian defenses in August and seized a swath of Russian territory in the Kursk region \u2014 a gambit seen by many as a blow to Putin\u2019s prestige. Russia has managed to retake some of that territory, but has failed to expel the Ukrainian invaders and seemed reluctant to divert troops from the war\u2019s eastern front lines to do so.",
      "North Korean troops are expected to help with that.",
      "South Korea\u2019s foreign and defense ministers will be traveling to Washington for meetings with their counterparts Wednesday and Thursday, following a briefing of NATO leadership Monday.",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a statement following the briefing that the alliance could now confirm that North Korean troops are in Russia and have been deployed to the Kursk region.",
      "Asked by NBC\u2019s Keir Simmons last week in Kazan to comment directly on these developments, Putin stuck to his guns:",
      "\u201cIt is not Russia\u2019s actions that led to an escalation in Ukraine,\u201d Putin said, blaming Washington and its NATO allies for arming and supporting Ukraine. As for the presence of North Korean troops in Russia, he didn\u2019t deny the reports and instead referenced a mutual defense pact signed in Pyongyang in June.",
      "But what, exactly, is Pyongyang getting out of this?",
      "Western and South Korean officials have suggested previously that North Korea was being paid through various means, including resources, food and in some cases hard cash. But Russian and North Korean relations have visibly deepened as the war in Ukraine has raged on.",
      "A visit by Kim to Russia\u2019s Vostochny spaceport last summer, which set the stage for the supply of North Korean munitions, was met with speculation that Putin was trading away valuable Russian knowledge in the sphere of space technologies, which have vast overlaps with those utilized in a successful nuclear program.",
      "\u201cI think that question whether or not that is actually happening is the key,\u201d Gabuev said.",
      "South Korea\u2019s spy agency said Tuesday that North Korea was preparing to repeat a failed effort to launch a spy satellite, with the help of Russia, according to the Yonhap News Agency. Their last attempt came May 27, when the rocket carrying the satellite into orbit exploded on launch.",
      "But the dispatch of troops is a more significant commitment from North Korea than material. And it is driven largely out of desperation on both sides of the relationship, analysts told NBC News.",
      "Moscow is in dire need of friends, especially those that will chip in to the war effort. North Korea, for its part, needs a partner that will shield it from the United Nations Security Council as it pursues its nuclear ambitions.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea is trying to get as many benefits as it can from this relationship,\u201d said Edward Howell, an expert on North Korea at the Chatham House think tank. \u201cAnd it now has full, unwavering support of Russia at the U.N. Security Council, which is extremely beneficial for North Korea, because it knows that it can test missiles, it can provoke South Korea.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt can even conduct a nuclear test and get away with it, because sanctions are just not going to be issued because of Russia\u2019s veto power,\u201d he said.",
      "There are other benefits for Kim\u2019s regime.",
      "Though North Korea has the fourth-largest standing army in the world \u2014 some 1.2 million troops \u2014 it has been a long time since that army has engaged in warfare. The war\u2019s vast front lines could become a sort of laboratory for modern warfare, giving Kim\u2019s troops \u2014 and their generals \u2014 a chance to study.",
      "This may explain why South Korea has taken the lead in raising the alarm. Seoul has even gone so far as to say that it may consider sending lethal military aid to help Ukraine. But Gabuev said that South Korea\u2019s main concern is mostly on strategic issues \u2014 such as the nuclear program.",
      "\u201cIf thousands of North Korean troops learn how to survive on a battlefield full of drones,\u201d Gabuev said, \u201cthat is a lesser problem than North Korea having quieter nuclear-capable submarines. And I think that is what explains South Korea\u2019s fierce response.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Tropical Storm Rafael is passing south of western Jamaica and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane possibly by Tuesday evening.",
      "Rafael, which formed Sunday and was previously known as Potential Tropical Cyclone 18, is located about 65 miles southwest of Montego Bay, Jamaica, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph and moving north-west at 13 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center's 10 a.m. ET Tuesday update.",
      "Forecasters said Rafael is \u201cgetting better organized\u201d as its center passes Jamaica. It\u2019s expected to undergo \u201csteady to rapid intensification\u201d over the next 24 to 36 hours, and is expected to become a hurricane as it passes near the Cayman Islands this evening and tonight, the NHC said.",
      "Rafael is the 17th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, and it will be the 11th hurricane if it strengthens further, as expected. The season lasts until Nov. 30, though peak activity is usually around Sept. 10.",
      "The storm system is expected to approach the U.S. later in the week, the hurricane center said. A tropical storm watch was issued Monday afternoon for the lower and middle Florida Keys and for the Dry Tortugas, which was later upgraded Tuesday morning to a tropical storm warning.",
      "It\u2019s too soon to determine what, if any, impacts Rafael could bring to portions of the northern Gulf Coast, however, tropical storm winds are possible for the Florida Keys and south Florida on Wednesday afternoon. Rafael is also forecast to rapidly weaken as it is approaching landfall on the Gulf Coast.",
      "A hurricane warning has been issued for the Cayman Islands, and the Cuban government has upgraded all areas previously covered by hurricane watches to hurricane warning status, which indicates hurricane conditions are likely in 36 hours, the hurricane center said.",
      "Havana is among the areas under a hurricane warning, the  center said.",
      "Forecasters expect the weather system to move near Jamaica late Monday, then to be near or over the Cayman Islands by late Tuesday, when it may be near or at hurricane intensity. It is then forecast to approach Cuba on Wednesday.",
      "The hurricane center's latest forecast cone, which comes with some uncertainty, has Rafael passing over the western reaches of Cuba on Wednesday afternoon or evening.",
      "\"Rafael is expected to become a hurricane as it passes near the Cayman Islands with further strengthening before it makes landfall in Cuba,\" the hurricane center said Tuesday morning.",
      "As early as Monday morning, NHC forecasters said the chance that the storm would become a hurricane over the next 48 hours was \u201cnear 100%.\u201d",
      "Rafael is forecast to dump 3 to 6 inches of rain across much of the western Caribbean and up to 10 inches in some areas. The heaviest precipitation is expected in Jamaica.",
      "Minor coastal flooding is possible in Jamaica on Monday evening, and storm surge up to 3 feet is expected in the Cayman Islands on Tuesday, the NHC said. Flooding and mudslides could also occur in parts of Jamaica and Cuba.",
      "This hurricane season has proven to be an active one. Parts of the Southeast are still reeling from hurricanes Helene and Milton, which hit two weeks apart in late September and early October.",
      "Forecasters predicted an exceptionally busy hurricane season, in part because of record-high sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic.",
      "Experts at Colorado State University, a prominent hurricane forecast center, said this year that they anticipated a \u201chyperactive season.\u201d The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted eight\u00a0to\u00a013 hurricanes\u00a0and 17 to 25 named storms \u2014 the most the agency had ever projected in the annual outlook it issues in May.",
      "Rafael is the 10th named storm since Sept. 24, making the 2024 season\u2019s 10 named storms between Sept. 24 and Nov. 4 the most on record for that time span, according to Colorado State University meteorologist Philip Klotzbach.",
      "An average Atlantic hurricane season has 14 named storms, seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes (classified as Category 3 or above), according to the NHC."

      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missiles flew about 250 miles but did not specify how many were fired. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said they landed in waters outside Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone and there were no immediate reports of damage.",
      "The launches came days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a flight test of the country\u2019s newest intercontinental ballistic missile designed to reach the U.S. mainland. In response to that launch, the United States flew a long-range B-1B bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in a show of force. That drew condemnation from Kim\u2019s powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong, who on Tuesday accused North Korea\u2019s rivals of raising tensions with \u201caggressive and adventuristic military threats.\u201d",
      "South Korean officials had said that North Korea was likely to dial up its military displays around the U.S. presidential election to command the attention of Washington. South Korea\u2019s military intelligence agency said last week that North Korea has also most likely completed preparations for its seventh nuclear test.",
      "Outside officials and analysts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win concessions such as sanctions relief after a new U.S. president is elected.",
      "There are widespread views that Kim Jong Un would prefer a win by Republican candidate Donald Trump, with whom he engaged in high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018-19, seeing him as a more likely counterpart to give him what he wants than Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. During campaigning, Harris said she would not \u201ccozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un who are rooting for Trump.\u201d",
      "North Korea claimed last week that the Hwasong-19 it tested on Oct. 31 was \u201cthe world\u2019s strongest\u201d ICBM, but experts say the solid-fuel missile was too big to be useful in war. Experts say North Korea has yet to acquire some critical technologies to build a functioning ICBM, such as ensuring that the warhead survives the harsh conditions of atmospheric re-entry.",
      "Tensions between the Koreas are at their highest point in years as Kim has repeatedly flaunted his expanding nuclear weapon and missile programs, while reportedly\u00a0providing Russia with munitions and troops\u00a0to support President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "On Monday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters that as many as 10,000 North Korean soldiers were in Russia\u2019s Kursk region near Ukraine\u2019s border and were preparing to join Moscow\u2019s fight against Ukraine in the coming days. If they engage in combat, it would be North Korea\u2019s first participation in a large-scale conflict since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.",
      "After a meeting in Seoul on Monday, senior South Korean and European Union officials expressed concerns about Russia\u2019s possible transfer of technology to North Korea to enhance its nuclear program in exchange for its troops. Such transfers would \u201cjeopardize the international non-proliferation efforts and threaten peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and across the globe,\u201d they said.",
      "In response to North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear threat, South Korea, the United States and Japan have been expanding their combined military exercises and updating their nuclear deterrence plans built around U.S. strategic assets.",
      "North Korea has portrayed the joint military drills by its rivals as rehearsals for an invasion and used them to justify its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles.",
      "At a U.N. Security Council meeting Monday, North Korea\u2019s ambassador, Kim Song, defended the North\u2019s nuclear and ICBM programs as essential for the country\u2019s self-defense and a necessary response to what it perceives as nuclear threats from the United States. He stressed that North Korea would accelerate the build-up of \u201cour nuclear force that can counter any threat presented by hostile nuclear weapon states.\u201d",
      "U.S. Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood warned that the U.S. cannot stand back from North Korea\u2019s expanding nuclear program and the growing threat to U.S. security \u201cwithout a response.\u201d",
      "Wood also repeated last week\u2019s call for Russia to say whether there are North Korean troops on the ground in Russia. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a court here,\u201d Russian Deputy Ambassador Anna Evstigneeva replied, \u201cand the questions of the United States, in the spirit of an interrogation, is not something I intend to answer.\u201d"
