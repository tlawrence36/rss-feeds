      "\u201cFor example, when a former president was indicted \u2014 a historical first \u2014 the court took the case to decide whether he could be prosecuted for his official acts,\u201d Barrett wrote. She joined most of Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 majority opinion.",

      "The court's consideration of the president and executive power \"necessarily has to be detached from the current occupant of the office because ... the court has to think about things in the context of the broad sweep of history, of the presidents who have come before and the presidents who will come later. And so the court in deciding cases about executive power, it really is focused on the presidency rather than the president,\u201d Barrett said.",
      "In the interview and in subsequent public appearances, Barrett downplayed the idea that the nation is facing a constitutional crisis or dealing with unprecedented events.",

Trump signed an executive order last month requiring the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute people for burning the American flag, despite a 1989 high court decision protecting the act as political speech.",
      "Barrett wrote admiringly of the free-speech votes of Justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia, for whom she once worked, despite their personal distaste for burning the flag.",
      "Without reference to Trump and his musings about seeking a third presidential term, Barrett also noted the clarity of the two-term limit added to the Constitution in 1951.",

      "The 82nd Venice Film Festival has wrapped up, but the buzz continues",
      "The 82nd Venice Film Festival may be over, but the conversations on the films that premiered, the things people said, the clothes they wore, and how it affects the Oscar race are still going.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown of the big moments and takeaways from this year\u2019s edition.",
      "Jim Jarmusch\u2019s quiet film \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother\u201d took the top prize, the Golden Lion. It was a surprise to many who expected that honor to go to \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab,\u201d which ended up with the runner up award, or \u201cNo Other Choice.\u201d",
      "Aside from Benny Safdie\u2019s best director win for \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d Hollywood players were largely shut out of the awards in favor of a diverse, international selection. Chinese actor Xin Zhilei won best actress for Cai Shangjun\u2019s \u201cThe Sun Rises on Us All,\u201d Italian icon Toni Servillo won best actor for \u201cLa Grazia\u201d and Swiss actor Luna Wedler took the up-and-comer prize, the Marcello Mastroianni Award, for \u201cSilent Friend.\u201d",
      "The awards didn\u2019t give many hints, but Venice has been known to launch several best actor campaigns including Joaquin Phoenix in \u201cJoker,\u201dBrendan Fraser in \u201cThe Whale\u201d and Adrien Brody in \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d This year the most obvious heavyweight to follow is Dwayne Johnson for his turn as MMA fighter Mark Kerr in \u201cThe Smashing Machine.\u201d",
      "Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons were also strange and fierce as kidnapped and kidnapper in Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s provocative \u201cBugonia.\u201d Oscar Isaac portrayed Victor Frankenstein as a romantic madman and Jacob Elordi was na\u00efve and raw as the monster. Amanda Seyfried put a human, feminist, face to the religious sect the shakers in \u201cThe Testament of Ann Lee,\u201d and Julia Roberts flexed her acting muscles as a Yale philosophy professor in the midst of a misconduct accusation against a colleague in \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d",
      "Filmmakers like Kathryn Bigelow and previous Golden Lion winners Guillermo del Toro and Yorgos Lanthimos will also likely be in the conversation for months to come.",
      "There\u2019s always some unexpected Hollywood person at the Venice Film Festival who doesn\u2019t seem to be associated with any one film. Sometimes they\u2019ve come in for amfAR, sometimes they\u2019ve been invited by one of the festival\u2019s sponsors. But text chains started blowing up when Seth Rogen started popping up everywhere: Red carpets, press conferences, parties. Don\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s a Venice episode of \u201cThe Studio\u201d in the works: This trip was research, and maybe even a little more.",
      "In a cute, unexpected (possibly highly staged) moment during the festival, Amanda Seyfried commented on Julia Roberts\u2019 Instagram asking to \u201cplease let me wear the same outfit.\u201d Three days later, Seyfried was also rocking the Versace blazer, jeans, button up and belt, just with different shoes. It helps that they share a stylist, Elizabeth Stewart.",
      "First, let\u2019s just make clear that entertainment trade publications only started tracking Venice standing ovations recently. This year, audiences at the premiere of \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d applauded for 22-minutes, surpassing the 18-minute record set last year by \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d which went on to win the Golden Lion. Even with a limited data set, that\u2019s a long time to clap after a movie.",
      "Other standing ovation times from the 82nd festival: \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d ((tilde)5 minutes), \u201cBugonia\u201d ((tilde)6 minutes), \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d ((tilde)7 minutes), \u201cJay Kelly\u201d ((tilde)9 minutes), \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin\u201d ((tilde)10 minutes), \u201cA House of Dynamite\u201d ((tilde)11 minutes), \u201cFrankenstein\u201d ((tilde)14 minutes), \u201cThe Testament of Ann Lee\u201d ((tilde)15 minutes), \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d ((tilde)15 minutes).",
      "The festival might not take political stances, but politics, and filmmakers grappling with the state of the world, from the Israel-Hamas conflict to nuclear weapons, were clearly top of mind. Kathryn Bigelow set off a warning shot about nuclear weapons and the apparatus of decision making with her urgent, and distressingly realistic, thriller \u201cA House of Dynamite.\u201d Tunisian filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania made an essential document of the human toll in Gaza with \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab.\u201d And Olivier Assayas charted the rise of Vladimir Putin in \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin.\u201d",

      "From a record-breaking standing ovation to the ever-present Campari spritzes to even on-screen subtitles, the 2025 Venice Film Festival was a bounty of interesting numbers",
      "VENICE, Italy -- After 10 days and dozens of red carpet premieres, the 82nd edition of the Venice Film Festival came to a close Saturday. While cinema is focused on the qualitative, a quantitative look can tell a story of its own. There are, after all, plenty of fascinating figures \u2014 beyond the celebrity kind \u2014 to be found on the Lido.",
      "Here's a look at this year's Venice Film Festival, by the numbers.",
      "That figure includes 1,936 feature films, which cost 200 euros ($234) apiece to submit. To be eligible for selection, a film must have been completed after Sept. 7, 2024, and must be making its world premiere at Venice. The festival decides what section a selected film goes in.",
      "It amounts to slightly over 1% of the feature films submitted. The 21 movies were the ones eligible for awards like the Golden Lion, which was won this year by Jim Jarmusch's \u201cFather Mother Sister Bother.\u201d There were also 30 films making their world premieres at Venice, but out of competition, like Luca Guadagnino's \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d Nineteen films played in the Horizons (Orizzonti) sidebar, which has its own awards. The Venice Classics sidebar featured 18 restorations.",
      "Led by American director Alexander Payne, the jury included French director St\u00e9phane Briz\u00e9, Italian director Maura Delpero, Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof (he lives in exile in Germany), Brazilian actor Fernanda Torres and Chinese actor Zhao Tao. They decide the winners among the main competition.",
      "The applause meter at film festivals is notoriously faulty, calibrated differently outlet by outlet, but it was clear that the ovation for \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d was record-breaking and definitely over 20 minutes. Variety reported 22 and BBC had it at 23. Kaouther Ben Hania's movie easily surpassed last year's Golden Lion winner, Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d which had people on their feet for 18 minutes.",
      "Doing the math, that's definitely more than 82 years ago. The festival has been suspended or periodically taken different forms over the years, including during World War II \u2014 though it did go forward in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Selections hailed from far and wide, from the U.S., France and, of course, Italy, to Ecuador, Slovakia and Taipei.",
      "There's space for short films \u2014 20 minutes and under \u2014 and feature films \u2014 longer than 60 minutes \u2014 but woe betide the filmmaker who makes anything in between.",
      "That distinction belongs to Olivier Assayas\u2019 \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin,\u201d an adaptation of Giuliano da Empoli\u2019s bestselling book of the same name, in which Jude Law transforms into Vladimir Putin.",
      "The longest ovation went to the shortest film in competition, \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab.\u201d Ben Hania's film combines real audio from Hind Rajab, the Palestinian 6-year-old girl who was found dead days after her desperate call for rescue in Gaza, with actors portraying volunteers at the Red Crescent, where the movie is set.",
      "Israel's war in Gaza reverberated through the festival, with high-profile calls to disinvite Gerard Butler and Gal Gadot over the war and questions to filmmakers and actors about an indie film company\u2019s funding ties to the Israeli military. The Aug. 30 march in Venice aimed to turn the spotlight from the stars to the war, and organizers estimate that over 10,000 people turned out.",
      "Those Golden Lions went to Kim Novak, the 92-year-old legendary actor who starred in Alfred Hitchcock's \u201cVertigo,\u201d and Werner Herzog, the prolific 83-year-old German filmmaker whose works range from lauded documentaries like \u201cLittle Dieter Needs to Fly\u201d to the Nicolas Cage-starrer \u201cBad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans.\u201d (He also acts, as viewers of \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d can attest.)",

      "The Venice Film Festival doesn't take place in the heart of the city, which would be the Piazza San Marco. Instead, it's on the Lido, a barrier island across the Venetian Lagoon.

Should they fall overboard, they would contend with a depth of up to 71 feet (21 meters).",
      "The historic theater is home to the biggest screenings at the festival, as well as the awards ceremonies. It includes four additional spaces for people in wheelchairs.",

(All films are shown with English subtitles projected off-screen.) The festival's detailed subtitling guidelines suggest opting for white on-screen subtitles. And, yes, the festival has a preferred font. Much like the Microsoft Office of yore, it's Arial.",

      "SAO PAULO -- Taylor Swift is very likely not aware of it, but she's considered a good luck charm for the Brazilian soccer team hosting Friday's game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Chargers.",
      "The unlikely connection between the pop superstar \u2014 whose fianc\u00e9 is Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce \u2014 and one of the most popular clubs in soccer-mad Brazil lies in the release date of her albums dating to 2006.

      "It all started as a joke about five years ago, but it has developed into a superstition for local fans.",

Taylor\u2019s first contract was signed on Sept. 1, that\u2019s the same day Corinthians was founded in 1910,\u201d said Rebeca Gois, 32, a marketing writer who lives near the stadium and is a Swift fan. \u201cIt has become a thing. Whenever there\u2019s a new album, we have a double joy; new Taylor songs and Corinthians unbeaten before and after that.\u201d",
      "That long run has encouraged Corinthians fans to think of the singer as an honorary supporter. Some have worn Swift costumes during games.",
      "Gavioes da Fiel, a Corinthians-linked samba school that parades in Sao Paulo's Carnival, jokingly invited Swift to join them in the festivities in 2022.",
      "Swift was in Brazil in 2012 to promote her album \u201cRed\u201d and then in 2023 with six concerts in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo during the Eras Tour. She has yet to appear at Corinthians stadium.",
      "Nataly Nascimento, a hardcore Corinthians Swiftie, said the trend got a boost after Swift had all her three concerts in Sao Paulo at the Allianz Parque, the stadium of their archrival Palmeiras.",
      "\u201cPeople started to look for that connection to tease Palmeiras fans. And then Corinthians fans started finding those links,\u201d said Nascimento, a 25-year-old teacher who lives in Brazil's Northeast and won't attend. \u201cBut there's something bigger. In the same way that Corinthians fans are much more passionate about their club, Swifties feel that about Taylor. It is mystical.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who say the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.",
      "The landmark settlement, if approved by a judge as soon as Monday, could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement.",
      "The company has agreed to pay authors or publishers about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement.",
      "\u201cAs best as we can tell, it\u2019s the largest copyright recovery ever,\u201d said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \u201cIt is the first of its kind in the AI era.\u201d",
      "A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "A federal judge dealt the case a mixed ruling in June, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn\u2019t illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites.",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\u201cWe were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\u201d said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Anthropic said in a statement Friday that the settlement, if approved, \u201cwill resolve the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining legacy claims.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems,\u201d said Aparna Sridhar, the company's deputy general counsel.",
      "As part of the settlement, the company has also agreed to destroy the original book files it downloaded.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic\u2019s Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup\u2019s June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \u201cknew had been pirated.\u201d It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \u201cThe Lost Night\u201d by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",

The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \u201can excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors\u2019 works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\u201d",
      "The Danish Rights Alliance, which successfully fought to take down one of those shadow libraries, said Friday that the settlement would be of little help to European writers and publishers whose works aren\u2019t registered with the U.S. Copyright Office.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s comforting to see that compiling AI training datasets by downloading millions of books from known illegal file-sharing sites comes at a price,\u201d said Thomas Heldrup, the group\u2019s head of content protection and enforcement.",
      "On the other hand, Heldrup said it fits a tech industry playbook to grow a business first and later pay a relatively small fine, compared to the size of the business, for breaking the rules.",
      "\u201cIt is my understanding that these companies see a settlement like the Anthropic one as a price of conducting business in a fiercely competitive space,\u201d Heldrup said.",
      "The privately held Anthropic, founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021, earlier this week put its value at $183 billion after raising another $13 billion in investments.",
      "Anthropic also said it expects to make $5 billion in sales this year, but, like OpenAI and many other AI startups, it has never reported making a profit, relying instead on investors to back the high costs of developing AI technology for the expectation of future payoffs.",
      "The settlement could influence other disputes, including an ongoing lawsuit by authors and newspapers against OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft, and cases against Metaand Midjourney. And just as the Anthropic settlement terms were filed, another group of authors sued Apple on Friday in the same San Francisco federal court.",
      "\u201cThis indicates that maybe for other cases, it\u2019s possible for creators and AI companies to reach settlements without having to essentially go for broke in court,\u201d said Long, the legal analyst.",
      "The industry, including Anthropic, had largely praised Alsup\u2019s June ruling because he found that training AI systems on copyrighted works so chatbots can produce their own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative.\u201d",
      "Comparing the AI model to \u201cany reader aspiring to be a writer,\u201d Alsup wrote that Anthropic \"trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them \u2014 but to turn a hard corner and create something different.\"",
      "But documents disclosed in court showed Anthropic employees\u2019 internal concerns about the legality of their use of pirate sites. The company later shifted its approach and hired Tom Turvey, the former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "With his help, Anthropic began buying books in bulk, tearing off the bindings and scanning each page before feeding the digitized versions into its AI model, according to court documents. That was legal but didn\u2019t undo the earlier piracy, according to the judge.",

      "While other fashion empires make their money on handbags and footwear, Armani\u2019s appeal has always been in the apparel, the core of his $10 billion empire.",
      "After his death Thursday at the age of 91, Armani has been remembered for softening the 1980s power suit, decades of fruitful Hollywood collaborations and as a defining figure of Italian luxury ready-to-wear.",
      "But he was also a keen business owner who maintained his independence in an era of consolidation, an innovative communicator and a boss who was in charge of every aspect of his business.",
      "\u201cI have to say, King George is the first in everything. The first but not the only,\u2019\u2019 said Mario Boselli, who was president of the Italian fashion chamber from 1999-2015. \u201cHe was the master of luxury ready-to-wear.\u201d",
      "The deconstructed, soft-shouldered Armani jacket catapulted Armani to fashion stardom, first with Richard Gere in the 1980 film \u201cAmerican Gigolo,\u2019\u2019 and then as the centerpiece of a women\u2019s wardrobe.",
      "\u201cI would say that the famous Armani jacket was a discovery that allowed women to live every day with an Armani garment that could go from work to dates. Armani could dress a woman from morning to evening, I would say with great precision, for every occasion,\u2019\u2019 Boselli said.",
      "Armani himself said in his 2015 memoir he wanted to create \u201ca new kind of femininity that forced men to look at women with new eyes.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cI have great esteem for women. I think they know how to be seductive without resorting to an exhibitionism that easily slips into vulgarity and excess,\u2019\u2019 Armani wrote. He credited American women as \u201cthe first to appreciate my work \u2014 and my audacity.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jackets remained the core of his collections through the decades. But with time he introduced more couture elements into his ready-to-wear in part to counter his image as the power suit designer, said Scott Schuman, the Milan-based photographer behind The Sartorialist fashion blog and the creator of the Armani tribute Instagram account @armaniarchive.",
      "Every collection started with a cascade of textiles on a huge table, which Armani himself would examine after his team made a first selection.",
      "\u201cThe collection, and the mood and the vibe started from the fabrics,\u2019\u2019 said Milan-based Austrian designer Arthur Arbesser, who was on the Armani design team for seven years until leaving in 2013 to launch his own brand.",
      "\u201cThat was unique, I learned from him what it was to touch the fabrics, then to come in with another fabric and with another shade to form a gradient of colors,\u2019\u2019 Arbesser said.",
      "Boselli first met Armani 45 years ago, arriving at his Borgnonuovo offices with a satchel of jersey knit samples as a sales rep for his family\u2019s textile company.",
      "\u201cHe saw the entire collection of fabrics, and chose them personally,\u2019\u2019 Boselli recalled. \u201cThat is not something everyone does. It takes time, it takes care. He had great respect for the work of others.\u2019\u2019",
      "Shuman said the fabric choices made going into Armani's stores \u201ca sensory overload.\u201d",

But Armani always had a following, from Hollywood stars who could count on him for stunning looks without too much risk, to everyday people who sought well-made, tailored looks to project them from morning to evening.",
      "\u201cArmani was a beautiful river of design. You could pop in and out, and there was some kind of continuity,\u2019\u2019 Schuman said.",
      "Kenneth Richard, founder of The Impression, an influential fashion newsletter, called Armani \"the original game-changer,'' for the scale of a fashion empire he built himself, and for extending his brand into areas like home decor and hotels while maintaining his famed attention to detail.",
      "\u201cYou can check into an Armani hotel, get fitted downstairs and go to a red carpet event. Where else can you do this? You are sleeping on Armani sheets, in an Armani bed, with an Armani couch,'' Richard said. And all of it is owned by Armani, not licensed as many brands do.",
      "On the runway, Armani \u201cstuck to a singular voice through 50 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis aesthetic was refined, and approachable. You cannot become a $10 billion brand when you are consistently doing the same thing over and over again, without being approachable. He sells. People want to wear his clothing.\u201d",
      "Giorgio Armani's final collection will be previewed during Milan Fashion Week later this month during an event marking 50 years of his signature fashion house.",
      "Armani set up a foundation as a succession tool to avoid his businesses being split up. A rarity in the Italian fashion world, he never sold even a part of his company to an outsider.",
      "He also indicated the creative succession would go to longtime collaborator Leo Dell\u2019Orco and his niece Silvana Armani, who have headed the menswear and womenswear collections, respectively, for all Armani collections: Giorgio Armani, Emporio Armani and Armani Exchange.",
      "The question of generational succession has always been a fraught one in Italy's largely family run fashion industry. Armani's attention to every detail in the empire he launched 50 years ago will make him a tough act to follow.",
      "\u201cHe was involved in very step of the process from the very beginning to the end. Every photograph, every font, everything,'' Arbesser said. \"That is what makes a difference. These days, there is no boss, no creative director, who has so much control over everything. That is where the magic is. And that is where it is hard to see what is going to happen now.\u201d",

      "At least, that used to be the case.",
      "In the last few years, a new generation of songwriters has begun stepping into the spotlight. Muni Long has a successful R&B career; songwriter HARDY has done the same in the country music space. Julia Michaels writes big pop hits and records her own. Victoria Mon\u00e9t went from Grammy nominations as a songwriter and producer to taking home trophies as a solo artist.

      "Here\u2019s how it happened.",
      "Why is there a buzz around songwriters now? The answer is challenging to pinpoint. Allen says she\u2019s noticed a shift in \u201cthe past six years,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI am so grateful that the general public is starting to take interest in the people behind the curtain of how music is made,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut I think songwriters have kind of long gone without any type of visibility or recognition.\u201d",
      "She credits fans \u2013 modern music listeners \u2013 for driving attention to her and her colleagues and social media platforms like TikTok for some of this newfound interest. Online, dedicated fans are curious about the names behind their favorite songs, what Allen describes as a desire to \u201cconnect the dots \u2026 like they\u2019re trying to solve a murder mystery.\u201d",

He says writing for others and writing for himself are two distinct skill sets, each a unique expression of creativity and empathy. \u201cAs a songwriter, my job is to listen and mimic,\u201d he says. \u201cMy job as a songwriter is to get as close to their voice as possible.\u201d",

There are two kinds: publishing (the notes, melodies, chords, rhythms, lyrics, etc.) and master rights (the master recording, typically owned by the record label). Songwriters do not receive master rights, which limits how much they are compensated.",

      "But ultimately, it\u2019s not just a financial reality. Songwriters choosing to record their own music is just another expression of creative autonomy.",

As a partner for Cliff\u2019s eager conversation, Didi, a woman with a defeated, just-getting-through-the-day, middle-aged melancholy, would seem about the least genial match.",
      "But each gets little windows into the other\u2019s life. Didi, divorced, learns her daughter won\u2019t be with her that evening \u2014 a phone call overheard by Cliff. And when the dental work is done, Cliff realizes his car has been towed. Didi reluctantly offers a ride, and, from there, the two end up on an unlikely Christmas Eve odyssey together, without the supernatural qualities of Dickens but nevertheless with ghosts from the past along the way, such as Didi\u2019s ex-husband and Cliff\u2019s former improv troupe (named The Baltimorons).",

      "The documentary \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d directed by Colin Hanks and produced by Ryan Reynolds, is a tribute not just to Candy the actor, but Candy, the man",
      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 \u201cI wish I had more bad things to say about him,\u201d Bill Murray says in the opening moments of the documentary \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me.\u201d",
      "It has always been hard to find a negative word about Candy. The great Canadian comedian and actor not only radiated a warm, down-to-earth friendliness in movies like \u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles,\u201d \u201cUncle Buck\u201d and \u201cThe Great Outdoors,\u201d he was that way off screen, too. As Mel Brooks says in the film, \u201cHe was a total actor because he was a total person.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d directed by Colin Hanks and produced by Ryan Reynolds, is a tribute not just to Candy the actor, but Candy, the man. On Thursday night, it premieres as the opening night film of the Toronto International Film Festival. For a beloved Canadian icon like Candy, whose nickname was \u201cJohnny Toronto,\u201d the setting could hardly be more fitting. To reference Candy\u2019s cameo in \u201cThe Blues Brothers,\u201d it\u2019s an occasion that calls for orange whips, all around.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the amount of meetings we had about when the movie can be made, and maybe we can do this festival or that,\u201d Hanks says. \u201cAnd I just kept thinking in the back of my mind: Well, this is a gigantic waste of time. It should just be at Toronto. Period. The End.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d which will debut on Prime Video on Oct. 10, is a kind of cinematic eulogy for Candy, who died of heart failure at the age of 43 in 1994. Long ago as that was, \u201cI Like Me\u201d is the first feature documentary to tackle Candy, who might be even more popular three decades after his death.",
      "\u201cPart of me hates the fact that John maybe never really saw how beloved he was,\u201d Reynolds says. \u201cHe left something really lasting. He died of a heart failure and ironically the thing he left behind was his heart. That\u2019s the thing that stays.\u201d",
      "Hanks, Reynolds and Candy\u2019s children, Jennifer and Chris Candy, spoke in interviews before the TIFF opening about the making of \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d the title of which comes from one of Candy\u2019s most memorable lines from \u201cTrains, Planes and Automobiles.\u201d But it also serves as a guiding ethos to the documentary.",
      "Candy, who grew up in working-class Ontario and whose father also died young, had his own long-range struggles with that loss. He also, through a people-pleasing smile, dealt with the sometimes insensitive way his size was discussed in the media. Says Reynolds: \u201cHe was self-effacing his work, but not self-loathing. He didn\u2019t make a sport of punching down, not even on himself.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe left, but he did leave us some tools to get through this,\u201d says Chris Candy, 40, speaking alongside his 45-year-old sister. \u201cThat would be through the way he raised us and also saying it\u2019s OK to talk to someone if you have heavy feelings.\u201d",
      "For the Candys, \u201cI Like Me\u201d is an extremely emotional experience but one they\u2019re grateful for. They have each navigated their own way through an upbringing marked by their father\u2019s loss. It was years before Chris could visit his father\u2019s grave site or rewatch his movies. Once he did, he was astonished at his father\u2019s talent.",
      "For Jennifer, her father's movies helped carry her through grief.",
      "\u201cI jumped in and watched everything. All through college, I made sure I had the whole DVD collection,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me that was a constant reminder to hear his voice. We had cassette tapes of his \u2018Radio Kandy\u2019 show that I would just listen to all the time in the car during high school.\u201d",

To him, the movie is about drilling down on what gave Candy such an everyman quality. What made him, to millions, like their Uncle Buck. Hanks experienced Candy's effect firsthand as a child visiting his father, Tom Hanks, on the set of \u201cSplash.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have vivid memories of visiting on set. He was just one of my parents\u2019 friends, someone they worked with,\u201d says Hanks. \u201cHe had a way, even as a kid, of making you feel incredibly important.\u201d",
      "\u201cI had been on the periphery of the most intense fame you can have, as well as a much smaller version myself,\u201d adds Hanks. \u201cIt is an adjustment. It is hard to navigate. Not that it\u2019s not amazing and great, but that idea of how much you can actually give of yourself to people.\u201d",
      "Reynolds, born and raised in Vancouver, has been a fan of Candy\u2019s since growing up watching \u201cSCTV\u201d reruns. His fondness for Candy, in many ways, has been an influence throughout his career.",
      "\u201cI feel like in the bigger movies I\u2019m always either Del Griffith or Neil Page, from \u201cPlanes, Trains,\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cI tend to really fluctuate back and forth between those guys.\u201d",
      "As his own fame grew, alongside with his ability to take some authorship of his films, Reynolds has populated his movies with references to Candy. Easter eggs adorn the \u201cDeadpool\u201d films. In one moment, he utters the \u201cI like me,\u201d albeit in a much different context. Reynolds had the prop department make a mug with the same quote. A Chrysler LeBaron appears in the background of another scene. He even licensed the book \u201cThe Canadian Mounted: A Trivia Guide to Planes, Trains\u201d so it could make a cameo in all the \u201cDeadpool\u201d movies.",
      "\u201cI like having him around,\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cI feel safer. I feel better. I also feel maybe just a skosh more honest.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn was a good person when nobody was watching, and I think that\u2019s an increasingly scarce resource these days, in an age where everything is not only seen, it\u2019s perfection,\u201d Reynolds adds. \u201cIt\u2019s like an epidemic. All we see is perfection and curation. Nobody wants to try anything new because nobody\u2019s willing to suck at anything.\u201d",
      "For Jennifer and Chris, \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d awash in memories of their father,\u201d is a kind of time capsule that, like their dad's other movies and radio show recordings, will be long treasured.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m fortunate that I will always have this,\u201d says Chris. \u201cAnd I love it for that.\u201d",

      "In short, it\u2019s not the kind of material that usually makes a hit movie in Japan, where action-packed blockbusters or animation based on popular manga comics or spectacular special effects have drawn audiences in the past.",

It\u2019s been stereotyped as catering to old people, as younger generations turn to Western and modern forms of entertainment like boys\u2019 bands, baseball games and streaming services.",
      "In Kabuki, all the roles are played by men, wearing thick makeup and elaborate kimono, delivering sing-song lines in tales of intrigue and violence set in the samurai era.",
      "The film shows the dazzling esoteric elements of Kabuki, such as the backstage where actors apply makeup with their fingertips, or the flutter of paper snowflakes or flower petals on the stage.",

      "Based on lessons from the New Hampshire men and a handful of other one-off attempts, the Food and Drug Administration approved pig producer eGenesis to begin a rigorous study of kidney xenotransplants.",
      "\u201cRight now we have a bottleneck\u201d in finding enough human organs, said Mass General kidney specialist Dr. Leonardo Riella, who will help lead the new clinical trial.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting. As an alternative, scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike, less likely to be immediately attacked and destroyed by people\u2019s immune system.",
      "Initial experiments, two hearts and two kidneys, were short-lived and included very ill patients. Chinese researchers also recently announced a kidney xenotransplant but released little information. Then an Alabama woman whose pig kidney lasted 130 days before rejection prompted its removal, sending her back to dialysis, helped researchers shift to not-as-sick patients.",
      "In New Hampshire, high blood pressure caused Stewart's kidneys to fail but he had no other health problems. It can take up to seven years for people with his blood type to find a matching kidney from a deceased donor, and some would-be living donors didn't qualify. After two years in dialysis, he heard about Mass General\u2019s most recent xenotransplant recipient \u2013 Andrews \u2013 and applied to be the next candidate.",

      "Riella, the kidney specialist, said Stewart had his anti-rejection drugs adjusted to counter an early concern and that Andrews has needed similar adjustments.

      "Sophia Forchas was the most seriously wounded child among those who survived after a shooter opened fire at the Church of the Annunciation on Aug. 27. The church was full of students from the affiliated Annunciation Catholic School who had gathered for their first Mass of the academic year. Two students were killed, and 21 people were injured.",
      "The shooter died by suicide, police said.",
      "Sophia remains in intensive care at Hennepin Healthcare, a trauma hospital that has treated many of the victims. Her neurosurgeon, Dr. Walt Galicich, said at a news conference that a bullet, which remains lodged in her brain, caused severe damage, including to a major blood vessel. Surgeons had to remove the left half of her skull to relieve the pressure inside her head.",
      "\u201cIf you had told me at this juncture, 10 days later, that we\u2019d be standing here with any ray of hope, I would have said it would take a miracle,\u201d Galicich told reporters. He said they are banking on the ability of young brains to heal and make up for the damage.",
      "Sophia is still being kept in a medically induced coma most of the time to control the swelling, Galicich said. She is opening her eyes and showing some level of awareness of her surroundings, and has some slight movement in her right leg, but she\u2019s still not responding to commands, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s day by day, and I can\u2019t tell you how this is going to end,\" the doctor said. \"I know she\u2019s had a stroke from that injury to that blood vessel.

      "International officials say contaminated metal at an industrial site in Indonesia could be the source of radioactive material behind recalls of imported shrimp",
      "Contaminated metal at an industrial site in Indonesia may be the source of radioactive material that led to massive recalls of imported frozen shrimp, international nuclear safety officials say, as efforts are underway to halt more U.S.-bound shipments.",
      "The International Atomic Energy Agency said Friday that officials are in \u201cconstant contact\u201d with Indonesian nuclear regulators who have detected Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope, at a processing plant that sent millions of pounds of shrimp to the U.S.",
      "\u201cPreliminary information suggests that it may have originated from activities at a metal melting facility at the same industrial site or from the disposal of scrap metal junk to other areas of the site,\u201d IAEA spokesperson Fredrik Dahl said in an email.",
      "No U.S. investigators have been sent to the site in Serang, west of Jakarta, federal officials said.",
      "Meanwhile, the company that exported the shrimp, PT Bahari Makmur Sejati, also known as BMS Foods, has recalled more than 300 shipping containers that were already on their way to the U.S., Dahl said.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned last month that Cesium-137 was detected in shipping containers sent to four U.S. ports, and in a sample of imported frozen shrimp. That spurred multiple recalls of shrimp sold at Walmart, Kroger and other stores.",
      "This week, additional recalls were issued by Tampa Maid Foods LLC, of Florida, for breaded butterfly shrimp sold under Admiral of the Fleet, Portico Seafood Classic and other labels.",
      "None of the shrimp that triggered alerts or tested positive for Cesium-137 was released for sale, the FDA said. But other shipments sent to stores may have been manufactured under conditions that allowed the products to become contaminated, the agency said.",
      "The risk appears to be small, but the shrimp could pose a \u201cpotential health concern\u201d for people exposed to low levels of Cesium-137 over time, FDA officials said.",
      "The FDA issued an import alert for shrimp from BMS Foods to stop the products from coming into the U.S.",
      "The company sent about 12 million pounds of shrimp to U.S. ports in Los Angeles, Houston, Miami and Savannah, Georgia, in July and August, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection records obtained by Import Genius, a trade data analysis company.",

      "The level of Cesium-137 detected in the frozen shrimp was about 68 becquerels per kilogram, a measure of radioactivity. That is far below the FDA\u2019s level of 1,200 becquerels per kilogram that could trigger the need for health protections.",
      "Still, it is unusual to see that concentration of Cesium-137 in shrimp, said Steve Biegalski, a nuclear medicine expert at the Georgia Institute of Technology.",
      "It\u2019s possible that the contamination could have come from recycling old medical equipment that contained Cesium-137, Biegalski said. The material has been used in medical devices to reduce blood contamination and to treat cancer, for instance.",

      "Supporters of the proposal, which passed a final vote in the GOP-controlled Texas Senate, call it a key tool to enforce the state's ban and protect women and fetuses. Opponents see it as not only another way to rein in abortion but intimidate providers outside Texas who are complying with the laws in their states. They also say it would encourage a form of vigilantism.",

      "Under the bill, providers could be ordered to pay $100,000. But only the pregnant woman, the man who impregnated her or other close relatives could collect the entire amount. Anyone else who sues could receive only $10,000, with the remaining $90,000 going to charity.",
      "Lawmakers also added language to address worries that women would be turned in for seeking to end pregnancies by men who raped them or abusive partners. For instance, a man who impregnated a woman through sexual assault would not be eligible.",

      "MOROGORO, Tanzania -- A man lies unmoving, slumped in the rubble of a simulated earthquake, as an unlikely rescuer approaches: a rat with a backpack. Whiskers waving, the rat breezes past garbage, toppled furniture and scattered clothes to find him and pull a trigger on its pack, alerting searchers above.",
      "Then a resounding click. A survivor has been found. The search in Morogoro in Tanzania\u2019s Uluguru Mountains is over and the rat scurries out of the abandoned building to be rewarded with a banana. A successful mission is complete for this African giant pouched rat being trained for search and rescue operations.",
      "\u201cTheir sense of smell is incredible,\u201d said Fabrizio Dell\u2019Anna, an animal behaviorist at APOPO, a Tanzania-based nongovernmental organization that trains the rats for lifesaving applications. \u201cThese rats are able to detect explosives, tuberculosis \u2014 even tiny amounts of the bacteria \u2014 and in this project, they are able to correctly identify and indicate humans.\u201d",
      "In a field nearby, more rats walk on leashes held between handlers, pacing a grid filled with land mines as part of an initiative by APOPO, which works alongside Sokoine University of Agriculture. When they pause, it indicates that explosives are beneath. These rats are readying for their next deployment, perhaps Angola or Cambodia, where APOPO has helped clear more than 50,000 land mines since 2014.",
      "From detecting land mines to sniffing out tuberculosis, these \u201chero rats\u201d have become unlikely, and sometimes unrecognized, front-line responders in Tanzania and beyond.",
      "For decades APOPO has trained these \u201chero rats,\u201d which have one of the most sensitive noses in the animal kingdom. Since 2003, the rats have been finding land mines and, more recently, have been turned on to trafficked wildlife and earthquake survivors.",
      "The rats begin training shortly after birth for specific missions and, with a longer-than-average rodent life span of almost a decade, can spend years carrying out their work. The cost of training each rat runs around 6,000 euros ($6,990).",
      "It is all done with classical conditioning and positive reinforcement, explained Dell\u2019Anna, who oversees the search and rescue program. The first cohort of this group of specialized rats are already in Turkey with a partner search and rescue organization.",
      "While the rats focused on explosives or survivors buried in rubble get all the glory, it is a group of rats inside a lab that are arguably the most impactful lifesavers. These are not typical lab rats, but rather, as their proponents would argue, one of the world\u2019s most effective detectors of tuberculosis.",
      "\u201cEvery day as many people die from TB as from land mines in a whole year,\u201d said Christophe Cox, the CEO of APOPO. \u201cIt\u2019s more spectacular to be on the minefield \u2026 but for TB \u2026 in terms of social impact, it\u2019s tremendous.\u201d",
      "Tuberculosis is an ancient respiratory disease that continues to run rampant despite centuries of research and treatment. The World Health Organization said last October in its most recent TB report that the disease had resurged as the top infectious disease killer, with 1.25 million deaths and a record 8.2 million infections in 2023.",
      "In sub-Saharan Africa, only about half of TB patients receive a diagnosis, according to a study by researchers in the UK and Gambia published in the National Library of Medicine, and this leaves them liable to spread the disease. Tanzania struggles with one of the highest global TB burdens, according to the WHO.",
      "APOPO expanded into TB detection in 2007 and its rats have been deployed in Tanzania, Ethiopia and Mozambique. The group works with 80 hospitals in Tanzania, collecting samples daily and bringing them to the lab rats.",
      "With their sensitive noses, the rats sniff out samples of sputum from patients, looking for positive TB cases that had been marked as negative. Research suggests the rats are picking up on six unique volatile organic compounds in positive TB samples, said Cox.",
      "False negatives remain a persistent issue in TB detection and suppression because each infected person can spread the disease to 10 to 15 more people each year.",
      "\u201cThe benefits of using rats are significant,\u201d said Felista Stanesloaus, a doctor at a TB clinic in Morogoro. \u201cThey help us detect cases that might otherwise be missed, which prevents people from unknowingly spreading infections.\u201d",

      "While the use of molecular detection devices, such as one called GeneXpert, have become more widespread, a clinic may only have one of these devices and it can take two hours to process a sample. Overburdened clinics turn to the centuries-old technique of microscopy, or investigation of sputum under a microscope, which is both fallible and time-consuming.",
      "\u201cHuman error may result in a person being told they are disease-free when they are not,\u201d said Stanesloaus. \u201cUsing rats is a very effective initiative.\u201d",

The NGO is able to do with one lab what 55 hospitals do in a day, he adds.",
      "Yet using live animals in the place of medical devices poses challenges, especially when it comes to scale. Samples have to be brought directly to a lab with enough trained rats to conduct the detection, with some samples brought to Morogoro by motorbike each day. Operations are most effective in dense urban centers, like Dar es Salaam, Cox said.",
      "The more existential challenge for these \u201chero rats\u201d comes from regulators and a wider health community who doubt this unconventional method of disease detection.",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats are not classified as primary diagnostic tools by the WHO. Instead, they are a second line of defense. Any positive samples detected by the rats must be confirmed with human microscopy in APOPO\u2019s labs before treatment can be administered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge,\u201d said Cox. \u201cNot being recognized by the WHO means that the mainstream funding for TB \u2026 never reaches us.\u201d",
      "Cox has given up on the prospect of getting approval from the WHO, though APOPO has faced pressure from donors to go through this process, which would be extensive and rigorous with no guarantee of success.",
      "Regulators may also challenge APOPO\u2019s method of focusing on finding every single positive case possible at the cost of more potential false positives.",
      "APOPO relies on the indication of just one rat to proceed with further investigation into a possible positive case, while higher specificity standards may need multiple rats to flag a sample.",
      "Cox defends this approach.",

    "story": [
      "An expanding iron-ore mine and a deposit of rare-earth minerals are fragmenting the land in northern Sweden and altering ancient reindeer migration routes",
      "KIRUNA, Sweden -- High atop the Luossavaara Mountain in northern Sweden, Sami reindeer herder Lars-Marcus Kuhmunen mapped out a bleak future for himself and other Indigenous people whose reindeer have roamed this land for thousands of years.",
      "An expanding iron-ore mine and a deposit of rare-earth minerals are fragmenting the land and altering ancient reindeer migration routes. But with the Arctic warming four times faster than the rest of the planet, herders say they need more geographic flexibility, not less, to ensure the animals' survival.",
      "If a mine is established at the deposit of rare-earth minerals called Per Geijer, which Sweden heralds as Europe\u2019s largest, Kuhmunen said it could completely cut off the migration routes used by the Sami village of Gabna.",
      "That would be the end of the Indigenous way of life for Kuhmunen, his children and their fellow Sami reindeer herders, he said, in this far-north corner of Sweden some 200 kilometers (124 miles) above the Arctic Circle.",
      "\u201cThe reindeer is the fundamental base of the Sami culture in Sweden,\u201d Kuhmunen said. \u201cEverything is founded around the reindeers: The food, the language, the knowledge of mountains. Everything is founded around the reindeer herding. If that ceases to exist, the Sami culture will also cease to exist.\u201d",
      "Sami herders are descended from a once-nomadic people scattered across a region spanning the far north of Sweden, Norway, Finland and the northwestern corner of Russia. Until the 1960s, members of this Indigenous minority were discouraged from reindeer herding, and the church and state suppressed their language and culture.",
      "In Sweden alone there are at least 20,000 people with Sami heritage, though an official count does not exist because an ethnicity-based census is against the law. Today, a Sami village called a sameby is a business entity dictated by the state, which determines how many semi-domesticated reindeer each village can have and where they can roam.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s getting more and more a problem to have a sort of sustainable reindeer husbandry and to be able to have the reindeers to survive the Arctic winter and into the next year,\u201d said Stefan Mikaelsson, a member of the Sami Parliament.",
      "In the Gabna village, Kuhmunen oversees about 2,500 to 3,000 reindeer and 15 to 20 herders. Their families, some 150 people in total, depend on the bottom line of the business.",
      "Even before the discovery of the Per Geijer deposit, they had to contend with the expanding footprint of Kiirunavaara. The world\u2019s largest underground, iron-ore mine has forced the village's herders to lead their reindeer through a longer and harder migration route.",
      "Swedish officials and LKAB, the state-owned mining company, say the proposed Per Geijer mine could reduce Europe's reliance on China for rare-earth minerals. LKAB hopes to begin mining there in the 2030s.",
      "Besides being essential to many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles, rare-earth minerals also are considered crucial to shifting the economy away from fossil fuels toward electricity and renewable energy.",
      "But if work on Per Geijer goes forward, Kuhmunen said there will be no other routes for the Gabna herders to take the reindeer east from the mountains in the summer to the grazing pastures full of nutrient-rich lichen in the winter.",
      "The village will contest the mine in court but Kuhmunen said he is not optimistic.",
      "\u201cIt's really difficult to fight a mine. They have all the resources, they have all the means. They have the money. We don\u2019t have that,\" Kuhmunen said. \u201cWe only have our will to exist. To pass these grazing lands to our children.\"",

      "Norway is holding an election on Monday, with inequality and the future of a century-old wealth tax in focus",
      "STAVANGER, Norway -- Prosperous Norway is holding an election on Monday with inequality high on the list of concerns and the future of a wealth tax that has endured for over a century in doubt.",
      "There is expected to be a close outcome between the center-left bloc led by the Labor Party of Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, Norway's leader for the past four years, and a right-wing bloc.",
      "Labor wants to keep the wealth tax that has been a mainstay of Norwegian policy since 1892. Of its rivals on the right, the Conservatives want it reduced and the Progress Party, which calls for lower taxes and more immigration controls, wants it scrapped. Previously a fringe issue, it has been at the heart of this campaign.",
      "Around 4.3 million people in the nation of some 5.6 million are eligible to vote for the new 169-member parliament, or Storting. Official results are expected on Tuesday. They are usually followed by weeks of horse-trading to form a coalition and agree on cabinet positions.",
      "The result isn\u2019t likely to have major implications for Norway\u2019s foreign policy. The country is a stalwart member of NATO and a strong supporter of Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russia.",
      "The wealth tax is a levy of up to 1.1% on assets and shares worth more than 1.76 million kroner (around $176,000), though there are various reductions and discounts, for instance taking account of debt and property. Labor says that scrapping it would cost 34 billion kroner ($3.3 billion) per year.",
      "The Progress Party, which leads the right-wing coalition, is calling for the wealth tax to be abolished, arguing that it is detrimental to the economy. Party leader Sylvie Listhaug argues that it penalizes entrepreneurs who might have taxable stakes in valuable companies, but little real income.",
      "\u201cThe money paid in wealth tax could have been spent creating businesses, new jobs and more innovation,\u201d Listhaug wrote in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Polls show Listhaug's party ahead of the Conservatives, led by former Prime Minister Erna Solberg, who were the senior partner in the last center-right government from 2013 to 2021. It has been bolstered by an energetic social media campaign, driven by youthful influencers who have inspired younger voters against the tax.",
      "\u201cI think that young people are really unhappy about the direction that Norway is taking,\u201d said Listhaug, citing concerns about immigration, crime, overseas aid and green subsidies as crunch issues for young voters. \u201cThe future seems less bright so they want a change.\u201d",
      "Norway is one of the richest countries in the world. It has a generous welfare state, sits on billions of barrels of oil and gas, and has one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, worth around 20 trillion kroner ($2 trillion). Gross domestic product per person is the sixth-highest in the world, one place above the U.S., according to the International Monetary Fund.",
      "It is also one of the world's most egalitarian countries, sharing its wealth much more evenly than many others \u2014 and the way Norway\u2019s riches have been used for international aid and investment has also emerged as a campaign issue.",

      "Leo canonized Carlo Acutis, who died in 2006, during an open-air Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Square before an estimated 80,000 people, many of them millennials and couples with young children. During the first saint-making Mass of his pontificate, Leo also canonized another popular Italian figure who died young, Pier Giorgio Frassati.",
      "Leo said both men created \u201cmasterpieces\u201d out of their lives by dedicating them to God.",
      "\u201cThe greatest risk in life is to waste it outside of God\u2019s plan,\u201d Leo said in his homily. The new saints \u201care an invitation to all of us, especially young people, not to squander our lives, but to direct them upwards and make them masterpieces.\u201d",
      "Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London to a wealthy but not particularly observant Catholic family. They moved back to Milan soon after he was born and he enjoyed a typical, happy childhood, albeit marked by increasingly intense religious devotion.",
      "Acutis was particularly interested in computer science and devoured college-level books on programming even as a youngster. He earned the nickname \u201cGod\u2019s Influencer,\u201d thanks to his main tech legacy: a multilingual website documenting so-called Eucharistic miracles recognized by the church, a project he completed at a time when the development of such sites was the domain of professionals.",
      "He was known to spend hours in prayer before the Eucharist each day. The Catholic hierarchy has been trying to promote the practice of Eucharistic adoration because, according to polls, most Catholics don\u2019t believe Christ is physically present in the Eucharistic hosts.",
      "But Acutis limited himself to an hour of video games a week, apparently deciding long before TikTok that human relationships were far more important than virtual ones. That discipline and restraint has proved appealing to the Catholic hierarchy, which has sounded the alarm about the dangers of today's tech-driven society.",
      "In October 2006, at age 15, Acutis fell ill with what was quickly diagnosed as acute leukemia. Within days, he was dead. He was entombed in Assisi, which known for its association with another popular saint, St. Francis.",
      "In the years since his death, young Catholics have flocked by the millions to Assisi, where they can see the young Acutis through a glass-sided tomb, dressed in jeans, Nike sneakers and a sweatshirt. He seems as if he's sleeping, and questions have swirled about how his body was so well preserved, especially since parts of his heart have even toured the world as relics.",
      "Both saint-making ceremonies had been scheduled for earlier this year, but were postponed following Pope Francis\u2019 death in April. Francis had fervently pushed the Acutis sainthood case forward, convinced that the church needed someone like him to attract young Catholics to the faith while addressing the promises and perils of the digital age.",

      "Milei's recently formed La Libertad Avanza party captured just 34% of the vote in Argentina\u2019s biggest province, losing by a landslide to the left-leaning Peronist opposition, which secured 47% with the majority of ballots counted late Sunday.",

      "With Milei struggling to stabilize a sputtering economy and his close associates embroiled by a graft scandal ahead of congressional midterm elections in late October, the results were being closely scrutinized for their potential to rattle investors and roil jittery global markets.",

      "\u201cWhile not the main national election in October, it is nonetheless a wake-up call for the government, and how it reacts will be crucial to understanding the evolving political map.\u201d",

      "Legislators have toppled France\u2019s government in a confidence vote",
      "PARIS -- Legislators toppled France\u2019s government in a confidence vote on Monday, a new crisis for Europe\u2019s second-largest economy that obliges President Emmanuel Macron to search for a fourth prime minister in 12 months.",
      "Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou was ousted overwhelmingly in a 364-194 vote against him. Bayrou paid the price for what appeared to be a staggering political miscalculation, gambling that lawmakers would back his view that France must slash public spending to repair its debts. Instead, they seized on the vote that he called to gang up against Bayrou \u2014 a 74-year-old centrist who was appointed by Macron last December.",
      "The demise of Bayrou\u2019s short-lived minority government \u2014 now constitutionally obliged to submit its resignation to Macron after just under nine months in office \u2014 heralds renewed uncertainty and a risk of prolonged legislative deadlock for France as it wrestles with pressing challenges, including budget difficulties and, internationally, wars in Ukraine and Gaza and the shifting priorities of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.",
      "Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou warned that France is risking its future and its influence by racking up trillions in state debts that are \u201csubmerging us,\u201d pleading for belt-tightening in a last-ditch effort to save his job from a parliamentary vote expected to oust him later Monday.",
      "Bayrou, 74, painted a dramatic picture of the European Union\u2019s No. 2 economy becoming beholden to foreign creditors and addicted to living beyond its means. He castigated opponents in the National Assembly who were preparing to topple his minority government, ganging up against him despite their own sharp political differences.",
      "\u201cYou have the power to overthrow the government, but you do not have the power to erase reality,\u201d Bayrou said in a speech to the National Assembly before the confidence vote that he called. \u201cReality will remain inexorable. Spending will continue to increase and and the debt burden \u2014 already unbearable \u2014 will grow heavier and more costly.\u201d",
      "At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France\u2019s public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros, or 114% of gross domestic product. Debt servicing remains a major budget item, accounting for around 7% of state spending.",
      "The expected demise of Bayrou\u2019s short-lived premiership \u2014 he was appointed in December \u2014 would bring renewed uncertainty and a risk of prolonged legislative deadlock for France as it wrestles with pressing challenges, including budget difficulties and, internationally, wars in Ukraine and Gaza and the shifting priorities of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "The confidence vote expected in the early evening seems set to make Bayrou the third prime minister in 12 months to leave or be forced out by lawmakers, requiring Bayrou to submit his government's resignation to President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "Although Macron has had two weeks to prepare for the expected government collapse since Bayrou announced in August that he\u2019d seek a confidence vote on his unpopular budget plans, no clear front-runner has emerged as a likely successor.",
      "After Gabriel Attal\u2019s departure as prime minister in September 2024, followed by former Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier\u2019s ouster by parliament in December and Bayrou now threatened, too, Macron again faces an arduous hunt for a replacement to build consensus in the parliament's lower house that is stacked with opponents of the French leader.",
      "As president, Macron will continue to hold substantial powers over foreign policy and European affairs and remain the commander in chief of the nuclear-armed military. But domestically, the 47-year-old president\u2019s ambitions are increasingly facing ruin.",

      "The root of the latest expected government collapse was Macron's stunning decision to dissolve the National Assembly in June 2024, triggering a legislative election that the French leader hoped would strengthen the hand of his pro-European centrist alliance. But the gamble backfired, producing a splintered legislature with no dominant political bloc in power for the first time in France\u2019s modern republic.",
      "Shorn of a workable majority, his minority governments have since lurched from crisis to crisis, surviving on the whim of opposing political blocs on the left and far-right that don\u2019t have enough seats to govern themselves but can, when they team up, topple Macron's choices.",
      "Bayrou, too, rolled the dice by calling the confidence vote, a decision that quickly looked like a staggering miscalculation by the political veteran as left-wing and far-right legislators vowed to seize the opportunity to bring down his government, seeking to increase pressure on Macron.",
      "Bayrou conceded that putting his fate on the line was risky, but said that France's debt crisis compelled him to seek legislative support for remedies, in the face of what he called \u201ca silent, underground, invisible, and unbearable hemorrhage\u201d of excessive public borrowing.",
      "\u201cThe greatest risk was to not take one, to let things go on without changing anything, to go on doing politics as usual,\u201d he said. \u201cSubmission to debt is like submission through military force. Dominated by weapons, or dominated by our creditors, because of a debt that is submerging us \u2014 in both cases, we lose our freedom.\u201d",
      "The 577-seat National Assembly interrupted its summer recess to convene for the extraordinary session of high political drama.",
      "Macron's opponents are seeking to leverage the latest crisis to push for a new legislative election, pressure for Macron's departure or jostle for posts in the expected next government.",
      "Far-right leader Marine Le Pen is calling for Macron to again dissolve the National Assembly, seemingly confident that her National Rally party and its allies would win a majority in another round of an unscheduled legislative election, positioning it to form a new government.",
      "\u201cA big country like France cannot live with a paper government, especially in a tormented and dangerous world,\u201d she said in the National Assembly.",
      "If Bayrou loses, Macron's chosen successor will operate in the same precarious environment and face the same pressing budget problems that dogged Bayrou and his predecessors. Macron himself has vowed to stay in office until the end of his term, but risks becoming a lame duck domestically if political paralysis continues.",
      "Under the French political system, the prime minister is appointed by the president, accountable to the parliament and is in charge of implementing domestic policy, notably economic measures.",
      "Arguing that sharp cuts are needed to repair public finances, Bayrou has proposed to cut 44 billion euros ($51 billion) in spending in 2026, after France\u2019s deficit hit 5.8% of GDP last year, way above the official EU target of 3%.",

      "\u201cJust giving out money, no sugar-coating,\u201d said Renate Rivers, a senior journalist for Pacific Media Network and a former public servant in Samoa, who covered the vote. \u201cThe scale this time around has been very alarming.\u201d",

      "Fiam\u0113 was more cautious than her predecessor about accepting loans from China for development projects. Samoa\u2019s debt to China is among the highest in the world when measured by percentage of GDP and reflects a period when Beijing has sought to curry sway in the Pacific by funding infrastructure and law enforcement initiatives.",

      "These families have come to symbolize the search for the more than 120,000 people who disappeared in Colombia between 1985 and 2016.",
      "Galeano is searching for her husband, Luis Javier Laverde Salazar, whom she last saw on Dec. 9, 2008. Their last contact was a phone call in which he told her he would be home for dinner. She believes he is buried in La Escombrera and was disappeared by paramilitaries.",
      "La Escombrera sits on a steep hillside in the Comuna 13 district, a once strategic location for moving drugs and weapons. At the end of the 1990s and into the early 2000s, it was fought over by guerrillas and paramilitaries \u2014 groups that emerged to combat the leftist insurgents\u2014 with the latter eventually gaining control in the early 2000s.",
      "Between 2001 and 2004, Colombian security forces carried out 34 military operations in Comuna 13 in an attempt to take control. Some of these operations have come under scrutiny due to alleged human rights violations against the civilian population, which have been denounced by victims and are now being investigated by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace.",
      "\u201cLa Escombrera was a paramilitary base since at least mid-2002,\u201d said Justice Gustavo Salazar, who is leading the investigation with the special tribunal. \"People detained by these groups were taken there to be interrogated, tortured, or simply killed and buried, under the belief that their bodies would never be found.\u201d",

At the same time, construction waste was being dumped at La Escombrera, a site once used to extract sand before being filled with rubble. While he believes the paramilitaries are the likely perpetrators, he doesn't rule out the possibility that other illegal groups also concealed bodies there.",

      "Margarita Restrepo, 62, lives in fear that her 17-year-old daughter, Carol, is buried in La Escombrera, a site she can see from her home every day. The thought that her daughter could be buried so close to her after 23 years of searching is agonizing.",
      "Carol disappeared on Oct. 25, 2002, during Operacion Orion, a military operation in Comuna 13 carried out by police, soldiers and aerial support at the start of the administration of then- President \u00c1lvaro Uribe.",
      "The discovery of human remains in La Escombrera ignited a debate in Colombia. The conservative party Centro Democr\u00e1tico defended Uribe\u2019s security policy and Operation Orion, arguing the disappearances didn\u2019t happen then and accusing the peace tribunal of political opportunism. In contrast, Colombian President Gustavo Petro, the country\u2019s first left-wing leader, saw it as confirmation of the state and paramilitary violence he has long condemned.",

      "Artificial intelligence is transforming call centers by streamlining tasks and improving customer service",
      "NEW YORK -- Armen Kirakosian remembers the frustrations of his first job as a call center agent nearly 10 years ago: the aggravated customers, the constant searching through menus for information and the notes he had to physically write for each call he handled.",
      "Thanks to artificial intelligence, the 29-year-old from Athens, Greece, is no longer writing notes or clicking on countless menus. He often has full customer profiles in front of him when a person calls in and may already know what problem the customer has before even saying \u201chello.\u201d He can spend more time actually serving the customer.",
      "\u201cA.I. has taken (the) robot out of us,\u201d Kirakosian said.",
      "Roughly 3 million Americans work in call center jobs, and millions more work in call centers around the world, answering billions of inquiries a year about everything from broken iPhones to orders for shoes. Kirakosian works for TTEC, a company that provides third party customer service lines in 22 countries to companies in industries such as autos and banking that need extra capacity or have outsourced their call center operations.",
      "Answering these calls can be thankless work. Roughly half of all customer service agents leave the job after a year, according to McKinsey, with stress and monotonous work being among the reasons employees quit.",
      "Much of what these agents deal with is referred to in the industry as \u201cbreak/fix,\u201d which means something is broken \u2014 or wrong or confusing \u2014 and the customer expects the person on the phone to fix the problem. Now, it\u2019s a question of who will be tasked with the fix: a human, a computer, or a human augmented by a computer.",
      "Already, AI agents have taken over more routine call center tasks. Some jobs have been lost and there have been dire forecasts about the future job market for these individuals, ranging from modest single-percentage point losses, to as many as half of all call center jobs going away in the next decade. The drop likely won't match the more dire predictions, however, because it's become evident that the industry will still need humans, perhaps with even higher levels of learning and training, as some customer service issues become increasingly harder to solve.",
      "Some finance companies have already experimented with going in heavily with AI for their customer service issues.",
      "Klarna, the Swedish buy now, pay later company, replaced 700 of their roughly 3,000 customer service agents with chatbots and AI in 2024. The results were mixed. While the company did save money, Klarna found there was still a need for higher skilled human agents in certain circumstances, such as complicated issues related to identity theft. Earlier this year, Klarna hired seven internal freelancers to handle these issues.",
      "Earlier this year, Klarna hired a handful of customer service employees back to the firm, acknowledging there were certain issues that AI couldn\u2019t handle as well as a real person, like identity theft.",
      "\u201cOur vision of an AI-first contact center, where AI agents handle the majority of conversations and fewer, better trained and better paid human agents support only the most complex tasks, is quickly becoming a reality,\u201d said Gadi Shamia of Replicant, an AI-software company that trains chatbots to sound more human, in an interview with consultants at McKinsey.",

      "The call center customer's experience, while improved, is still far from perfect.",
      "The initial customer service call has long been handled through interactive voice response systems, known in the industry as IVR. Customers interact with IVR when they're told \u201cpress one for sales, press two for support, press five for billing.\u201d These crude systems got an update in the 2010s, when customers could prompt the system by saying \u201csales\u201d or \u201csupport\u201d or simple phrases like \u201cI\u2019d like to pay a bill\u201d instead of navigating through a labyrinthian set of menu options.",
      "But customers have little patience for these menus, leading them to \u201czero out,\u201d which is call center slang for when a customer hits the zero button on their their keypad in hopes of reaching a human. It\u2019s also not uncommon that after a customer \u201czeros out\u201d they will be put on hold and transferred because they did not end up in the right place for their request.",
      "Aware of Americans' collective impatience with IVR, Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Republican Jim Justice of West Virginia have introduced the \u201cKeep Call Centers in America Act,\u201d which would require clear ways to reach a human agent, and provide incentives to companies that keep call center jobs in the U.S.",
      "Companies are trying to roll out telephone systems that broadly understand customer service requests and predict where to send a customer without navigating a menu. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, is coming out with its \u201cChatGPT Agent\u201d service for users that\u2019s able to understand phrases like \u201cI need to find a hotel for a wedding next year, please give me options for clothing and gifts.\u201d",
      "Bank of America says it has had increasing success in integrating such features into \u201cErica,\u201d its chatbot that debuted in 2018. When Erica cannot handle a request, the agent transfers the customer directly to the right department. Erica is now also predictive and analytical, and knows for instance that a customer may repeatedly have a low balance and may need better help budgeting or may have multiple subscriptions to the same service.",
      "Bank of America said this month that Erica has been used 3 billion times since its creation and is increasingly taking on a higher case load of customer service requests. The chatbot's moniker comes from the last five letters of the company's name.",
      "James Bednar, vice president of product and innovation at TTEC, has spent much of his career trying to make customer service calls less painful for the caller as well as the company. He said these tools could eventually kill off IVR for good, ending the need for anyone to \u201czero out.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're getting to the point where AI will get you to the right person for your problem without you having to route through those menus,\u201d Bednar said.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- More than 300 South Korean workers detained following a massive immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia will be released and brought home, the South Korean government announced Sunday.",
      "Kang Hoon-sik, chief of staff for President Lee Jae Myung, said South Korea and the U.S. had finalized negotiations on the workers\u2019 release. He said South Korea plans to send a charter plane to bring the workers home as soon as remaining administrative steps are completed.",
      "South Korea's Foreign Ministry said that Seoul and Washington are discussing details on allowing all the detained workers to return on a voluntary basis. It said Foreign Minister Cho Hyun is to leave for the U.S. on Monday afternoon for talks related to the workers' releases.",
      "U.S. immigration authorities said Friday they detained 475 people, most of them South Korean nationals, when hundreds of federal agents raided Hyundai's sprawling manufacturing site in Georgia where the Korean automaker makes electric vehicles. Agents focused on a plant that is still under construction at which Hyundai has partnered with LG Energy Solution to produce batteries that power EVs.",
      "Cho said that more than 300 South Koreans were among the detained.",
      "The operation was the latest in a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation agenda. But the one Thursday is especially distinct because of its large size and because the targeted site has been touted as Georgia's largest economic development project.",
      "The raid stunned many in South Korea because the country is a key U.S. ally. It agreed in July to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy and make a $350 billion investment in the U.S. in return for the U.S lowering tariff rates. About two weeks ago, U.S. President Donald Trump and Lee held their first meeting in Washington.",
      "Trump said perhaps the U.S. could work out an arrangement with South Korean workers who would train U.S. citizens to do work such as battery and computer manufacturing.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have people in this country right now that know about batteries, maybe we should help them along and let some people come in and train our people,\u201d Trump said Sunday night at Andrews Air Force Base. He added that \u201cthe way you train people is bring people in that know what they\u2019re doing, let them stay for a little while and help.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The housing market is becoming more buyer-friendly after years of sharply rising prices",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Skyrocketing housing values and a shortage of homes on the market gave homeowners the upper hand for years when it came time to sell. That\u2019s no longer a given.",
      "Across the country, it\u2019s getting tougher for sellers to drive a hard bargain. A dearth of home shoppers who can afford to buy and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy, jobs and mortgage rates is putting pressure on sellers to give ground at the negotiating table.",
      "In some markets, mainly in the South and West, homeowners who are eager to sell are more likely to give buyers a better deal. This could include a lower price, up-front money to nudge down the buyer\u2019s mortgage rate, and funds for closing costs and any repairs or improvements that may pop up after the home inspection.",
      "The reasons: Would-be buyers balk at what they view as unreasonable asking prices, while at the same time new construction is giving buyers more options and putting pressure on sellers to make their homes more appealing.",
      "As a result, while the national median home listing price rose slightly in July, some metro areas saw a decline, signaling a reversal in the power dynamic between buyers and sellers. It\u2019s rare to see the type of eye-popping bidding wars that exploded home values by roughly 50% nationally earlier this decade. Low-ball offers are more common.",
      "Despite this hopeful trend, the housing market remains mired in a slump. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes are running about 1.3% below where they were through the first seven months of last year, when they sank to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "The national median home listing price rose slightly in July from a year earlier to $439,450, according to Realtor.com. The real estate listing company found the most a homebuyer who earns the median U.S. household income can afford to spend on a home is $298,000. The analysis assumes a 20% down payment and a 30-year mortgage at a fixed rate of 6.74%. By those criteria, 7 out of 10 home shoppers are priced out of the market.",
      "The housing market has been in a rut since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. The number of homes available for sale sank while prices kept rising.",
      "Nationally, more homes are going on sale and remaining unsold longer because buyers have been unwilling or unable to make a deal. Active listings \u2014 a tally that encompasses all homes on the market except those pending a finalized sale \u2014 increased in July for the 21st month in a row, climbing nearly 25% from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com.",
      "The inventory of homes for sale across the U.S. has increased gradually as the market has slowed and is now at a level where supply and demand are more balanced. But in states like Texas and Florida, the number of homes on the market has climbed sharply, partly because those states are hotbeds of new home construction.",
      "Home shoppers may now have more leverage relative to sellers in the South and West, where home inventory has risen in the single digits, compared to pre-pandemic levels. Conditions are tougher in markets in the Midwest and Northeast, where the supply of homes remains 40% and 50% below pre-pandemic levels, respectively, according to Realtor.com.",
      "After roughly two months on the market and three open houses, Doug McCormick\u2019s home has yet to receive a single offer.",
      "The retired business owner and his wife initially listed the 4-bedroom, 4.5-bath house located in Evergreen, a mountain community about 30 miles west of Denver, for $1.3 million. They lowered their asking price to about $1.28 million. That, too, failed to bring in a buyer.",
      "McCormick, 80, says he\u2019s hoping mortgage rates ease a bit and bring out more buyers. But he\u2019s also considering just renting the property.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s kind of in the back of my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI keep reminding myself you only need one buyer.\u201d",
      "McCormick\u2019s situation is not unique. As demand has slowed, more sellers have resorted to lowering their initial asking price \u2014 often multiple times \u2014 to no avail.",

      "Lindsay Olesberg and her husband, John, know what it\u2019s like to navigate both sides of the housing slump.",
      "The couple listed their 4-bedroom, 3.5-bath home outside Albuquerque for $835,000 in June 2024 after John, a research scientist, got a new job in Texas. The plan: Sell their house, move to Austin and buy a home there. It took more than a year, during which the couple lowered their asking price several times, temporarily took the home off the market and had some offers fall through.",
      "In the end, they agreed to sell for $40,000 below their original listing price.",
      "Buying a home was much easier. The Olesbergs had little trouble finding homes they liked and could afford in Austin, where home inventory was up nearly 60% in July compared to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "They bought a five-bedroom, three-bath house in Austin for $735,000, or $30,000 below its initial listing price. The seller also agreed to cover $1,000 in fees.",
      "\u201cWe got less for our house in New Mexico than we would have wanted,\u201d said Lindsay Olesberg, 59, a Bible teacher. \u201cBut at the same time, you also knew it was a buyer\u2019s market in Austin, so the prices were coming down.\u201d",
      "In markets where buyers now have the upper hand, sellers who can afford to wait are often opting to pull their listing rather than be pressured into coming way down on price.",
      "Tammy Tullis put her home in the Miami suburb of South Miami on the market in June. But the four-bedroom, 3.5-bath house didn\u2019t receive many offers initially, so she dropped her $2.8 million asking price by $100,000. That helped drive turnout during an open house, but she only received low-ball offers.",
      "\u201cThey were like $400,000-$500,000 off the mark,\u201d said Tullis, 51.",
      "Last month, the finance consultant took the listing down. She may relist it sooner, rather than later.",
      "\u201cI want to sell, but I\u2019m not in a rush-rush,\u201d Tullis said.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, saying doing so will help the housing market. But homebuyers \u2013 and politicians \u2013 should keep in mind that the central bank only directly influences short-term rates, while most mortgages are based on the yield of the 10-year Treasury. So, lower mortgage rates wouldn\u2019t be a given, even if the Fed cuts rates in two weeks, as the market expects.",
      "And while lower mortgage rates would boost home shoppers\u2019 purchasing power, they also could bring in more buyers, giving sellers less incentive to keep lowering prices.",
      "Economists generally expect the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain near the mid-6% range this year.",

      "Based in Lakewood, Colorado., FirstBank, which is also branded as 1stBank, is a midsized bank that operates 120 retail branches with $26.7 billion in assets. The bank is privately held, but the banks disclosed that the stockholders of FirstBank who collectively own 45.7% of the shares have already voted in favor of the merger.",
      "\u201cIts deep retail deposit base, unrivaled branch network in Colorado, growing presence in Arizona, and trusted community relationships make it an ideal partner for PNC,\u201d said Bill Demchak, chairman and chief executive officer of PNC, in a statement.",
      "PNC has been on an acquisition streak in the last few years that has made the Pennsylvania bank one of the biggest players in retail banking in the country, as PNC executives like to say \u201ca coast-to-coast banking franchise.\" PNC bought the U.S. operations of Spanish bank BBVA shortly after the pandemic for $11.6 billion. The bank has also been opening new branches in multiple markets, but particularly in the Southwest.",
      "The FirstBank acquisition will make PNC the largest bank in the Denver market, and will give PNC more than 70 branches in Arizona. PNC will also grow to roughly $575 billion in assets.",
      "The FirstBank purchase will put PNC closer in size to Capital One and U.S. Bank, who are PNC\u2019s closest rivals. U.S. Bank, in particular, operates heavily in the Colorado and Arizona market.",

      "In the rebel-held territories including Bukavu, several state employees once paid in cash say they now get paid via online transfers.",

      "David Kyanga, a professor of economics at Bukavu\u2019s Higher Institute of Commerce, said the only solution is for the M23-controlled cities to adopt the defective banknotes as valid means of payment in the absence of cash supplies from Congolese banking authorities.",

      "Very early in the plan, Tesla would have to reach a market valuation of $2 trillion and achieve 20 million vehicles deliveries. Tesla delivered less than 2 million vehicles in 2024.",

      "RIO FRIO, Portugal -- U.S. winemakers have something to celebrate: the corks they\u2019re popping aren\u2019t subject to tariffs.",
      "Cork comes from the spongy bark of the cork oak tree, which is primarily grown and harvested in the Mediterranean basin. The framework trade agreement between the United States and the European Union singled out the material as an \u201cunavailable natural product.\u201d So as of Sept. 1, cork joined a handful of other items, including airplanes and generic pharmaceuticals, that are exempt from a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU products.",
      "The cork carve-out was vital for Portugal. The European country is the world\u2019s largest cork producer, accounting for about half of global production.",
      "Portuguese diplomats lobbied for the exemption on both sides of the Atlantic. Patrick Spencer, the executive director of the U.S.-based Natural Cork Council, raced from Salem, Oregon, to Washington in June to explain cork\u2019s origins to U.S. trade officials and to seek a tariff reprieve. The Wine Institute, which represents California vintners, said it also pushed for the special dispensation.",
      "Spencer said he was thrilled when a summary of the U.S.-EU agreement released in August mentioned cork.",
      "\u201cIt was a great day in our neighborhood,\u201d said Spencer, a self-described \u201ccork dork.\"",
      "It\u2019s unclear if cork is unique or if other natural products will be exempt from U.S. tariffs in future trade agreements. The U.S. Department of Commerce and the White House did not respond when The Associated Press asked about tariff exemptions.",
      "It\u2019s not even clear if the tariffs President Donald Trump put on imports from the EU's 27 member nations and almost every country will remain. Late last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that Trump had no right to impose his sweeping tariffs, although it left them in place while his administration appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "But if the tariffs stay in place, cork may signal other exemptions to come. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated during a July interview with CNBC that natural products like mangoes or cocoa may be free from tariffs",
      "The U.S. is the second-largest market for Portuguese cork after France. In 2023, the U.S. imported $241 million worth of cork from Portugal; just over 70% of it came in the form of stoppers for wine, spirits, olive oil, honey and other liquids, according to the Natural Cork Council, a trade group.",
      "Cork has other applications, too. NASA and SpaceX have used it for thermal protection on rockets. Cork crumbles are also used as infill for sports fields and inserted into concrete on airport runways to help absorb the shock of plane landings.",
      "Even though California has a similar climate to the Mediterranean, the U.S. has never developed a cork industry. There was an attempt to start one during World War II, and around 500 cork oaks from that period remain on the campus of the University of California, Davis.",
      "But the effort evaporated when the war ended. The problem: it takes 25 years for a cork tree to produce its first bark for harvesting, and the initial yield typically isn\u2019t high quality. After that, it takes the tree about nine years to grow new bark.",
      "\u201cAmericans are not patient enough to wait for a tree that takes 25 years to give its first harvest,\u201d said Antonio Amorim, the chairman and CEO of Portugal\u2019s Corticeira Amorim, one of the world\u2019s largest cork companies.",

      "Cork harvesting is also an extremely specialized skill, since cutting into a tree the wrong way could kill it. Cork harvesters are the highest paid agricultural workers in Europe, Spencer said.",
      "Amorim, which exports cork to more than 100 countries, has more than 20 million cork trees spread over 700,000 hectares (1.7 million acres) of woodland.",
      "On a recent day at Amorim\u2019s Herdade de Rio Frio, a farm 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Lisbon, crews zig-zagged across the thin, pale grass between scattered cork trees, kicking up dust.",
      "The quiet woodland echoed with the gentle thud of the workers\u2019 axes. They gently pierced the bark, feeling for the thickness of cork that could be peeled off without harming the trunk. The Portuguese have harvested cork this way for more than 200 years.",
      "The tree bark came off in featherweight slabs that the workers, their hands black from the oaks' natural tannins, tossed onto a flatbed truck. It would go to factories to be cut into strips and fed into a machine that punches out stoppers.",
      "Once the trees were bare, a woman painted a white \u201c5\u201d on the orange-colored trunks, signaling they were stripped in 2025. Herdade de Rio Frio's cork oaks, which are native to Portugal and can resist frequent droughts and scorching summer temperatures, were planted more than 100 years ago.",
      "Cork\u2019s sustainable harvesting process and its biodegradability are two reasons many U.S. winemakers have returned to plugging bottles with it after experimenting with closures made of aluminum, plastic and glass. In 2010, 53% of premium U.S. wines used cork stoppers; by 2022, that had risen to 64.5%, according to the Natural Cork Council.",
      "Cork taint, which gives wine a funky taste and is caused by a fungus in natural corks, was a big problem in the 1990s, and it pushed many vintners into aluminum screw caps and other closures, said Andrew Waterhouse, a chemist and director of the Robert Mondavi Institute of Wine and Food Science at the University of California, Davis.",
      "The cork industry has largely solved that problem, Waterhouse said. In the meantime, the wine industry came up with new technology, like screw caps that can mimic cork in the amount of oxygen they let into a bottle over time.",
      "Many wineries, including Trump Winery in Virginia, now use both screw caps and natural corks. Waterhouse said screw caps generally make more sense for a wine like ros\u00e9, which isn\u2019t intended to age, while cork is the standard for aging wines.",
      "\u201cIf you say, \u2018Has this wine aged properly?,\u2019 what you mean is, \u2018Was it in a glass bottle with a cork seal in a cool cellar?\u2019 Under any other conditions, it didn\u2019t age the same,\u201d Waterhouse said. \u201cWe\u2019re always trapped by history.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Fox News seemed to be dealt a crippling blow in a $787 million settlement of a libel lawsuit more than two years ago, but has instead thrived",
      "NEW YORK -- Twice recently, the people who run Fox News were reminded of their biggest nightmare.",
      "The conservative network Newsmax's $67 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems over false claims after the 2020 election recalled Fox's own $787.5 million deal with the same company more than two years ago. New legal papers filed last month by a second company suing Fox, Smartmatic, also put an episode they would like to forget back in the news.",
      "Between the staggering payment to bypass a defamation trial and revelations about the lengths to which Fox went to avoid telling its audience what it didn't want to hear about Donald Trump's defeat, many wondered if its actions in November 2020 would damage Fox News or compel it to change directions.",
      "Not so much, it turns out.",
      "Fox News Channel has defied gravity with its ratings, and is more popular with viewers this summer than ABC, CBS or NBC. Its top personalities resolutely support Trump, who has filled his second administration with former Fox stars like Pete Hegseth and Jeanine Pirro. Time after time, the White House turns to Fox to make news; shortly after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump was sitting with Sean Hannity.",
      "Reached by The Associated Press, Fox declined to make anyone available to speak for this story.",
      "An ethos many at Fox share with the president \u2014 no expressed regrets, no apologies \u2014 has also shown signs of spreading, given Newsmax's swagger following the Aug. 11 settlement announcement.",
      "Fox News averaged 2.63 million viewers in weekday prime-time for the second quarter of 2025, up 56% from the same period in 2023, the Nielsen company said. While the increase is somewhat inflated since Fox took a hit in the ratings two years ago following the firing of Tucker Carlson, the advance of cord-cutting means that any network gaining viewers now is unusual.",
      "MSNBC's prime-time audience of 1 million this spring was down 21% in two years, and CNN's viewership of 538,000 was down 6%, Nielsen said. Forty-five percent of people watching one of the top three cable news networks at any given time two years ago were tuned to Fox. This year, that audience share jumped to 62%.",
      "Clearly, Fox's audience is more interested in following a Trump administration than it was for a Joe Biden administration. Just as clearly, the Dominion case had little appreciable impact on viewership.",
      "\u201cFox's audience didn't really look at that verdict and say, \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t watch them anymore,'\u201d said Tim Graham, director of media analysis at the conservative Media Research Center. \u201cI think Fox's audience looked at that and said, \u2018oh, the left is coming after them.\u2019\u201d",
      "Financially, the Dominion settlement was stiff enough that Newsmax is spreading its payments out over three years. The much larger Fox had a greater ability to absorb its hit. Fox confirmed at the time that it could deduct the settlement from its income taxes, and insurance could make the payment lower. Meanwhile, Fox News is a profit engine and becoming even more so; Axios reported earlier this year that the company expected to make half a billion dollars on non-TV products like books, podcasts and streaming.",
      "Carlson was the face of the network before he was fired shortly after the settlement was announced, but Fox has always been able to generate new stars. Carlson took over from Bill O'Reilly when he was fired in 2017. Fox started \u201cThe Five,\u201d arguably its centerpiece show, when Glenn Beck was shown the door in 2011. Jesse Watters now owns Carlson and O'Reilly's old time slot.",
      "Yet, it's hard to understate the worry many at Fox had about losing audience immediately following the 2020 election. Trump, and many of his fans, were angry that the network declared Biden the winner in Arizona before most news outlets, a pivotal moment in the vote-counting.",
      "Internal messages and deposition interviews revealed in court papers tied to Smartmatic's lawsuit reveal much of that drama. Management criticized anchor Neil Cavuto for ordering his show to cut away from Trump press secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she began talking about election fraud. News reporters were disciplined for fact-checking some of Trump's claims. Many in Fox's audience expressed anger at hearing Trump corrected and wanted to hear conspiracy theories.",
      "Cavuto left Fox after 28 years last December. McEnany is now a co-host of Fox's midday show, \u201cOutnumbered.\u201d Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, hosts a weekend show at Fox.",

      "Former Fox politics editor Chris Stirewalt, who was fired by Fox shortly after the network's correct call in Arizona, identified in a Smartmatic deposition a programming strategy that Fox excels at. \u201cThe best way to capture an audience is to make them afraid, make them fearful of something \u2014 to make them hate or resent other people to try to keep them with your telecast and that they're afraid to change the channel,\u201d he said.",
      "Fox has also maintained its dominance by playing a form of hardball that Newsmax alleged, in a lawsuit filed this week, violates antitrust laws. Newsmax said Fox has tried to block television distributors from carrying its rival, hired private detectives to investigate Newsmax executives and pressured guests not to appear on the network.",
      "In response, Fox said, \u201cNewsmax cannot sue their way out of their own competitive failures in the marketplace to chase headlines simply because they can't attract viewers.\u201d",
      "Smartmatic said Fox has never retracted, or apologized for, programs that falsely suggested the company was involved in changing votes in 2020. Fox, which would not make an executive available for this story, said fraud charges made by a president or his representatives were newsworthy, and the network is defending itself on free speech grounds.",
      "Newsmax has twice publicly expressed some regrets about its postelection coverage. The network settled a lawsuit with Smartmatic in 2024.",
      "In a statement aired on Newsmax in December 2020, the network said that \u201cno evidence has been offered that Dominion or Smartmatic used software or reprogrammed software that manipulated votes in the 2020 election.\u201d The following April, Newsmax apologized for airing false allegations that a Dominion employee, Eric Coomer, manipulated voting machines or tallies to the detriment of Trump in 2020. Coomer, in turn, dropped Newsmax from a defamation lawsuit.",
      "According to court papers in the case, Newsmax executive Gary Kanofsky wrote about conspiracy theorists to a colleague shortly after the election: \u201cSimply giving them a microphone to spew more anti-election rhetoric and advance their claims without being properly equipped to question the legitimacy or factual accuracy of their assertions may be fun, but it\u2019s terrible journalism.\u201d",
      "But Newsmax offered no apology in making the Dominion settlement, announced Aug. 11. The network's CEO, Chris Ruddy, attacked the judge, saying he \u201ceffectively entered a confiscation of our property because our reporting was not always sympathetic to Joe Biden.\u201d",
      "The network said on the air: \u201cNewsmax believed it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020. We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced and conducted within professional standards of journalism.\u201d",
      "What has changed? Newsmax has grown, and two months after Trump took office again, it went public. It invites members of its audience \u2014 dominated by Trump fans \u2014 to invest in the network.",
      "\u201cIf you're paying attention to your audience at Newsmax,\u201d Graham said, \u201cyou don't want to give the impression that you're knuckling under.\u201d",

      "India\u2019s clean energy appetite is helping the country\u2019s solar power industry wean itself off imported Chinese parts and continue growing even as it faces a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States",
      "JAIPUR, India -- On the edge of Jaipur, an Indian city known for its colorful bazaars and palaces, a bustling industrial complex is the epicenter of the country's push to compete with China in making components for solar technology.",
      "India, the world's most populous nation, is jockeying for market share against the global leader in solar in part by selling to its own citizens, which helps the country with its other goal: meeting growing domestic demand for electricity.",
      "In the government-subsidized zone that provides tax breaks, solar manufacturer ReNew's sprawling factory makes enough modules to produce 4 gigawatts of power each year \u2014 equivalent to the energy needed for approximately 2.5 million Indian homes. The 2-year-old facility that employs nearly 1,000 people serves as a symbol of the solar industry\u2019s momentum. India\u2019s capacity to build key solar components more than doubled in the fiscal year ending in March.",
      "\u201cWhen I got this opportunity, I was really happy that I was directly contributing to the clean energy transition,\u201d said Monisha, an engineer at ReNew who goes by one name. She said the work has helped her become independent and assist her family with their finances.",
      "The country still faces a steep climb in its efforts to develop solar manufacturing that could one day rival China, which makes more than 80% of all solar components in the world and supplies key materials to Indian manufacturers.",
      "India's solar industry must also contend with a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs of 50% on Indian goods took effect last month, while Trump\u2019s administration and Republican lawmakers have taken other steps to hinder U.S. adoption of solar and other clean energy.",
      "Still, India's clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures. Energy analysts said India's domestic demand for solar power will likely reduce disruption from tariffs imposed by the U.S., where about a third of the solar panels produced by India were sold in a recent fiscal year. Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.",
      "While Indian solar manufacturers can sell at higher prices abroad, ambitious domestic clean energy targets and domestic demand will help them find buyers within India if sales in the U.S. slow, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge industry that can absorb these modules and cells that are being produced. We are not necessarily as export dependent as other countries are,\u201d said Charith Konda, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "India's domestic solar market has already helped Hyderabad-based Vega Solar shift its customer base for off-grid solar modules for RVs, electric fences and other uses to customers in India in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, said Vinay Keesara, a company director.",
      "\u201cBefore the pandemic, 90% of my business was exports and 10% used to be domestic supply, now this has just flipped the other way around,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun and other clean energy sources. The cost of solar power \u2014 now half that of new coal-powered plants \u2014 and India's many sunny days are reasons that experts said installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.",
      "Before the U.S. tariffs were announced, researchers with IEEFA and Gurugram, India-based JMK Research wrote that India's demand for solar modules during the next two years could exceed what its manufacturers are selling within the country because so many are being exported. India has also been importing solar modules from China.",
      "Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won\u2019t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance. And uncertainty remains over the fate of all of Trump's tariffs. Despite a U.S. court ruling against Trump\u2019s tariffs, they remain in place until at least October while his administration files appeals.",
      "India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline \u2014 most of which are solar \u2014 and are expected to be completed in the next few years. The country also has an ambitious clean energy target of 500 gigawatts by 2030.",
      "Government policies restricting imports of solar components, incentives for solar manufacturers and mandates for solar power producers to purchase material from government-approved sources gave Indian companies the right signals to ramp up solar manufacturing, said Sanjay Verghese, ReNew\u2019s group president for solar manufacturing and solar projects.",

      "India still depends on imports of raw materials as well as finished solar components from China but is making progress on reducing its reliance. Government data showed India imported $1.3 billion worth of solar cells and modules from China in the first quarter of the year, down by more than one-third from the same period a year earlier. Cells are individual units that convert sunlight into energy, while modules are made up of multiple cells.",

      "McDonald\u2019s Chairman and CEO Chris Kempczinski said in an interview on CNBC Tuesday that he supports President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to eliminate federal taxes on tips. But since McDonald\u2019s workers don't earn tips, the policy doesn\u2019t help them.",
      "Kempczinski also noted that in many states, sit-down restaurants are allowed to pay servers as little as $2.13 per hour, a federal minimum set in 1991, with tips making up the rest of their pay.",
      "\u201cSo right now, there\u2019s an uneven playing field. If you are a restaurant that allows tips or has tips as part of your equation, you\u2019re essentially getting the customer to pay for your labor and you\u2019re getting an extra benefit from no taxes on tips,\u201d Kempczinski said.",
      "Seven states \u2013 including California, Nevada and Minnesota \u2013 require restaurants to pay their servers a minimum wage before tips are added. Kempczinski said that policy helps lower poverty levels and employee turnover.",
      "\u201cWe just need to do that, I think, across all 50 states. And we\u2019ve said repeatedly, we\u2019re open to conversations on raising the federal minimum wage,\u201d Kempczinski said.",
      "Kempczinski was promoting McDonald's new Extra Value Meals, which offer discounted prices for an entree, side and drink. Kempczinski said the company is trying to appeal to lower- and middle-income customers who have cut back on their visits as fast food prices have risen.",

      "Staked to a one-point lead, the Americans delivered a record performance in singles by winning eight of the 10 matches and halving another for a 17-9 victory.",
      "U.S. Amateur champion Mason Howell capped off his amazing summer by scratching out a halve with Connor Graham in a tight match of 18-year-olds, going 2-0-1 for the week.",
      "Stewart Hagestad, the veteran of this U.S. team playing in his fifth Walker Cup, holed a 20-foot birdie putt on the par-3 15th for a 4-and-3 victory that assured the Americans keeping the cup, and Preston Stout secured an outright win when he held off Luke Poulter, 2 and 1.",
      "The fog was so thick there was a slight delay when players couldn't see the green over the ocean on the par-3 16th hole. By then, it was over except for the final score.",

      "This is the longest winning streak for the Americans since they won eight in row from 1973 through 1987. Unlike the Walker Cup two years ago at St. Andrews, the powerful U.S. team didn't need any Sunday heroics.",
      "They won big, anyway. The 8-1-1 Sunday singles was the best record by a Walker Cup team since it went to 10 matches in 2009.",
      "Howell delivered more big moments in the Sunday morning foursomes, holing a 35-foot birdie putt on the 15th and holing out from the fairway on the par-4 17th. Jackson Koivun and Tommy Morrison turned what looked like a sure loss into a 1-up win.",
      "The morning session ended in a draw, and the Americans took a one-point lead into singles matches of all 10 players.",
      "Under a brilliant blue sky on America's most picturesque golf course, the scoreboard quickly filled with red scores. The matches were all relatively close, but it was a daunting site for a GB&I team looking to win on U.S. soil for the first time since 2001.",

      "Josh Allen led Buffalo to three scores in the final four minutes, the last a 32-yard field goal by Matt Prater as time expired, and the Bills rallied from 15 points down to stun the Baltimore Ravens 41-40 in a season-opening thriller",
      "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- Josh Allen had a message to the few thousands fans \u2014 and perhaps the entire NFL, for that matter \u2014 who left the stadium early to beat the traffic on Sunday night.",
      "Maybe they should\u2019ve stuck around.",
      "\u201cOur team didn\u2019t quit,\u201d Allen said, his voice almost hoarse after rallying the Bills from a 15-point deficit in the final four minutes to a thrilling season-opening 41-40 win over the Baltimore Ravens. \u201cI think there\u2019s people who left the stadium. That\u2019s OK. We\u2019ll be fine. But have some faith next time.\u201d",
      "Allen refused to let up in scoring two touchdowns and throwing another \u2014 with Keon Coleman catching a tipped pass in the end zone \u2014 in a frantic fourth quarter alone. The NFL\u2019s reigning MVP then capped the win by overseeing a nine-play, 66-yard drive over the final 86 seconds in setting up Matt Prater\u2019s 32-yard field goal as time expired.",
      "\u201cJosh, he\u2019s always been like that though. He wants the ball in key moments of the game,\u201d coach Sean McDermott said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the great ones, that\u2019s their mindset. That\u2019s what they want, that's what they do. And he\u2019s never out of it in his mind.\u201d",
      "Allen finished going 33 of 46 for 394 yards and two touchdowns and earned his 77th win, tying Joe Ferguson for second on the Bills list.",
      "The Bills' defense bent but didn\u2019t break in an outing it was being trampled by Derrick Henry, who finished with 169 yards rushing and scored twice. Meantime, Lamar Jackson combined for three touchdowns, including two passing, in steering an offense that scored on seven of its first eight possessions.",
      "Henry, however, contributed to the loss by losing a fumble with 3:06 left, which opened the door for Buffalo\u2019s comeback.",
      "Allen scored on a 1-yard run two minutes later in cutting the lead to 40-38. And the Bills then got the ball back after the defense forced a three-and-out on what became Baltimore\u2019s final possession.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing I saw when we got down early, no one blinked,\u201d Prater said. The 41-year-old made his Bills debut, replacing Tyler Bass, who\u2019s on injured reserve with hip and groin issues.",
      "Buffalo overcame a fourth-quarter 15-point deficit for just the third time in team history. Baltimore became the first team in NFL history to lose when scoring 40 or more points and rushing for 235 yards or more.",
      "\u201cYou just got to finish the game,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not over until there is zero, zero, zero on the clock. And we found that out tonight.\u201d",
      "Henry blamed himself for the fumble, which was forced by Ed Oliver and recovered by Terrel Bernard at Baltimore\u2019s 30.",
      "\u201cI told my teammates after the game, put the loss on me. I own it like a man,\u201d Henry said. \u201cGot lackadaisical and they made a play. ... If I take care of the ball, I feel like it would be a different situation.\u201d",
      "The game appeared over when Henry scored on a 46-yard run to put Baltimore ahead 40-25 with 11:42 remaining.",
      "This prime-time matchup lived up to the preseason hype as a rematch of Buffalo\u2019s 27-25 win over Baltimore the divisional round of last season\u2019s AFC playoffs.",

    "story": [
      "A new study finds that climate change is increasing sugar consumption in the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- Global warming in the United States is amping up the country's sweet tooth, a new study found.",
      "When the temperature rises, Americans \u2014 especially those with less money and education \u2014 drink lots more sugary beverages and a bit more frozen desserts. That amounts to more than 100 million pounds of added sugar (358 million kilograms) consumed in the nation a year, compared to 15 years earlier, according to a team of researchers in the U.S. and United Kingdom.",
      "When temperatures go between 54 and 86 degrees (12 and 30 degrees Celsius), the amount of sugar the average American consumes goes up by about 0.4 grams per degree Fahrenheit (0.7 grams per degree Celsius) per day, based on researchers tracking of weather conditions and consumers' purchases. At 54 degrees, the amount of added sugar for the average American is a little more than 2 grams. At 86 degrees, it\u2019s more than 15 grams.",
      "Beyond that, appetites lessen and added sugar falls off, according to the study in Monday's Nature Climate Change.",
      "\u201cClimate change is shaping what you eat and how you eat and that might have a bad effect on your health,\u201d said study co-author Duo Chan, a climate scientist at the University of Southampton.",
      "\u201cPeople tend to take in more sweetened beverages as the temperature is getting higher and higher,\u201d Chan said. \u201cObviously under a warming climate that would cause you to drink more or take in more sugar. And that is going to be a severe problem when it comes to health.\u201d",
      "The daily difference from higher temperatures doesn't amount to even a single candy bar for the average person. But it adds up over time and has a big effect, said University of California San Francisco endocrinology professor Dr. Robert Lustig, a specialist in pediatrics and obesity who wasn't part of the study.",
      "Lustig wrote in an email that among poorer Americans, just one added can of sugary soft drink per day increases diabetes risk by 29% \u2014 and temperature-related thirst plays a big part in America\u2019s obesity epidemic.",
      "The United States\u2019 average annual temperature has gone up about 2.2 degrees (1.2 degrees Celsius) since 1895, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "To chart the impact on sugar consumption, researchers compared it to the American Heart Association recommendations: limiting daily intake to 36 grams for men and 25 grams for women.",
      "The team then compared wind, precipitation and humidity records to the detailed purchase records of 40,000 to 60,000 American households from 2004 to 2019, not using any data after the pandemic hit. Then they looked at the nutritional information of the items bought. That allowed them to eliminate other factors to make a causal link and come up with a calculation for how much extra sugar is consumed per person per degree, said lead author Pan He, an environmental scientist at Cardiff University.",

      "The researchers found that men consumed more sugary soft drinks, and that the amount of added sugar consumed during hot weather was several times higher for low- and very low-income families than for the wealthiest, the study found.",
      "People who work outside drank more sugary drinks than those who work inside, and the same went for families where the head of the household was less educated. White people have the highest added sugar effect, while Asians showed no significant change in added sugar in the heat.",
      "Lustig said sugary drinks are marketed and priced in a way to attract the poor, and in many disadvantaged communities the water tastes funny because of chemicals in them. Poor people are also less likely to have air conditioning and are more likely to work outside and need more hydration, Lustig and He said.",
      "\u201cIt should concern us that the rate of the impact is larger in households where people make less money or are less educated,\u201d said Dr. Courtney Howard, vice chair of the Global Climate and Health Alliance. \u201cThese groups tend to have lower baseline health status, so this is an area where climate-related changes appear to magnify existing health inequalities.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.",
      "This is the nation\u2019s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port \u2014 enough to power up to 60,000 homes.",

      "Wave energy is an emerging industry that\u2019s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.",
      "Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America\u2019s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race.

      "Thanks to artificial intelligence, the 29-year-old from Athens, Greece, is no longer writing notes or clicking on countless menus. He often has full customer profiles in front of him when a person calls in and may already know what problem the customer has before even saying \u201chello.\u201d He can spend more time actually serving the customer.",
      "\u201cA.I. has taken (the) robot out of us,\u201d Kirakosian said.",
      "Roughly 3 million Americans work in call center jobs, and millions more work in call centers around the world, answering billions of inquiries a year about everything from broken iPhones to orders for shoes. Kirakosian works for TTEC, a company that provides third party customer service lines in 22 countries to companies in industries such as autos and banking that need extra capacity or have outsourced their call center operations.",
      "Answering these calls can be thankless work. Roughly half of all customer service agents leave the job after a year, according to McKinsey, with stress and monotonous work being among the reasons employees quit.",
      "Much of what these agents deal with is referred to in the industry as \u201cbreak/fix,\u201d which means something is broken \u2014 or wrong or confusing \u2014 and the customer expects the person on the phone to fix the problem. Now, it\u2019s a question of who will be tasked with the fix: a human, a computer, or a human augmented by a computer.",
      "Already, AI agents have taken over more routine call center tasks. Some jobs have been lost and there have been dire forecasts about the future job market for these individuals, ranging from modest single-percentage point losses, to as many as half of all call center jobs going away in the next decade. The drop likely won't match the more dire predictions, however, because it's become evident that the industry will still need humans, perhaps with even higher levels of learning and training, as some customer service issues become increasingly harder to solve.",
      "Some finance companies have already experimented with going in heavily with AI for their customer service issues.",
      "Klarna, the Swedish buy now, pay later company, replaced 700 of their roughly 3,000 customer service agents with chatbots and AI in 2024. The results were mixed. While the company did save money, Klarna found there was still a need for higher skilled human agents in certain circumstances, such as complicated issues related to identity theft. Earlier this year, Klarna hired seven internal freelancers to handle these issues.",

      "New research suggests that a tiny phytoplankton that is an essential part of the marine food web may decline sharply as oceans warm",
      "SEATTLE -- For decades, scientists believed Prochlorococcus, the smallest and most abundant phytoplankton on Earth, would thrive in a warmer world. But new research suggests the microscopic bacterium, which forms the foundation of the marine food web and helps regulate the planet\u2019s climate, will decline sharply as seas heat up.",
      "A study published Monday in the journal Nature Microbiology found Prochlorococcus populations could shrink by as much as half in tropical oceans over the next 75 years if surface waters exceed about 82 degrees Fahrenheit (27.8 Celsius). Many tropical and subtropical sea surface temperatures are already trending above average and are projected to regularly surpass 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius) over that same period.",
      "\u201cThese are keystone species \u2014 very important ones,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Ribalet, a research associate professor at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Oceanography and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cAnd when a keystone species decreases in abundance, it always has consequences on ecology and biodiversity. The food web is going to change.\u201d",
      "Prochlorococcus inhabit up to 75% of Earth\u2019s sunlit surface waters and produce about one-fifth of the planet\u2019s oxygen through photosynthesis. More crucially, Ribalet said, they convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into food at the base of the marine ecosystem.",
      "\u201cIn the tropical ocean, nearly half of the food is produced by Prochlorococcus,\u201d he said. \u201cHundreds of species rely on these guys.\u201d",
      "Though other forms of phytoplankton may move in and help compensate for the loss of oxygen and food, Ribalet cautioned they are not perfect substitutes. \u201cEvolution has made this very specific interaction,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, this is going to have an impact on this very unique system that has been established.\u201d",
      "The findings challenge decades of assumptions that Prochlorococcus would thrive as waters warmed. Those predictions, however, were based on limited data from lab cultures. For this study, Ribalet and his team tested water samples while traversing the Pacific over the course of a decade.",
      "Over 100 research cruises \u2014 the equivalent of six trips around the globe \u2014 they counted some 800 billion individual cells taken from samples at every kilometer. In his lab at the University of Washington, Ribalet demonstrated the SeaFlow, a box filled with tubes, wires and a piercing blue laser. The custom-built device continuously pulls in seawater, which allowed the team to count the microbes in real time. \u201cWe have counted more Prochlorococcus than there are stars in the Milky Way,\u201d Ribalet said.",
      "Paul Berube, a research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies Prochlorococcus but was not involved in the work, said the breadth of data is \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d And he said the results fit with what is known about the microbe\u2019s streamlined genome, which makes it less adaptable to rapid environmental changes.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re at the very base of the food web, and they feed everything else \u2014 the fish eat the things that eat the phytoplankton and we eat the fish,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen changes are being made to the planet that influence these particular organisms that are essentially feeding us, that\u2019s going to have big consequences.\u201d",
      "To test whether Prochlorococcus might evolve to withstand hotter conditions, Ribalet\u2019s team modeled a hypothetical heat-tolerant strain but found that even those would \u201cnot be enough to fully resist the warmest temperature if greenhouse emissions keep rising,\u201d Ribalet said.",
      "He stressed that the study\u2019s projections are conservative and don\u2019t account for the impacts of plastic pollution or other ecological stressors. \u201cWe actually tried to put forth the best-case scenario,\u201d Ribalet said. \u201cIn reality, things may be worse.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe need to look for every possibility we have to find more water for society,\u201d Dugan, a geophysicist and hydrologist at the Colorado School of Mines, told Associated Press journalists who recently spent 12 hours on the drilling platform. The research teams looked in \u201cone of the last places you would probably look for fresh water on Earth.\u201d",
      "They found it, and will be analyzing nearly 50,000 liters (13,209 gallons) of it back in their labs around the world in the coming months. They're out to solve the mystery of its origins \u2014 whether the water is from glaciers, connected groundwater systems on land or some combination.",
      "The potential is enormous. So are the hurdles of getting the water out and puzzling over who owns it, who uses it and how to extract it without undue harm to nature. It's bound to take years to bring that water ashore for public use in a big way, if it's even feasible.",
      "Why try? In just five years, the U.N. says, the global demand for fresh water will exceed supplies by 40%. Rising sea levels from the warming climate are souring coastal freshwater sources while data centers that power AI and cloud computing are consuming water at an insatiable rate.",
      "The fabled Ancient Mariner\u2019s lament, \u201cWater, water, every where, nor any drop to drink,\u201d looms as a warning to landlubbers as well as to sailors on salty seas.",
      "In Virginia alone, a quarter of all power produced in the state goes to data centers, a share expected to nearly double in five years. By some estimates, each midsize data center consumes as much water as 1,000 households. Each of the Great Lakes states has experienced groundwater shortages.",
      "Cape Town, South Africa, came perilously close to running out of fresh water for its nearly 5 million people in 2018 during an epic, three-year drought. South Africa is thought to have a coastal undersea freshwater bonanza, too, and there is at least anecdotal evidence that every continent may have the same.",
      "Canada's Prince Edward Island, Hawaii and Jakarta, Indonesia, are among places where stressed freshwater supplies coexist with prospective aquifers under the ocean.",
      "Enter Expedition 501, a $25 million scientific collaboration of more than a dozen countries backed by the U.S. government's National Science Foundation and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (U.S. money for it was secured before budget cuts sought by the Trump administration).",
      "Scientists went into the project believing the undersea aquifer they were sampling might be sufficient to meet the needs of a metropolis the size of New York City for 800 years. They found fresh or nearly fresh water at both higher and lower depths below the seafloor than they anticipated, suggesting a larger supply even than that.",
      "Their work at sea unfolded over three months from Liftboat Robert, an oceangoing vessel that, once on site, lowers three enormous pillars to the seafloor and squats above the waves. Normally it services offshore petroleum sites and wind farms. This drill-baby-drill mission was different.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s known that this phenomena exists both here and elsewhere around the world,\u201d Expedition 501 project manager Jez Everest, a scientist who came from the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, Scotland, said of undersea water. \u201cBut it\u2019s a subject that\u2019s never been directly investigated by any research project in the past.\u201d",
      "By that, he means no one globally had drilled systematically into the seabed on a mission to find freshwater. Expedition 501 was quite literally groundbreaking \u2014 it penetrated Earth below the sea by as many as 1,289 feet or nearly 400 meters.",
      "But it followed a 2015 research project that mapped contours of an aquifer remotely, using electromagnetic technology, and roughly estimated salinity of the water underneath.",
      "That mission, by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, reported evidence of a \u201cmassive offshore aquifer system\u201d in this area, possibly rivalling the size of America\u2019s largest \u2014 the Ogallala aquifer, which supplies water to parts of eight Great Plains states.",
      "Two developments in 1976 had stirred interest in searching for undersea freshwater.",
      "In the middle of Nantucket island, the U.S. Geological Survey drilled a test well to see how far down the groundwater went. It extracted fresh water from such great depths that it made scientists wonder if the water came from the sea, not the sky.",
      "The same year, that federal agency mounted a 60-day expedition aboard the drilling vessel Glomar Conception along a vast stretch of the Continental Shelf from Georgia to Georges Bank off New England. It drilled cores in search of the sub-seabed's resources, like methane.",
      "It found an eye-opening amount of fresh or freshened water in borehole after borehole.",
      "That set the stage for the water-seekers to do their work a half-century later.",

      "Soon after Robert arrived at the first of three drilling sites May 19, samples drawn from below the seabed registered salinity of just 4 parts per thousand. That's far below the oceans' average salt content of 35 parts per thousand but still too briny to meet the U.S. freshwater standard of under 1 part per thousand.",
      "\u201cFour parts per thousand was a eureka moment,\" Dugan said, because the finding suggested that the water must have been connected to a terrestrial system in the past, or still is.",
      "As the weeks wore on and Robert moved from site to site 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) off the coast, the process of drilling into the waterlogged subsea sediment yielded a collection of samples down to 1 part per thousand salt content. Some were even lower.",
      "Bingo. That's what you find in many bodies of fresh water on land. That's water you can drink, in theory. No one did.",
      "In months of analysis ahead, the scientists will investigate a range of properties of the water, including what microbes were living in the depths, what they used for nutrients and energy sources and what byproducts they might generate; in other words, whether the water is safe to consume or otherwise use.",
      "\u201cThis is a new environment that has never been studied before,\u201d said Jocelyne DiRuggiero, a Johns Hopkins University biologist in Baltimore who studies the microbial ecology of extreme environments and is not involved in the expedition.",
      "\u201cThe water may contain minerals detrimental to human health since it percolated through layers of sediments,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, a similar process forms the terrestrial aquifers that we use for freshwater, and those typically have very high quality.\u201d",
      "By sequencing DNA extracted from their samples, she said, the researchers can determine which microorganisms are there and \u201clearn how they potentially make a living.\u201d",
      "Techniques will also be used to determine whether it came from glacial ice melt thousands of years ago or is still coming via labyrinthian geologic formations from land.",
      "Researchers will date the water back in the lab, and that will be key in determining whether it is a renewable resource that could be used responsibly. Primordial water is trapped and finite; newer water suggests the aquifer is still connected to a terrestrial source and being refreshed, however slowly.",
      "\u201cYounger means it was a raindrop 100 years ago, 200 years ago,\u201d Dugan said. \u201cIf young, it\u2019s recharging.\u201d",
      "Those questions are for basic science. For society, all sorts of complex questions arise if the basic science affirms the conditions necessary for exploiting the water. Who will manage it? Can it be taken without an unacceptable risk of contaminating the supply from the ocean above? Will it be cheaper or environmentally friendlier than today's energy-hungry desalination plants?",
      "Dugan said if governments decide to get the water, local communities could turn to the aquifers in time of need, such as drought, or when extreme storms flood coastal freshwater reserves and ruin them. The notion of actually using this old buried water is so new that it has not been on the radar of many policymakers or conservationists.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lesson in how long it can take sometimes to make these things happen and the perseverance that\u2019s needed to get there,\" said Woods Hole geophysicist Rob Evans, whose 2015 expedition helped point the way for 501. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of excitement that finally they\u2019ve got samples.\"",
      "Still, he sees some red flags. One is that tapping undersea aquifers could draw water away from onshore reserves. Another is that undersea groundwater that seeps out to the seafloor may supply nutrients vital to the ecosystem, and that could be upset.",
      "\"If we were to go out and start pumping these waters, there would almost certainly be unforeseen consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of balance we would need to consider before we started diving in and drilling and exploiting these kinds of things.\u201d",
      "For most in the project, getting to and from Liftboat Robert meant a voyage of seven hours or more from Fall River, Massachusetts, on a supply boat that made round trips every 10 days or so to replenish stocks and rotate people.",
      "On the platform, around the clock, the racket of metal bore pipes and machinery, the drilling grime and the speckled mud mingled with the quieter, cleaner work of scientists in trailers converted to pristine labs and processing posts.",
      "There, samples were treated according to the varying needs of the expedition\u2019s geologists, geochemists, hydrologists, microbiologists, sedimentologists and more.",
      "Passing through clear plastic tubes, muck was sliced into disks like hockey pucks. Machines squeezed water out. Some samples were kept sealed to enable study of ancient gases dissolved in the water. Other samples were frozen, filtered or left as is, depending on the purpose.",
      "After six months of lab analysis, all the science teams of Expedition 501 will meet again \u2014 this time in Germany for a month of collaborative research that is expected to produce initial findings that point to the age and origin of the water.",
      "On July 31, Liftboat Robert cranked up its legs from this place of hidden water to end a mission that lent credence to another passage from \u201cThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" Samuel Taylor Coleridge's classic poem about life, death and mysteries at sea.",

      "The report, released Friday by House Republicans on the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, argues the projects have allowed China to exploit U.S. research partnerships for military gains while the two countries are locked in a tech and arms rivalry.",
      "\u201cAmerican taxpayer dollars should be used to defend the nation \u2014 not strengthen its foremost strategic competitor,\u201d Republicans wrote in the report.",
      "\u201cFailing to safeguard American research from hostile foreign exploitation will continue to erode U.S. technological dominance and place our national defense capabilities at risk,\" it said.",
      "The Pentagon didn't immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment. Beijing has in the past said science and technological cooperation between the two countries is mutually beneficial and helps the two sides cope with global challenges.",
      "The congressional report said some officials at the Defense Department argued research should remain open as long as it is \u201cneither controlled nor classified.\u201d",
      "The report makes several recommendations to scale back U.S. research collaboration with China. It also backs new legislation proposed by the committee's chairman, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Michigan. The bill would prohibit any Defense Department funding from going to projects done in collaboration with researchers affiliated with Chinese entities that the U.S. government identifies as safety risks.",
      "The 80-page report builds on the committee's findings last year that partnerships between U.S. and Chinese universities over the past decade allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to help Beijing develop critical technology. Amid pressure from Republicans, several U.S. universities have ended their joint programs with Chinese schools in recent years.",
      "The new report focuses more narrowly on the Defense Department and its billions of dollars in annual research funding.",
      "The committee's investigation identified 1,400 research papers published between June 2023 and June 2025 that acknowledged support from the Pentagon and were done in collaboration with Chinese partners. The publications were funded by some 700 defense grants worth more than $2.5 billion. Of the 1,400 publications, more than half involved organizations affiliated with China's defense research and industrial base.",
      "Dozens of those organizations were flagged for potential security concerns on U.S. government lists, though federal law does not prohibit research collaborations with them. The Defense Department money supported research in fields including hypersonic technology, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, advanced materials and next-generation propulsion.",

      "As learning went online, special programs to engage girls lapsed \u2014 and schools were slow to restart them. Zoom school also emphasized rote learning, a technique based on repetition that some experts believe may favor boys, instead of teaching students to solve problems in different ways, which may benefit girls.",

      "In most school districts in the 2008-2009 school year, boys had higher average math scores on standardized tests than girls, according to AP's analysis, which looked at scores across 15 years in over 5,000 school districts. It was based on average test scores for third through eighth graders in 33 states, compiled by the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University.",
      "A decade later, girls had not only caught up, they were ahead: Slightly more than half of districts had higher math averages for girls.",
      "Within a few years of the pandemic, the parity disappeared. In 2023-2024, boys on average outscored girls in math in nearly nine out of 10 districts.",
      "A separate study by NWEA, an education research company, found gaps between boys and girls in science and math on national assessments went from being practically non-existent in 2019 to favoring boys around 2022.",
      "Studies have indicated girls reported higher levels of anxiety and depression during the pandemic, plus more caretaking burdens than boys, but the dip in academic performance did not appear outside STEM. Girls outperformed boys in reading in nearly every district nationwide before the pandemic and continued to do so afterward.",

      "When STEM courses had large male enrollment, Superintendent Kenny Rodrequez noticed girls losing interest as boys dominated classroom discussions at his schools in Grandview C-4 District outside Kansas City.

      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government\u2019s attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \u201canswer engines\u201d as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google\u2019s long-held position as the internet\u2019s main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by AI also reshaped the judge\u2019s approach to the remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration and carried onward by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "\u201cUnlike the typical case where the court\u2019s job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge\u2019s forte,\u201d Mehta wrote.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services. The ruling also will pry open some of the prized databases of closely guarded information about search that have provided Google with a seemingly insurmountable advantage.",
      "The handcuffs being slapped on Google will preclude contracts that give its search engine, Gemini AI app, Play Store for Android and virtual assistant an exclusive position on smartphone, personal computers and other devices.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google\u2019s search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \u201cwould be incredibly messy and highly risky.\u201d",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine\u2019s secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results. That is a measure that Google had also fiercely opposed, contending it was unfair and would raise privacy and security risk for the billions of people who have posed questions to its search engine \u2014 sometimes delving into sensitive issues.",
      "The Justice Department's antitrust chief, Gail Slater, hailed the decision as a \u201cmajor win for the American people,\u201d even though the agency didn't get everything it sought. \u201cWe are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough,\u201d Slater wrote in a post.",
      "In its own post, Google framed Mehta's ruling as a vindication of its long-held position that the case never should have been brought. The decision \u201crecognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information,\u201d wrote Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \u201cThis underlines what we\u2019ve been saying since this case was filed in 2020: Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want.\u201d",
      "The Mountain View, California, company has already vowed to appeal the judge\u2019s monopoly findings issued 13 months ago that led to Tuesday's ruling.",

That would translate into a nearly $200 billion increase in Alphabet's market value, if the shares follow a similar trajectory in Wednesday's regular trading session.",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It\u2019s also a win for Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and other recipients of the payments.",

      "That dire prospect prompted a New Zealand nature lover who found the snail in her garden in August to launch a campaign to find his perfect match. But Ned\u2019s quest for true love, perhaps predictably, is slow.",
      "Giselle Clarkson was weeding her home vegetable patch in Wairarapa on the North Island when a snail tumbling out of the leafy greens caught her eye.

      "The magazine launched a nationwide campaign to find a mate for Ned, named for the left-handed character Ned Flanders in \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d who once opened a store called The Leftorium. That explains the male pronouns some use for Ned, although snails are hermaphrodites with sex organs on their necks and the capacity for both eggs and sperm.",

      "The fact that romantic hopefuls need not be a sex match should have boosted Ned\u2019s prospects. But his inbox has remained empty except for photos of \u201coptimistically misidentified right-coiling snails,\" Clarkson said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of enthusiasm and encouragement for Ned, a lot of people who can relate and really want the best for them, as a symbol of hope for everyone who\u2019s looking for love,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as yet, no lefties have been forthcoming.\u201d",
      "Ned\u2019s relatable romantic woes have attracted global news coverage, but New Zealand\u2019s strict biosecurity controls mean long-distance love probably isn\u2019t on the cards.

      "A quest to find left-coiled mates for Jeremy prompted the discovery of two prospective matches, who initially preferred each other. But Jeremy got the hang of it eventually, and by the time of his death had 56 offspring \u2014 all of them right-coiled.",
      "It was a fascinating chance for scientists to investigate what produces left-coiled snails, with the cause most likely a rare genetic mutation. Studies of snail farms in Europe prompted researchers to estimate about 1 in every 40,000 snails is a lefty.",

      "A new online platform called wplace invites users to \u201cpaint the world\u201d on a massive digital canvas",
      "NEW YORK -- In one new corner of the internet, users are invited to \u201cpaint the world.\u201d And paint they have. Welcome to wplace \u2014 an ever-evolving, gamified global map overflowing with drawings made on a more than 4-trillion-pixel canvas.",
      "Images of Icelandic singer Laufey float over Reykjav\u00edk, while tributes for the late Tejano singer Selena Quintanilla surround Corpus Christi, Texas. The crest of San Lorenzo and other soccer clubs fill Buenos Aires. \u201cSquid Game\u201d fanart can be found on the outskirts of Seoul. And Walter White's opening monologue from \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d sits near Albuquerque, New Mexico.",
      "Wplace launched July 21, but the artwork is already overwhelming \u2014 ranging from simple stick figures and thin-lettered words, to colorful fanart and highly detailed images users build under online pseudonyms.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wild, and chaotic and crude,\u201d said Yotam Ophir, a University at Buffalo professor of communication whose research includes analyzing digital spaces. That's part of wplace's appeal, he added, describing the site as a somewhat of a \u201crebellion\u201d against what the internet has become.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to break Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s kind of a reminder that things can be done differently.\u201d",
      "Wplace has garnered more than 10.6 million users worldwide as of Thursday, co-founder Enzo Watanabe told The Associated Press. With that explosion in just over a month, moderation challenges have arisen. Watanabe said via email that the project\u2019s growth \u201cexceeded all expectations\u201d \u2014 but acknowledged that \u201cadjusting to the high demand has been challenging.\u201d",
      "The game was developed in Brazil over three months by a single person, he said, and is now run by a team of 46, in addition to volunteers.",
      "New users begin with a small, fixed number of pixels, and more become available every 30 seconds. The more you contribute, the more pixels are available to you \u2014 sort of \u201clike a leveling system\u201d seen in video games, said Moira Hembns, a 19-year-old user from Edmonton, Alberta.",
      "Even with bigger pools of pixels, it can take a lot of time to bring map paintings to life. \u201cEvery art piece takes me hours to design in advance,\u201d said Hembns. One drawing she recently finished, of a Pok\u00e9mon named Leafeon in her hometown, took her two days to design outside of wplace \u2014 and then another day to build in it, she said.",
      "But Hembns notes that she loves art, and checks the map and places pixels almost every morning now. Muhammad Aliy Fattah bin Yusrizal, a 21-year-old from Malaysia, similarly says wplace has become an outlet for his creativity.",
      "The site \u201cis one of the places that I can express myself,\u201d Fattah said, noting he's mostly contributed art dedicated to his favorite video games and placed atop his home country.",
      "Users from around the world also team up to bring larger projects to life \u2014 like \u201cThe Neighborhood,\u201d which sits in a corner of Yuma County, Arizona. Real-life resident Krista Rider, 25, started by drawing two homes. It now has over 50, connected by paths, patches of grass and rivers.",
      "\u201cI wanted to do something nice that could lift people up, give them something that they feel like they\u2019re contributing to, whether it\u2019s big or small,\u201d Rider said.",
      "Much of wplace's spaces are filled with an endless array of pop culture references \u2014 often intertwined with symbols of local and national identity, protest and other reflections of daily life seen worldwide. In his own time scrolling through wplace's map, Ophir notes he's seen anything from small towns highlighting a restaurant they love, to tributes to local musicians, to broader imagery of political tensions and global conflicts.",
      "\u201cIn a way, every person is zooming in on what reflects them and who they are,\u201d Ophir said.",
      "Above Gaza, users have painted Palestinian flags and messages of solidarity amid Israel's ongoing war. Images of war are also seen on the border between Russia and Ukraine \u2014 some use their pixels to depict military tanks or planes, while others write messages calling for peace. Washington, D.C., is covered with political messages, many of which focus on President Donald Trump.",
      "Carly Kocurek, associate dean of Lewis College of Science and Letters at Illinois Tech and director of the school\u2019s game design program, says there's a long history of \u201cdigital spaces as a places for protest.\u201d",

      "With the resources required to meet erupting demand, some question whether wplace should keep accepting new submissions forever.",
      "\u201cI definitely don\u2019t want it to stay around forever, because I think it\u2019ll just fall apart if it does,\u201d Hembns said, noting wplace could perhaps create a snapshot capturing the map so far \u2014 or pause and open future contributions later, similar to a predecessor, Reddit's now-retired r/place.",
      "Watanabe on Thursday told the AP wplace intends \u201cto continue welcoming new contributions,\u201d as well as host in-platform events.",
      "Regardless of wplace's future, experts like Lingel expect pockets of artistic collaboration to continue emerging online \u2014 even they don't attract as much attention.",

      "Philipos Melaku-Bello, a volunteer who has manned the vigil for years, told The Associated Press that the Park Police removed it early Sunday morning. He said officials justified the removal by mislabeling the memorial as a shelter.",
      "\u201cThe difference between an encampment and a vigil is that an encampment is where homeless people live,\u201d Melaku-Bello said. \u201cAs you can see, I don't have a bed. I have signs and it is covered by the First Amendment right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression.\u201d",

      "Some history teachers are concerned about what may come of a White House review of the Smithsonian's public-facing content",
      "High school history teacher Katharina Matro often pulls materials from the Smithsonian Institution website as she assembles her lessons. She trusts its materials, which don't require the same level of vetting as other online resources. She uses documents and other primary sources it curates for discussions of topics like genocide and slavery.",
      "As the White House presses for changes at the Smithsonian, she's worried she may not be able to rely on it in the same way.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want a partisan history,\" said Matro, a teacher in Bethesda, Maryland. \"We want the history that\u2019s produced by real historians.\u201d",
      "Far beyond museums in Washington, President Donald Trump's review at the Smithsonian could influence how history is taught in classrooms around the country. The institution is a leading provider of curriculum and other educational materials, which are subject to the sweeping new assessment of all its public-facing content.",
      "Trump is moving to bring the Smithsonian into alignment with his vision of American history. In a letter last month to the Smithsonian Institution, the White House said its review is meant to \u201cassess tone, historical framing, and alignment with American ideals.\u201d It\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s agenda to \u201ccelebrate American exceptionalism\u201d by removing \u201cdivisive or partisan narratives,\u201d it said.",
      "Those opposed to the changes fear they will promote a more sanitized version of American history.",
      "In celebration of the country\u2019s 250th anniversary next year, the Education Department recently launched the White House's Founders Museum in partnership with PragerU, a conservative nonprofit that produces videos on politics and history. Visitors to the museum in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, as well as the White House website, can read biographies on the signers of the Declaration of Independence and watch videos that depict them speaking.",
      "\u201cReal patriotic education means that just as our founders loved and honored America, so we should honor them,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a PragerU video introducing the project.",
      "The project mentions some signers favoring abolition and includes Phillis Wheatley, an enslaved woman who became the first published Black female poet in the U.S. But critics say it brushes over some of the nation\u2019s darker past.",
      "\u201cThose are the kinds of things that teachers are really leery of because they don't see partisanship in the sources that we're using as being good educational practice,\u201d said Tina Ellsworth, president of the National Council for the Social Studies.",
      "Like many other history teachers, Matro said she turns to materials from the Smithsonian because she doesn't have the time to create lessons from scratch or the budget to buy the latest books. She favors the museum's digitized collections to guide her classes.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have to figure out \u2018is this real? Is this not real?\u2019 I can trust the descriptions of the artifact,\u201d she said.",
      "More than 80% of history teachers report using free resources from federal museums, archives and institutions including the Smithsonian, according to an American Historical Association survey last year.",
      "The federal institutions' materials have been widely trusted partly because they are thoroughly examined by professionals, said Brendan Gillis, the historical association's director of teaching and learning. Some teachers have out-of-date history textbooks, and online resources from institutions like the Smithsonian can fill the gaps, he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s been one of the most influential and profoundly important ways that the federal government has invested in social studies education over the last couple of decades,\u201d Gillis said.",
      "While education always has been part of the Smithsonian's mission, developing materials specifically for classrooms became more prevalent after World War II, said William Walker, a State University of New York, Oneonta, professor who has researched the Smithsonian\u2019s history.

      "Lawmakers from Louisiana \u2014 a red state that surrounds politically blue New Orleans \u2014 said it was a great idea for National Guard troops to go there next.",
      "\"New Orleans, like most Democrat-run cities, has a high crime rate, so it would be helpful,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told The Associated Press.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., agreed: \u201cWe need all the help we can get. I\u2019m delighted to bring in the National Guard.\u201d",
      "Republicans have in recent years found political success focusing on the issue of crime. The vast majority of Americans, 81%, see crime as a \u201cmajor problem\u201d in large cities, according to recent polling from the The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That includes nearly all Republicans, roughly three-quarters of independents and nearly 7 in 10 Democrats.",
      "However, statistics show overall crime is down across the nation, with some cities reporting 30-year lows.",

      "Notable examples include the 1894 Pullman strike in Chicago, during the Civil Rights era to enforce desegregation in the South, and in 1992 during deadly rioting after police officers brutally beat motorist Rodney King and were acquitted on state charges.",

      "Experts say that Trump's crime mission stands out because he's not responding to a particular crisis. Instead, Trump is using the military to implement his domestic policies, whether that means using military aircraft for deportation flights, beefing up military at the U.S.-Mexico border or ordering National Guard troops to be ready for law enforcement duties.",
      "\u201cAll of these things indicate an administration that is making a broad, concerted effort to insert the military into civilian law enforcement in a way and on a scale that has no precedent in American history,\u201d said Joseph Nunn, an attorney at the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program.",

      "Congress under its constitutional duties has laid out laws that govern when and how the National Guard can be deployed domestically. But as Trump has pushed the limits of those laws, the Republican-controlled Congress has stood by. Instead, it's been left to the courts to put any guardrails on Trump's maximalist approach to the presidency.",
      "A federal judge ruled last week that the Trump administration \u201cwillfully\u201d broke the Posse Comitatus Act, a nearly 150-year-old federal law that limits the U.S. military\u2019s role in domestic law enforcement, when he sent National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area in early June after days of protests over immigration raids. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco noted Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have stated they intend to deploy National Guard troops to other cities across the country, raising concerns they're \u201ccreating a national police force with the President as its chief.\u201d",
      "That sort of use of the National Guard was just what the writers of the Constitution were trying to guard against, said Andrew Wiest, co-founder of the Center for the Study of the National Guard at the University of Southern Mississippi.",
      "The young nation had just endured a war of independence that was sparked by a British military acting as a police force on the colony, and its early leaders were reticent to give the president too much control over the military. Since then, presidents have increasingly exercised more power over the troops that started as state-based militias.",
      "\u201cThis is another one of those pendulum moments where the Guard will become more federal or maybe it will swing back in the other direction,\" Wiest said. \u201cBut since the founding of the Republic, it\u2019s been swinging towards the federal side.\u201d",

      "Republicans are moving to change the rules of the Senate to approve more of President Donald Trump's nominees",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader John Thune says he\u2019s ready to change the chamber\u2019s rules to allow quick confirmations of dozens of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive branch nominees, moving this week to speed up votes after months of Democratic delays.",
      "Thune says he\u2019ll start the process of changing the rules when the Senate goes into session on Monday afternoon, with a final vote likely coming later this week. \u201cWe must return to the Senate\u2019s traditional confirmation process that existed before this unprecedented blockade,\u201d Thune said in an op-ed published on Breitbart.com Monday morning.",
      "Republicans have been talking about options for changing the rules since early August, when the Senate left for a monthlong recess after a breakdown in bipartisan negotiations over the confirmation process. Democrats have blocked nearly every single one of Trump\u2019s nominees, forcing majority Republicans to spend valuable floor time on procedural votes and leaving many positions in the executive branch unfilled.",
      "The changes come after both parties have escalated their obstruction of the other party\u2019s nominees for years, and as leaders in both parties have incrementally changed the rules to make the process less bipartisan. The proposal to group nominations is loosely based on legislation introduced by Democrats two years ago as Republicans blocked many of then-President Joe Biden\u2019s picks.",
      "But while Senate Republicans forced similar delays during Biden\u2019s administration, Democrats have blocked almost all of Trump\u2019s nominations. It\u2019s the first time in recent history that the minority party hasn\u2019t allowed at least some quick confirmations.",
      "\u201cDemocrats have made President Donald Trump the first president on record to not have a single nominee confirmed via voice vote or unanimous consent, and they are forcing time-consuming votes on noncontroversial nominees who go on to be confirmed by large bipartisan margins,\u201d Thune said in the op-ed.",
      "The delays have infuriated Trump, who told Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to \u201cGO TO HELL!\u201d in a social media post after negotiations broke down over the process in early August.",

      "Thune has not yet said how they will change the rules, but Republicans said last week that the leading option was to allow votes on large groups of nominees at once if a majority of senators agree. Currently, one senator\u2019s objection can force days of votes on a single nominee.",
      "If Republicans act quickly, they could confirm more than 100 of Trump\u2019s pending nominations as soon as this week. The rules change is expected to only apply to executive branch nominations, not lifetime judicial appointments, and would exclude the most high-profile positions, such as Cabinet nominees, that require a longer debate time. Some others could also be excluded, such as nominees that are particularly controversial.",
      "The process to change the rules will likely require several floor votes and the support of a simple majority, so at least 51 out of the chamber\u2019s 53 Republicans. But most GOP senators appear to be on board.",
      "The change will be the latest salvo in years of intensifying standoffs over presidential nominations. In 2013, Democrats changed Senate rules for executive branch and lower court judicial nominees to remove the 60-vote threshold for confirmations as Republicans blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s picks. In 2017, Republicans did the same for Supreme Court nominees as Democrats tried to block Trump\u2019s nomination of Justice Neil Gorsuch.",
      "Democrats have said the rules change would be a mistake, especially as Senate Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass spending bills and other legislation moving forward.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said last week that Republicans\u2019 proposed plan \u201cguts the Senate\u2019s constitutional role of advice and consent, weakens our checks and balances, and guarantees that historically bad nominees will only get worse with even less oversight.\u201d",

      "Norwich police\u2019s all-electric Chevy BrightDrop van debuted in early August, with about 90% of the $43,000 cost coming from donations from area businesses and contributors, and the rest from the city. Some departments have used tax revenue from legal marijuana sales and property seizures to fund their ice cream operations.",
      "On a recent day, Norwich's van stopped at a local school where children were participating in sports camps. It was a hit as officers handed out ice cream sandwiches, bubble gum-flavored pops and Italian ices.",
      "\u201cInstead of seeing people in jail, they\u2019re seeing kids be happy,\u201d said 11-year-old Rozzy Constant, who opted for the bubble gum pop.",

      "Like Norwich, many departments' ice cream truck programs are funded by donations, and the treats they hand out for free are often provided to them at no charge by local businesses like grocery stores and ice cream shops. Norwich police list 20 sponsors on their truck.",

      "In Chicopee, Massachusetts, police paid for theirs with assets seized during criminal arrests.

      "In partnership with the HP Hood ice cream company, whose half vanilla and half chocolate ice cream cups are iconic in New England, the city began \u201cOperation Hoodsie Cup\u201d in 2010.

      "President Donald Trump attended the U.S. Open on Sunday, drawing boos from the crowd",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump was loudly booed at the men's final of the U.S. Open on Sunday, where extra security caused by his visit led to lines long enough that many people missed the start of play, even after organizers delayed it.",
      "Wearing a suit and long, red tie, Trump briefly emerged from his suite about 45 minutes before the match started and heard a mix of boos and cheers from an Arthur Ashe Stadium that was still mostly empty. No announcement proceeded his appearance, and it was brief enough that some in the crowd missed it.",
      "Trump appeared again to more boos before the National Anthem. Standing in salute, the president was shown briefly on the arena's big screens during the anthem, and offered a smirk that briefly made the boos louder.",
      "When the anthem was over, the Republican pointed to a small group of supporters seated nearby, then sat on the suite's balcony to watch the match intently. He mostly didn't applaud, even following major points that energized the rest of the crowd as Spain's Carlos Alcaraz bested Jannik Sinner of Italy.",
      "Trump was shown on the big screen again after the first set ended, and elicited a roar of louder boos and some piercing whistles. He raised his left fist in salute as the noise continued in the stadium, which with a capacity of 24,000 is one of the largest in tennis.",
      "The president later moved back inside the suite, where he was seen seated at a table with family members and appeared to be eating, but he was back in his seat shortly before match point. Cameras briefly flashed on Trump as Alcaraz celebrated, but his reaction to the conclusion was as muted as it had been throughout most of the match. This time, there was little crowd reaction, too.",
      "Organizers pushed the start of the match back half an hour to give people more time to pass through enhanced screening checkpoints reminiscent of security at airports. Still, thousands of increasingly frustrated fans remained in line outside as the match got underway. Many seats, especially those in upper rows, stayed empty for nearly an hour.",

      "The court has blocked off four weeks for the trial of Ryan Routh, but attorneys are expecting they\u2019ll need less time.",
      "Jury selection is expected to take three days, with attorneys questioning three sets of 60 prospective jurors. They\u2019re trying to find 12 jurors and four alternates. Opening statements are scheduled to begin Thursday, and prosecutors will begin their case immediately after that.",

She also explained to Routh that he would be allowed to use a podium while speaking to the jury or questioning witnesses, but he would not have free rein of the courtroom.",
      "The trial will begin nearly a year after prosecutors say a U.S. Secret Service agent thwarted Routh's attempt to shoot the Republican presidential nominee. Routh, 59, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations.",

      "In 2010, police searched a warehouse Routh owned and found more than 100 stolen items, from power tools and building supplies to kayaks and spa tubs. In both felony cases, judges gave Routh either probation or a suspended sentence.",

      "About two dozen local governments in South Carolina have passed their own hate crime ordinances as the latest attempt to put pressure on the South Carolina Senate to take a vote on a bill proposing stiffer penalties for crimes driven by hatred of the victims because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, gender or ethnicity.",
      "A decade of pressure from businesses, the survivors of a racist Charleston church massacre that left nine dead, and a few of their own Republicans hasn't been enough to sway senators.",
      "Richland County, where McKenzie lives, has a hate crime ordinance and the white man seen on security camera footage grabbing the rifle and firing through his open car window before driving into his neighborhood on July 24 is the first to face the charge.",
      "But local laws are restricted to misdemeanors with sentences capped at a month in jail. The state hate crimes proposal backed by business leaders could add years on to convictions for assault and other violent crimes.",
      "McKenzie sat in the same spot at the edge of his neighborhood for a year at 5:30 a.m. waiting for his supervisor to pick him up for work. For him and his family, every trip outside now is met with uneasiness if not fear.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to know that I get up every morning. I stand there not knowing if he had seen me before,\u201d McKenzie said.",
      "The lack of a statewide hate crime law rapidly became a sore spot in South Carolina after the 2015 shooting deaths of nine Black worshippers at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. After a summer of racial strife in 2020, business leaders made it a priority and the South Carolina House passed its version in 2021.",
      "But in 2021 and again in the next session in 2023, the proposal stalled in the South Carolina Senate without a vote. Supporters say Republican Senate leadership knows it will pass as more moderate members of their own party support it but they keep it buried on the calendar with procedural moves.",
      "The opposition is done mostly in silence and the bill gets only mentioned in passing as the Senate takes up other items, like in May 2023 when a debate on guidelines for history curriculum on subjects like slavery and segregation briefly had a longtime Democratic lawmaker ask Republican Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey why hate crimes couldn't get a vote.",
      "\u201cThe problem right now is there is a number of people who think that not only is it feel good legislation, but it is bad legislation. It is bad policy not because people support hate but because it furthers division,\u201d Massey responded on the Senate floor.",

      "As President Donald Trump signals plans to order federal intervention in Chicago, experts say the likely escalation of immigration enforcement operations is setting the stage for a contentious dynamic between local police and federal authorities",
      "CHICAGO -- As President Donald Trump threatens to expand immigration raids and deploy the National Guard, Chicago has become the latest flashpoint in a broader national struggle over how far the federal government can push local authorities to cooperate with its immigration agenda.",
      "For the Chicago Police Department, the challenge is acute. The force must preserve public safety in a city already under strain while avoiding the appearance of working hand-in-hand with federal immigration authorities, a stance that could erode community trust and ignite new protests.",
      "The same balancing act has confronted other big-city departments in recent months. Local police in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., were drawn into fraught arrangements with federal agencies that experts say left residents wary and, at times, undermined public confidence in their police.",
      "Now, Chicago finds itself on the same path, with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker objecting to any National Guard deployment and city officials bracing for how the added federal presence could reshape the dynamic on the ground. The outcome, policing experts warn, may determine whether Chicago police can maintain credibility in immigrant communities likely to be targeted by a president determined to show force.",
      "\u201cWhat the Trump administration is doing here is engaging in federal policing in a way that really rips at the seams of the relationships between state and local police and the federal government, between communities and law enforcement,\u201d said Nayna Gupta, policy director at American Immigration Council. \u201cThose kinds of standoffs and contentious practices is what erodes public safety.\u201d",
      "Over the course of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration surges, Chicago officials repeatedly reaffirmed the city's so-called sanctuary policies that have been place for four decades. But as fear grew about looming U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions, the city's mayor has avoided detail about how local police will navigate tensions on the ground.",
      "Chicago\u2019s policies bar local law enforcement from asking about or detaining someone for their immigration status or from supporting ICE, including by securing perimeters for raids, transporting detainees or sharing information about undocumented immigrants.",
      "Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order last week declaring city police would not collaborate with federal immigration agents. It also requires Chicago officers to wear uniforms and not wear masks to \u201cclearly distinguish them from federal agents.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not have our police officers who are working hard every single day to drive down crime deputized to do traffic stops and checkpoints for the president,\u201d Johnson said before signing the order.",
      "Craig Futterman, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said any cooperation between ICE and local officers hurts public trust and blurs the lines between agencies.",
      "\u201cIt can get really messy,\u201d Futterman said. \u201cThere\u2019s how sanctuary cities are supposed to work on paper vs. what happens in practice.\u201d",
      "Gupta said Chicago police will have to coordinate with federal agencies to some degree, even to respond to protests against immigration raids and detentions.",
      "In the meantime, city officials say they're following a similar strategy to policing as the one in place around the 2024 Democratic National Convention, which cost the city about $27 million in officer overtime.",
      "ICE detained at least 10 Chicagoans at an immigration office on June 4, drawing dozens of protesters and local elected officials to the street outside. Police didn't originally know it was an immigration action and left after realizing that, officials said.",
      "Some protesters and local elected officials claimed they saw Chicago officers clearing the way for ICE agents and protecting their vehicles. Chicago City Council members demanded an internal probe into officers\u2019 behavior.",
      "Similar tensions played out in California, where hundreds of protesters clashed with federal immigration authorities in June, prompting Trump to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, despite the objections of local authorities.",

      "On Thursday, the District of Columbia sued to stop President Donald Trump\u2019s deployment of National Guard during his law enforcement intervention there.",
      "\u201cAs far as the National Guard as police, they have traditionally assisted in natural disasters, large scale disturbances and aiding law enforcement in support functions like traffic and crowd control,\" Wexler said. \"I don\u2019t recall the National Guard being deployed to deal directly with day-to-day crime issues.\u201d",
      "Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling has asked for more communication from federal authorities so \u201cwe don't have people running scared and it doesn\u2019t create chaos on our streets.\u201d",
      "In Philadelphia, District Attorney Larry Krasner says the Trump administration's use of the National Guard is a threat to successful prosecutions of crime, risking witness statements being thrown out and evidence suppressed.",
      "\u201cNone of these people are trained in evidence gathering procedures,\" Krasner said. \"None of them are trained in Miranda warnings. None of them are trained in Fourth Amendment rights and procedures and illegal searches and seizures.\u201d",
      "Kenneth Corey, a former department chief with the New York City Police Department, warned that surging resources like the National Guard leads to an artificial and often temporary reduction in crime.",
      "\u201cAny time you surge resources like that you are going to see an immediate reduction in crime because it has a deterrent effect,\u201d said Corey, who now works at the University of Chicago Crime Lab\u2019s Policing Leadership Academy.",
      "\u201cBut the problem is it\u2019s short-lived. It can\u2019t be sustained. When they leave, crime returns. You haven\u2019t addressed the root causes of crime.\u201d",

The Associated Press and APM Reports in 2020 uncovered new evidence and serious flaws in that investigation, leading to the creation of an independent legal panel to review the case.",

Since his conviction for first-degree murder remained on his record, it was still illegal for him to have a gun.

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "The clothes designed by Giorgio Armani (July 11, 1934-Sept. 4, 2025) very much reflected relaxed elegance \u2013 a supercool attitude that blurred divisions between men's and women's clothing. Forming the Giorgio Armani Company in 1975, he first made menswear, then launched a women's line, one that recut a traditional men's suit jacket.",
      "Armani told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006 that it was a response to the emerging feminist movement; he thought women needed their own sexy version of boardroom attire. \"When I started blending men and women's fashions many years ago, the public often became uneasy and perplexed,\" he said.",
      "Born in Piacenza, Italy, Armani's was a childhood ravaged by World War II, his family's home destroyed by bombs. Though he hadn't dreamed of a career in design, a temporary job in a department store made him realize he had a knack. Rising through the ranks, he worked for designer Nino Cerutti, but lacked formal training of his own.",
      "In 1966, Armani met Sergio Galeotti, an architectural draftsman who became his partner in work and in life. Galeotti encouraged Armani to begin designing on his own.",
      "Armani would put Italian ready-to-wear style on the international fashion map in the late 1970s. His liningless sports jacket, paired with a T-shirt, was an instant success, while his women's pantsuit was revolutionary. He landed on the cover of Time magazine, and his clothes found their way into countless films (including \"American Gigolo\"), and on the red carpet.",
      "After the death of Galeotti in 1985, Armani continued the company, building it into a $10 billion empire encompassing not just fashion but also home design, bars and restaurants, perfumes, cosmetics, and even a basketball team, Olympia Milano.",
      "A perfectionist, Armani would worry about every detail, no matter how small. When asked what he felt when releasing a new collection, Armani replied, \"I am terrified.\""

    "summary": "Nate Bargatze, the highest-grossing stand-up in the U.S., talks about moving back to Nashville, the appeal of being a \"clean comic,\" and hosting the 77th Emmy Awards on CBS.",
    "story": [
      "2024 was a historic year for comedian Nate Bargatze. As the highest-grossing stand-up in the country, he set attendance records at several massive arenas. But a small gymnasium in Nashville \u2013 the home of the Donelson Christian Academy Wildcats \u2013 is where he's recently made his mark. He's donated more than a million dollars to his alma matter, which now features the Nate Bargatze Gymnasium.",
      "Bargatze never played on this court: \"Yeah, I was cut every year from my basketball team,\" he said. \"But now, you know, now they can't cut you!\"",
      "Donelson Christian Academy is a private high school his family could only afford because his father taught here. \"My freshman year, he's assistant coach,\" Bargatze said. \"So that really got it started. When your dad cuts you, it kind of sets the tone for the rest of your high school.\"",
      "Nate's father, Stephen Bargatze, also happens to be a professional magician. Before that, he was a clown. As you might imagine, that provided some inspiration for a career in comedy \u2013 and for some early stand-up material:",
      "\"It's funny, too, when I tell people my dad was a clown. People will just be like 'Ugh, I hate clowns.' Hey, remember that time I just said my dad was a clown?\"",
      "After dropping out of community college, Bargatze moved from Nashville to Chicago, where he honed his style performing for free at small clubs. \"I would never trade it, and I would never go back,\" he said. \"You just didn't know no better. There's nothing better than when you don't know that there's better.\"",
      "He then made the move to New York. But in 2014, just as his stand-up career was taking off, Bargatze made a surprising move back home to Nashville.",
      "Why? \"You know what? I always thought it was the first thing I did that wasn't for me,\" he said. \"I wanted my daughter to grow up in a normal situation, as normal as it can be. And so it was like, 'All right, let's move back.' And when I moved back, I just didn't tell anybody.\"",
      "I asked, \"Were you worried that there was going to be an impression that, like, 'Well, he moved back to Nashville, he's given up'?\"",
      "\"That's why I didn't tell anybody, 'cause I thought they would think I'd quit,\" Bargatze said. \"And I was so scared of that. So, I just didn't say anything.\"",
      "Nobody would ever think that now. Bargatze has since released five hour-long specials, written a New York Times bestselling book, and sold more than a million tickets last year alone.",
      "\"I don't know anything about history. And I can tell, because every history movie I watch, I watch on the edge of my seat. I watched 'Pearl Harbor,' I was as surprised as they were.\"",
      "His next milestone? Hosting the Primetime Emmy Awards next Sunday on CBS.",
      "\"I love show business,\" he said while recording promotional material for the awards. \"I love all of this. And as part of me, I want to do everything. You're just curious to go, like, Well, what is that like? What is that, you know, when you do 'Saturday Night Live'?\u00a0It's like, I want to see the chaos. I want to feel the chaos.\"",
      "Bargatze has hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" twice. [\"I'm as shocked as you are that I'm here,\" he said in his monologue.] His \"Washington's Dream\" sketch became one of the most viral sketches in years:",
      "There's more acting on the horizon. Bargatze just finished filming his first feature, \"The Breadwinner,\" costarring Mandy Moore, set to hit theaters next spring. His character is a bumbling dad \u2013 a role he says is not too dissimilar from his real-life personality. \"We eased into it,\" he said, \"I ain't crying in this movie, I can tell you that. In the movie, I have three daughters and, you know, I have one daughter.\"",
      "\"Oh my gosh, give him the Academy Award right now,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah. Yeah,\" he laughed. \"There's a lot of buzz about it!\"",
      "Bargatze met his wife, Laura, when he was 21; they were coworkers at an Applebee's. As he recounted in the 2017 special \"The Standups,\" \"I went from, like, my mom to her. So, I don't even know what it feels like not to have some lady be like, 'I don't know if I would do that, you know?'\"",
      "Their daughter, Harper, introduces his stand-up specials, which are intentionally family-friendly. He's a clean comic.",
      "\"I love that people when they come to my show, it's, uh, I don't wanna betray that trust,\" he said. \"You can have your kid watch my stand-up and you don't like, if you see 'em have it on, you don't have to be like, 'Whoa, what's going on?'\"",
      "While working clean can be a savvy business decision, it allows one to sell tickets to the widest audience possible. For Bargatze, it's also part of a larger mission. He said, \"You feel like you're being asked to do this and the career that I have. And so, you just gotta trust that, uh, your path is gonna be the path, and just stick with it.\"",
      "I said, \"When you say asked to do this, do you mean in like sort of a religious calling kind of a way?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" he replied. \"You feel \u2013 you know, I feel it's beyond me.\"",
      "With \"Good Clean Funny\" as its mantra, Bargatze's company, Nateland, produces specials, live events, and podcasts featuring other clean comedians. He even has dreams of one day opening his own theme park and movie studio in Nashville.",
      "\"I'm not gonna be able to go to every city in America for the rest of my life,\" he said. \"So, I want to build a place where you can come. And if you and your wife and your kids are 11 and they want to go run off on their own for a second, I want that to happen.\"",
      "To pull off all of his ambitious plans, one of the most successful touring comedians of all time is already plotting the end of his touring days.",
      "\"I'm doing this tour, I plan on doing one more tour after that,\" he said. \"I need to go do movies, and I need to build that world up and learn how to do all of that stuff. So, I'm gonna dive into that aspect of it. I can see myself being and making movies for, like, another 15 years, and then \u2013 if I'm allowed to! I mean, it might all fall apart.\"",
      "These days, during breaks on his grueling tour schedule, Bargatze is able to briefly take his mind off stand-up by playing golf. \"I mean, it's kind of like stand-up,\" he said. \"You're kind of out there on your own. Golf is, uh, you're so much like thinking about what you're doing out there. I realized, like, I can't turn my brain off, so I just need to direct it to something else.\"",
      "Bargatze has a lot to focus on. The day before he hosts the Emmys in Los Angeles, he's performing two back-to-back arena shows in Denver. But he wouldn't have it any other way.",
      "He said, \"I know how to kind of operate in this chaos. And if you pulled me out and gave me a month off, I think I would be like lost right now. Let's keep going. We're in a good groove. You don't want to kind of stop the groove. Yeah, it'll be a lot of stuff. It's a lot of stuff!\"",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 09:37:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A Mike Tyson-Floyd Mayweather fight was announced Thursday. But there are multiple questions surrounding the bout.",
    "story": [
      "The boxing world was hit with a big announcement on Thursday night when former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and former multi-division champion Floyd Mayweather said they\u00a0agreed to a bout to be held in the spring of 2026.",
      "Details on a date, location, television partner and any potential professional sanctioning of the bout were not immediately released, though both Hall-of-Fame boxers appeared excited about the fight in a press release distributed by CSI Sports.",
      "\"I still can't believe Floyd wants to really do this,\" Tyson said in the release. \"It's going to be detrimental to his health, but he wants to do it, so it's signed and it's happening!\"",
      "\"I've been doing this for 30 years and there hasn't been a single fighter that can tarnish my legacy,\" Mayweather said. \"You already know that if I am going to do something, it's going to be big and it's going to be legendary. I'm the best in the business of boxing. This exhibition will give the fans what they want.\"",
      "Coming Soon pic.twitter.com/lSeyrR0BKO",
      "While Mayweather noted that the bout would be an exhibition, meaning it wouldn't be sanctioned by an athletic commission or count toward either fighter's professional record, this was not confirmed by the fight promoters. But the sanctioning of the bout is just one of multiple outstanding questions surrounding this clash between two of the biggest names in boxing history. Below, we'll break down a few others.",
      "Will it be a professional, sanctioned bout?",
      "This is arguably the biggest question surrounding the bout but it's unlikely to be professionally sanctioned, despite the fact that Tyson just fought his first professional fight in 19 years when he lost to Jake Paul last November. Mayweather has had multiple exhibition bouts since retiring in 2017 following a knockout win against Conor McGregor. But he hasn't fought professionally since then, when he left the ring with a perfect 50-0 record. Mayweather indicated that the fight with Tyson will be an exhibition but he did not immediately respond to a CBS News request for further comment.",
      "What weight class would the fight be held in?",
      "This will largely depend on whether the bout is professional or an exhibition. If it's the former, then the boxers will need to agree on a weight limit that they would both be held to. But if it's an exhibition, which seems to be the case, it's likely that both boxers will enter the ring around the weight they last fought at. That means Mayweather would be around the middleweight limit, while Tyson is likely to be around the 220-pound range he often fought at as a champion in the 1980s and 1990s. Tyson tipped the scales at 230 pounds for his fight with Paul 10 months ago.",
      "Would the fight be held under non-standard rules?",
      "Whether it's a pro fight or an exhibition, there may be other, non-standardized rules in play here. Tyson is 59 years old. Mayweather is 48 years old. Boxers in that age range, when they do enter the ring, tend to perform under different rules and regulations. When Tyson fought Paul last fall, for example, the length of the rounds was reduced to two minutes from the standard three. And it was limited to an eight-round fight, when it normally would have been 10 for a non-championship affair. Both boxers also wore heavier gloves in the bout than is the norm, which is likely to be the case for a Tyson-Mayweather affair, too.",
      "Is this a new trend in boxing?",
      "Boxing exhibitions featuring retired champions is nothing new to the sport. Mayweather and former foe Manny Pacquiao have done so multiple times in recent years. While it may not be a boxing purist's preference, it's not unusual.",
      "What is a bit unique, however, is that this will be Tyson's third fight in approximately six years, after retiring from the sport in 2005. He fought an exhibition against former champion Roy Jones, Jr. in 2020 and Paul last November. Paul, meanwhile, who boxed Tyson as a heavyweight, appears to be moving on to his own exhibition fight against former lightweight champion Gervonta Davis, in an another match between boxers in wildly different weight classes. That fight was\u00a0announced for Nov. 14.",

    "story": [
      "Philadelphia \u2014 Jalen Hurts rushed for two touchdowns for the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles, who lost their hot-tempered star defender for spitting on Dak Prescott, then withstood a rare weather delay and needed a late stop to beat the Dallas Cowboys 24-20 early Friday in a wild start to the NFL season.",
      "With one last chance at a comeback, Prescott threw an incomplete pass on fourth-and-3 with 1:54 left to send what was left of a thinned out Eagles crowd into a frenzy.",
      "The game ended at 12:18 a.m.",
      "It was delayed 65 minutes because of lightning in the area. The Eagles led 24-20 with 4:44 left in the third quarter when the gamn was stopped - and that's the way it ended.",
      "Hurts wore out a defense without Micah Parsons on TD runs of 4 and 8 yards - no legal tush push needed. Saquon Barkley also ran for a 10-yard score, even if his final rushing total of 60 yards was minuscule compared to the last season, when he topped 2,000 yards.",
      "Hurts punctuated one score by chucking the ball into the stands and shrugging his shoulders much like his friend and mentor, Michael Jordan, who received a nice ovation when he was shown on the big screen.",
      "\"I think our discipline wasn't in it early in the game,\" Hurts said. \"Great job by our defense being able to battle and respond. Guys stepped in and filled those roles. We came into this game talking about discipline and focus, and we'll leave it saying the same things.\"",

    "story": [
      "At the end of summer, Congress is often sleepy, and slowly gets back to work. But this past week was an exception. On Capitol Hill, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrived, and the controversial Health and Human Services Secretary sparked a reckoning over public health in America.",
      "At a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, Kennedy defended the Trump administration's policies: \"We at HHS are enacting a once-in-a-generation shift from a sick-care system, to a true health care system that tackles the root causes of chronic disease,\" he said.",
      "Tempers ran hot at the hearing. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said, \"This is not a podcast. It is the American people's health that is on the line here.\"",
      "Democrats rebuked Kennedy, perhaps the most high-profile member of President Donald Trump's cabinet. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) asked Kennedy, \"When were you lying, sir \u2013   when you told this committee that you were not anti-vax? Or when you told Americans that there's no safe and effective vaccine?\"",
      "To which Kennedy replied, \"Both things are true.\"",
      "There were Republicans who offered broad support for Kennedy. Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Ida.) said, \"President Trump and Secretary Kennedy have made a steadfast commitment to make America healthy again.\"",
      "Yet some Republicans notably did push Kennedy on how his long-standing opposition to vaccine mandates is affecting policy, and on Kennedy's doubts about the safety of various vaccines. Sen. John Barasso (R-Wyo.) said, \"There are real concerns that safe, proven vaccines like measles, like hepatitis B and others, could be in jeopardy.\"",
      "The committee room standoff had been brewing for days. On Aug. 27, the government announced new restrictions on eligibility for COVID vaccinations. That decision prompted some health organizations to warn the policy could cause confusion.",
      "That same day, the Trump White House said Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who had just been confirmed by the Senate weeks earlier, was fired.",
      "The Trump White House stood by Secretary Kennedy's sweeping changes, and by the firing. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said of Monarez, \"She was not aligned with President Trump's mission to make America healthy again.\"",
      "In a statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"The White House maintains full confidence in Secretary Kennedy's leadership at HHS to advance President Trump's MAHA agenda. With Operation Warp Speed's unprecedented success delivering COVID-19 vaccines in record time, President Trump proved that it's possible to shake up the status quo of our broken and bureaucratic public health system to deliver real results for the American people. Now the second Trump administration is building on this record and experience to restore Gold Standard Science as the guiding principle of health decision-making at HHS to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Susan Monarez has written that she was pressured to \"compromise science itself\" \u2013 and to sign off on people who \"have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric.\"",
      "This turbulence has put Kennedy, who was a key Trump ally during last year's campaign, in the spotlight.",
      "Asked whether there has been pressure within the Republican Party to stand by Kennedy, Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul said, \"Nobody's pressured me or ever called me on it. I sort of speak my mind. And these are long-standing beliefs for me.\"",
      "Paul, an ophthalmologist, supports Kennedy, and lays blame on scientists \u2014 not skeptics \u2014 for worries about vaccine safety. \"All the doubt over vaccines is \u2013 there might be some doubt coming from those who don't want you to take a vaccine, but quite a bit of doubt is coming from the establishment that I believe is authoritarian in nature,\" said Paul. \"You don't care whether they tell you what to do. You should just do what you're told. We know better than you.\"",
      "But some who have worked at the highest level are fighting back against criticism, and are sounding an alarm.",
      "\"A significant distrust of vaccines\"",
      "Four CDC officials \u2014 Doctors Jennifer Layden, Daniel Jernigan, Debra Houry, and Demetre Daskalakis \u2014 all have resigned in recent days, some citing Secretary Kennedy's vaccine policies, others citing the upheaval at the CDC, which provides crucial health guidance nationwide.",
      "And all four expressed concerns about their resulting trust in CDC information about vaccines and vaccine safety data. \"It's why I left; I'm very concerned,\" said Dr. Daskalakis. \"We've already crossed the line. The COVID recommendations for children and pregnant women are completely not based in any evidence that world experts agree on.\"",
      "I asked, \"You know Secretary Kennedy would push back on that; what would you tell him?\"",
      "\"Ah, easy,\" Daskalakis replied. \"The recommendation is that there should be no healthy kids that get the vaccine; it should only be in kids with underlying conditions. Kids that are six-months-old, 56% of them that are admitted to the hospital have no underlying condition. So, by not offering the vaccine to parents who are willing to do it, those kids that could have been protected won't be.\"",
      "Asked how he would label Kennedy and his view of vaccines, Dr. Daniel Jernigan said, \"I think he has a significant distrust of vaccines. I don't know that he's driving a get-rid-of-vaccines agenda. It's more death by a thousand cuts, death by a thousand questions, calling into question data that has been accepted for many, many years, and simply that calling it into question brings into people's minds that, 'Maybe I shouldn't get that vaccine.'\"",
      "Dr. Debra Houry said that when Kennedy began at HHS, \"I read his books. I wanted to better understand his research and his background on it. So, we were open, you know, to having those discussions.\"",
      "In an additional statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said:",
      "\"Americans haven't forgotten how 'the science' was politicized and weaponized during the COVID era by unaccountable 'health officials' to push intrusive mandates and stifle any semblance of the skepticism that actual scientific inquiry is based on. The Trump administration is committed to restoring evidence-based, Gold Standard Science and answering the questions that Americans haven't been allowed to ask to restore trust, confidence, and accountability in our public health bodies.\"",
      "Asked what the cost to Americans would be of doctors and other officials leaving the CDC, Dr. Jennifer Layden said, \"We're talking about the whole public health infrastructure of our nation. And I think when we start to see (and we will) outbreaks that normally don't happen \u2013 more food-borne outbreaks, Legionella outbreaks, rising measles cases \u2013 people will start to care. That may take time for us to see some of those negative consequences, but that's what the ripple effect of all this will do across our nation.\"",
      "In fact, ripple effects are already apparent.",
      "\"Diseases don't obey borders\"",
      "Just this past week, Florida's Republican governor announced plans to eliminate all childhood vaccine requirements.",
      "Meanwhile, West Coast Democratic governors who oppose Secretary Kennedy's policies are moving fast to protect vaccine programs in their states.",
      "I asked Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon who served in the Biden administration, \"What is the consequence for the country when you have such a differentiation? It's splintered.\"",
      "\"It's severely splintered, and I'm very worried about it,\" Gawandea replied, \"because diseases don't obey borders.",
      "For Gawande, Kennedy's actions could upend not only federal agencies, but America's standing in global health. \"There isn't always consensus, for sure, among our own medical community,\" he said, \"but we generally have been able to come together enough to be able to say, 'Here is where we can assure getting \u2013 whether it's COVID boosters, and making sure we don't leave out the people who are most in need of vaccination \u2013 to making sure we're not abandoning our childhood immunization. Other countries around the world are baffled by our now falling into a civil war over whether the discoveries that have saved the world mattered.\"",
      "Later this month, the CDC's vaccine advisory board \u2014\u00a0now featuring Kennedy appointees\u00a0\u2014 will meet to decide future guidelines.",
      "At the end of the day, Gawande says, \"Trust helps assuage doubt.\"",
      "But, I asked, \"Is trust still possible in this environment?\"",
      "\"Trust is still possible,\" said Gawande, \"but it is not possible while we have leaders who actively drive chaos, who actively are trying to create uncertainty and break down trust. But ultimately, people have to choose the leaders who have the track record of demonstrating better outcomes. And those leaders are scientists, health professionals, and others who have demonstrated over years that they actually get you better results.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Thursday denied that he pressured the ousted director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to preapprove vaccination recommendations from a panel he overhauled before her firing.",
      "Susan Monarez was fired from the position less than a month after her Senate confirmation. In an opinion piece\u00a0in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Monarez said that Kennedy \"pressured me to resign or face termination\" in an Aug. 25 meeting.",
      "\"One of the troubling directives from that meeting more than a week ago: I was told to preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric,\" she wrote.",
      "The piece was published shortly before Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee, where he faced tough questioning about his vaccine policies.",
      "\"I did not say that to her,\" Kennedy told Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. \"I never had a private meeting with her. Other witnesses to every meeting that we have, and all those witnesses will say, I never said that.\"",
      "\"So she's lying today to the American people in the Wall Street Journal?\" Wyden asked.",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Later, Kennedy told Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia that he did not demand Monarez accept the recommendations of the panel without further review from career scientists at the CDC.",
      "\"I told her I didn't want her to have a rule that she's not going to sign onto it,\" Kennedy said when asked whether he told Monarez to accept the recommendations.",
      "At another point in the hearing, Kennedy claimed he asked Monarez to resign \"because I asked her, 'Are you a trustworthy person?' and she said no.\"",
      "In a statement Thursday afternoon, lawyers for Monarez said Kennedy's claims were \"false, and at times, patently ridiculous.\"",
      "\"Dr. Monarez stands by what she said in her op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, would repeat it all under oath and continues to support the vision she outlined at her confirmation hearing that science will control her decisions,\" attorneys Mark Zaid and Abbe Lowell said.",
      "In June, Kennedy removed every member of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a government panel that makes vaccine recommendations. At the time, he asserted that it \"has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.\" He then named several members to the panel, including vaccine skeptics, circumventing the usual CDC practice for selecting medical and public health experts.",
      "The newly constituted ACIP is set to meet later this month to consider vaccine recommendations. In her op-ed, Monarez wrote that \"[i]t is imperative that the panel's recommendations aren't rubber-stamped but instead are rigorously and scientifically reviewed before being accepted or rejected.\"",
      "After Monarez's firing, several other top CDC officials resigned, citing the Trump administration's stance on vaccines, which they found troubling, and budget cuts.",

    "story": [
      "More than 1,000 current and former Health and Human Services employees penned an open letter Wednesday calling for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to either resign or be fired.",
      "The letter \u2014 whose signatories were not publicly named \u2014 was released at a tense time for the health agency. Last week, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez was fired, and several other top CDC officials resigned from their jobs in protest. Staff are also reeling from layoffs, changes to the vaccine approval system \u2014 led by Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic \u2014 and a shooting outside the CDC headquarters last month.",
      "Wednesday's letter accused Kennedy of \"endangering the nation's health.\" It cited last week's upheaval at the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration's decision to rescind emergency approvals that made the COVID-19 vaccines available for young children, and the elevation of \"political ideologues who pose as scientific experts\" to key vaccine approval posts.",
      "It called for Kennedy to resign, and said that if he declines to leave his post voluntarily, President Trump should pick a new HHS secretary.",
      "\"We swore an oath to support and defend the United States Constitution and to serve the American people. Our oath requires us to speak out when the Constitution is violated and the American people are put at risk,\" the letter reads.",
      "The letter was released by a group called Save HHS, which penned a similar open letter last month urging Kennedy to \"stop spreading inaccurate health information.\"",
      "The group said the signatories for Wednesday's letter were provided to members of Congress, but weren't publicly listed due to security and privacy concerns.",
      "HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon responded to the letter by defending Kennedy's record and arguing he is working to restore trust in a \"broken\" CDC.",
      "\"From his first day in office, he pledged to check his assumptions at the door \u2014 and he asked every HHS colleague to do the same,\" Nixon said. \"That commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "Separately, nine former CDC directors wrote a New York Times op-ed on Monday that castigated Kennedy for making decisions they said were \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" and argued Monarez's firing \"adds considerable fuel to this raging fire.\"",
      "Kennedy is set to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday morning, where he's likely to face questions about the tumult at HHS.",
      "Last week, the White House confirmed that Monarez was fired. Her lawyers called the firing \"legally deficient\" and said she was \"targeted\" because she \"refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated public health experts.\"",
      "At least four other senior CDC leaders also stepped down last week, in some cases penning resignation letters that decried cuts to the CDC, accused the Trump administration of an \"ongoing weaponizing of public health\" and blasted \"misinformation\" about vaccines.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the Senate health committee, said the resignations will \"require oversight.\" He also sits on the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "Meanwhile, Kennedy ousted every member of a CDC panel responsible for making vaccine recommendations earlier this year, in some cases replacing them with people who have questioned the safety of vaccines.",
      "And last week, the FDA only authorized a set of updated COVID-19 vaccines for younger adults and children with preexisting health conditions, in addition to all seniors.",

      "In a large-scale immigration enforcement raid at a huge Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday, 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally were detained, federal authorities announced.",
      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia and Alabama, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals, but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Saturday that more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people detained.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a month-long investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally, and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",
      "ICE said in a statement Friday night that those arrested during the operation were \"found to be working illegally, in violation of the terms of their visas and/or statuses.\" One green card holder from Mexico was arrested after \"being determined to be removable from the U.S. based on multiple criminal convictions,\" ICE said.",
      "The investigation is ongoing, and additional arrests and charges are possible, ICE said.",
      "In ICE's statement Friday night, Schrank said the operation \"sends a clear message that those who exploit the system and undermine our workforce will be held accountable.\"",
      "\"We welcome all companies who want to invest in the U.S., and if they need to bring workers in for building or other projects, that's fine \u2014 but they need to do it the legal way,\" Schrank said.",
      "The president of Georgia's chapter of the AFL-CIO called the raid politically motivated and said ICE has been escalating its presence at workplaces across the state.",
      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE, Border Patrol, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Earlier, the Atlanta office of the ATF had said 450 people were detained in\u00a0a post on social media, which included pictures from the operation.",
      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "The Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement that it was aware of the operation and was \"closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances.\"",
      "\"Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,\" it said. \"Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.\"",
      "\"We are reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors,\" the company said, in part, adding that it will \"conduct an investigation to ensure all suppliers and their subcontractors comply with all laws and regulations.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed it was dispatched to assist federal authorities.",
      "Video posted to social media on Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: \"We're Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.\"",
      "\"We need construction to cease immediately,\" the man says in the video. \"We need all work to end on the site right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.",
      "The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",
      "Hyundai and LG's battery joint venture, HL-GA Battery Company, said in a statement that it's \"cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities\" and paused construction of the battery site to assist their work.",
      "Operations at Hyundai's EV manufacturing plant weren't interrupted, said plant spokesperson Bianca Johnson.",
      "\"This did not impact people getting to work,\" Johnson said in an email. \"Production and normal office hours had already begun for the day\" when authorities shut down access.",
      "The Hyundai site is in Bryan County, which saw its population increase by more than a quarter in the early 2020s and stood at almost 47,000 residents in 2023, the most recent year data is available. The county's Asian population went from 1.5% in 2018 to 2.2% in 2023, and the growth was primarily among people of Indian descent, according to Census Bureau figures.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 21:35:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Employers added far fewer jobs last month than economists had predicted, prompting some experts to reassess the economy.",
    "story": [
      "Many economists say Friday's disappointing jobs report\u00a0is sending warning signals about the pace of hiring across the U.S. and the broader health of the economy.",
      "Employers added only 22,000 nonfarm jobs in August, far short of Wall Street analyst forecasts of 80,000, while the nation's unemployment rate rose to 4.3% \u2014 the highest level since October of 2021, when the economy was still reeling from the effects of the pandemic. In 2024, the economy added an average of 168,000 per month, labor data shows.",
      "The job market is faltering partly because of the Trump administration's tariffs, which are heightening economic uncertainty, boosting costs for importers and complicating business planning.. Some economists also think that rapid employer adoption of artificial intelligence is hurting demand for recent college graduates and other entry-level workers, although there is ongoing debate among researchers about how much AI is affecting job growth.",
      "\"Uncertainty makes it very, very difficult for people in companies to make decisions,\" Laura Ullrich, director of economic research for North America at job-search firm Indeed and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"My former boss says that when you are driving through fog, you slow down \u2014 but if it gets thick enough, you pull over.\"",
      "The Trump administration defended its trade and other economic policies, expressing confidence they will eventually drive growth.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these unprecedented trade deals and the administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and historic working-class tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "In response to the jobs report, President Trump on Friday posted on social media that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell should have moved sooner to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs can stimulate job growth by driving consumer spending and making it cheaper for businesses to expand their operations.",
      "\"Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he's 'Too Late!',\" the president wrote.",
      "Here are three key takeaways from economists about the latest employment figures.",
      "The job market is stalling",
      "Overall hiring in August was far weaker than economists expected. More troubling, the numbers look considerably worse after stripping out the two sectors that showed some of the strongest growth in August \u2014 health care and social assistance. Health care companies created 31,000 new jobs last month, while social assistance \u2014 employers such as food banks and those providing services for disabled people, children and low-income families \u2014 added 16,000 new jobs.",
      "But many other sectors had stagnant or even declining job growth, such as manufacturing, which shed 12,000 jobs in August, and professional and business services, which lost 17,000.",
      "\"Absent the secular gains in health care and social assistance, the cyclical categories of the private service sector (excluding health care and social assistance) have collectively turned negative on average in the past four months,\" Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic said in a report Friday.",
      "Hiring this summer was also weaker than previously thought. The Labor Department's latest\u00a0data\u00a0shows employers cut 13,000 jobs in June, rather than adding 14,000 new hires as the agency had reported in its first estimate for that month. The June drop marks the first decline in monthly jobs since late 2020.",
      "Although July payroll gains were revised up slightly, total job growth for June and July was 21,000 lower than previously reported, according to the Labor Department.",
      "Job growth is at its lowest level in 15 years",
      "The average monthly job gains since January represent the fewest jobs added over the first eight months of the year in 15 years, excluding the pandemic-triggered crisis period of 2020, Indeed's Ullrich noted.",
      "\"We haven't added this few jobs since 2010, and we have 17 million more people in the labor market than we did then,\" she said. \"That, to me, is a staggering headline.\"",
      "That loss of momentum in creating new jobs is raising concerns about the overall strength of the economy. The nation's gross domestic product \u2014 the total value of goods and services \u2014 is expanding\u00a0more slowly than in 2024, while inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's annual growth target of 2%.",
      "That combination has caused some economists to warn about the risk of the U.S. entering a period of\u00a0\"stagflation,\" a toxic mix of high prices and weak growth. Forecasters expect Consumer Price Index data for August, which is set to be released next week, to show inflation rising at an annual rate of 2.9%, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "\"Concerns about the health of the economy are starting to creep in,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an email. \"Equally, a strong inflation print next week could strike new fears about a stagflationary mix.\"",
      "The Fed is highly likely to cut interest rates this month",
      "Across the board, economists on Friday said the subpar August jobs report virtually locks in a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut when policymakers meet on Sept. 17.\u00a0 The question is by how much.",
      "August hiring was so anemic that some economists now think the Fed could opt for a 0.5 percentage point cut \u2014 double the typical rate cut \u2014 in a bid to keep the job market on track. Traders now see a 10% chance of a jumbo cut and a 90% likelihood of a 0.25 percentage point reduction, according to CME FedWatch. Prior to Friday's jobs report, the market was completely discounting a jumbo cut, the tool shows.",
      "Some economists also think the Fed will continue trimming rates later in 2025 to counter the weak job market.",
      "\"With the weak job growth, the Fed is cleared to cut rates in September. The question is whether we get [0.25 or 0.50 percentage points],\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said in an email. \"We continue to believe the Fed will ease into the cutting cycle here with one rather than two, but there is some latitude here.\"",

    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 22,000 jobs in August, falling short of economists' muted expectations and signaling the labor market is facing sharp headwinds from mounting economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 80,000 last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in August, up from 4.2% in July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "The latest data points to an ongoing slowdown in the labor market, with employers hiring an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus 168,000 workers each month in 2024. Revised data shows that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June rather than adding the 14,000 that had been reported a month earlier, marking the first decline since late 2020.",
      "Some companies are paring back hiring plans amid the on-again, off-again uncertainty of the Trump administration's tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies. Businesses in seven of the Fed's 12 regional districts canvassed in the latest so-called Beige Book, a survey of local economic conditions, said they were hesitant to hire because of weaker demand and uncertainty over the near-term outlook.",
      "\"August's employment report confirmed that the labor market has headed off a cliff-edge,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research report.",
      "Consumers are also dour, with a new CBS News poll finding that Americans are continuing to rate the U.S. economy negatively, with most respondents picking \"uncertain\" and \"struggling\" to describe its current state.",
      "The August jobs report marks the first since President Trump\u00a0fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Aug. 1 in the wake of a disappointing July jobs report, which included a significant downward revision of May and June hiring figures.",
      "Citing the large revisions, Mr. Trump questioned the validity of the government data, although the BLS typically revises its prior reports each month based on fresher responses from employers.",
      "The new revisions",
      "On Friday, the BLS revised the prior two months' data, showing that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June, revising the month's hiring downward by 27,000 fewer jobs. That marks the first monthly decline in hiring since December 2020, when the U.S. was in the midst of an economic crisis caused by the pandemic.",
      "The BLS also revised July's jobs numbers upward, showing that employers added 79,000 workers that month, rather than the 73,000 reported in August.",
      "The revisions show that the economy added 21,000 fewer jobs in June and July than had earlier been reported by the BLS.",
      "What economists say",
      "The labor market data is complicating the Federal Reserve's next rate cut decision, which set for Sept. 17. The central bank's dual mandate requires it to ensure that both inflation and unemployment remain low, but inflation has been edging upward, which economists say is partly due to Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The Fed's most powerful weapon for battling inflation is to hike interest rates, yet its best option for helping the job market is to lower borrowing costs, making it cheaper for businesses to expand. With the combination of rising inflation and weaker hiring, the Fed is in a tough position, economists say.",
      "Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has been under pressure from Mr. Trump to cut rates, signaled that the central bank is open to reducing rates at its September meeting, citing risks to the labor market.",
      "\"The labor market continues to show fatigue as businesses hold back on hiring amid uncertainty around the direction of inflation, tariffs and the strength of the underlying economy,\" said Joe Gaffoglio, CEO at Mutual of America Capital Management, in an email after the data was released.",
      "\"Recent labor data showed that more individuals are unemployed in the U.S. (7.24 million) than there are available jobs (7.18 million), which hasn't happened since April 2021,\" he added.",
      "The latest data is likely to ensure a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, experts said on Friday. The lower-than-expected hiring, as well as June's negative revision, could also persuade the central bank to cut later in the year as well, they added.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve needs to cut interest rates in September and probably October and December, too. The 'no hiring' economy is turning to a layoff economy and if that worsens, it will lead to a recession. This needs to be stopped,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email.",

      "With the Powerball jackpot reaching\u00a0nearly $1.8 billion for Saturday night's drawing, there's been\u00a0lottery fever in the air. If you're one of the lucky ones whose $2 ticket ends\u00a0up worth millions, what do you do with all that money?",
      "Jackpot winners have the option to either take a lump sum payment of the estimated cash value \u2014 in this case, a total of roughly $820 million \u2014 or they can opt to receive their prize as an annuity, paid in 30 graduated payments over 29 years. In either case, those totals are before the Internal Revenue Service takes a cut, as do most states.",
      "Should you take a lump sum payment or annuity option?",
      "Dan Geltrude, a certified public accountant in New Jersey, told CBS News: \"I personally would take the lump sum payment because I feel comfortable in how I can invest my money. However, having that much money for a lot of people is dangerous.\"",

      "While meticulously tailored clothing made from quality fabrics has always been at the heart of the Armani brand, the designer expanded his business over the years to include not just perfumes and accessories but home furnishings, cosmetics, books, flowers \u2014 even chocolates. Connecting them all was sophisticated design, which Armani wove into all things he put his name on.",
      "\"He was masterful in sticking to his vision, but executing it in a way that would be accessible luxury, a quiet luxury, but still tasteful and elegantly crafted,\" Grain Carter said.",
      "Among Armani's most celebrated contributions and successful business maneuvers was the power suit, a softly tailored, ready-to-wear take on office attire that quickly rose in popularity among the American business class.",
      "Introduced in the '70s, the Armani suit was a bold deviation from the rigid, restrictive suits businessmen were accustomed to wearing. Armani's elegantly tailored suits quickly became a must in every well-heeled man's closet.",
      "Beth Dincuff, an associate professor at New York's Parsons School of Design, said Armani cultivated the idea of a \"sophisticated man who cared about how he looked, who was aware of his physique and who wanted to show it off in a new way.\"",
      "Armani soon brought that masculine sensibility to women's fashion with the pantsuit, a shoulder-padded jacket and tailored trousers. This gave women a refined option for the office that projected confidence and power.",
      "\"That's attributed to Giorgio Armani \u2014 making it OK for a woman to wear a pantsuit but still look like a woman in terms of a power aesthetic,\" said Grain Carter.",
      "Armani's designs also had a knack for tapping into the zeitgeist. He\u00a0told CBS News in 2006 that his new line of women's clothes was in response to the feminist movement. Women needed their own version of the traditional men's suit jacket, Armani thought.",
      "Celebrities and Armani",
      "Using celebrities to elevate the Armani brand was another to key to the designer's business success. He began by outfitting Richard Gere in the 1980 neo-noir crime drama \"American Gigolo.\" Armani went on to design clothes for more than 150 films throughout his career.",
      "\"His idea to reach out to celebrities was very, very important,\" said Dincuff, noting that this approach to marketing fashion was novel at the time.",
      "Armani pivoted to dressing celebrities on the red carpet in the 1990s, where his\u00a0black-tie outfits and glittering evening gowns often stole the show. Some early looks that captured popular attention included the oversized Armani suit worn by Julia Roberts at the 1990s Golden Globes and a champagne-colored Armani suit that Jodie Foster wore at the 1992 Academy Awards.",
      "The list of celebrities that have\u00a0worn Armani on the red carpet is long and includes Beyonc\u00e9, Selena Gomez, \u00a0Anne Hathaway, Michelle Pfeiffer, Margot Robbie and Winona Ryder.",
      "His own boss",
      "Central to Armani's success was the fact that he never relinquished control of the multibillion company he created, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. In rejecting a merger or sale to a larger industry rival, the Italian fashion designer was always his own boss.",
      "This allowed Armani to maintain creative control and consistency over his expanding business empire, distinguishing him from other designers.",
      "While he did strike several licensing deals over his career with companies like EssilorLuxottica\u00a0and\u00a0L'Or\u00e9al, he kept the majority of his business portfolio in-house. That included everything from Armani Priv\u00e9, his haute couture fashion collection and fragrance line, to Armani Exchange \u2014 a more affordable fashion line geared toward younger generations, said Grain Carter. Armani also kept the collections Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani under his purview.",
      "\"All of this was in-house and he controlled it from concept to production to distribution to marketing to how it is financed,\" Grain Carter said. \"He was active at every level, at every step.\"",
      "Today, the Armani empire has more than 9,000 employees along with seven industrial hubs and over 600 stores worldwide, according to figures released in 2023.",
      "As for potential succession plans, the Giorgio Armani company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"I cannot really contemplate the next person, because there will be no other Giorgio Armani,\" Grain Carter said.",

    "story": [
      "Anthropic, which operates the Claude artificial intelligence app, has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who alleged the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.",
      "The company has agreed to pay authors about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement. A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year, and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "The landmark settlement could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement. A judge could approve the settlement as soon as Monday.",
      "\"As best as we can tell, it's the largest copyright recovery ever,\" said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \"It is the first of its kind in the AI era.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Anthropic Aparna Sridhar deputy general counsel said the settlement \"will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims.\"",
      "Sridhar added that the settlement comes after the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June ruled that Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train Claude did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "\"We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery and solve complex problems,\" Sridhar said.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced\u00a0Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Settlement terms",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\"We were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\" said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic's Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",
      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \"damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\" if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \"an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors' works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\"",

      "Reuters was the first to report that the Transportation Department was shelving the proposal.",

Some of the rules proposed or adopted by the previous administration, however, went beyond what Congress has required by statute, and we intend to reconsider those extra-statutory requirements.\"",
      "\"This action does not change the Department's commitment or intent to carry out the consumer protection mandates from Congress in the recent FAA Reauthorization Act, including provisions relating to refunds.

      "A federal jury has ordered Google to pay $425.7 million for improperly snooping on people's smartphones during a nearly decade-long period of intrusions.",
      "The verdict reached Wednesday in San Francisco federal court followed a more than two-week trial in a class-action case covering about 98 million smartphones operating in the United States between July 1, 2016, through Sept. 23, 2024. That means the total damages awarded in the five-year-old case works out to about $4 per device.",
      "Google had denied that it was improperly tracking the online activity of people who thought they had shielded themselves with privacy controls. The company maintained its stance even though the eight-person jury concluded Google had been spying in violation of California privacy laws.",
      "\"This decision misunderstands how our products work, and we will appeal it,\" Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said Thursday. \"Our privacy tools give people control over their data, and when they turn off personalization, we honor that choice.\"",
      "The lawyers who filed the case had argued Google had used the data they collected off smartphones without users' permission to help sell ads tailored to users' individual interests \u2014 a strategy that resulted in the company reaping billions in additional revenue. The lawyers framed those ad sales as illegal profiteering that merited damages of more than $30 billion.",
      "Even though the jury came up with a far lower calculation for the damages, one of the lawyers who brought the case against Google hailed the outcome as a victory for privacy protection.",
      "\"We hope this result sends a message to the tech industry that Americans will not sit idly by as their information is collected and monetized against their will,\" said attorney John Yanchunis of law firm Morgan & Morgan.",
      "The San Francisco jury verdict came a day after Google avoided the U.S. Department of Justice's attempt to break up the company in a landmark antitrust case in Washington, D.C., targeting its dominant search engine. A federal judge who had declared Google's search engine to be an illegal monopoly ordered less radical changes, including requiring the company to share some of its search data with rivals.",

      "The new tax rule could save qualifying tipped workers about $1,300 each, according to the White House. Some restrictions built into the law could limit the tax break's value, while some people in jobs on Treasury's list \u2014 but that don't typically receive tips \u2014 might not derive much benefit from the change.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:01:21 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government could have to refund domestic businesses billions in tariffs, should the Supreme Court uphold a recent federal appeals court ruling.",
    "story": [
      "American businesses could be owed tens of billions of dollars in refunds for tariffs they paid on foreign goods.",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection has collected more than $200 billion in tariff revenue from American businesses of all sizes from October through August 24, according to agency data. Of that, more than $70 billion comes from payments of country-based tariffs that\u00a0a federal appeals court recently ruled\u00a0President Trump lacked the authority to impose.",
      "Industry-specific tariffs, such as steel and aluminum levies, are unaffected by Friday's ruling.",
      "The court on Friday ruled that President Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs of up to 145% on dozens of U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to review the federal appeals court's decision before it takes effect on Oct. 14.",
      "Mr. Trump's appeal means that, for now, there's no guarantee businesses will receive refunds. That spells more uncertainty for enterprises struggling to balance raising prices to cover the cost of levies against potentially turning away customers, according to supply chain experts.",
      "\"From the supply chain perspective, we are seeing a lot of uncertainty, which has been the case since April 2,\" Scott Pruneau, CEO of ITS Logistics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"No one knows how to price their goods, because you can't whipsaw your customers on pricing.\"",
      "If the court's decision stands, the U.S. government could have to return billions in tariff revenue it has collected from businesses.",
      "\"It'd be very challenging\"",
      "But even if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs, businesses could still face hurdles in collecting refunds for the levies they've already paid the U.S. government, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. For one, there is no guarantee that whatever kind of refund system the government sets up would be automatic or that the process will be simple.",
      "\"There's been speculation that if ultimately, the Supreme Court overturns the tariffs, then Customs could just issue refunds, but I don't know that it's going to happen that way,\" Felicia Pullam, former executive director of the Office of Trade Relations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the current senior director for geo-commerce at APCO, a global advisory firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The easiest way would be for Customs to put a process in place and issue refunds, rather than make companies go and apply,\" she added.",
      "Ultimately, however, if refunds are owed, it would be up to the Trump administration to decide how to administer them. \"It'd be very challenging, but I am confident CBP could handle it.\"",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "Requests for refunds",
      "Ted Murphy, co-leader of Sidley Austin's global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice, told CBS MoneyWatch that if the Supreme Court affirms the federal circuit court's ruling that Trump's reliance on IEEPA to impose country-based tariffs was illegal, the government would have to cease collecting tariffs from companies.",
      "When it comes to recouping levies that have already been paid, there are three ways refunds could be administered, Murphy said.",
      "Most simply, the government could provide automatic refunds to businesses for levy amounts paid. \"The government has that information, so it could happen automatically,\" Murphy told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I don't think that's particularly likely, but it is an option.\"",
      "The government could instead decide that only the plaintiffs who filed suit against the tariffs are entitled to refunds, and require additional parties seeking refunds to bring similar legal actions. \"In that case, you'd see tens and tens of thousands of people filing complaints at the Court of International Trade,\" he said.",
      "But the most likely repayment option in Murphy's view would be that the government agrees to refund duties paid by parties who submit requests for reimbursement.",
      "Historical precedent for refunds",
      "There's precedent for the government reimbursing businesses for tariff payments that were later deemed unlawful. In 1998, the Supreme Court struck down a harbor maintenance tax assessed on exports, which had been imposed by the Reagan administration. The government then owed companies more than a billion dollars in refunds, which it required companies to apply for in order to receive.",
      "Dan Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide, a trade consultancy, echoed Murphy, saying that it is hard to predict how the government might choose to process refunds, should the Supreme Court determine they are owed.",
      "\"It's up to the administration to decide, and that's where it gets very complicated and speculative,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Technically speaking, issuing refunds wouldn't be hard. \"Theoretically, the government could quite quickly figure out who paid what, and refund it to the payer,\" he said. \"But the government could also make it very difficult and force people to make requests.\"",
      "That would create work for companies, but also for the government, which would then have to review requests for refunds from thousands of companies. \"That's infinitely more work for the government, but it's pretty clear the government does not want to give money back, so if you make it a difficult process, then a number of importers are probably not going to pursue it,\" Anthony said.",
      "Large refunds to businesses could weigh on the Treasury's finances, TD Securities analysts noted in a report Thursday. \"Treasury would likely step up bill supply even further to obtain the extra funds, creating little disruption in longer-dated yields, but potentially pressuring funding spreads,\" TD Securities analysts said.",
      "The Trump administration could also turn to other emergency powers to replace the IEEPA tariffs in order to maintain the U.S.' effective tariff rate, the analysts noted.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Treasury immediately responded to a request for comment.",

      "The news comes at a financially tumultuous time for the budget carrier. Spirit initially filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2024 after years of of struggling with rising operation costs and mounting debt. Just months after emerging from Chapter 11 reorganization, the airline filed for bankruptcy protection again in August.",
      "At the time, Spirit said it intended to conduct business as usual during the restructuring process, signaling passengers would still be able to book flights and use tickets.",
      "Spirit is seeking to cut costs by eliminating money-losing routes.

      "At $299, the pass costs less than what customers typically pay for a domestic ticket on other U.S. airlines, Frontier said, citing data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. On Friday, the pass's cost will rise to $599.",
      "This year's pass offers the most amount of travel time that Frontier has offered through the program, Frontier Airlines chief commercial officer Bobby Schroeter said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "It's a step that could help Frontier catapult past its competitors, industry experts said. Frontier is expanding the pass as low-cost competitor Spirit struggles with its second bankruptcy in less than a year, while rival Southwest's new policies, like ending its\u00a0free checked bag policy, have alienated some customers.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/august-jobs-report-labor-market-bureau-labor-statistics/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 09:41:14 -0400",
    "summary": "After President Trump expressed \"shock\" over the pace of hiring in July, much is riding on the employment data for August.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump last month fired the head of the federal bureau that produces the government's monthly jobs report after the numbers pointed to a slump in U.S. hiring, he drew rebukes from critics who accused him of politicizing a technical \u2014 and nonpartisan \u2014 data collection process.",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department is set to release employment figures for August in what could emerge as another possible flashpoint.",
      "The new payroll report comes at a critical juncture for the economy. Recent data suggests the labor market is cooling, a particular concern as workers and businesses head into the crucial\u00a0holiday spending period. The Federal Reserve later this month is also expected to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since December 2024 as it swivels from fighting inflation to shoring up job growth.",
      "The August employment report will be the first since Mr. Trump ordered the dismissal of former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and questioned the Labor Department's competence in tracking the rate of job-creation across the U.S.",
      "In the aftermath, economists expressed concern that Mr. Trump's move could undermine confidence in the accuracy of U.S. economic data \u2014 a benchmark for the global economy. Any further actions by the Trump administration to question the accuracy of the monthly jobs data could sow further doubt about its validity, Gregory Daco, chief economist at strategy consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What happened last month",
      "Employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, the government reported last month \u2014 a figure that fell far short of economist forecasts and that led Mr. Trump to express \"shock\"\u00a0over what appeared to be a sudden downturn in hiring. Also troubling was that the Labor Department sharply revised down how many jobs the economy added in May and June, a sign the economy was weaker than previously thought.",
      "Such revisions are common, according to economists. The U.S. has roughly 160 million workers, making it impossible for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to tally each job every month. Instead, Labor Department staff draws on available data to estimate hiring and layoffs, while also revising their estimates for seasonal factors.",
      "Still, the Labor Department's July recalculation of the pace of job growth was noteworthy for its scale, representing the largest two-month downward revision since 1968.",
      "\"The previous report was obviously shocking in the sense of the downward revisions for the previous two months, and really caused a reckoning in the sense of needing to view hiring in a new light \u2014 and obviously not in a positive light,\" Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Indeed, the disappointing numbers were the clearest sign to date this year that the job market could be starting to sputter as the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs and general economic uncertainty weigh on employers.",
      "What to expect from the August job numbers \u2014 and beyond",
      "The August jobs data will provide a crucial measure of whether the labor market is holding up or running out of steam, as recent data suggests. The year started off strong, with an average monthly payroll gain of 123,000 from January to April \u2014 well above the number required to keep the nation's unemployment rate, now at 4.2%, from rising.",
      "However, the job market has stalled in recent months, with an average payroll gain from May to July of only 35,000. For the first time since April of 2021, the U.S. now has more unemployed people, at 7.24 million, than the 7.18 million jobs open around the country, according to labor data released on Wednesday.",
      "\"This is yet another data point underscoring how this job market is frozen, and it's difficult for anyone to get a job right now,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email. \"This is a turning point for the labor market. It's yet another crack.\"",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet projected that employers added 80,000 jobs in August, with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 4.2%. A figure around or exceeding that level would alleviate fears that the job market is cratering.",
      "Daco, who forecasts a much more moderate gain of 40,000 jobs in August, said in a research note this week that the employment report on Friday is \"likely to confirm that a marked slowdown in labor market conditions is underway.\"",
      "Another important marker to look for in the latest job figures will be whether the Labor Department revises the payroll gains for July, as it did for May and June.",
      "\"Since every month in 2025 has been revised lower so far, the risk is that July job growth will also be marked down,\" Shruti Mishra, a U.S. economist at Bank of America Global Research, said in a report. \"This could point to more sustained labor market weakness than we have been forecasting.\"",
      "Moving forward, Daco predicts payroll gains will average around 30,000 per month through the end of the year and for the nation's jobless rate to reach 4.7% by December.",
      "\"Looking ahead, the labor market slowdown is likely to persist,\" he said.",
      "What could the jobs report mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "The Federal Reserve has held off on lowering interest rates as it tries to finish the job of extinguishing the raging inflation that scorched consumers during the pandemic and to assess the impact of steeper tariffs on the economy.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last month that there might be an opening for a cut in September as downside risks to employment increase. Another month of weak or flat job growth would reinforce this outlook and likely keep the central bank on track for a cut at the Fed's next policy meeting on Sept. 16-17, according to many economists.",
      "\"The report would have to be significantly stronger than we are forecasting to dissuade the [Fed] from cutting rates,\" Oxford Economics said in a recent report.",
      "As of Sept. 3, traders see a 95% probability that the Fed will lower its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.",

    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to rein in spending this holiday season by the most amount since the pandemic, as they continue to face pressure from high prices and tariffs.",
      "That's according to a new survey released by accounting firm PwC on Wednesday, which predicts Americans this year will reduce holiday spending to $1,552 a person on average, which is 5% less than in 2024. That includes spending on gifts, travel, food and entertainment.",
      "If the predictions come to pass, it would represent the most significant drop in holiday spending since 2020. While consumers are not cutting purchases entirely, they are getting smarter about how they stretch their dollars, according to Alison Furman, PwC's consumer markets industry leader.",
      "\"Inflation is kind of creeping in, and they're seeing it affect their wallets,\" Furman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For its report, PwC surveyed 4,000 Americans from Gen Zs to baby boomers over a two-week period from June to July, when tariff-related uncertainty was more pronounced. But any perceived changes in the economy over the next couple of months could alter consumers' attitude toward spending.",
      "\"Economic signals continue to shift and, between now and December, purchasing behavior could evolve in response,\" the report states.",
      "The generation expected to tighten their spending the most is Gen Z. Respondents from this cohort, ages 17 to 28, said they expect to reduce their holiday budgets by 23% \u2014 more than any other generation in the study. That's due in part to the\u00a0tough job market\u00a0facing young Americans, along with rising costs.",
      "Overall, 84% of consumers expect to cut back spending in general over the next six months, according to the report.",
      "A slowdown in spending could spell trouble for retailers who depend on holiday sales to shore up revenue toward the end of the year. Since 2019, holiday sales during the months of November and December have accounted for 19% of total retail revenue for the year, according to a National Retail Federation\u00a0report.",
      "Tariffs, high prices top of mind",
      "The projected pullback in consumer holiday spending underscores Americans' shaky confidence in the state of the economy. Worries over inflation and tariffs have already led shoppers to be more judicious with their spending.",
      "Discretionary spending on categories like indoor and outdoor dining were down in August, according to the U.S. Conference Board's latest consumer confidence index each month. Meanwhile, average 12-month inflation expectations among consumers increased to 6.2%, from 5.7% in July.",
      "Tighter spending",
      "PwC expects consumers to approach holiday shopping \"more deliberately,\" with an eye toward saving money, amid ongoing concerns over tariffs and high prices.",
      "Furman said the potential for tariff-related price increases has already made the consumers \"very conscious of trying to buy things at a discount.\"Case in point: Internet searches for \"discount\" and \"coupon code\" have climbed by 11% over the past year, according to the survey.",
      "With deals in mind, consumers are expected to do a large portion, or 39%, of their total planned holiday gift spending, during the time between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, according to the PwC report. With heightened traffic expected during that five-day stretch, Furman advises shoppers to start looking early for popular items.",
      "\"If you're interested in very hot items, knowing that they're going to likely be on shelves sooner, to guarantee that you'll get them, you may want to shop for them in those early promotional cycles, versus wait until the five-day frenzy,\" she said.",

      "The high court agreed to freeze a district court's temporary restraining order that prevented federal immigration authorities from stopping people in Southern California without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. unlawfully. That order barred officials from relying solely on certain factors like a person's race or occupation as the basis for a detentive stop.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit largely rejected the Trump administration's request to pause the district court's order. The Justice Department then\u00a0sought emergency relief\u00a0from the Supreme Court.",

      "\"That decision is yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,\" Sotomayor, joined by Kagan and Jackson, wrote of the majority's move. \"We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.\"",
      "In response to the Supreme Court's order, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said \"we look forward to full vindication on this front in short order, but in the meantime, the Trump Administration will continue fulfilling its mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens.\"",

      "The legal challenge",
      "The greater Los Angeles area, located within the Central District of California, is home to nearly 20 million people. The Trump administration estimates that 2 million of its residents are in the country illegally and has said that the region is a \"top enforcement priority.\"",
      "In June, federal immigration agencies began undertaking efforts to ramp up immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, which\u00a0Mr. Trump called\u00a0the \"largest mass deportation operation \u2026 in history.\" After protests broke out in response to enforcement operations at workplaces in the region, the Trump administration\u00a0deployed members of the California National Guard\u00a0and\u00a0active-duty Marines\u00a0to Los Angeles in June to protect federal property and immigration agents.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court arose after three men who are in the U.S. illegally were arrested and filed a lawsuit seeking release from detention. The men, who live in Pasadena, were working as day laborers and were arrested in mid-June as part of a targeted enforcement action at a donut shop, according to court papers. They have since been released on bond.",
      "The migrants, later joined by two U.S. citizens and four organizations, challenged the Trump administration's immigration raids, alleging that officers violated their Fourth Amendment rights when conducting patrols and other enforcement operations. One of the plaintiffs, Brian Gavidia, was confronted by armed agents while working at a tow yard and repeatedly told officers he was a U.S. citizen as they tried to detain him.",
      "The plaintiffs claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were targeting certain businesses and conducting \"indiscriminate immigration operations.\"",
      "Last month, a federal district court agreed to issue a temporary restraining order that blocked federal agents from conducting immigration enforcement stops without reasonable suspicion that the person they are stopping is in the U.S. illegally. The order from U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong specified that agents could not rely solely on four factors as grounds for detaining people: apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; being at a specific location like a bus stop, agricultural site or day laborer pick-up site; and the type of work a person does.",
      "In her decision, Frimpong, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, wrote there was a \"mountain of evidence\" that \"roving patrols\" were indiscriminately stopping and detaining people without reasonable suspicion in violation of the Fourth Amendment.",
      "But in the request for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer, the solicitor general, called Frimpong's injunction a \"straitjacket on law-enforcement efforts.\"",
      "\"The injunction wrongly brands countless lawful stops as unconstitutional, thereby hampering a basic law-enforcement tool, while turning every single stop in the District into a potential contempt trap,\" he wrote in a filing. \"No agent can confidently enforce the law and engage in routine stops when the district court may later refuse to credit that the stop reflected additional, permissible factors and instead treat virtually any stop as contemptuous misconduct.\"",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs said that the Trump administration's pattern of conducting immigration enforcement stops without reasonable suspicion has done \"immeasurable\" harm.",
      "\"Numerous U.S. citizens and others who are lawfully present in this country have been subjected to significant intrusions on their liberty. Many have been physically injured; at least two were taken to a holding facility.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Monday rejected a lawsuit filed by a group of states that challenged the mass firings of thousands of federal probationary workers.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit divided 2-1 in finding that the 19 states and the District of Columbia did not have legal standing to sue over the large-scale terminations. The appeals court sent the case back to the federal district court with directions to dismiss it.",
      "\"We acknowledge that the abrupt and indiscriminate dismissal of the probationary employees here exacted all-too-human costs upon those affected,\" Judge Harvie Wilkinson wrote for the two-judge majority. \"But this real impact on the employees, who are not parties here, cannot govern our review.\"",
      "Wilkinson wrote that while federal probationary workers \"suffered the brunt of the harm\" as a result of their firings, \"they are nowhere to be found in this case.\"",
      "Joining Wilkinson in the majority was Judge Allison Jones Rushing. Judge DeAndrea Gist Benjamin dissented.",
      "Probationary workers are those who generally have been in their jobs with the federal government for one or two years, depending on the nature of their jobs. Shortly after President Trump returned to the White House for a second term, his administration moved to lay off thousands of probationary workers as part of its goal of shrinking the size of the federal government.",
      "The terminations occurred in mid-February, when thousands of probationary workers began receiving notices from their agencies that they were laid off. Court filings indicate that at least 24,000 of these federal employees had been fired by early March.",
      "The 19 states and the District of Columbia swiftly filed a lawsuit against a slew of agencies challenging the mass firings, arguing that the terminations were unlawful because the Trump administration did not comply with a legal requirement to provide states with 60 days notice before a large-scale layoff.",
      "The states that sued were Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.",
      "In April, a federal district court in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to reinstate all affected probationary workers living or working in the states that sued. The district court also prohibited the government from conducting any future reductions-in-force unless they were in compliance with federal law.",
      "The 4th Circuit granted a Trump administration request to freeze the district court's decision, clearing the way for agencies to lay off probationary workers again. It heard arguments in the case in May.",
      "In his opinion, Wilkinson said that the interests at issue in the case are federal, so the states have no concrete injury that can be remedied by the courts.",
      "\"The federal government is required in all kinds of ways to respect the basic sovereignty of the states. But the reverse is also true,\" he wrote. \"It is hard to imagine a more traditionally federal function than the management of the federal workforce. The federal workforce performs federal functions. How it performs them is a matter of federal concern.\"",
      "He warned that if the court were to accept the states' theory of how they have been harmed, every change in federal funding levels would authorize states to sue the federal government.",
      "\"A contrary result would upend our federalist system by ceding federal sovereignty to the states,\" Wilkinson wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts has allowed President Trump to remove a member of the Federal Trade Commission for now.",
      "The chief justice granted interim relief to the Trump administration Monday while the Supreme Court takes more time to consider its request to lift a lower court order requiring Rebecca Kelly Slaughter to be reinstated to her position at the commission.",
      "Slaughter is one of several appointees at independent agencies that the president has removed since he returned to the White House. The Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission\u00a0while legal challenges to the removals move forward.",
      "Mr. Trump appointed Slaughter to the FTC in 2018, and former President Joe Biden reappointed her to the role. Her term was set to expire in 2029.",
      "But in March, Slaughter received an email from the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, which contained a message from Mr. Trump informing her that she had been removed from the FTC. Slaughter sued the president and officials at the commission, arguing that her removal violated the Federal Trade Commission Act. That law limits the grounds that a president can remove a commissioner to inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "In July, a federal district court in Washington, D.C., ruled in Slaughter's favor and found that Mr. Trump's removal was \"unlawful\" and \"without legal effect.\" The Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which declined last week to freeze the district court's order while it considers the case.",
      "The Trump administration then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "The dispute over Slaughter's firing involves the same agency and removal protections that were at issue in a 1935 case known as Humphrey's Executor v. United States. In that landmark decision, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the restrictions and ruled that Congress could enact for-cause removal protections for multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "But the high court has chipped away at that precedent in recent years and reasserted the president's power to remove executive officers without cause. In a recent cases involving Mr. Trump's removals of members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Supreme Court indicated it believes the entities exercise considerable executive power.",
      "In its request for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the modern FTC exercises \"vast executive authority,\" a change from the 1935-era commission.",
      "In addition to seeking to remove Slaughter, the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to take up the case and decide the merits before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rules.",

    "summary": "Justice Amy Coney Barrett spoke with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell for her first TV interview since joining the Supreme Court in 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Justice Amy Coney Barrett spoke with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell for her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court in October 2020, responding to criticism that the Supreme Court is allowing President Trump to expand the bounds of executive power and discussing the attacks waged on the federal judiciary.",
      "Selected by President Trump to succeed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died just weeks before the 2020 presidential election, Barrett's appointment to the high court widened its conservative majority to 6-3. At 53, she is likely to serve for decades.",
      "So far in her tenure on the Supreme Court, Barrett has been in the majority in landmark decisions overturning Roe v. Wade, ending affirmative action in higher education, and curbing federal regulatory power. She also joined with her conservative colleagues in ruling last year that former presidents have immunity from federal prosecution for official actions taken while in office.",
      "But this year, she earned the ire of some conservatives after declining to grant the Trump administration emergency relief during an early stage of a challenge to its freezing of foreign aid funding. Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts also joined with the three liberal justices in rejecting Mr. Trump's bid to delay his sentencing earlier this year for a felony criminal conviction in New York.",
      "Barrett has written a new book, \"Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution\" (which will be available to the public Sept. 9). She spoke with O'Donnell about an array of topics related to the Supreme Court, including how it handles emergency appeals, its June 2022 ruling unwinding the constitutional right to abortion, and the threats she has faced since becoming a justice.",
      "Here are five takeaways from Barrett's interview:",
      "Barrett details the decision overturning Roe v. Wade",
      "Shortly after Barrett joined the Supreme Court in October 2020, the high court agreed to take up a case that asked it to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to an abortion.",
      "In June 2022, a five-justice majority on the Supreme Court voted to dismantle the federal abortion protections, saying it would be up to states to decide the issue of abortion access. Barrett was among the five justices who voted to overturn Roe.",
      "Explaining the decision, Barrett said that the Supreme Court did not outlaw abortion through its ruling in the case, known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.",
      "\"Dobbs did not render abortion illegal. Dobbs did not say anything about whether abortion is immoral,\" she told O'Donnell. \"Dobbs said that these are questions that are left to the states. All of these kinds of questions, decisions that you mention that require medical judgments, are not ones that the Constitution commits to the court, you know, to decide how far into pregnancy the right of abortion might extend.\"",
      "Barrett said that before the Supreme Court overturned Roe, it had drawn lines.",
      "\"What Dobbs says is that those calls are properly left to the democratic process, and the states have been working those out,\" she said. \"There's been a lot of legislative activity and a lot of state constitutional activity since the decision in Dobbs was rendered.\"",
      "Since Roe was reversed, 14 states have enacted near-total bans on abortion, and a handful more have restricted access to the procedure. But 18 states protect abortion access.",
      "\"The question is how do you decide because I don't think that \u2014 well, certainly my children would say they don't want me deciding under the law of Amy what liberties, what rights we have and not. I mean, that's a job for the American people, and the Constitution leaves virtually every question like that to the democratic process, to the American people,\" she said.",
      "Barrett says emergency orders present \"challenge\" for the court",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to office for a second term, the Supreme Court has been asked by the Justice Department to intervene in the early stages of cases nearly two dozen times. These cases land on the court's emergency docket, or \"shadow docket,\" a term coined by a University of Chicago law professor in 2015.",
      "While emergency relief was typically sought in death penalty cases, the Supreme Court has in recent years been asked to issue interim orders that, if granted, remain in place while litigation moves through the lower courts.",
      "As federal judges have issued injunctions blocking many of Mr. Trump's policies this year, the Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to step in and freeze those orders, allowing it to continue enforcing a challenged policy as the cases proceed. The high court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of independent agencies, terminate grants from the Department of Education and National Institutes of Health, and move forward with agency plans to terminate thousands of federal workers, among other decisions.",
      "The Trump administration has prevailed in most of those emergency appeals. The Supreme Court's handling of those requests has sparked complaints from its critics, as it often does not provide a written explanation for its decision.",
      "\"The emergency orders present a challenge because they do require the work of the court to proceed far more quickly than it normally does,\" Barrett told O'Donnell.",
      "The justice said the Supreme Court \"typically moves slowly.\" When it agrees to hear a case and decide the merits, each side submits briefs presenting their legal arguments, the justices hear oral arguments and then typically spend weeks, if not months, working on opinions.",
      "\"I describe in the book the way that oral argument has grown and developed over 200 years, it's taken us to kind of settle into the way that we do arguments and opinions,\" Barrett said. \"The emergency docket moves much more quickly, and it is a much more recent phenomenon.\"",
      "She added: \"The emergency docket is newer, and so I would say those processes are still being shaped and sorted out.\"",
      "Barrett says it's \"wrong\" to suggest the Supreme Court has an agenda",
      "Mr. Trump shaped the current composition of the Supreme Court, appointing three of its nine justices \u2014 Barrett and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 during his first term.",
      "Critics of the Supreme Court have said the conservative majority has allowed Mr. Trump to expand the bounds of his power by granting the emergency relief he has sought. But Barrett rejected that contention.",
      "\"Justices and courts, district courts, are not trying to enable Congress or the executive to do anything. We're deciding cases,\" she told O'Donnell.",
      "Barrett said cases that come to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket are \"far more tentative,\" and there are more factors that the justices have to consider when asked to grant a stay, including whether the applicant will be irreparably harmed without relief.",
      "\"I think people will disagree with respect to any individual order, whether the court made the right judgment about the merits or not,\" she said. \"I think in so far as the question might suggest that the court has an agenda or some motive, that's just wrong.\"",
      "Barrett said it's not the Supreme Court's job to \"survey\" and form a political view, explaining \"our job is to decide these legal questions.\"",
      "Barrett details the threats she has received since joining the Supreme Court",
      "In May 2022, a draft of the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade was published by the news outlet Politico, an unprecedented leak that Chief Justice John Roberts denounced as a \"betrayal.\" The person who leaked the draft opinion has not been identified.",
      "In response, demonstrators appeared outside the homes of several of the conservative justices, including Barrett's, to protest Roe's impending reversal. The protests went on for months, and then-Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the U.S. Marshals Service to provide additional support to ensure the safety of the justices.",
      "Shortly after the leak, a California man allegedly armed with a gun, knife and various tools was arrested outside of Kavanaugh's Maryland house. He was charged with attempting to kill a Supreme Court justice and pleaded guilty in April of this year.",
      "Since then, judges across the country have continued to face threats to their safety and harassment. In July, three sitting federal judges spoke out about how they have been targeted after ruling against the Trump administration, including through \"swattings\" and \"pizza doxxings.\"",
      "Barrett's sister was the target of a bomb threat at her home in South Carolina, CNN reported in March. The justice herself is the \"not-so-proud owner\" of a bulletproof vest, she said, recalling one of her sons asking if he could try it on.",
      "\"Thinking, 'This is a parenting moment that I wasn't quite prepared for,' I said, 'Sure. Go ahead.' And he puts it on. And then he looked up at me and he said, 'Wait. Why do you have a bullet-proof vest?'\" Barrett recalled. \"So, you know, we've tried to explain those things to the kids.\"",
      "When demonstrators were protesting outside her home, Barrett said her family developed a safety routine for when her children would arrive to find them there. The justice recalled her son getting dropped off, and realizing she had forgotten to tell him there would be protesters outside.",
      "The justice confirmed to O'Donnell that she has received death threats, and condemned threats of violence.",
      "\"I think that it should not be the price of public service for any official, judges included, to face violence or threats of violence,\" she said.",
      "Barrett said she tries to tune out the criticism lodged against her, which has come from both sides of the aisle, and said judges have been the subject of attacks before.",
      "\"I think that's part of the risk of the job,\" she said. \"You know, many judges and justices before me have faced criticism and threats. And I am sure that will be true in the future. That's why it requires a stiff spine.\"",
      "Still, Barrett said she believes there has been a shift in the justices' experience on the Supreme Court that began after Justice Antonin Scalia died in 2016. Barrett said she is seldom alone now and rarely drives herself.",
      "Barrett said that she doesn't like \"not being anonymous,\" and acknowledged that working as a public servant comes at a cost, like losing your privacy.",
      "\"One of the things I miss is just being able to go to the grocery store and not worrying that someone's gonna recognize me. I don't like that part of it,\" she said. \"So I find the being a public figure and being with security, I've found that hard to get used to, even five years in.\"",
      "Barrett says being a justice requires a \"stomach for criticism\"",
      "Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court by Mr. Trump was praised by conservatives, but she has since received criticism from some of the president's allies for recent votes in cases involving him and his administration.",
      "Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who has compiled information for Mr. Trump about White House personnel, called Barrett a \"DEI appointee,\" referencing diversity, equity and inclusion, and Fox News host Mark Levin claimed the justice \"deceived people into thinking she was a reliable constitutionalist.\"",
      "\"I've been criticized by the left, I've been criticized by the right, I'm sure I've been criticized by the middle,\" Barrett said of the attacks on her. \"If you can't have a stomach for people not liking you, and if you don't have a stomach for criticism, then you're not suited to the role.\"",
      "Still, she acknowledged the difficulties of being \"unpopular.\"",
      "\"That's why being a judge \u2014 you know, people think it's glamorous but it's actually public service and hard work. I love it because I love the ability to serve my country, I think that's a privilege. I enjoy the work. I like my colleagues, my law clerks are wonderful,\" Barrett said. \"But there is this other side, you know, this personal cost, this willingness to be unpopular.\"",

      "\"I am pleased to announce this morning that the Department of Education will soon issue new guidance protecting the right to prayer in our public schools, and it's total protection,\" the president said, to applause and cheers from attendees ahead of a meeting of the Justice Department's Religious Liberty Commission.",

      "In a speech focused on religious liberty and his administration's work to protect the interests of religious conservatives, he said it's \"ridiculous\" that today's students are \"indoctrinated with anti-religious propaganda, and some are even punished for their religious beliefs.\"",
      "The president said the new guidance will support students like Hannah Allen, who was in the audience Monday. According to the First Liberty Institute, which represent Allen, Allen was praying for an injured peer in Honey Grove Middle School's cafeteria in Honey Grove, Texas in 2018. The school required the students to instead pray behind a curtain, move to an empty gym or go outside, the group said. Under pressure from religious liberty groups, the Honey Grove Texas Independent School District eventually reversed the decision.",

      "Mr. Trump also talked about his administration's efforts to offer tax credits for school choice scholarships, and his efforts to keep transgender students out of sports. The president suggested the nation's faith and success are linked.",

      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0The Minister of Health for the Democratic Republic of Congo, Samuel Roger Kamba, confirmed last week an outbreak of the highly infectious Zaire strain of Ebola virus disease in the country's Central Kasai Province. He said 16 deaths and 28 suspected cases had been confirmed, including four suspected infections among health care workers.",
      "World Health Organization regional director for Africa Mohamed Janabi said the first case, known as the index case, was a \"34-year-old pregnant woman who was admitted on August 20 and passed away on August 25 with typical features for hemorrhagic fever; bloody diarrhea, bleeding from the nose, vomiting, and bleeding from the rectum.\"",
      "The Ebola virus is transmitted to humans through close contact with infected wildlife, often bats, and can then spread through bodily fluids through close human-to-human contact. The WHO said that, as of Sept. 4, the case fatality rate in the Congo outbreak was 57%, with 80% of the cases in people aged 15 or older.",
      "This is the sixth Ebola outbreak within seven years in Congo, making it the highest concentration of outbreaks since the virus was first discovered in 1976.",
      "A team of first responders arrived Sunday in the Bulape health zone, where the outbreak has struck, with medical supplies.",
      "In the country's capital Kinshasa, health workers and first responders from the Ministry of Health, the WHO and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were given vaccinations ahead of deployments to the affected region.",
      "Congo currently has a stockpile of 2,000 vaccine doses and has ordered more to arrive in the coming days, according to the WHO.",
      "Patrick Otim, the WHO's emergency response coordinator for the area, told reporters during a Sept. 4 briefing that the United Nations agency was already working to trace close contacts with known cases, increase field lab testing capacity and community response to ensure early reporting.",
      "He acknowledged that the DRC had requested additional vaccines and stressed that, as \"early supportive care is key to lifesaving,\" the WHO was working to deliver more medical supplies, including protective clothing and other items \"necessary to manage the outbreak.\"",
      "The last two outbreaks, in 2022, were contained quickly, said Otim, but he noted that they were addressed before the Trump administration severely cut funding for international health programs, including the WHO.",
      "Those cuts have fueled concern in Africa and elsewhere about the ability of individual nations and global agencies to respond to and quickly contain outbreaks of diseases including Ebola \u2014 and to keep such deadly viruses from reaching U.S. shores.",
      "\"The recent cuts will definitely have an impact,\" Otim said at the briefing. \"As a global community, we need to work together to stop this virus, as diseases do not respect borders.\"",
      "\"What we know (from past outbreaks) is you need to get supplies and resources as soon as possible to stop transmission,\" Otim added.",
      "President Trump announced in January that the U.S. \u2014 long a key stakeholder and largest donor to the agency \u2014 would be pulling out of the WHO, with the White House citing \"the organization's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\"",
      "The Trump administration, at the time, also accused the WHO of demanding \"unfairly onerous payments from the United States, far out of proportion with other countries' assessed payments.\"",
      "The WHO warned almost immediately that, given the uncertainty over future U.S. funding, it was cutting back spending in ways that could impact its operations.",

      "\"We hold that the district court did not err in any of the challenged rulings and that the jury's duly rendered damages awards were reasonable in light of the extraordinary and egregious facts of this case,\" three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit wrote in a unanimous opinion.",
      "The decision is the latest defeat for Mr. Trump in a case that dates back to 2019, when Carroll first went public with allegations that he sexually assaulted her in a department store decades earlier.",
      "Roberta Kaplan, an attorney for Carroll, lauded the decision, saying the appeals panel concluded that \"Carroll was telling the truth, and that President Donald Trump was not.\" Kaplan noted that the court found Mr. Trump was \"recklessly indifferent\" to Carroll's \"health and safety\" when making defamatory statements about her.",
      "\"We look forward to an end to the appellate process so that justice will finally be done,\" Kaplan said.",
      "Lawyers for the president argued that he was shielded in the case by presidential immunity, that the trial court made a series of improper decisions and that the damages awarded to Carroll were excessive. The appeals court rejected their arguments in each instance.",
      "A spokesman for Mr. Trump's legal team decried \"the political weaponization of our justice system,\" calling the case a \"Democrat-funded travesty.\"",
      "\"President Trump will keep winning against Liberal Lawfare, as he is focusing on his mission to Make America Great Again,\" the spokesman said.",
      "Carroll has twice prevailed over Mr. Trump at trial. In 2023, a federal jury in New York awarded her $5 million while finding Mr. Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The same appeals court in June upheld that judgment. That case involved allegations that Mr. Trump forcefully inserted his fingers into Ms. Carroll, which the jury concluded was substantiated by a preponderance of evidence.",
      "In 2024, a separate jury heard evidence related to additional defamatory remarks made by Mr. Trump about Carroll. The appeals court noted in its decision Monday that \"he made several disruptive comments and gestures in front of the judge and jury.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's defamatory statements included him both denying Carroll's allegations and insisting she had made them up.",
      "During the 2024 trial, the jury heard evidence and analysis pointing to significant reputational and personal damage suffered by Carroll in the wake of Mr. Trump's denials.",
      "Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, implored the jury to award Carroll enough to \"make him stop\" defaming her client.",

    "published": "Mon, 08 Sep 2025 11:07:04 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow it to freeze billions of dollars in foreign aid funding.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow it to freeze billions of dollars in foreign aid funding, seeking its intervention in a clash over the president's refusal to spend money allocated by Congress for foreign assistance programs.",
      "The Trump administration is asking the high court to partially halt a lower court order that required it to spend more than $4 billion in aid by the end of September. Mr. Trump is attempting to claw back that money, which has already been approved by Congress, through a rarely used maneuver known as a pocket rescission.",
      "The dispute also involves another $6.5 billion in foreign assistance, though the Justice Department has said it is taking steps to obligate those funds by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.",
      "The legal fight quickly arrived at the Supreme Court after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled last week that the executive branch had to spend the $4 billion in foreign aid funding that Congress had appropriated. The Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to freeze that decision, though it declined to do so last Friday.",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the district court's injunction \"raises a grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers.\" He is asking the Supreme Court to pause the district court's order only as to the $4 billion that Mr. Trump is attempting to rescind.",
      "\"The President can hardly speak with one voice in foreign affairs or in dealings with Congress when the district court is forcing the Executive Branch to advocate against its own objectives,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Since returning to the White House, the Trump administration has canceled billions of dollars in contracts and grants that it says do not align with the president's policy objectives. On the first day of his second term, the president signed an executive order that called for a 90-day pause in foreign aid and said administration officials would determine whether to continue or cease each foreign assistance program.",
      "Congressional Democrats estimate that more than $425 billion in federal funding has been canceled or frozen by the president.",
      "The latest dispute before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of nonprofits and businesses that receive money for foreign assistance projects. The plaintiffs argued that the 90-day freeze was an unconstitutional exercise of the president's authority.",
      "The case has already landed at the Supreme Court, though in an earlier stage in the proceedings. In early March, the high court split 5-4 in rejecting a bid from the president to keep $2 billion in foreign aid frozen while the case moved forward.",
      "The case has progressed since then. Last month, a three-judge panel on the D.C. Circuit said that the nonprofits and businesses could not sue. The 2-1 panel wiped away an order from Ali that had prohibited the government from impounding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit panel issued an amended opinion late last month that opened up an avenue for the nonprofits and businesses to seek relief on different legal grounds.",
      "On the heels of that decision, Mr. Trump sent a letter to Congress proposing to rescind a total of $4.9 billion, which includes funding for the State Department, international development programs and the the U.S. Agency for International Development, which the president has moved to shutter.",
      "The president's plan is an attempt to roll back funding unilaterally and has not been done in nearly 50 years. One Republican has called the effort \"unlawful\" and said the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the power of the purse.",
      "The plaintiffs in the case sought a new preliminary injunction. Last week, Ali found that the government has a statutory duty to spend the $4 billion that is subject to Mr. Trump's rescission proposal. He ordered the Trump administration to spend the expiring funds approved by Congress for foreign assistance, unless Congress claws it back in accordance with the procedures laid out in federal law.",
      "In seeking relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer, the solicitor general, said Ali's injunction \"puts the executive branch at war with itself\" by requiring it to spend the same $4 billion that the president wants to claw back.",

    "summary": "Ryan Routh, 59, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign and will be representing himself at trial.",
    "story": [
      "Jury selection is set to begin Monday in the criminal trial of Ryan Routh, the man charged with trying to assassinate President Trump last year in South Florida.",
      "Routh, 59, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations, is set to represent himself in the trial, after a federal judge signed off on his request earlier this year. He has also pleaded not guilty to state charges of terrorism and attempted murder.",
      "Opening statements are expected on Sept. 11.",
      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Mr. Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on Sept. 15 at his West Palm Beach country club. A Secret Service agent spotted Routh before Mr. Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot.",
      "Prosecutors also alleged in court filings that Routh attempted to acquire an anti-aircraft weapon to shoot down Mr. Trump's plane.",
      "The government said that in August 2024, \"Routh sought to purchase the devices online from an associate Routh believed to be a Ukrainian with access to military weapons.\"",
      "Routh allegedly told an associate to \"'send me an rpg [rocket propelled grenade] or stinger and I will see what we can do,'\" according to the court document.",
      "\"I need equipment so that Trump cannot get elected,\" Routh told his associate.",
      "The government said Routh also sought to purchase a .50 caliber rifle the same month, and this rifle would have been an even more destructive and powerful version of the one he had already allegedly obtained. Prosecutors said Routh hoped to purchase the .50 caliber rifle at a gun show, but his contact was ultimately not able to locate the type of gun Routh wanted until after the assassination attempt at the golf course.",
      "Routh was armed with an AK-47-style rifle and was allegedly 300-500 yards away from Mr. Trump when the Secret Service agent spotted his rifle in the tree line, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.",
      "Two people have been charged with selling the gun to Routh, though both defendants told law enforcement they did not have any advance knowledge of Routh's alleged plans.",
      "Two defendants \u2014 Tina Brown Cooper and Ronnie Jay Oxendine \u2014 have pleaded guilty to gun-related charges in federal court, after being indicted in March and arrested in April. Cooper pleaded guilty to firearm trafficking on Monday, and Oxendine pleaded guilty last month to possessing an unregistered firearm after police found a short-barreled shotgun in his storage building.",
      "In court papers filed in both cases as part of the plea agreements, the Justice Department said the two sold Routh a Chinese-made SKS rifle in August, with Cooper allegedly acting as a middleman in a sale between Routh and Oxendine. Law enforcement said Cooper worked for Oxendine at the time of the sale at a roofing company in Greensboro, North Carolina.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged Cooper, Routh and Oxendine met at the roofing company's headquarters, where Routh paid Oxendine $350 cash for the SKS rifle and $100 to Cooper for helping to arrange the sale.",
      "About six weeks later, Routh was allegedly found with an SKS-style rifle outside Mr. Trump's golf club in West Palm Beach. In a filing in Routh's criminal case, prosecutors said the gun he brought to Trump International Golf Club was the same one allegedly sold to him by Oxendine and Cooper.",
      "Records show Routh's issues with the law go back to the 1990s and include lesser charges of writing bad checks. But in 2002 he was charged with possession of a weapon of mass destruction, a felony, according to North Carolina Department of Corrections records. In another incident, he was charged with misdemeanors, including a hit-and-run offense, resisting arrest, and a concealed weapons violation, the records show.",
      "But his son, Oren Routh, told CBS News his father wasn't violent, and he said he was \"definitely surprised\" by the latest allegations.",
      "\"He's a good person and has been a hard worker his whole life. He's a great man and good dad, non-violent, and was never abusive. I was definitely surprised this happened. He taught us to work hard and be good people. I haven't known him to own guns or ever hurt anyone in any way, always tried to help his community in any and every way possible,\" Oren Routh said.",
      "Routh voted Democratic in the 2024 primary election in North Carolina, and he voted in person, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections. He appears to be registered as an unaffiliated voter.",
      "His account on X, formerly known as Twitter, has now been suspended, and it included a number of posts about Mr. Trump.",
      "Since being granted the ability to defend himself in court, Routh's filings have been filled with rants about Mr. Trump and international affairs. In a motion to attempt to dismiss evidence that the Justice Department says it will present during his trial, Routh said he would trade the evidence being submitted into the record in exchange for a subpoena of Mr. Trump, calling him a \"dumbass\" and even suggesting \"a round of golf with the racist pig,\" and if Trump wins, Trump \"can execute me.\"",

    "story": [
      "Patients begin lining up before dawn at Operation Border Health, an annual five-day health clinic in Texas' Rio Grande Valley. Many residents in this predominantly Latino and Hispanic region spanning the Mexican border lack insurance, making the health fair a major source of free medical care in South Texas for more than 25 years.",
      "Until this year. The Trump administration's plan to strip more than $550 million in federal public health and pandemic funds from Texas helped prompt cancellation of the event just before its scheduled July 21 start.",
      "\"Some people come every year and rely on it,\" said Hidalgo County Health and Human Services Director Dairen Sarmiento Rangel. \"Some people even camp out outside of Border Health so they can be the first in line to receive services. This event is very important to our community.\"",
      "States and local governments have made painful program cuts in the wake of major reductions in federal health funding that have already taken effect. Now, they're sizing up the financial hits to come \u2014 some not until late next year or beyond \u2014 from the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" the tax and spending law congressional Republicans passed in July that enacts much of President Trump's domestic agenda.",
      "Texas, for instance, expects to see its federal Medicaid funds reduced by as much as $39 billion\u00a0over 10 years due to new barriers for enrollment, such as more frequent eligibility checks, according to a July analysis by KFF.",
      "Taken together, the reductions amount to a seismic shift in how state health programs are provided and paid for. The administration is, in effect, pushing a significant amount of health costs to states. That will force their leaders to make difficult choices, as many state budgets are already strained by declining tax revenues, a slowdown in federal pandemic spending, and economic uncertainty.",
      "Revenue forecasters in more than a dozen states have lowered expectations for the coming year, according to a June report by Pew.",
      "\"It's almost inevitable that states will enact a number of cuts to health services because of the fiscal pressure,\" said Wesley Tharpe, senior adviser for state tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Some are proactively trying to stanch the impact.",
      "Hawaii lawmakers are looking to aid nonprofits that are already contending with federal funding cuts. They're doling out $50 million in grants to health, social service, and other nonprofits hit by federal funding cuts. To get the money, nonprofits must show a termination or drop in funding, or that they have otherwise been harmed by the cuts.",
      "\"It is not fair that organizations dedicated to supporting the people of Hawaii are being forced to scale back due to federal funding cuts,\" Democratic Gov. Josh Green said in a statement.",
      "Other states are scaling back projects to contend with cuts. Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer, a Democrat, received notice in March that the Trump administration was cutting $38 million in public health funding from the state. The next month, state legislative leaders halted a planned project to upgrade and expand the Capitol complex as a result.",
      "\"We recognized that the reckless federal cuts to the social safety nets of thousands of Delawareans called for us to hold back resources to protect our most vulnerable,\" said David Sokola, president pro tempore of the Delaware Senate.",
      "In New Mexico, the state with the highest percentage of residents enrolled in Medicaid, a bipartisan group of lawmakers voted to create a trust fund to boost funding for the program. About 10% of the more than 800,000 state residents covered by Medicaid and the related Children's Health Insurance Program could lose their health coverage under the federal spending law, based on some estimates.",
      "Some state leaders are warning constituents that the worst may be yet to come.",
      "At an Aug. 18 event at a hospital in the South Bronx section of New York City, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, stood on stage among health care workers in white coats to skewer Trump's new law.",
      "\"What Republicans in Washington have done through the 'Big Ugliest Bill' I've ever seen is literally screwing New Yorkers,\" she said. The state's health system is bracing for nearly $13 billion in annual cuts.",
      "And in California, lawmakers weighed the impact of the coming cuts from the federal law at a general assembly committee hearing on Aug. 20, where some Democratic legislators said state efforts to protect reproductive health services and other programs were in jeopardy.",
      "\"We've been bracing for this reality: President Trump's so-called 'Big, Beautiful Bill' is now law,\" Democratic lawmaker Gregg Hart said at the hearing, calling it a \"direct assault on California's core programs and our values.\"",
      "\"Sadly, the reality is, the state does not have the capacity to backfill all of these draconian federal funding cuts in the current budget,\" Hart said. \"We cannot simply write a check and make this go away.\"",
      "The sweeping budget law, which passed without any Democratic support, will reduce federal spending on Medicaid by about $1 trillion over the next decade, based on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. The spending reductions largely come from the imposition of a work requirement on people who've obtained Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act's expansion, as well as other new barriers to coverage.",
      "The law will mean more than 7.5 million people will lose Medicaid coverage and become uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office, while extending tax cuts for wealthy people who, Democrats say, don't need them. Republicans and Trump have said the spending package and its accompanying program cuts were necessary to prevent fraud and waste, and to sustain Medicaid, a state-federal program for people with disabilities and lower incomes.",
      "\"The One Big Beautiful Bill removes illegal aliens, enforces work requirements, and protects Medicaid for the truly vulnerable,\" the White House said in a June 29 statement.",
      "The Medicaid cuts won't begin until after the midterm elections in November 2026, but other cuts have already hit.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to claw back $11 billion in federal public health funds earmarked to states because of the pandemic, spurring a legal fight\u00a0with a coalition of Democratic-led states. It also cut about $1 billion in federal grants for mental health services in schools, and halted grants from the National Institutes of Health that provided money to more than 90 public universities.",
      "HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard said the agency is prioritizing investments that advance Mr. Trump's mandate to confront chronic disease. She defended some of the cuts and said, erroneously, that the spending law doesn't cut Medicaid.",
      "\"The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a crisis that Americans moved on from years ago,\" she said.",
      "State leaders say the pandemic funding the administration wants returned was earmarked for other public health measures, such as tracking emerging diseases, outbreak responses, and staffing. State attorneys general in May won a temporary restraining order against the administration.",
      "\"What we're seeing now is states anticipating big cuts in Medicaid coming, but they're also dealing with a whole variety of federal cutbacks in public health programs that are smaller but still quite meaningful,\" said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Part of the challenge for states is simply understanding the changes.",
      "\"I think it's fair to say there is concern, confusion, and uncertainty,\" said Kathryn Costanza, a Medicaid expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "States are struggling to sort it all out, forming advisory groups that are tracking federal changes, suing to try to block the cuts, and reallocating funding.",
      "In Colorado, lawmakers passed a bill to let state Medicaid dollars pay for non-abortion care at Planned Parenthood of America clinics after Mr. Trump's law banned federal funding for such care. Whether the ban holds up in court remains to be seen.",
      "The Louisiana Legislature sent $7.5 million to state universities to make up for cuts to federal research funding, much of which goes to health-related research.",
      "And in South Dakota, the state's largest food bank has asked lawmakers to spend $3 million to make up for funding cuts to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "States must balance their budgets every year, so cuts put many services at risk if state lawmakers are unwilling to raise taxes. The work will begin in earnest in January, when many states begin new legislative sessions.",
      "And the tough choices are likely to continue. Congressional House Republicans are considering legislation that could bring more cuts, including by slashing the generous cost sharing the federal government provides for 20 million adults who enrolled in Medicaid under the ACA's Medicaid expansion.",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, said Sunday that President Trump \"essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation\" referring to his recent remarks about Chicago. But she outlined that \"we don't have any indications\" that the administration is getting ready to send troops into the nation's third-largest city, despite signals in recent weeks that he is preparing to do so.",
      "\"This is not normal,\" Duckworth said of Mr. Trump's statements on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"This is not acceptable behavior.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Mr. Trump shared a screenshot that read \"Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR,\" alongside an AI-generated image that appeared to be inspired by the movie \"Apocalypse Now.\" On Friday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War, though a formal name change would have to go through Congress. He is expected to seek congressional approval.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday that \"we're not going to war.\"",
      "\"We're going to clean up our cities. We're going to clean them up so they don't kill five people every weekend,\" the president said. \"That's not war, that's common sense.\"",
      "The post marked the latest in a series of threats Mr. Trump has made to send troops to Chicago as part of a nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration and crime, following his decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in June. California Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged the legality of that deployment, and a judge ruled last week that it violated federal law, although the ruling appeared to only apply to California.",
      "Despite Mr. Trump's rhetoric, Vice President JD Vance said in recent days that the administration has \"no immediate plans\" to send National Guard forces to Chicago. The comments came one day after Mr. Trump again suggested he would send federal forces to Chicago, saying \"we're going in.\"",
      "Still, Duckworth said she takes what the president says seriously.",
      "\"I take what the president of the United States says very seriously, because that is the respect you have to give to the office,\" Duckworth said. \"And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear: it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the President of the United States.\"",
      "Duckworth was among a group of Illinois leaders who visited the Naval Station Great Lakes Saturday, following news that some federal immigration enforcement agents will be based there. She said military leadership confirmed that the only assistance they've been requested to provide to the federal government is for office space for ICE.",
      "\"No barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared in order to support troops into Chicago,\" Duckworth said.",
      "The Illinois Democrat said \"we certainly have sent the administration multiple inquiries about what they are planning on doing,\" adding that the administration hasn't reached out to local law enforcement to try to coordinate.",
      "\"If they were truly, truly interested in fighting crime, then they would work with local law enforcement and ask them, 'What do you need? What help do you need?'\" Duckworth said. \"And we've not gotten any, any communications or feedback from the administration whatsoever.\"",
      "The developments come after Mr. Trump deployed the National Guard in Washington, D.C. last month as part of an anti-crime initiative, while vowing to intervene in cities like Chicago and Baltimore next.",

    "summary": "Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett said the Federal Reserve's monetary policy \"needs to be fully independent of political influence \u2014 including from President Trump.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett, who President Trump has said is on his shortlist to become the next chair of the Federal Reserve, said Sunday that the Federal Reserve's monetary policy \"needs to be fully independent of political influence \u2014 including from President Trump.\"",
      "\"The fact is that we've looked at countries that have allowed the leaders to take over the central banks, and what tends to happen is that it's a recipe for inflation and misery for consumers,\" Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The comments came after Mr. Trump said Friday that Hassett is among three candidates he's considering to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term is up in 2026. Powell, has faced intense pressure from the president to cut interest rates, spurring questions about the White House's influence at the central bank.",
      "Hassett said central bank independence is something \"Democrats and Republicans in the White House all agree about.\"",
      "\"Now the question is, has the current central bank been as independent as we would like, as transparent as we would like, and I think that there's some dispute about that,\" Hasset added.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for changes to the Federal Reserve and a widespread review of the institution in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Friday, writing that \"mission creep and institutional bloat threaten the central bank's independence.\" Hassett said on Sunday that he agrees with Bessent's piece, but he wouldn't commit to implementing his ideas should he become the next Fed chair.",
      "\"I agree with his vision, but I look forward to the president deciding who's going to be the Federal Reserve Chair, and I think that he and Secretary Bessent will do that ably,\" Hassett said. \"There are a lot of great candidates.\"",
      "Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller and former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh are also on Mr. Trump's shortlist.",
      "Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from the central bank, as well as selecting a top economic aide as a replacement for another post on the board of governors, have sparked questions around independence at the Federal Reserve in recent weeks, raising concerns among Wall Street analysts that the White House is trying to wrest control of the historically independent central bank.",
      "Stephen Miran, Mr. Trump's pick to join a vacated seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, testified on Capitol Hill last week and sparked criticism from Democrats after he suggested he wouldn't immediately resign from his White House role if he was confirmed.",
      "Miran, who currently chairs the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged at the hearing that Mr. Trump selected him \"because I have policy views that I suppose that he liked.\" But he pledged that if confirmed, he would \"act independently.\"",
      "\"I couldn't be more in agreement that independence of the central bank is of paramount importance for the economy, for financial markets, for the long-run stewardship of the country,\" Miran said.",
      "CBS News polling released Sunday found that 68% of Americans want the Federal Reserve to make decisions independently from Mr. Trump. But 59% of Republicans say the Fed should be guided by what the president wants.",
      "The developments come as U.S. employers added 22,000 jobs in August, according to the August jobs report released Friday, falling short of economists' expectations. Hiring was lower-than-expected in July as well, a pattern that complicates the Federal Reserve's next rate cut decision, set for Sept. 17.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Roger Marshall, Republican of Kansas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We turn now to Republican Senator Roger Marshall, who joins us this morning from Wichita, Kansas. Welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Margaret, great to be with you. I know it's going to be a great discussion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you were an OB-GYN in practice for decades before you ran for office. This past week, the HHS Secretary underwent intense questioning from both democratic lawmakers, and some of your fellow Republicans, who were also doctors. Take a listen.",
      "((BEGIN VIDEO CLIP))",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO:\u00a0 Secretary Kennedy, in your confirmation hearing, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines. Since then, I've grown deeply concerned.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I would say, effectively, we're denying people vaccine.",
      "((END VIDEO CLIP))",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the Republican Whip, and that is the Chair of the Committee, Bill Cassidy. Why do you think they're off base and they're concerned?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, President Trump chose Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be a disrupter to the CDC, and that's exactly what he's doing. He's focused on making the CDC more transparent, to make it more trustworthy right now. Right now, Americans don't trust the CDC, so he is literally turning that place upside down. I respect what my colleagues are saying, but I think that, you know, this whole issue today, or in that meeting, was about vaccines. In my humble opinion, not every person needs every vaccine. And I don't think there's many children out there that need 76 jabs by the time they're old enough to vote. But before you label me a non-vaxxer-person, look, I've raised money for polio vaccinations. The MMR is a great vaccine. It saved thousands of lives. Vaccines, overall, have saved hundreds of millions of lives, but not every person needs every vaccine. And we just want to empower parents and the doctors to make great decisions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I just want to unpack a few things you said there, and just very- because we want to be very careful in this very heated environment. When you say you have a problem with trusting the CDC, it was just a few weeks ago a gunman walked onto the CDC campus in Atlanta and shot the place up. Do you care to respond to that? And do you think that we need to be careful when we are discussing the CDC and public health officials right now?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Well, look, of course, I condemn that shooting. But the lack of confidence in the CDC goes back to what the CDC did during Covid. They misguided us, maybe lied to us, even, about the origins of Covid, and how to treat it, as well. And the vaccine, they over-promised what the vaccine could do as well. So that's where the distrust is. And now, Bobby Kennedy is in there, trying to clean-up that distrust, and trying to give American parents and grandparents and the doctors the right information, transparent information, to make good decisions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, just before we talk about other vaccines, specific to Covid, and what you just said with the CDC; it was- the pandemic was during the Trump administration. It began during the Trump administration, and Operation Warp Speed was a Presidential Directive by Trump, which some of your fellow Republicans say he deserves the Nobel Prize for because it stopped the pandemic. So, did you trust the CDC and Operation Warp Speed under President Trump, or are you saying you don't think the President deserves the prize for that shot?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look President Trump absolutely deserves the Nobel prize. That vaccine saved millions of lives --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay, but you just said something that sounded very contradictory to that. --",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I disagree. I think it's such a different time today than it was five years ago. Five years ago, we had a novel virus. None of us had any immunity to it. It was a strange virus made in a lab in Wuhan, China. But today, on average, Americans have had Covid five times. We now have natural immunity to it, and not everybody needs the vaccine. So both things can be true, and that's why, when you have people who don't understand science, that don't understand medicine, why they don't get it. It was a different day then than it is today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but people do understand that when they go into their pharmacy and have a problem getting a shot. Because in many states, they are now told they need to go back and get a prescription, that the effect, here, of the Kennedy policies are making it more difficult, even if they fall into categories where they should be able to get a shot. You would acknowledge that?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Yeah. Yeah, I think you're making this way, way too complicated. That- look, vaccines are a medicine, and just like you need a prescription to get a GLP-1 --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. You said he's disrupting. But, effectively, what you were hearing the Republican Whip John Barrasso, and the Republican Senator Bill Cassidy talk about was the interruption of the availability of vaccine. Cassidy said, I would say, effectively, we're denying people vaccines. That's not Margaret Brennan, that's Bill Cassidy.",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, I disagree, respectfully disagree. Think about this, what the CDC is now saying is if you're over the age of 65, you can have the vaccine. It's interesting that the UK and France have set 75 and 80 as the age. So, all you need to do is email or call your doctor's nurse and get a prescription, and you should be able to get it. If you're over the age of 6 months, it's probably a good idea to talk to your doctor. And all your nurse has to do is look at the chart and say, oh, little Johnny's got asthma, definitely needs the vaccination as well. So I think we're making this way too complicated. Why does everybody lose their minds when it comes to Covid vaccine? Why can't we let the doctor and the parents decide? Let the patients decide. There's so many more important things out there we should be talking about: Chronic diseases, 20% of our adolescents have obesity, mental health problems in- and are on prescription drugs. There's so many more things to talk about than just Covid vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but I think we're conflating a few things, including the operational aspect of this. I think people get frustrated with their insurance companies. I think people get frustrated with their pharmacies and the implementation of health policy. And you know that that's more complicated than just saying we're changing a few things here. There are big implications, and I want to talk to you about it because you said you like the MMR vaccine. You like DPT, Polio, Smallpox. You don't like Hepatitis B, which is a liver infection, and you don't think newborn kids need to be vaccinated against it. Senator Cassidy, who is a liver doctor, said he treated poor and underserved patients and that it can be a life-altering condition for the rest of your life. So why isn't it a compelling argument to you, that this should be available?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I delivered a baby- delivered a baby every day for 25 years. We did a Hepatitis test on every one of my patients at the time of delivery. If that mom has a negative Hepatitis test, she's in a stable, monogamous relationship, she's not doing IV drugs, she's not letting her baby play in a sandbox full of used needles, then there's zero chance that that baby's going to have Hepatitis. Now, there's other moms that- or other babies that do need it, okay. We need to be more specific. We can't be overly-prescriptive. If that mom has not had prenatal care, if she's an IV drug-abuser, if she's not in a stable relationship, a whole lot of reasons, but we need to pick-and-choose. Not every baby needs Hepatitis vaccine, and especially on day number one. What are these vaccines doing to mess with the immune system of that particular baby as well? So, that's my concern. It's not every baby needs Hepatitis-B vaccine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I understand it can also be spread from- in a household sharing toothbrushes or razors or, for example, if her partner was not monogamous, the pregnant lady, for example. But I hear your point here that you want this to be more bespoke, like, more picking-and-choosing. But others would argue, here, that in doing that, you're going to drive down immunization rates overall, if you create broader doubt in vaccines, and that it's a slippery slope, here. Are you at all concerned that that is going to be the takeaway?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, Anthony Fauci did more to create vaccine hesitancy than Bobby Kennedy will do in his four years, or eight years, however long he has Secretary. That's where the problem is. So, don't blame Bobby Kennedy for the problems created by Anthony Fauci. But this- but I'm just telling --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- I'm asking you about what you said about the Hepatitis-B vaccine.",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wasn't talking about Bobby Kennedy, or Secretary Kennedy. I was talking about you, and what you said about the Hepatitis-B vaccine, and are you concerned that picking-and-choosing these things like this, this bespoke concept of giving more choice, that it also has the effect of undermining confidence in vaccines?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I think this is a big difference between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats want a one-size-fits-all prescription for everybody. And I'm telling you, not everybody reads the- reads the book does exactly like that. I have confidence in doctors, and nurses, and parents, and grandparents to make these decisions. I don't think that we should have one government policy that dictates every one of these vaccines. I think local policy, local schools, if they want to have requirements, what Florida did was a bridge too far. But how about just a little common sense? Just a little common sense would go a long ways here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, because President Trump said he had some doubts about that Florida statement you just mentioned there, too, and that he likes a lot of vaccines. Before I let you go, Secretary Kennedy founded this group that is arguing that women taking Tylenol or Acetaminophen might be putting their babies at risk. They claim there's a link to neurodevelopmental disorders. Would you take- tell a pregnant woman to take a Tylenol and not feel worried about it?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, Tylenol is a Category-B drug. I've given it to lots of patients. It's on the approved- approved list. But, that being said, I try to tell my patients- my pregnant woman, not to take anything, because we don't know what we don't know. I'm very cautious. You know, why- why did 20% of our children have some type of mental health illness right now? Why do we have so many peanut allergies? Why do we have so many people with autoimmune diseases? We- so we don't know. What we don't know, we don't know, and I want gold standard studies to help us figure this out and sort it out. But as far as I know, Tylenol is okay in pregnancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator, we'll leave it there for today. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner. Good morning, Senator, good to have you here in person. You are known for your intel work, but you're also on a number of other committees. We were just there talking about the economy. Do you agree that basically, the economic data that the United States releases is potentially fundamentally flawed?",
      "SEN. MARK WARNER: No, I think that the BLS has been the gold standard for years, viewed not only in this country, but around the world. Could there be reforms? Absolutely, but it's a little ironic that you're firing the referee, the president firing the head, cutting the staff. I'm not sure how that is going to improve the quality of the data. And the President had promised that a golden age from American workers. We're down 80,000 manufacturing jobs since the beginning of his term. We're basically a flat hiring position. And what I think families who are listening, if anybody's got a family, a family member that's in college or immediately getting out of college. You know what a tough job market is to find this. And one of the things I would like to have heard from Kevin, and frankly, from more economists, is we're about to see the biggest job dislocation in our history, I believe, in terms of AI job dislocation. And those are many times kind of college driven jobs. I mean, think back five years ago, we said to every kid, if you want to get a good job, go become a computer programmer. Those are going to be some of the first jobs ignored and eliminated. And so I just, I'm fearful that this focus on who's keeping score when I think the American public realized the job market is tough, and particularly in terms of manufacturing jobs, there is no golden age.,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and there's also a fundamental remaking of the economy, if you're talking about artificial intelligence. So on that point quickly, there were more than a dozen tech titans at the White House this week, including some of these giants in the artificial intelligence space. Microsoft's founder Bill Gates, Google CEO, Apple CEO, and they were all around the table praising President Trump for the investment in chip manufacturing. And AI, do you deserve- Do you think he does deserve that praise?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I can tell you the chip manufacturing came about because of a bill that John Cornyn and I put in under Biden the Chips Infrastructure Act\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bipartisan.",
      "SEN. WARNER: $52 billion totally bipartisan. President Trump has been very times critical of that bill. Now he is, I think, sending a bit of a mixed message, because some of the investments in that bill were going to Intel, our last meaning, meaningful fabricator of chips. He took an equity stake there, which is debatable, although I do think getting some of the profits\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Taxpayers own 10% of the company now.",
      "SEN. WARNER: But here's the weird thing, while he's trying to support American chip manufacturing, at the same time, he's taken off any of the restrictions on, for example, Nvidia H-20 chips to sell to China. So what- How do we read this if we want to say we want to build American capacity until, yes, make sure we maintain our lead against China. Well, why sell some of our most cutting edge chips to China? It is a complete contradiction in in policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the White House says, Oh, they're not great chips, so therefore we can, can sell them. That's what the Commerce Secretary has said. But on, on the intelligence beat, as the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, you have an oversight authority, and under law, the Intel agencies must inform that committee about their operations. The CIA has to tell you about covert actions. This is an important kind of oversight, but this past week, you said you were blocked from even attending a meeting at the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency out in Virginia. Why do you think you were blocked? And has your Republican counterpart promised you that this isn't going to continue.",
      "SEN. WARNER: I have done these visits to our intel facilities for the 10 plus years I've either been Chair or Vice Chair of the Intelligence Committee. They are part of the normal course. You get a chance to see the workforce, where they're working. You get to see the new, newest, best, coolest stuff, and oftentimes I get to do a town hall meeting, because I'm not only the Chair or Vice Chair, but many of these facilities are in Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEN. WARNER: So this, this meeting have been on the books for literally weeks. Normal course of business. This very unusual individual, Laura Loomer, who is a right wing blogger who is so controversial that the Trump administration didn't even put her in- in their cabinet or- and she has been a 9/11 denier. She's been a virulent anti-anti-Muslim individual. She has been a big proponent of working with white nationalists, yet she seems to have the ear of President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She speaks to top advisors including the Secretary of State.",
      "CROSSTALK",
      "SEN. WARNER: His first National Security Advisor- National Security Advisor got kicked out because she went after him, the head of the National Security Agency who I saw with recently, General Tim Hawk got fired. She claimed that firing. Recently, we've seen 37 senior intel facility individuals lose their, their security classification, which basically puts them out of a job. And she brags about all this on her blog. I mean, it really raises the question, is she actually the Acting Secretary of Defense or Secretary of War as of this morning? Is she the real Director of National Intelligence? What she went after me on was something unrelated to this, and said, Why can we let some anti Trump person in to a intelligence facility? Strangely enough, Tuesday night, my meeting was canceled. Now we're not going to stand up for that. I've talked to my Republican colleagues\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, is Tom Cotton promising you this won't happen again?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I'm going to get those meetings held. I have raised it with Cotton. I've raised it with the other intelligence members. You want to talk about something that is dangerous, you restrict Congress's ability to do oversight, particularly with this administration, then we are flying blind. And in the intelligence space in particular, not every member can do this. Those of us who are senior on the Intel Committee, we are the limited numbers, we are the eyes and the ears of the rest of the Senate to do this oversight. They try to restrict this America will be less safe. And we're going to, I'm going to get those made.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, tell me about this campaign it would have seen in Latin America, with the United States taking out this drug boat. Secretary Rubio, your former colleague on the Senate Intelligence Committee says, quote, if you're on a boat full of cocaine or fentanyl or whatever headed to the United States, you're an immediate threat to the United States. He is saying that is a national security justification to carry out a campaign with an unclear timeline. Have you reached out to Rubio about this? Do you know anything about how it is being formulated here with the intelligence community.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, first of all, the Maduro regime in Venezuela are bad guys, and we obviously need to do all we can to stop fentanyl. We have not been briefed on this. This was a DOD, it was not an Intel project. It was a DOD project. But my fear is, there are still international laws of the sea about how the process of interdicting these kind of boats, they're supposed to be a firing of a warning shot. You're supposed to try to take it peacefully. My understanding, this boat, none of those procedures are followed, and I'm going to get the full brief this week. But what I'm worried about is if we put our sailors in harm's way by violating international law, unless there is the appropriate designations, could this come back and and hurt those sailors? Sailors were doing their job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as far as you know, this is fully a military operation. It is not using the intelligence assets?",
      "SEN> WARNER: Yes, we not\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the administration says they know everyone who was on that boat, they had \"great clarity and fidelity.\"",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I'd like to see that data. But this, again, goes to the point. This kind of action should be briefed to the intelligence community. And I'm a member of what's called the Gang of Eight. Those are the folks that's supposed to get the absolute secret stuff, the only the President gets. I've gotten no briefing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No briefing on this?",
      "SEN. WARNER: No briefing on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are they conducting regular information sharing with Gang of Eight?",
      "SEN. WARNER: There are information sharing, the level of sharing and the timeliness of the sharing we, for example, we were on the Iran bombings. We were not notified beforehand, our my Republican colleagues were notified. When you start making oversight and who gets shared information on a partisan basis, this kind of cooking the books and intelligence how we got into the war in Iraq in the first place?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Warner, thank you for your time. Today. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. So stay with us."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning, and welcome to Face The Nation. We begin this morning with the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Good morning and thank you for being here.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Good morning. It's great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In person.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot to get to with you, but I want to start on what just happened overnight. Russia has launched a very significant attack on Ukraine and in Kyiv. They actually even hit a Ukrainian government building. Does the U.S. condemn the assault? And what are you waiting for now in terms of triggering those sanctions on Russia?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, as you know, I'm not one of the foreign policy advisors of the President, but at the National Economic Council we are responsible for making sure that sanctions get enforced and that people that are helping Russia with their war against Ukraine, as for example India has been doing, excuse me, by buying Russian oil, that we're ready to respond to them economically. And you know, last night's news is very disappointing and I'm sure that there's going to be a lot of talk today and tomorrow about the level of sanctions and the timing of sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The timing of additional sanctions on Russia.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Correct, yes. I mean it's up to the president in the end. But yes, it's a very disappointing set of affairs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the U.S. economy, there were 22,000 jobs added last month. The past two months of data were also revised down. You've said in interviews this week it suggests there's less momentum here than you thought. Has job creation stalled and should the Federal Reserve be concerned about the jobs picture?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right, well, well first of all, the interesting thing about the jobs numbers, right, is that they had the biggest revisions in 50 years over the summer, and we came in with 22,000 in August. But if you look at what they said in 23 and 24, they have two ways of estimating the jobs. There's something called the payroll survey, where they ask the employers how many people did you hire? Then they have something called the household survey, where they call up people, they say do you, do you have a job?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And over those two years, the payroll numbers said that we created four and a half million jobs and the household survey said about 2 million fewer, about two and a half million jobs. And they should have the same answer. And so for August, for example, the payroll survey said 22,000 and the household survey said 288,000. And so I think that what's going on is that these old fashioned ways of surveying, like I wonder if you've ever gotten a survey in the mail and filled it out and mailed it back in, maybe you have, but I think that that's the way they're trying to do it. And the reason we're getting these massive revisions and these numbers that don't make sense is really that we've got to modernize the way we do the labor data. But if you look at the non-labor data, you know, second quarter GDP was revised up to 3.3%. The Atlanta Fed's GDP estimate for the third quarter right now is 3% and so industrial production is at an all time high.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe all that data? All those models are functioning.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, the point is when there's dissonance in data that you have to sort of watch how it all works out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And the thing that I'm most suspicious of right now, in terms of data quality, is the job number. In part because there are other ways to do it. There's this company called Homebase that does it. Their August number is 150. But again, even think about this, if we ask households how many jobs do they have? It's plus 288,000 in August. If we ask the employers, it's 22,000. Then that's that becomes a puzzle for economists, like what is wrong with the data? And we kind of know what's wrong with the data. What's wrong with the data is people aren't filling out the forms and sending in the surveys.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last month, the president fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, suggesting there was political bias. Not just what you're talking about, which is a very technical issue on how data is collected and crunched. Did you fix the political bias or --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Well, there, there are patterns of the data that look like political bias, but they could be accidental. And that's why we need to get a new set of eyes in there to make sure that things are more transparent, that we modernize the surveys and we make them so that more people trust them. But think about this, at the Federal Reserve --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So you don't trust these numbers?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think the BLS numbers need to really be improved. They need to be modernized. And I gave a talk at the BLS next to Alan Greenspan we had a few years ago where I talked about the necessity of modernizing them, and so I still agree with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But trend line wise, when we hear from companies like Caterpillar, Deere, Ford, Procter & Gamble, that their costs are going up due to tariffs. That doesn't suggest there's going to be robust hiring in those sectors, right? When a company is taking on something that could hurt their productivity or profitability I should say?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well we've seen, inflation has come down quite a bit. It was in the high threes when President Trump took office. The average over the six months is 1.9. And, you know, even the Fed right now clearly agrees that inflation has been under control if you believe futures markets because the federal funds futures markets are now saying the Fed is going to cut interest rates three times this year --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Expected to (inaudible) --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- And so the Fed, they're expected to. And so, therefore, you know, the Fed is expected to feel like it's comfortable with where inflation is right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But my point being that doesn't forecast from these companies a scenario in which they would necessarily be hiring. Have you been able to calculate what the immigration crackdown has done to employment?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, yeah, there are, there are a couple of things that we could look at. First of all, the private sector employment is up by about half a million this year and government workers, government employment is down by about 100,000. There's another thing is that most of the jobs that have been created in the U.S. are for native born workers, and they've actually, there's actually been a reduction in labor supply for non-native born workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, we have a, we have a survey where they actually ask it. Now, maybe we don't trust the surveys, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And there is actually a thing --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- And if you know the corporations are hiring undocumented, or have a pattern of it, are you prosecuting those companies?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: There's technicalities that when someone's released into the country then, in the previous administration, then they would often get a number that would allow them to work legally until they went to court. And so there were, for sure, people that were undocumented --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But going after the employers? --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- who were being able to work. But the other thing that you can see in the data, because we get the unemployment insurance claims by like county, that about 80% of the claims for unemployment over the last few months have come from blue states. And so there are places like Portland and Chicago where people are fleeing the cities and you're seeing that in the numbers too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you don't plan to prosecute companies who had this pattern, you're talking about, of hiring people in the country illegally?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I don't work for the Justice Department, but I do see the pattern of native born versus non-native born employment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we are also seeing in that data, you say you don't trust necessarily, that it's manufacturing. That's trade related. That that is where the lack of hiring is happening. Those are the areas that the President had promised there would be new jobs. When do those new jobs in those sectors come?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right, let's think about it again though that in terms of the way that the data are a little frustrating for everyone right now that industrial production is at an all time high, GDP is booming, productivity was up 3.8% in the last quarter, and it looks like manufacturing jobs are down. And so how is it that industrial production is at an all time high while manufacturing employment is down? It's something that we're looking forward to seeing what happens in the revisions. The revisions have been, last year \u2013 there's a benchmark revision next week \u2013 last year, the revision was more than a million over the last year. This is why we need new and better data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll wait to see if those jobs are created. I want to ask you about the Fed. Because the president, you were standing next to him in the Oval Office, said he might basically make you one of the most powerful men in the world because he's considering you to become the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Our CBS polling we just did shows that 70% of Americans want the Federal Reserve to make decisions independently from President Trump. But there's a big partisan difference here. 59% of Republicans say the Fed should be guided by what Trump wants. 41% should be independent of Trump. Which Republican camp do you fall into?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, if I were in that survey then I would say 100% that monetary policy, Federal Reserve monetary policy, needs to be fully independent of political influence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including from President Trump?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Including from President Trump. The fact is that we've looked at countries that have allowed the leaders to take over the central banks, and what tends to happen is that it's a recipe for inflation and misery for consumers. And so central bank independence is something that, as you saw, there was a hearing this week about that, that Democrats and Republicans and the White House all agreed about. Now the question is, has the current central bank been as independent as we would like, as transparent we would as we would like? And I think that there's some dispute about that, which we could go into if you'd like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Secretary Bessent went into that in an article in the Wall Street Journal this past week. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- He did. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He talked about the central bank's independence being under threat due to mission creep. There should be an independent, non partisan review of the entire Fed, its role in regulation, monetary policy and research. What's your plan to overhaul the Fed?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I don't have a plan to overhaul the Fed right now. I'm just happy to do my job --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You have to have been thinking about it. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Look, I've been the President's one of his top economic advisers for nine years. We talk about everything from golf to decorating the Oval Office to monetary policy, but right now what I'm focused on is doing my job as Director of National Economic Council every day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would endorse what Secretary Bessent wrote in that article fully --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Yes I agree with this article, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you would be prepared to implement that vision for the Federal Reserve if you are chair?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: It's a hypothetical that we'll see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it certainly seems from one of the political appointees, the Cabinet member, to be a vision for the future of the Fed that the Trump administration would like.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I agree with his vision, but I look forward to the President deciding who is going to be the Federal Reserve Chair and I think that he and Secretary Bessent will do that ably. There are a lot of great candidates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What will you do if the Supreme Court does rule that the President's tariff policy, or at least those under the IEPPA, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are not legal?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: We certainly don't expect the Supreme Court to do that and I think that we're on pretty high ground and so it's a very unlikely scenario. But the fact is that there are other legal authorities that one could use to get the same outcome. 232s, 301s, you know numbers that we could go into if you like --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Other ways to implement tariffs. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- But it might be like, yeah, too deep a dive for the show on a Sunday. But, but yes, there are other things that could happen should it go that way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Alright. Kevin Hassett, thanks for coming in this Sunday morning.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Thank you, it's great to be here."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 And we're joined now by Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth. She joins us this morning from Schaumburg, Illinois. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So you attended, as I understand, a demonstration yesterday in Chicago where thousands of people were out on the street protesting President Trump's vow to send in immigration agents. I know he's also posted on social media suggesting troops will go in. Quote, \"Chicago is about to find out why it is called the Department of War.\" Vice President Vance says there aren't plans to send in troops. Do you have concrete indication, now, that there are plans to do so?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Let's make it clear the president of the United States essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation. This is not normal, Margaret. This is not acceptable behavior. No, we don't have any indications of them getting ready to send troops into Chicago. In fact, I was out at Great Lakes base yesterday, naval training base, and they were able to confirm that the only assistance they've been requested to provide is just office space for ICE, but that no barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared in order to support troops into Chicago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So, so then is this just, you know, social media trash talk? When you say he's declaring war, is this tongue in cheek?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 I think he's renaming the Department of Defense the Department of War, and did he not just say that Chicago will find out what it means to be at war? I don't- I take what the President of the United States says very seriously, because that is the respect you have to give to the office. And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear, it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the President of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Senator, I know you just mentioned you went out to the Great Lakes Naval training session- station, I should say, and you said the military leadership said they'll only get office space, ICE cannot bring in lethal munitions, and the resources will not be diverted from military training. So all of that together, did you breathe a sigh of relief and say this won't have a real impact on the military?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Well, we're going to make sure that there's not an impact on the military. We need to make sure that- as, you know, Great Lakes naval training base is where every single recruit in the United States Navy goes through to get that basic training, and then later on, some advanced training. We need to make sure that not a single dollar, not a single penny of the resources that they have that should be- that should be directed towards training our nation's sailors and making them ready to dare- do their jobs, none of that money needs to be diverted in order to support ICE or any of Donald Trump's political, you know, theater efforts. We need to focus on making sure we turn out the very best sailors we possibly can out of the base.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So in terms of how Democrats are responding to this, this rhetoric, the Chicago Tribune faulted Governor Pritzker for his threats, to quote, \"not stand idly by\" if the guard went in. They wrote, \"what does that threat actually mean? How about a conversation before the action or the response? Because it's all potentially harmful to collective health.\" It sounds like there's a lot of tension here. Is there an opportunity to work with the administration to avoid making this worse?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Well, they've not- they've not responded to any of our requests. I mean, I'll give you a very concrete example. Senator Durbin, myself, Senator Schneider- Congressman Schneider, sent requests into DHS to ask them to explain what exactly are you going to be doing at Great Lakes? And can we come look at your facility so we have a better understanding of what your operations are? And they replied, no, you can't. And in fact, gave their staff the day off on the day that we went to go look at the facilities, and locked the doors and left the base. Basically, they fled the base. This is not the action of someone that's doing something legal or that they're- that they're proud of. They literally gave the people the day off, locked the doors and left. Now the Navy allowed us onto the post. They allowed us to tour the outside of the facility and also where they would be storing the non-lethal munitions. But DHS did not show up. And we certainly have sent the administration multiple inquiries about what they are planning on doing. Who are they bringing into Chicago? Are they planning to bring the National Guard in? They've- none, none of that. They've not even reached out to local law enforcement to try to coordinate. You know, if they were truly, truly interested in fighting crime, then they would work with local law enforcement and ask them, what do you need? What help do you need? And we've not gotten any- any communications or feedback from the administration, whatsoever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to ask you in your armed services role about what is a significant geopolitical meeting this past week. You had a lot of America's adversaries gathering together. Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un of North Korea, all of them in Beijing. And China and Russia seem to be deepening their work together. What do you think the signal to the United States here is?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: The signal to the United States is exactly what, you know, these authoritarian regimes want to send, which is that they are the new world power, that America is losing its ground, and that they have utter disrespect for the United States. I think it was very, very clear, and it, you know, it doesn't escape me, the fact that once this meeting happened, which was humiliating to Donald Trump, he immediately responds by saying, well, then I'm going to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War and declare war on Chicago. This is what Donald Trump does when something bad happens to him in the news cycle, or when the Epstein victims come together and have a very emotional press conference, he changes the topic and distracts us by saying things like, I'm going to send ICE into Chicago, I'm going to do this or do that. The American people cannot be fooled. We cannot be allowing him to distract us from what is truly happening, which is, this is a man who has driven our economy to a point where now there are more unemployed people than there are jobs. You know, we're not selling our agricultural products overseas. Our adversaries are united against us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, the unemployment rate is still low, but I hear you on a weaker than expected jobs number. Just very quickly, there was military action taken in America's backyard by the Trump administration. Vice President Vance says \"killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.\" He was talking about a strike on a drug boat- alleged drug boat, off the coast of Venezuela. What do you make of that show of force?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 It was an illegal- it was an illegal move by the Trump administration. There's a thing called due process in this country, and that needed to have happened. And the fact that it happened in international order- in international waters actually opens Americans to a similar action by our adversaries. You just- we were just talking about Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping and getting together and showing us- showing a show of force against the United States. Well, there's nothing now to stop them from doing something like that against Americans in international waters. And it could be civilians, and they could say, you know what? Those were drug boats. We're just going to go ahead and blow them out of the water. You're- he's setting a precedence here that puts Americans in danger.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Senator Duckworth, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back."

      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot to get to with you, but I want to start on what just happened overnight.",
      "Russia has launched a very significant attack on Ukraine and \u2013 in Kyiv. They actually even hit a Ukrainian government building. Does the U.S. condemn the assault? And what are you waiting for now in terms of triggering those sanctions on Russia?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, as you know, I'm not one of the foreign policy advisers of the president, but at the National Economic Council, we are responsible for making sure that sanctions get enforced and that people that are helping Russia with their war against Ukraine, as, for example, India has been doing by \u2013 excuse me \u2013 by buying Russian oil, that we're ready to respond to them economically.",
      "And, you know, last night's news is very disappointing, and I'm sure that there's going to be a lot of talk today and tomorrow about the level of sanctions and the timing of sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The timing of additional sanctions on Russia?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Perhaps, yes. I mean, it's up to the president in the end, but, yes, it's a very disappointing set of affairs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the U.S. economy, there were 22,000 jobs added last month. The past two months of data were also revised down.",
      "You've said in interviews this week it suggests there's less momentum here than you thought. Has job creation stalled, and should the Federal Reserve be concerned about the jobs picture?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "Well \u2013 well, first of all, the interesting thing about the jobs numbers, right, is that they had the biggest revisions in 50 years over the summer, and we came in with 22,000 in August. But if you look at what they said in '23 and '24, they have two ways of estimating the jobs.",
      "There's something called the payroll survey, where they ask the employers how many people did you hire? Then they have something called the household survey, where they call up people, they say, do you \u2013 do you have a job?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And over those two years, the payroll numbers said that we created 4.5 million jobs and the household survey said about two million fewer, about 2.5 million jobs. And they should have the same answer.",
      "And so, for August, for example, the payroll survey said 22,000 and the household survey said 288,000. And so I think that what's going on is that these old-fashioned ways of surveying \u2013 like, I wonder if you've ever gotten a survey in the mail and filled it out and mailed it back in. Maybe you have.",
      "But I think that that's the way they're trying to do it. And the reason we're getting these massive revisions and these numbers that don't make sense is really that we've got to modernize the way we do the labor data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But if you look at the non-labor data, you know, second- quarter GDP was revised up to 3.3 percent. The Atlanta Fed's GDP estimate for the third quarter right now is 3 percent. And so industrial production is at an all-time high.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe all that data? All those models are functioning?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And so \u2013 no, the point is, when there's dissonance in data, that you have to sort of watch how it all works out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And the thing that I'm most suspicious of right now in terms of data quality is the job number, in part because there are other ways to do it. There's this company called Homebase that does it. Their August number is 15.",
      "But, again, even think about this. If we ask households how many jobs do they have, it's plus 288,000 in August. If we ask the employers, it's 22,000. Then that's \u2013 that becomes a puzzle for economists. Like, what is wrong with the data? And we kind of know what's wrong with the data. What's wrong with the data is, people aren't filling out the forms and sending in the surveys.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, last month, the president fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, suggesting there was political bias, not just what you're talking about, which is a very technical issue on how data is collected and crunched.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you fix the political bias or\u2026",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well \u2013 there \u2013 there \u2013 there are patterns of the data that look like political bias, but they could be accidental. And that's why we need to get a new set of eyes in there to make sure that things are more transparent, that we modernize the surveys and we make them so that more people trust them.",
      "But think about this. At the Federal Reserve\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't trust these numbers from Friday?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think the BLS numbers need to really be improved. They need to be modernized.",
      "And I gave a talk at the BLS next to Alan Greenspan we had a few years ago where I talked about the necessity of modernizing them, and so I still agree with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, trend line-wise, when we hear from companies like Caterpillar, Deere, Ford, Procter & Gamble that their costs are going up due to tariffs, that doesn't suggest there's going to be robust hiring in those sectors, right, when a company is taking on something that could hurt their productivity \u2013 or profitability, I should say.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, we've seen inflation has come down quite a bit. It was in the high 3's when President Trump took office. The average over the six months is 1. 9.",
      "And, you know, even the Fed right now clearly agrees that inflation has been under control if you believe futures markets, because the federal funds futures markets are now saying the Fed is going to cut interest rates three times this year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Expected\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And so the Fed \u2013 they're expected to. And so, therefore, you know, the Fed is expected to feel like it's comfortable with where inflation is right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But my point being that doesn't forecast from these companies a scenario in which they would necessarily be hiring. Have you been able to calculate what the immigration crackdown has done to employment?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, yes, there are \u2013 there are a couple of things that we could look at. First of all, the private sector employment is up by about half-a-million this year, and government workers, government employment is down by about 100,000.",
      "There's another thing, is that most of the jobs that have been created in the U.S. are for native-born workers, and they've actually \u2013 there's actually been a reduction in labor supply for non-native-born workers. And the other\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, we have a \u2013 we have a survey where they actually ask it. Now, maybe we don't trust the surveys, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And there is actually a thing\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And if you know the corporations are hiring undocumented or have a pattern of it, are you prosecuting those companies?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: There \u2013 there's technicalities that \u2013 when someone's released into the country, then, in the previous administration, then they would often get a number that would allow them to work legally until they went to court. And so there were, for sure, people that were undocumented\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But going after the employers?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: \u2026 who were being able to work.",
      "But the other thing that you can see in the data, because we get the unemployment insurance claims by, like, county, that about 80 percent of the claims for unemployment over the last few months have come from blue states. And so there are places like Portland and Chicago where people are fleeing the cities, and you're seeing that in the numbers too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you don't plan to prosecute companies who had this pattern you're talking about of hiring people in the country illegally?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I don't work for the Justice Department, but \u2013 but I do see the pattern of native-born versus non-native-born employment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we are also seeing in that data you say you don't trust necessarily that it's manufacturing that's trade-related, that that is where the lack of hiring is happening. Those are the areas that the president had promised there would be new jobs.",
      "When do those new jobs in those sectors come?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Let's think about it again though that in terms of the way that the data are a little frustrating for everyone right now, that industrial production is at an all-time high, GDP is booming, productivity was up 3.8 percent in the last quarter, and it looks like manufacturing jobs are down.",
      "And so how is it that industrial production is at an all-time high while manufacturing employment is down? It's something that we're looking forward to seeing what happens in the revisions. The revisions have been last \u2013 last year \u2013 there's a benchmark revision next week.",
      "Last year, the revision was more than a million over the last year. This is why we need new and better data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll wait to see if those jobs are created.",
      "I want to ask you about the Fed, because the president, you were standing next to him in the Oval Office, said he might basically make you one of the most powerful men in the world, because he's considering you to become the next chairman of the Federal Reserve.",
      "Our CBS polling we just did shows that 70 percent of Americans want the Federal Reserve to make decisions independently from President Trump. But there's a big partisan difference here; 59 percent of Republicans say the Fed should be guided by what Trump wants, 41 percent should be independent of Trump. Which Republican camp do you fall into?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, if I were in that survey, then I would say 100 percent that monetary policy, Federal Reserve monetary policy needs to be fully independent of political influence and\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including from President Trump?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Including from President Trump.",
      "The fact is that we've looked at countries that have allowed the leaders to take over the central banks, and what tends to happen is that it's a recipe for inflation and misery for consumers. And so Central Bank independence is something that \u2013 as you saw, there was a hearing this week about that, that Democrats and Republicans and the White House all agreed about.",
      "Now, the question is, has the current Central Bank been as independent as we would like, as transparent we would as we would like? And I think that there's some dispute about that, which we could go into if you'd like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Secretary Bessent went into that in an article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" this past week.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: He did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He talked about the Central Bank's independence being under threat due to mission creep. There should be an independent, non partisan review of the entire Fed, its role in regulation, monetary policy and research.",
      "What's your plan to overhaul the Fed?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I don't have a plan to overhaul the Fed right now. I'm just happy to do my job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have to have been thinking about it.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Look, I have been the president's \u2013 one of his top economic advisers for nine years. We talk about everything from golf to decorating the Oval Office to monetary policy, but, right now, what I'm focused on is doing my job as Director of National Economic Council every day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would endorse what Secretary Bessent wrote in that article fully?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, I agree with his article, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you would be prepared to implement that vision for the Federal Reserve if you are chair?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: It's a hypothetical, that \u2013 we'll see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it certainly seems, from one of the political appointees, the Cabinet member, to be a vision for the future of the Fed that the Trump administration would like.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Oh, I \u2013 I agree \u2013 I agree with his vision, but I look forward to the president deciding who is going to be the Federal Reserve Chair. And I think that he and Secretary Bessent will do that ably. There are a lot of great candidates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What will you do if the Supreme Court does rule that the president's tariff policy, or at least those under the IEEPA, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are not legal?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: We \u2013 we certainly don't expect the Supreme Court to do that. And I think that we're on pretty high ground. And so it's a very unlikely scenario.",
      "But the fact is that there are other legal authorities that one could use to get the same outcome. 232s, 301s, you know, numbers that we could go into if you like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Other ways to implement tariffs.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But it might be like, yes, too \u2013 too deep a dive for the show on a Sunday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But \u2013 but, yes, there are other things that could happen should it go that way.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here in person.",
      "You are known for your Intel work, but you're also on a number of other committees. We were just there talking about the economy. Do you agree that, basically, the economic data that the United States releases is potentially fundamentally flawed?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: No, I think that the BLS has been the gold standard for years, viewed not only in this country, but around the world.",
      "Could there be reforms? Absolutely. But it's a little ironic that you're firing the referee, the president firing the head, cutting the staff. I'm not sure how that is going to improve the quality of the data.",
      "And the president had promised that \u2013 a golden age from American workers. We're down 80,000 manufacturing jobs since the beginning of his term. We're at basically a flat hiring position. And what I think families who are listening, if anybody's got a family, a family member that's in college or immediately getting out of college, you know what a tough job market is to find this.",
      "And one of the things I would like to have heard from Kevin and, frankly, from more economists is, we're about to see the biggest job dislocation in our history, I believe, in terms of A.I. job dislocation. And those are many times kind of a \u2013 college-driven jobs.",
      "I mean, think back five years ago, we said to every kid, if you want to get a good job, go become a computer programmer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Those are going to be some of the first jobs ignored and eliminated.",
      "And so I just \u2013 I'm fearful that this focus on who's keeping score, when I think the American public realize the job market is tough, and particularly in terms of manufacturing jobs, there is no golden age.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and there's also a fundamental remaking of the economy if you're talking about artificial intelligence.",
      "So, on that point quickly, there were more than a dozen tech titans at the White House this week, including some of these giants in the artificial intelligence space, Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates, Google CEO, Apple CEO, and they were all around the table praising President Trump for the investment in chip manufacturing and A.I.",
      "Do you deserve \u2013 do you think he does deserve that praise?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, I can tell you, the chip manufacturing came about because of a bill that John Cornyn and I put in under Biden, the CHIPS infrastructure act\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bipartisan.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 with the $52 billion, totally bipartisan. President Trump has been very times critical of that bill. Now he is, I think, sending a bit of a mixed message, because some of the investments in that bill were going to Intel, our last meaning \u2013 meaningful fabricator of chips.",

      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Yes.",
      "But the \u2013 here's the weird thing. While he's trying to support American chip manufacturing, at the same time, he's taken off any of the restrictions on, for example, Nvidia H20 chips to sell to China. So, what - - how do we read this? If we want to say we want to build American capacity, Intel, yes, make sure we maintain our lead against China, well, why sell some of our most cutting-edge chips to China?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: It is a complete contradiction in \u2013 in policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the White House says, oh, they're not great chips, so, therefore we can \u2013 can sell them. That's what the commerce secretary has said.",
      "But on \u2013 on the Intelligence beat, as the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, you have an oversight authority, and under law, the Intel agencies must inform that committee about their operations. The CIA has to tell you about covert actions. This is an important kind of oversight.",
      "But, this past week, you said you were blocked from even attending a meeting at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency out in Virginia. Why do you think you were blocked? And has your Republican counterpart promised you that this isn't going to continue?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: I have done these visits to our intel facilities for the 10 plus years I have either been chair or vice chair of the Intelligence Committee. They are part of the normal course. You get a chance to see the work force where they're working. You get to see the new \u2013 newest, best, coolest stuff.",

She's been a virulent anti \u2013 anti-Muslim individual. She has been a big proponent of working with white nationalists.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She speaks to Cabinet members, including the secretary of state.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, his first national security adviser got kicked out because she went after him. The head of the National Security Agency, who I saw with \u2013 recently, General Tim Haugh, got fired. She claimed that firing.",
      "Recently, we've seen 37 senior intel facility individuals lose their \u2013 their security classification, which basically puts them out of a job. And she brags about all this on her blog. I mean, it really raises the question, is she actually the acting secretary of defense or secretary of war as of this morning?",
      "Is she the real director of national intelligence? What she went after me on was something unrelated to this, and said, why can we let some anti- Trump person in to an intelligence facility? Strangely enough, Tuesday night, my meeting was canceled.",

      "You want to talk about something that is dangerous, you restrict Congress' ability to do oversight, particularly with this administration, then we are flying blind. And in the intelligence space, in particular, not every member can do this. Those of us who are senior on the Intel Committee, we are the limited numbers. We are the eyes and the ears of the rest of the Senate to do this oversight.",
      "They try to restrict this, America will be less safe. And we're going to \u2013 I'm going to get those meetings.",

      "Have you reached out to Rubio about this? Do you know anything about how it is being formulated here with the intelligence community?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, first of all, the Maduro regime in Venezuela are bad guys, and we obviously need to do all we can to stop fentanyl.",
      "We have not been briefed on this. This was a DOD \u2013 it was not an intel project. It was a DOD project. But my fear is, there are still international laws of the sea about how the process of interdicting these kind of boats \u2013 there's supposed to be a firing of a warning shot. You're supposed to try to take it peacefully.",
      "My understanding, this boat, none of those procedures were followed. And I'm going to get the full brief this week. But what I'm worried about is, if we put our sailors in harm's way by violating international law, unless there is the appropriate designations, could this come back and \u2013 and hurt those sailors? The sailors were doing their job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, as far as you know, this is fully a military operation; it is not using the intelligence assets of the intelligence\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, we have not\u2026",

      "And I think that, to the extent that any decision makes us unpopular, that's part of the price of the job. We have to make our best judgment about what the law requires. And, sometimes, that might mean that the executive branch succeeds in litigation and sometimes not.",
      "But it's not our job to look across the docket and say, oh, we want to even things out so that sometimes the executive branch wins some, sometimes it loses some. That's the antithesis of what our job entails. Our job entails making legal judgments about the cases that come before us. And we really can't \u2013 I mean, we want the court and I want the \u2013 I want the public to have trust in the integrity of the court.",
      "But the court can never change its decisions, its judgments about what the best \u2013 what the right outcome is in order to tailor it to public opinion.

He's focused on making the CDC more transparent, to make it more trustworthy right now. Right now Americans don't trust the CDC. So, he is literally turning that place upside down.",
      "I respect what my colleagues are saying. But I think that, you know, this whole issue today, or in that meeting, was about vaccines. In my humble opinion, not every person needs every vaccine. And I don't think there is many children out there that need 76 jabs by the time they're old enough to vote. But before you label me a non-vaxxer person, look, I've raised money for polio vaccinations. The MMR is a great vaccine. It saved thousands of lives. Vaccines overall have saved hundreds of millions of lives.",

      "Do you care to respond to that, and do you think that we need to be careful when we are discussing the CDC and public health officials right now?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Well, look, of course I condemn that shooting. But the \u2013 the lack of confidence in the CDC goes back to what the CDC did during Covid. They \u2013 they misguided us, maybe lied to us even, about the origins of Covid and how to treat it as well. And the vaccine, they \u2013 they overpromised what the vaccine could do as well. So, that's where the distrust is.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. OK. But just before we talk about other vaccines, specific to Covid and what you just said. With the CDC it was \u2013 the pandemic was during the Trump administration. It began during the Trump administration. And Operation Warp Speed was a presidential directive by \u2013 by Trump, which some of your fellow Republicans say he deserves the Nobel Prize for because it stopped the pandemic. So, did you trust the CDC and Operation Warp Speed under President Trump, or are you saying you don't think the president deserves the prize for that shot?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Yes, look, President Trump absolutely deserves the Nobel Prize. That vaccine saved millions of lives. But this is such a different time. That's what my friends \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because you just said something that sounded very contradictory to that.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: I disagree with you. I think it's such a different time today than it was five years ago. Five years ago we had a novel virus. None of us had any immunity to it. It was a strange virus made in a lab in Wuhan, China.",
      "But today, on average, Americans have had Covid five times. We now have natural immunity to it. And not everybody needs the vaccine. So, both things can be true. And that's why when you have people that don't understand science, that don't understand medicine \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Why they don't get it. It was a different day then than it is today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. But people do understand that when they go into their pharmacy and have a problem getting a shot, because in many states they are now told they need to go back and get a prescription, that the effect here of the Kennedy policies are making it more difficult, even if they fall into categories where they should be able to get a shot. You would acknowledge that?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: I think you're making this way, way too complicated. That, look, vaccines are a medicine. And just like you need a prescription to get a GLP-1 \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but what you said, he's disrupting. Right, you said he's disrupting, but effectively what you were hearing the Republican whip, John Barrasso, and the Republican Senator Bill Cassidy talk about was the \u2013 the interruption of the availability of vaccines. Cassidy said, \"I would say effectively we're denying people vaccines.\" So, that's not Margaret Brennan, that's Bill Cassidy.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Yes. Look, I disagree. Respectfully disagree. Think about this. What the CDC is now saying is, if you're over the age of 65, you can have the vaccine. It's interesting that the U.K. and France have said 75 and 80 as the age. So, all you need to do is email or call your doctor's nurse and get a prescription and you should be able to get it.",
      "If you're over the age of six months, you probably \u2013 it's probably a good idea to talk to your doctor. And all your nurse has to do is look at the chart and says, oh, little Johnny's got asthma, definitely needs the vaccination as well. So, I think we're making this way too complicated.",
      "Why does everybody lose their minds whether it comes to Covid vaccine? Why can't we let the doctor and the parents decide. Let the patients decide.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: There's so many more important things out there we should be talking about.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but I think we're conflating a few things, including the operational aspect of this. I think people get frustrated with their insurance companies. I think people get frustrated with their pharmacies and the implementation of health policy. And you know that that's more complicated than just saying we're \u2013 we're changing a few things here. There are big implications. And I want to talk to you about it because you said you like the MMR vaccine, you like DPT, polio, smallpox. You don't like hepatitis b, which is a liver infection, and you don't think newborn kids me to be vaccinated against it.",
      "Senator Cassidy, who is a liver doctor, said he treated poor and underserved patients and that it can be a life-altering condition for the rest of your life. So, why isn't it a compelling argument to you that this should be available?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Yes. So, I delivered a baby \u2013 I delivered a baby every day for \u2013 for 25 years. We did a hepatitis test on every one of my patients. At the time of delivery, if that mom has a negative hepatitis test, she's in a stable, monogamous relationship, she's not doing IV drugs, she's not letting her baby going to play in a sandbox full of used needles, then there's zero chance that that baby's going to have hepatitis.",
      "Now, there's other moms that \u2013 or other babies that do need it, OK? We need to be more specific. We can't be overly prescriptive. If that mom has not had prenatal care, if she's an IV drug abuser, if she's not in a stable relationship, a whole lot of reasons, but we need to pick and choose. Not every baby needs the hepatitis vaccine. And especially on day number one. What are these vaccines doing to \u2013 to \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: To mess with the immune system of \u2013 of that particular baby as well?",

      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: So, that's my concern. So not every baby needs hepatitis b vaccine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. And I understand it can also be spread from \u2013 in a household sharing toothbrushes or razors or, for example, if her partner was not monogamous, the pregnant lady, for example.",
      "But \u2013 but I hear your point here, that you want this to be more bespoke, like, more picking and choosing. But others would argue here that \u2013 that in doing that you are going to drive down immunization rates overall if you create broader doubt in vaccines. And that it's a slippery slope here. Are you at all concerned that that is going to be the takeaway?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Look, Anthony Fauci did more to create vaccine hesitancy than Bobby Kennedy will do in his four years or eight years, however long he is the secretary. That's where the problem is. So, don't blame Bobby Kennedy for the problems created by Anthony Fauci.",
      "But this \u2013 but I'm just telling you, parents today want more information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm asking you about what you said about the hepatitis b vaccine.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: I'm sorry. Go ahead again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wasn't talking about Bobby Kennedy, or Secretary Kennedy, I was talking about you and what you said about the hepatitis b vaccine and are you concerned that picking and choosing these things like this, this bespoke concept of giving more choice, that it also has the effect of undermining confidence in vaccines?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Yes, I think this is a big difference between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats want a one size fits all prescription for everybody. And I'm telling you, not everybody reads the \u2013 reads the book, does exactly like that. I have confidence in doctors, in nurses and parents and grandparents to make these decisions. I don't think that we should have one government policy that dictates every one of these vaccines. I think local policy, local schools, if they want to have requirements, what Florida did was a bridge too far.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: But how about just a little common sense. Just a little common sense would go a long ways here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. OK. Because President Trump said he had some doubts about that Florida statement you just mentioned there, too, and that he likes a lot of vaccines.",
      "Before I let you go, Secretary Kennedy founded this group that is arguing that women taking Tylenol or acetaminophen might be putting their babies at risk. They claim there's a link to neurodevelopmental disorders. Would you take \u2013 tell a pregnant woman to take a Tylenol and not feel worried about it?",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Look, Tylenol is a category b drug. I've given it to lots of patients. It's on the approved \u2013 approved list.",
      "But that being said, I try to tell my patients not \u2013 my pregnant women not to take anything because, you know, we don't know what we don't know. I'm very cautious. You know, why \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Why do 20 percent of our children have some type of a mental health illness right now? Why do we have so many peanut allergies? Why do we have so many people with autoimmune diseases?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: I \u2013 we \u2013 so, we don't know. What we don't know, we don't know. And I want gold standard studies to help us figure this out and sort it out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: But as far as I know, Tylenol is OK in pregnancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator. We'll leave it there for today.",
      "We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth. She joins us this morning from Schaumburg, Illinois.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you attended, as I understand it, a demonstration yesterday in Chicago where thousands of people were out on the street protesting President Trump's vow to send in immigration agents. I know he's also posted on social media suggesting troops will go in. Quote, \"Chicago is about to find out why it is called the Department of War.\"",
      "Vice President Vance says there aren't plans to send in troops. Do you have concrete indication now that there are plans to do so?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Let's make it clear, the president of the United States essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation. This is not normal, Margaret. This is not acceptable behavior.",
      "No, we don't have any indications of them getting ready to send troops into Chicago. In fact, I was out at Great Lakes base yesterday, naval training base, and they were able to confirm that the only assistance they have been requested to provide is just office space for ICE, but that there are no barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared to \u2013 in order to support troops into Chicago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013 so then is this just, you know, social media trash- talk? When you say he's declaring war, is this tongue-in-cheek?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: I think he's renaming the Department of Defense the Department of War. And did he not just say that Chicago will find out what it means to be at war? I \u2013 I don't \u2013 I take what the president of the United States says very seriously because that is the respect you have to give to the office. And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear, it would be an illegal order to declare war on major city, any city, within the United States by the president of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I know you just mentioned you went out to the Great Lakes naval training session \u2013 station, I should say, and you said, the military leadership said they'll only get office space. ICE cannot bring in lethal munitions. And the resources will not be diverted from military training. So, all of that together, did you breathe a sigh of relief and say this won't have a real impact on the military?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, we're going to make sure that there's not an impact on the military. We need to make sure that as, you know, Great Lakes naval training base is where every single recruit in the United States Navy goes through to get their basic training, and then later on some advanced training. We need to make sure that not a single dollar, not a single penny of the resources that they have there should be \u2013 that should be directed towards training our nation's sailors and making them ready to do their jobs. None of that money needs to be diverted in order to support ICE or any of Donald Trump's political, you know, theater efforts. We need to focus on making sure we turn out the very best sailors we possibly can out of the base.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in terms of how Democrats are responding to this rhetoric, \"The Chicago Tribune\" faulted Governor Pritzker for his threats to, quote, \"not stand idly by if the Guard went in.\" They wrote, \"what does that threat actually mean? How about a conversation before the action or the response because it's all potentially harmful to collective health.\" It sounds like there's a lot of tension here. Is there an opportunity to work with the administration to avoid making this worse?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, they've not \u2013 they've not responded to any of our requests. I mean, I'll give you a very concrete example. Senator Durbin, myself, Senator \u2013 Congressman Schneider sent a request into DHS to ask them to explain what exactly are you going to be doing at Great Lakes, and can we come look at your facility so we have a better understanding of what your operations are, and they replied, no, you can't, and, in fact, gave their staff the day off on the day that we went to go look at the facilities and locked the doors and left the base. Basically, they fled the base. This is not the action of someone that's doing something legal or that they are \u2013 that they're proud of. They literally gave the people the day off, locked the doors and left.",
      "Now, the Navy allowed us on to the post. They allowed us to tour the outside of the facility and also where they would be storing the non-lethal munitions. But DHS did not show up.",
      "And we certainly have sent the administration multiple inquiry about what they are planning on doing, who are they bringing into Chicago. Are they planning to bring the National Guard in. They've none \u2013 none of that. They've not even reached out to local law enforcement to try to coordinate. You know, if they were truly, truly interested in fighting crime, then they would work with local law enforcement and ask them, what do you need? What help do you need? And we've not gotten any, any communications or feedback from the administration whatsoever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, in your armed services role, about what is a significance geopolitical meeting this past week. You had a lot of America's adversaries gathering together. Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un of North Korea, all of them in Beijing. And China and Russia seemed to be deepening their work together. What do you think the signal to the United States here is?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The signal to the United States is \u2013 is exactly what, you know, these authoritarian regimes want to send, which is that they are the new world power, that America is losing its ground, and that they have utter disrespect for the United States. I think it was very, very clear. And it, you know, it doesn't escape me the fact that once this meeting happened, which was humiliating to Donald Trump, he immediately responds by saying, well, then I'm going to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War and declare war in Chicago.",
      "This is what Donald Trump does. When something bad goes \u2013 happens to him in the news cycle, or when the Epstein victims come together and have a very emotional press conference, he changes the topic and distracts us by saying things like, I'm going to send ICE into Chicago, I'm going to do this or do that. The American people cannot be fooled. We cannot be \u2013 allow him to distract us from what is truly happening, which is, this is a man who has driven our economy to a point where now there are more unemployed people than there are jobs. You know, we're not selling our agricultural products overseas. And our adversaries are united against us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the unemployment rate is still low. But I hear you on a weaker than expected jobs number.",
      "Just very quickly, there was military action taken in America's backyard by the Trump administration. Vice President Vance says, \"killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.\" He was talking about a strike on a drug boat \u2013 alleged drug boat off the coast of Venezuela. What do you make of that show of force?",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: It was an illegal move by the Trump administration. There is a thing called due process in this country, and that needed to have happened. And the fact that it happened in international order \u2013 in international waters actually opens Americans to a similar action by our adversaries. You just \u2013 we were just talking about Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping and getting together and showing a show of force against the United States. Well, there's nothing now to stop them from doing something like that against Americans in international waters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: And it could be civilians. And they could say, you know what, those were drug boats. We're just going to go ahead and blow them out of the water.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: You know, he's setting a precedence here that puts Americans in danger.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Duckworth, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto, for more insight on today's CBS News poll.",
      "So, Anthony, let's start on the economy. That jobs report for August was lower than expected. Inflation is down from its post-Covid peak, but it's still not at that 2 percent level the Fed wants to get to.",
      "How are people feeling?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Earlier this week I asked people, pick one word to describe the economy. And the top one they picked was \"uncertain.\" And you see here, I think tariffs are a big part of that. We've already seen four in ten people tell us they're cutting back on spending because of increases from prices that they see as part of tariffs. They think tariffs are going to raise prices in both the short term and the long term. And part of that is support for imposing new tariffs has been ticking down. It is now down again. Increasingly confined just to the president's base, to Republicans.",
      "Now, there is their view that it will ultimately increase manufacturing jobs in the U.S., that people ought to be willing to pay a little bit more to support President Trump's policies, but that view has not permeated beyond that base to the wider public, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we might need to wait until we see that job growth in those areas.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes, I mean it could be, in some ways, that pull back a little bit of leading indicator as we go forward, right? People spending. The other part of this, too, is more broadly. And we talk about who and where you can impose tariffs. When we talk about influence on the Federal Reserve, a presidential influence there, the lens of this is also about presidential power and how much influence a president can have over those levers on the economy.",
      "And, you know, I asked about this a little. And what we're seeing is, Republicans very comfortable with Donald Trump having those levers. Other Americans, not so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's unusual for conservatives in particular who have, for so long, trumpeted free market economy, not a centrally planned one. So really liking that there is such control in the hands of a political leader is really unusual. That's a change.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, it is in the sense that if you look back at polling over generations you would see Republicans, free markets, less government control. Here, so much of it, like so many things, centers around their trust in President Trump for that. But you also see some of those splits within Republicans where the MAGA base, they describe it as being efficient, and many others describing it as, you're right, just more control.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And it is that MAGA base that has reshaped the entire party.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Indeed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's what we mean really when we talk Republican these days.",
      "Let me ask you about the National Guard. This does seem to unify Republicans, if I understand it, from your polling. The focus on immigration and law enforcement. This surge of federal resources to D.C. He's talking about Portland and Chicago and Boston and Baltimore. What's the perception of it?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, the lens on this touches on views of crime and what is effective of fighting crime, but also on rights and freedoms. Yes, for proponents of this, many of them Republicans, they're saying it's effectively about fighting crime. They say they'd support deploying the National Guard to other cities, like you mentioned. Even to their own area, whether there's Democratic-run areas or Republican-run areas.",
      "But for the majority, who are in opposition to this, in principle, they say, well, it's going to impose on rights and freedoms. It's going to make those rights and freedoms less secure, here again, through the lens of presidential power. The public generally would see sort of to the local leaders, the governor and the president all involved. One thing to note, and I think it's related, speaking of the Republican base, the president's overall approval rating is ticked up from July. It's up two points. And it's stabilized after having steadily declined over those early weeks and months of his term. That's really helped buy Republicans.",
      "And you look at how people evaluate the president. Republicans say they're evaluating him more on immigration, deportation, crime, those issues. People who are evaluating him more on the economy, on inflation give him overall lower ratings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, thank you.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.",

    "story": [
      "Amy Coney Barrett had been teaching full-time for nearly two decades, at Notre Dame's campus in South Bend, Indiana, until she was selected by President Donald Trump, in 2020,  to serve on the Supreme Court. Now, she's traded the classroom for the courtroom, although she continues to teach a weeklong seminar on Constitutional Law.",
      "In her first television interview since she filled the seat left by the  late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Barrett was asked whether she believed  the Court has shifted to the right. \"I think shifting to the right, or  shifting to the left, I think those are other  people's labels, and that's other people's game,\" she said. \"I don't  think of it that way. You know, I just decide the cases as they come.  I've been criticized by both the right and the left.\"",
      "Justice Barrett's legal philosophy and personal story are the focus of her new book, \"Listening to the Law,\"\u00a0out on September 9. In it, she writes that, for her, the past five years  have not been easy since joining the Supreme Court: \"I'm happiest with  my old friends who knew me before I became Justice Barrett, and I am  wistful when we're back in South Bend.\"",
      "But she does not regret joining the High Court. \"No, I don't regret it,\"  she said. \"And I think it's really important work, and I'm proud to  serve. And we do have a good life in Washington, and we have friends in  Washington. But there is something nice about  our old life.\"",
      "Observers at the Supreme Court describe the 53-year-old mother of seven  as \"the most influential justice\" on the court today. Among the most  notable instances of that was her vote to overturn Roe v. Wade in the 2022 Dobbs decision, which overturned nearly 50 years of precedent surrounding the right to an abortion.",
      "For the minority's dissent, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan wrote:",
      "\"[T]he Court may face questions about the application of abortion  regulations to medical care most people view as quite different from  abortion. What about the morning-after pill? IUDs? In vitro  fertilization? And how about the use of dilation and evacuation  or medication for miscarriage management?\"",
      "Asked whether she sees those issues coming about now as a result of  Dobbs, Barrett replied, \"Those are issues inherent in medical practice.  And sure, they surround pregnancy care and the care of women. And those  are issues that are left now to the democratic  process. And the states are working those out. We have not had those  cases on our docket.\"",
      "But, Barrett added, \"Dobbs did not render abortion illegal. Dobbs did  not say anything about whether abortion is immoral. Dobbs said that  these are questions that are left to the states. And all of these kinds  of questions \u2013 decisions that you mention that  require medical judgments \u2013 are not ones that our Constitution connects  to the courts, you know, to decide how far into pregnancy the right of  abortion might extend. You know, the court was in the business of  drawing a lot of those lines before, and what Dobbs  says is that those calls are properly left to the democratic process.  And the states have been working those out. There's been a lot of  legislative activity and a lot of state constitutional activity since  the decision in Dobbs was rendered.\"",

      "Barrett said, \"Well, I think people who criticize the Court or who are  outside, say a lot of different things. But again, the point that I make  in the book is that we have to tune those things out.\"",
      "She also notes in her book that the rights to marry and engage in sexual  intimacy, to use birth control, and to raise children are, in her  words, \"fundamental.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Barrett said. \"Again, I'm describing what our doctrine is. And that is what we've said.\"",

      "At issue now: cases on the \"emergency docket,\" challenging Mr. Trump's  executive orders. The nation's highest court has routinely allowed the  president's policies (including on immigration\u00a0and mass layoffs of federal workers) to temporarily  proceed.",

      "\"The Supreme Court, you know \u2013 and I can speak for myself and the way  that I make these decisions \u2013 it's not our job to survey and decide  whether, you know, the current occupant of an office in this particular  moment is, you know, to form a political view.  You know, that's the job of journalists, that's the job of other  politicians, or that's the job of the people. But our job is to decide  these legal questions.",
      "\"And so, in the cases that we've decided, what I can say, and what I try  to explain in the book, is that we're trying to get the law right,\" she  said.",

I would not be surprised if there are some cases pending  below. And so, I can't answer that question. But actually, this is a  good opportunity for me to say why\u00a0I can't answer that question, because it's something I cover  in the book.

But if I'm going to decide something as a judge,  it really has to happen in the context of a particular case, because  judges have to approach things with an open mind on a specific set of  facts. We read briefs. I listen to oral argument. I talk to my law  clerks. I write out notes. I look at the cases. I  talk to my colleagues. And at any step of that process, I might change  my mind from my initial reaction. In fact, I often do.",

And I'm sure that not only you, but  probably others would be interested in, you know, what I think about  that question. I don't know what I think about that question yet, I can  honestly say.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-national-guard-cities-opinion-poll/",
    "published": "Sun, 07 Sep 2025 09:00:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump's approval rating ticks back up; support for tariffs declines as some pull back buying.",
    "story": [
      "The National Guard was deployed to Washington, D.C., and reportedly may be sent to other cities. But wherever Americans live, it is speaking to larger issues \u2013 ranging from crime and their safety, to rights and freedoms and their views on the powers of a president.",
      "Those in favor of President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to cities are largely in his Republican base and say it reduces crime, feel it makes them personally safer \u2014 even if they don't live in cities \u2014 and that in principle they'd support deployment to other U.S. cities.",
      "The majority of Americans are opposed, though, and those who are, tend to feel their own rights and freedoms would be less secure as a result. They do not think it would be effective at reducing crime or make them any safer.",
      "To those in favor, it's not a case of red-versus-blue cities. They'd support the Guard being sent to either Democratic- or Republican-led places, or coming to their own local area as well.",
      "To those opposed, they believe the president is acting out of politics more than crime prevention.",
      "People who live in cities generally oppose the idea of sending troops to other cities and Americans in rural areas are mostly in favor of sending the Guard to other cities. Opinion is more tied to partisanship than geography, though.",
      "The people who think the presence of the National Guard does reduce crime, but still oppose the deployment to Washington or elsewhere, tend to see Trump acting for political reasons, not just crime prevention.",
      "The bulk of Americans, wherever they stand on this deployment, think in principle, both the president and a local leader like a mayor or governor should have the authority to deploy the National Guard. Fewer \u2014 including a lot of those opposed \u2014 think it should be only a local leader. Very few think it should be only Donald Trump.",
      "Approval ratings",
      "The policy on which one judges a president can of course affect the overall evaluation of him.",
      "Republicans, and Trump's supporters overall, say they're judging him on immigration and deportation policy more than on his economy and inflation policies; that topic, plus crime, together far outpaces inflation and the economy as their most important metric.",
      "Of late, the deployments may have the political effect of focusing on matters other than inflation, at least for the president's political base. And that in turn has helped his overall numbers a bit.",
      "His Republican approval now ticks back up over 90%, and his overall approval has stabilized, up two points now, after steadily declining over the weeks and months of his term.",
      "Meanwhile, those judging him on economic and inflation policies don't approve of him overall or on the matter of inflation, specifically.",
      "The relatively small group of people who disapprove of him on inflation, but approve on immigration, mostly approve of him overall.",
      "Tariffs",
      "Economic matters remain tougher for Mr. Trump, as they have been. Many continue to say Trump's policies have made them financially worse off.",
      "Four in 10 Americans report buying fewer things because of tariffs.",
      "Support for tariffs continues to drop incrementally, if steadily.",
      "And as with many other items, support for tariffs is centered in the Republican and MAGA political base, but not elsewhere.",
      "That extends to a call for some financial sacrifice, too. Seven in 10 Republicans say Americans should be willing to pay more for what they buy to support Trump's trade policies. This is true for Republicans across income levels.",
      "On balance, people overall are mixed about the potential impact on manufacturing jobs. Relatively more do think the tariffs will lead to manufacturing jobs more than will lead to losses, and Republicans are also the most likely to think this.",
      "Views of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act remain underwater and its approval rating is unchanged from July, shortly after it was signed into law.",
      "The Fed",
      "Most Americans continue to call for a Federal Reserve that operates independently of what Donald Trump wants.",
      "Unlike matters related to immigration or the National Guard, there is a bit of difference within the GOP ranks. MAGA Republicans specifically would like the Fed more under Trump's guidance than non-MAGA Republicans. Nor would all Republicans have Trump replace Fed members who disagree with him.",
      "Trump's approach",
      "All of these matters also speak to questions of executive power and how it is applied.",
      "In all, as a general description, people tend to like Trump's goals relatively more than his approach.",
      "In general, two-thirds of Americans feel Donald Trump is trying to increase the powers of a president. That's not collectively what they'd want; most would say not to change those powers.",
      "And while Democrats see an approach they'd describe as Trump trying to bring the federal government more under his direct control, Republicans describe him trying to make it work more efficiently.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration told Kilmar Abrego Garcia on Friday it is now seeking to deport him to the tiny African kingdom of Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, according to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement email obtained by CBS News.",
      "The email from a top ICE official noted that Abrego Garcia's attorneys have warned he fears being persecuted or tortured in Uganda, where federal authorities threatened to deport him last month after he was detained once again by immigration officials following his release from criminal custody.",
      "The ICE official said Abrego Garcia, through his attorneys, has also claimed fear of being harmed if deported to more than 20 countries, most of them in Latin America.",
      "In the email, the official called the alleged claims \"hard to take seriously,\" but added: \"Nonetheless, we hereby notify you that your new country of removal is Eswatini, Africa.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to representatives and an attorney for Abrego Garcia, asking for comment on the Trump administration's threat to send their client to Eswatini.",
      "Eswatini is at least the fourth possible destination that the Trump administration has floated for Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador who was mistakenly deported in March, held in a notorious Salvadoran prison and returned to the U.S. in June \u2014 only to face federal smuggling charges.",
      "Africa's sole remaining absolute monarchy, Eswatini is one of several nations that has agreed to the Trump administration's requests to accept deportees who are not their citizens from the U.S. Earlier this year, the U.S. sent a small group of deportees from Asia and Latin America who had been convicted of violent crimes to Eswatini. Attorneys say the men are being held incommunicado in a prison there.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from pre-trial jail last month, but ICE almost immediately detained him during a check-in appointment with the agency in Baltimore and began processing him for deportation to Uganda. His attorneys have fought that move, and alleged the government offered to deport him to Costa Rica instead if he agreed to a plea deal in his smuggling case.",
      "And on Thursday, federal authorities argued they could have a legal route to deport him to El Salvador a second time. A 2019 immigration court ruling barred the government from sending him to the Central American country, citing a risk of persecution by gangs. But in a filing obtained by CBS News, the government argued those legal protections would be voided if Abrego Garcia's request to reopen his immigration court case is granted.",
      "Despite that legal protection issued in 2019, Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March, which government lawyers acknowledged was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "A senior Trump administration official said, \"Kilmar Abrego Garcia's lawyers are playing with fire. If their attempts to reopen his immigration case are successful, his own lawyers will have opened the door for his return to El Salvador.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia remains in ICE custody in Virginia while his lawyers fight his criminal charges and deportation proceedings. His possible deportation to Uganda was paused by a federal judge in Maryland until at least next month.",
      "Trump administration fights Abrego Garcia's asylum case",
      "Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia is seeking asylum in the U.S., a legal status granted to people who have a well-founded fear of persecution in another country.",
      "In an immigration court filing Thursday, government lawyers asked a judge not to grant Abrego Garcia's request to reopen his immigration case so he can seek asylum or some other legal protection, like a green card based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen.",
      "The administration argued that Abrego Garcia is not eligible for asylum and other benefits, citing his alleged affiliation with the gang MS-13, his smuggling charges and a domestic violence complaint filed by his wife. The government alleges Abrego Garcia is a member of a foreign terrorist group, since MS-13 has been classified as such by the State Department.",
      "Abrego Garcia has strongly denied any affiliation with MS-13 and has pleaded not guilty to his smuggling charges, which his attorneys have called \"vindictive and selective.\" Abrego Garcia's wife filed a protective order alleging domestic violence in 2021, but she later said she decided not to follow through with the case. Abrego Garcia was not criminally charged in the matter.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg told CBS News that if his client \"is allowed a fair trial in immigration court, there's no way he's not going to prevail on his claim for asylum.\"",
      "\"Kilmar Abrego Garcia was tortured in El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison earlier this year,\" he said. \"The only reason he was denied asylum in 2019 was because he did not file within one year of entering the United States, a problem which the government has now solved.\"",

    "summary": "Judge Edward Chen ruled against the Trump administration in a challenge to its effort to end the Temporary Protected Status program for roughly 1 million Venezuelan and Haitian migrants.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in California ruled Friday that the Trump administration's attempt to end the Temporary Protected Status program for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan and Haitian migrants was unlawful.",
      "The move by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen effectively sets aside the administration's attempt to end temporary legal protections and work permits for certain people from Venezuela and Haiti \u2014 unless his ruling is overturned on appeal. Chen ruled in favor of the National TPS Alliance, an organization that represents TPS holders across the country, and a group of Venezuelan migrants who received protections under the program.",
      "\"This case arose from action taken post haste by the current DHS Secretary, Kristi Noem, to revoke the legal status of Venezuelan and Haitian TPS holders, sending them back to conditions that are so dangerous that even the State Department advises against travel to their home countries,\" Chen wrote in a 69-page decision. \"The Secretary's action in revoking TPS was not only unprecedented in the manner and speed in which it was taken but also violates the law.\"",
      "In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end the TPS program for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, freezing an earlier ruling by Chen.",
      "Chen said that decision concerned only preliminary relief he ordered that postponed the Department of Homeland Security's actions. The high court's order, he said, did not bar him from adjudicating the case on the merits or issuing relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "The Justice Department will likely appeal the decision.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling in a statement, and said Noem will \"use every legal option at the Department's disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans.\"",
      "\"For decades the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program. Its use has been all the more dangerous given the millions of unvetted illegal aliens the Biden Administration let into this country,\" the statement read.",
      "Congress in 1990 established the Temporary Protected Status program, which allows the federal government to provide temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries experiencing wars, natural disasters, or other \"extraordinary and temporary\" conditions that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program lets TPS holders temporarily remain in the U.S. and apply for renewable work permits.",
      "During the Biden administration, the Department of Homeland Security designated Venezuela, which is the largest country included in the TPS program, covering roughly 600,000 migrants. It also created or expanded programs for Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti and Ukraine. The Biden administration had extended the TPS designations for Venezuela and Haiti.",
      "After President Trump returned to the White House for his second term, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem first sought to reverse the TPS extension for Venezuela, and then moved to terminate the designation altogether. She also sought to unwind TPS protections for Haitians and migrants of several other countries.",
      "The National TPS Alliance and Venezuelan TPS holders filed their lawsuit challenging Noem's decisions in February and argued she did not have the authority to unilaterally roll back the extension granted by her predecessor.",
      "In his decision against the Trump administration, Chen said Noem's attempts to reverse the TPS extensions granted by the Biden administration were \"extraordinary and unusual,\" and marked the first time in the program's 35-year-history that such a step had been taken. He called the decision-making process surrounding the move \"truncated and condensed,\" and said Noem failed to consult the appropriate agencies.",
      "\"As a matter of law, the Secretary lacked the implicit authority to vacate. Even if she had such authority, there is no genuine dispute that she exceeded that authority,\" he wrote.",

      "The image of comet 3I/ATLAS was captured on Aug. 27 using one of the telescopes at the International Gemini Observatory in Chile during a public outreach event allowing students to work with astronomers.",
      "The comet is only the third-known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. It poses no threat to Earth, NASA previously said.",
      "Comet 3I/ATLAS has been photographed multiple times since its discovery in July. In early August, NASA and the European Space Agency released photos taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. It was about 277 million miles away from Earth when the telescope captured it.",
      "The new image from the Gemini Observatory shows the comet's broad coma, or a cloud of dust and gas that forms around its nucleus as it gets closer to the sun, astronomers said in a news release. The tail spans about 1/200th of a degree in the sky. One degree is about the width of a pinky finger, according to the news release. The tail also points away from the sun.",
      "The features are \"significantly more extended than they appeared in earlier images,\" according to astronomers. This means that the comet has become \"more active\" as it travels through the inner solar system.",
      "The main purpose of the observatory session, which allowed students and members of the public to remotely join astronomers in the control room, was to look at the wavelengths of light that emit from the comet. The wavelengths, also called a spectrum, can give scientists information about the comet's composition and chemistry, helping them understand how the comet changes while passing through the solar system, the news release said.",
      "NASA previously said the comet is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October and pass between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The comet is expected to remain visible through September, then get too close to the sun to observe until it reappears on the other side of the solar body in early December.",

      "The company has agreed to pay authors about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement. A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year, and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "The landmark settlement could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement. A judge could approve the settlement as soon as Monday.",
      "\"As best as we can tell, it's the largest copyright recovery ever,\" said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \"It is the first of its kind in the AI era.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Anthropic Aparna Sridhar deputy general counsel said the settlement \"will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims.\"",
      "Sridhar added that the settlement comes after the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June ruled that Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train Claude did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "\"We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery and solve complex problems,\" Sridhar said.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced\u00a0Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Settlement terms",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\"We were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\" said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic's Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",
      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \"damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\" if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \"an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors' works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security said it was moving forward with ramped-up immigration enforcement in Chicago this week in an effort dubbed Operation Midway Blitz.",
      "\"This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American Streets,\" the department said in a statement Monday. The department said the mission would be carried out \"in honor of Katie Abraham,\" who was killed in a drunk driving hit-and-run crash that happened in Urbana, about 130 miles south of Chicago, earlier this year.",
      "Spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the operation \"will target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago.\"",

We will continue our law enforcement and public safety mission, undeterred, as we surge ICE resources in the city in coordination with our federal partners from across Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice.\"",

      "\"Once again, this isn't about fighting crime. That requires support and coordination \u2014 yet we've experienced nothing like that over the past several weeks.  Instead of taking steps to work with us on public safety, the Trump Administration's focused on scaring Illinoisians,\" he wrote.",
      "Mayor Brandon Johnson said the city has not received any official notice from the Trump administration about its immigration crackdown.",
      "\"We are concerned about potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE's track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"There are more than 500 documented incidents of human rights abuses at detention facilities since Trump took office, including deaths of detainees and alleged cases of sexual abuse of minors by federal immigration agents. Because of these incidents and more, we remain opposed to militarized immigration enforcement that runs afoul of the Constitution in our city.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-surgeon-general-school-vaccine-requirements/",
    "published": "Mon, 08 Sep 2025 15:50:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo said his department did not do any data analysis on how a change in vaccine rules could affect outbreaks of diseases like measles, polio or whooping cough.",
    "story": [
      "Florida's top health official said last week that the state will start dismantling school vaccine mandates, something no other state has done in modern U.S. history. On Sunday, in a CNN interview with Jake Tapper, Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo confirmed that his department did no data analysis or projections on how the change could affect outbreaks of diseases like measles, polio or whooping cough.",
      "When Tapper pressed him, Ladapo said he didn't think modeling was needed. \"Ultimately, this is an issue very clearly of parents' rights,\" he said. \"So do I need to analyze whether it's appropriate for parents to be able to decide what goes into their [child's body]? I don't need to do an analysis on that.\"",
      "The rollback, announced on Sept, 3, starts with rule changes that drop vaccine requirements for hepatitis B and chickenpox. Other vaccines \u2014 like those for measles, polio and whooping cough (pertussis) \u2014 are written into state law, so lawmakers would have to vote to remove them. Ladapo said he also wants those gone, calling vaccine rules a violation of \"bodily autonomy.\"",
      "Without projections about the potential impact, hospitals can't plan for enough staff, beds or children's ICU care if there are outbreaks of preventable diseases. Between 2008 and 2022, the U.S. lost about 20% of children's hospital beds, especially in rural areas, which means many families must travel farther to get care. Children's hospitals aren't built to handle big waves of sick kids. During the influenza, COVID and RSV surges in 2022 and 2023, hospitals quickly ran out of space.",
      "School vaccine rules have long been the best way to prevent such outbreaks by keeping vaccination rates high and protecting both children and the wider community. In addition to the decision by Ladapo and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to roll back childhood vaccination mandates, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s CDC vaccine advisory panel has questioned the need for COVID and RSV shots to protect infants and kids.",
      "Ladapo singled out whooping cough, arguing that pertussis vaccines are \"ineffective at preventing transmission.\" Research shows that immunity from pertussis vaccines does wane within a few years, but the shots still provide critical protection against severe illness. A large study of U.S. children found that unvaccinated kids were 13 times more likely to contract pertussis than those who were fully vaccinated. Maternal vaccination during pregnancy reduces infant hospitalizations by more than 90%.",
      "For more than 100 years, U.S. Supreme Court rulings have supported vaccine requirements. In Jacobson v. Massachusetts, in 1905, the Court said a state could mandate smallpox shots during an outbreak. The justices explained that personal freedom has limits when public safety is at risk and that states can enact reasonable health regulations to protect the public. Seventeen years later, in Zucht v. King, the Court ruled that schools could keep out children who weren't vaccinated, even if there wasn't an outbreak. This confirmed that school vaccine rules are a legal way for states to keep students safe.",
      "\"The courts have been clear and powerful for over a century, ruling consistently that vaccine mandates are a reasonable and lifesaving public health tool,\" said Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University. \"For decades, every state has required school-based vaccinations and no court has even questioned it. But all that settled law is unraveling.\"",
      "Gostin explained that courts usually let states decide their own health rules. This means states may require vaccines, but they don't have to. Because of this, Florida may be able to drop vaccine rules without violating old Supreme Court decisions. The bigger risk, he warned, is that today's courts might change the rules: they could demand that states provide stronger reasons for vaccine mandates or force all states to allow religious exemptions \u2014 which several states, like California and New York, don't currently do. Either step would make vaccine laws weaker around the country.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for President Trump's administration to resume sweeping immigration enforcement stops in the Los Angeles area for now as part of the president's campaign to carry out mass deportations of people in the U.S. unlawfully.",
      "The high court agreed to freeze a district court's temporary restraining order that prevented federal immigration authorities from stopping people in Southern California without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. unlawfully. That order barred officials from relying solely on certain factors like a person's race or occupation as the basis for a detentive stop.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit largely rejected the Trump administration's request to pause the district court's order. The Justice Department then\u00a0sought emergency relief\u00a0from the Supreme Court.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the injunction issued by the district court hampered the ability of immigration authorities to enforce the nation's immigration laws in Los Angeles and put them at risk of violating its order during routine investigative stops.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.",
      "\"That decision is yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,\" Sotomayor, joined by Kagan and Jackson, wrote of the majority's move. \"We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.\"",
      "In response to the Supreme Court's order, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said \"we look forward to full vindication on this front in short order, but in the meantime, the Trump Administration will continue fulfilling its mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security praised the court's move, calling it a \"win for the safety of Californians and the rule of law.\"",
      "\"DHS law enforcement will not be slowed down and will continue to arrest and remove the murderers, rapists, gang members and other criminal illegal aliens that Karen Bass continues to give safe harbor,\" DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, referring to the mayor of Los Angeles.",
      "In a statement of her own, Bass said the ruling \"will lead to more working families being torn apart and fear of the very institutions meant to protect \u2014 not persecute \u2014 our people.\"",
      "\"I want the entire nation to hear me when I say this isn't just an attack on the people of Los Angeles, this is an attack on every person in every city in this country,\" the mayor said. \"Today's ruling is not only dangerous \u2014 it's un-American and threatens the fabric of personal freedom in the United States of America.\"",
      "The legal challenge",
      "The greater Los Angeles area, located within the Central District of California, is home to nearly 20 million people. The Trump administration estimates that 2 million of its residents are in the country illegally and has said that the region is a \"top enforcement priority.\"",
      "In June, federal immigration agencies began undertaking efforts to ramp up immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, which\u00a0Mr. Trump called\u00a0the \"largest mass deportation operation \u2026 in history.\" After protests broke out in response to enforcement operations at workplaces in the region, the Trump administration\u00a0deployed members of the California National Guard\u00a0and\u00a0active-duty Marines\u00a0to Los Angeles in June to protect federal property and immigration agents.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court arose after three men who are in the U.S. illegally were arrested and filed a lawsuit seeking release from detention. The men, who live in Pasadena, were working as day laborers and were arrested in mid-June as part of a targeted enforcement action at a donut shop, according to court papers. They have since been released on bond.",
      "The migrants, later joined by two U.S. citizens and four organizations, challenged the Trump administration's immigration raids, alleging that officers violated their Fourth Amendment rights when conducting patrols and other enforcement operations. One of the plaintiffs, Brian Gavidia, was confronted by armed agents while working at a tow yard and repeatedly told officers he was a U.S. citizen as they tried to detain him.",
      "The plaintiffs claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were targeting certain businesses and conducting \"indiscriminate immigration operations.\"",
      "Last month, a federal district court agreed to issue a temporary restraining order that blocked federal agents from conducting immigration enforcement stops without reasonable suspicion that the person they are stopping is in the U.S. illegally. The order from U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong specified that agents could not rely solely on four factors as grounds for detaining people: apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; being at a specific location like a bus stop, agricultural site or day laborer pick-up site; and the type of work a person does.",
      "In her decision, Frimpong, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, wrote there was a \"mountain of evidence\" that \"roving patrols\" were indiscriminately stopping and detaining people without reasonable suspicion in violation of the Fourth Amendment.",
      "But in the request for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer, the solicitor general, called Frimpong's injunction a \"straitjacket on law-enforcement efforts.\"",
      "\"The injunction wrongly brands countless lawful stops as unconstitutional, thereby hampering a basic law-enforcement tool, while turning every single stop in the District into a potential contempt trap,\" he wrote in a filing. \"No agent can confidently enforce the law and engage in routine stops when the district court may later refuse to credit that the stop reflected additional, permissible factors and instead treat virtually any stop as contemptuous misconduct.\"",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs said that the Trump administration's pattern of conducting immigration enforcement stops without reasonable suspicion has done \"immeasurable\" harm.",
      "\"Numerous U.S. citizens and others who are lawfully present in this country have been subjected to significant intrusions on their liberty. Many have been physically injured; at least two were taken to a holding facility. And all have had to endure the prospect of unavoidable future intrusions based on broad demographic factors like the color of their skin,\" they told the Supreme Court in a filing.",
      "The lawyers warned that, if allowed, the Trump administration's practices could ensnare millions of people in Southern California who are U.S. citizens or legally in the country in an \"immigration dragnet.\"",
      "\"The government's extraordinary claim that it can get very close to justifying a seizure of any Latino person in the Central District because of the asserted number of Latino people there who are not legally present is anathema to the Constitution,\" they said.",

      "Officers responded to a call at around 2 p.m. Saturday reporting a deceased person in a wooded section of the park, according to Auburn Police. At around 3:30 p.m., the police department shared a social media post instructing people to avoid Kiesel Park because of \"a heavy first responder presence\" in the area. It remained closed through the weekend as police launched an investigation into the attack.",
      "Schnuelle had suffered injuries that indicated \"the death was caused by an assault,\" Auburn Police said, and the county coroner told WRBL that evidence was consistent with trauma sustained from a sharp object, potentially a knife, according to the station. The coroner said the body would undergo a full autopsy exam, WRBL reported.",
      "Auburn Police arrested Montgomery resident Harold Rashad Dabney, 28, in connection with the fatal stabbing on Sunday, the department said.

    "summary": "Justice Amy Coney Barrett spoke with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell for her first TV interview since joining the Supreme Court in 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Justice Amy Coney Barrett spoke with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell for her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court in October 2020, responding to criticism that the Supreme Court is allowing President Trump to expand the bounds of executive power and discussing the attacks waged on the federal judiciary.",
      "Selected by President Trump to succeed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died just weeks before the 2020 presidential election, Barrett's appointment to the high court widened its conservative majority to 6-3. At 53, she is likely to serve for decades.",
      "So far in her tenure on the Supreme Court, Barrett has been in the majority in landmark decisions overturning Roe v. Wade, ending affirmative action in higher education, and curbing federal regulatory power. She also joined with her conservative colleagues in ruling last year that former presidents have immunity from federal prosecution for official actions taken while in office.",
      "But this year, she earned the ire of some conservatives after declining to grant the Trump administration emergency relief during an early stage of a challenge to its freezing of foreign aid funding. Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts also joined with the three liberal justices in rejecting Mr. Trump's bid to delay his sentencing earlier this year for a felony criminal conviction in New York.",
      "Barrett has written a new book, \"Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution\" (which will be available to the public Sept. 9). She spoke with O'Donnell about an array of topics related to the Supreme Court, including how it handles emergency appeals, its June 2022 ruling unwinding the constitutional right to abortion, and the threats she has faced since becoming a justice.",
      "Here are five takeaways from Barrett's interview:",
      "Barrett details the decision overturning Roe v. Wade",
      "Shortly after Barrett joined the Supreme Court in October 2020, the high court agreed to take up a case that asked it to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to an abortion.",
      "In June 2022, a five-justice majority on the Supreme Court voted to dismantle the federal abortion protections, saying it would be up to states to decide the issue of abortion access. Barrett was among the five justices who voted to overturn Roe.",
      "Explaining the decision, Barrett said that the Supreme Court did not outlaw abortion through its ruling in the case, known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.",
      "\"Dobbs did not render abortion illegal. Dobbs did not say anything about whether abortion is immoral,\" she told O'Donnell. \"Dobbs said that these are questions that are left to the states. All of these kinds of questions, decisions that you mention that require medical judgments, are not ones that the Constitution commits to the court, you know, to decide how far into pregnancy the right of abortion might extend.\"",
      "Barrett said that before the Supreme Court overturned Roe, it had drawn lines.",
      "\"What Dobbs says is that those calls are properly left to the democratic process, and the states have been working those out,\" she said. \"There's been a lot of legislative activity and a lot of state constitutional activity since the decision in Dobbs was rendered.\"",
      "Since Roe was reversed, 14 states have enacted near-total bans on abortion, and a handful more have restricted access to the procedure. But 18 states protect abortion access.",
      "\"The question is how do you decide because I don't think that \u2014 well, certainly my children would say they don't want me deciding under the law of Amy what liberties, what rights we have and not. I mean, that's a job for the American people, and the Constitution leaves virtually every question like that to the democratic process, to the American people,\" she said.",
      "Barrett says emergency orders present \"challenge\" for the court",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to office for a second term, the Supreme Court has been asked by the Justice Department to intervene in the early stages of cases nearly two dozen times. These cases land on the court's emergency docket, or \"shadow docket,\" a term coined by a University of Chicago law professor in 2015.",
      "While emergency relief was typically sought in death penalty cases, the Supreme Court has in recent years been asked to issue interim orders that, if granted, remain in place while litigation moves through the lower courts.",
      "As federal judges have issued injunctions blocking many of Mr. Trump's policies this year, the Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to step in and freeze those orders, allowing it to continue enforcing a challenged policy as the cases proceed. The high court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of independent agencies, terminate grants from the Department of Education and National Institutes of Health, and move forward with agency plans to terminate thousands of federal workers, among other decisions.",
      "The Trump administration has prevailed in most of those emergency appeals. The Supreme Court's handling of those requests has sparked complaints from its critics, as it often does not provide a written explanation for its decision.",
      "\"The emergency orders present a challenge because they do require the work of the court to proceed far more quickly than it normally does,\" Barrett told O'Donnell.",
      "The justice said the Supreme Court \"typically moves slowly.\" When it agrees to hear a case and decide the merits, each side submits briefs presenting their legal arguments, the justices hear oral arguments and then typically spend weeks, if not months, working on opinions.",
      "\"I describe in the book the way that oral argument has grown and developed over 200 years, it's taken us to kind of settle into the way that we do arguments and opinions,\" Barrett said. \"The emergency docket moves much more quickly, and it is a much more recent phenomenon.\"",
      "She added: \"The emergency docket is newer, and so I would say those processes are still being shaped and sorted out.\"",
      "Barrett says it's \"wrong\" to suggest the Supreme Court has an agenda",
      "Mr. Trump shaped the current composition of the Supreme Court, appointing three of its nine justices \u2014 Barrett and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 during his first term.",
      "Critics of the Supreme Court have said the conservative majority has allowed Mr. Trump to expand the bounds of his power by granting the emergency relief he has sought. But Barrett rejected that contention.",
      "\"Justices and courts, district courts, are not trying to enable Congress or the executive to do anything. We're deciding cases,\" she told O'Donnell.",
      "Barrett said cases that come to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket are \"far more tentative,\" and there are more factors that the justices have to consider when asked to grant a stay, including whether the applicant will be irreparably harmed without relief.",
      "\"I think people will disagree with respect to any individual order, whether the court made the right judgment about the merits or not,\" she said. \"I think in so far as the question might suggest that the court has an agenda or some motive, that's just wrong.\"",
      "Barrett said it's not the Supreme Court's job to \"survey\" and form a political view, explaining \"our job is to decide these legal questions.\"",
      "Barrett details the threats she has received since joining the Supreme Court",
      "In May 2022, a draft of the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade was published by the news outlet Politico, an unprecedented leak that Chief Justice John Roberts denounced as a \"betrayal.\" The person who leaked the draft opinion has not been identified.",
      "In response, demonstrators appeared outside the homes of several of the conservative justices, including Barrett's, to protest Roe's impending reversal. The protests went on for months, and then-Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the U.S. Marshals Service to provide additional support to ensure the safety of the justices.",
      "Shortly after the leak, a California man allegedly armed with a gun, knife and various tools was arrested outside of Kavanaugh's Maryland house. He was charged with attempting to kill a Supreme Court justice and pleaded guilty in April of this year.",
      "Since then, judges across the country have continued to face threats to their safety and harassment. In July, three sitting federal judges spoke out about how they have been targeted after ruling against the Trump administration, including through \"swattings\" and \"pizza doxxings.\"",
      "Barrett's sister was the target of a bomb threat at her home in South Carolina, CNN reported in March. The justice herself is the \"not-so-proud owner\" of a bulletproof vest, she said, recalling one of her sons asking if he could try it on.",
      "\"Thinking, 'This is a parenting moment that I wasn't quite prepared for,' I said, 'Sure. Go ahead.' And he puts it on. And then he looked up at me and he said, 'Wait. Why do you have a bullet-proof vest?'\" Barrett recalled. \"So, you know, we've tried to explain those things to the kids.\"",
      "When demonstrators were protesting outside her home, Barrett said her family developed a safety routine for when her children would arrive to find them there. The justice recalled her son getting dropped off, and realizing she had forgotten to tell him there would be protesters outside.",
      "The justice confirmed to O'Donnell that she has received death threats, and condemned threats of violence.",
      "\"I think that it should not be the price of public service for any official, judges included, to face violence or threats of violence,\" she said.",
      "Barrett said she tries to tune out the criticism lodged against her, which has come from both sides of the aisle, and said judges have been the subject of attacks before.",
      "\"I think that's part of the risk of the job,\" she said. \"You know, many judges and justices before me have faced criticism and threats. And I am sure that will be true in the future. That's why it requires a stiff spine.\"",
      "Still, Barrett said she believes there has been a shift in the justices' experience on the Supreme Court that began after Justice Antonin Scalia died in 2016. Barrett said she is seldom alone now and rarely drives herself.",
      "Barrett said that she doesn't like \"not being anonymous,\" and acknowledged that working as a public servant comes at a cost, like losing your privacy.",
      "\"One of the things I miss is just being able to go to the grocery store and not worrying that someone's gonna recognize me. I don't like that part of it,\" she said. \"So I find the being a public figure and being with security, I've found that hard to get used to, even five years in.\"",
      "Barrett says being a justice requires a \"stomach for criticism\"",
      "Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court by Mr. Trump was praised by conservatives, but she has since received criticism from some of the president's allies for recent votes in cases involving him and his administration.",
      "Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who has compiled information for Mr. Trump about White House personnel, called Barrett a \"DEI appointee,\" referencing diversity, equity and inclusion, and Fox News host Mark Levin claimed the justice \"deceived people into thinking she was a reliable constitutionalist.\"",
      "\"I've been criticized by the left, I've been criticized by the right, I'm sure I've been criticized by the middle,\" Barrett said of the attacks on her. \"If you can't have a stomach for people not liking you, and if you don't have a stomach for criticism, then you're not suited to the role.\"",
      "Still, she acknowledged the difficulties of being \"unpopular.\"",
      "\"That's why being a judge \u2014 you know, people think it's glamorous but it's actually public service and hard work. I love it because I love the ability to serve my country, I think that's a privilege. I enjoy the work. I like my colleagues, my law clerks are wonderful,\" Barrett said. \"But there is this other side, you know, this personal cost, this willingness to be unpopular.\"",

      "\"I am pleased to announce this morning that the Department of Education will soon issue new guidance protecting the right to prayer in our public schools, and it's total protection,\" the president said, to applause and cheers from attendees ahead of a meeting of the Justice Department's Religious Liberty Commission.",
      "Mr. Trump did not provide further details about what the new guidance will be.",
      "In a speech focused on religious liberty and his administration's work to protect the interests of religious conservatives, he said it's \"ridiculous\" that today's students are \"indoctrinated with anti-religious propaganda, and some are even punished for their religious beliefs.\"",
      "The president said the new guidance will support students like Hannah Allen, who was in the audience Monday. According to the First Liberty Institute, which represent Allen, Allen was praying for an injured peer in Honey Grove Middle School's cafeteria in Honey Grove, Texas in 2018. The school required the students to instead pray behind a curtain, move to an empty gym or go outside, the group said. Under pressure from religious liberty groups, the Honey Grove Texas Independent School District eventually reversed the decision.",
      "\"I know what you went through. I know what you went through,\" the president told Allen.",
      "Mr. Trump also talked about his administration's efforts to offer tax credits for school choice scholarships, and his efforts to keep transgender students out of sports. The president suggested the nation's faith and success are linked.",
      "\"When faith gets weaker, our country seems to get weaker,\" the president said. \"When faith gets stronger, as it is right now, we're having a very good period of time after some rough years, good things happen for our country. It's amazing the way it seems to work that way.\"",
      "The president said the American people \"have to bring back religion in America, bring it back stronger than ever before.\"",
      "Against the backdrop of the Bible Museum, the president also announced he donated his Trump family Bible, given to him by his mother, to the museum to be put on display. It was used during both of his inauguration ceremonies.",

      "The latest dispute before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of nonprofits and businesses that receive money for foreign assistance projects. The plaintiffs argued that the 90-day freeze was an unconstitutional exercise of the president's authority.",
      "The case has already landed at the Supreme Court, though in an earlier stage in the proceedings. In early March, the high court split 5-4 in rejecting a bid from the president to keep $2 billion in foreign aid frozen while the case moved forward.",
      "The case has progressed since then. Last month, a three-judge panel on the D.C. Circuit said that the nonprofits and businesses could not sue. The 2-1 panel wiped away an order from Ali that had prohibited the government from impounding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit panel issued an amended opinion late last month that opened up an avenue for the nonprofits and businesses to seek relief on different legal grounds.",
      "On the heels of that decision, Mr. Trump sent a letter to Congress proposing to rescind a total of $4.9 billion, which includes funding for the State Department, international development programs and the the U.S. Agency for International Development, which the president has moved to shutter.",
      "The president's plan is an attempt to roll back funding unilaterally and has not been done in nearly 50 years. One Republican has called the effort \"unlawful\" and said the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the power of the purse.",
      "The plaintiffs in the case sought a new preliminary injunction. Last week, Ali found that the government has a statutory duty to spend the $4 billion that is subject to Mr. Trump's rescission proposal. He ordered the Trump administration to spend the expiring funds approved by Congress for foreign assistance, unless Congress claws it back in accordance with the procedures laid out in federal law.",
      "In seeking relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer, the solicitor general, said Ali's injunction \"puts the executive branch at war with itself\" by requiring it to spend the same $4 billion that the president wants to claw back.",

    "story": [
      "Chagas disease, a potentially deadly condition caused by an infected triatomine insect or \"kissing bug,\" may be becoming endemic in the United States, according to a\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report.",
      "In the report, which was originally published last month for the September issue of the CDC's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal, the authors said the disease is already endemic to 21 countries in the Americas, and growing evidence of the parasite is challenging the non-endemic label in the U.S.",
      "\"Autochthonous (or, locally acquired) human cases have been reported in 8 states, most notably in Texas. Labeling the United States as non-Chagas disease-endemic perpetuates low awareness and underreporting,\" the report noted, adding the insect has been reported in 32 states.",
      "Other states with human cases include California, Arizona, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas, according to the report.",
      "The report notes that data is \"inadequate\" to prove that the insects are increasing in geographic distribution or abundance. But it also says that the bugs are \"increasingly recognized\" because of frequent encounters with humans and due to more research attention.",
      "\"Invasion into homes, human bites, subsequent allergic reactions or exposure to T. cruzi parasites, and increasing frequency of canine diagnoses have led to growing public awareness,\" it says.",
      "What causes Chagas disease?",
      "The condition is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasites found in triatomine or \"kissing\" bugs, which can pass the disease to other animals and humans.",
      "According to UCLA Health, the insect's nickname comes from the bug often biting people on the face.",
      "According to the CDC, about 8 million people globally and 280,000 in the United States have the disease, often without knowing it.",
      "\"People might scratch or rub bug feces into a bite wound, their eyes, or mouth without realizing it, which allows the parasite to enter their body,\" the CDC says, adding bugs pass the parasite in their droppings after biting a person or animal. \"If these droppings get into someone's body through a cut in the skin, or near the eyes or mouth, it can lead to infection.\"",
      "The disease does not spread from person to person like a cold, nor does it spread through casual contact with those infected.",
      "Without treatment, the condition can be life-threatening, the CDC says.",
      "Symptoms of Chagas disease in adults",
      "In the acute phase, which happens shortly after infection, a type of eyelid swelling known as Roma\u00f1a's sign may appear.",
      "\"This happens when the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite gets into the eyelid, usually by accidentally rubbing the bug feces into your eye or into a bug bite near your eye,\" the CDC says.",

      "In both stages, some people might not feel sick while others can have serious health problems, the CDC adds.",
      "How to avoid kissing bugs",
      "There are no vaccines or drugs that can prevent Chagas disease at this time, according to the CDC, so it's important to protect yourself.",
      "Prevention methods include staying in well-built places if traveling, using insecticides and bug spray, wearing clothes that cover your skin and not eating raw fruits and vegetables, as the infection can also be acquired orally or through the mouth via contaminated food.",

      "Carlos Alcaraz\u00a0claimed his sixth major trophy overall at the U.S. Open on Sunday after defeating No. 1 Jannik Sinner. It is his second of 2025 following his victory over Sinner at the French Open.",
      "Alcaraz won the first set 6-2 in 37 minutes once the match finally began after a delay caused by extra security measures for\u00a0President Trump, who watched the match from a suite at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York City.",
      "Sinner, the 24-year-old defending champion from Italy, then took the second set 6-3. That was the first and only set Alcaraz lost in his seven matches at the tournament.",
      "The third set was dominated by Alcaraz, who took it 6-1.",
      "Alcaraz then closed out the championship with a 6-4 win in the fourth set.",
      "Since May, Alcaraz has won 36 of 37 contests. The one loss was to Sinner at Wimbledon \u2014 also Alcaraz's first defeat in a Slam final. Alcaraz leads the tour in wins (60) and titles (six) in 2025 and has reached the finals at his past eight tournaments.",
      "The Sunday showdown between Sinner and Alcaraz \u2014 who will now be No. 1 \u2014 marked the first time in tennis history that the same two men played each other in three consecutive Grand Slam finals within a single season.",
      "\"I'm seeing you more than my family,\" Alcaraz joked during the trophy ceremony, eliciting a grin from Sinner. \"It's great to share the court, to share the locker rooms, everything.\"",
      "This 2-hour, 42-minute win gave Alcaraz, a 22-year-old from Spain, leads over Sinner, a 24-year-old from Italy, of 10-5 in their head-to-head series, 6-4 in total Grand Slam trophies, and 2-1 in U.S. Open championships.",
      "\"I give lots of credit to him, because he handled the situation better than I did,\" said Sinner, who lamented that his own play was too predictable. \"He raised his level when he had to.\"",
      "Under a closed roof because of rain earlier in the day, Alcaraz was stronger, faster, more well-equipped for the occasion.",
      "\"You were better than me,\" Sinner said. \"I tried my best today. I couldn't do more.\"",
      "Alcaraz finished with twice as many winners, 42-21, and his coach, 2003 French Open champ Juan Carlos Ferrero, called the performance \"perfect.\" Alcaraz's view of that assessment? \"He's right. I think I played perfect. ... If I want to beat Jannik, I have to play perfect.\"",
      "This hard-court matchup followed Alcaraz's victory over Sinner across 5 1/2 hours after erasing a trio of match points on the red clay at Roland-Garros in June, and Sinner's victory over two-time reigning champ Alcaraz on the grass at the All England Club in July.",
      "\"The things ... I did well in London,\" Sinner said, \"he did better today.\"",
      "Alcaraz took a week off after Wimbledon and then immediately got to work, spending 15 days with Ferrero focusing on one thing and one thing only: beating Sinner.",
      "\"I studied that match,\" Alcaraz said.",
      "During his defeat at Wimbledon, Alcaraz was caught by a camera telling his team in Spanish: \"From the back of the court, he's much better than me.\"",
      "Perhaps that's why Alcaraz was so aggressive Sunday with his sledgehammer of a forehand. Whenever the smallest opening presented itself, Alcaraz barged through with that shot.",
      "Sinner had dropped a total of one service game in his preceding three matches, but Alcaraz broke right away Sunday and five times in all.",
      "These guys have combined to collect the past eight Slam trophies \u2014 four each \u2014 and 10 of 13. Novak Djokovic, the 24-time major champ eliminated by Alcaraz on Friday, took the other three.",
      "Both Sinner, who had won his past 27 hard-court matches at majors, and Alcaraz offered glimpses Sunday of why they are so good, although it was rare that both were at a peak simultaneously.",
      "As Sinner worked his way into things in the second set, he would celebrate points by pumping a fist toward his guest box, which included Olympic champion ski racer Lindsey Vonn.",
      "Ah, but it was Alcaraz who appeared to have more ticket-buyers on his side.",
      "They regaled him with standing ovations. For one particularly magical volley at a hard-to-believe angle struck just before the ball hit the court \u2014 even Alcaraz himself liked that one, saying \"Wow!\" and breaking into a wide grin. For one special overhead smash to a corner with the tailing movement of a firefly.",
      "And so on.",
      "Sinner, needless to say, wasn't as pleased by those sorts of strokes.",
      "He bounced his racket off the ground and caught it after one lost point. He exhaled and shook his head after another.",
      "Sinner simply doesn't see that sort of stuff from anyone else.",
      "And these numbers say as much about Alcaraz as they do Sinner: Over the last two seasons, Sinner is 1-7 against Alcaraz \u2014 and 109-4 against everyone else.",
      "That one win for Sinner over Alcaraz came at Wimbledon.",
      "Less than two months later, Alcaraz reversed the result to cap what he called \"the best tournament so far that I have ever played.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 08 Sep 2025 15:03:00 -0400",
    "summary": "France's President Emmanuel Macron must search for a fourth prime minister in 12 months after Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou was ousted.",
    "story": [
      "Legislators toppled France's government in a confidence vote on Monday, a new crisis for Europe's second-largest economy that obliges President Emmanuel Macron to search for a fourth prime minister in 12 months.",
      "Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou was ousted overwhelmingly in a 364-194 vote against him. Bayrou paid the price for what appeared to be a staggering political miscalculation, gambling that lawmakers would back his view that France must slash public spending to repair its debts. Instead, they seized on the vote that Bayrou called to gang up against the 74-year-old centrist who was appointed by Macron last December.",
      "The demise of Bayrou's short-lived minority government \u2014 now constitutionally obliged to submit its resignation to Macron after just under nine months in office \u2014 heralds renewed uncertainty and a risk of prolonged legislative deadlock for France as it wrestles with pressing challenges, including budget difficulties and, internationally, wars in Ukraine and Gaza and the shifting priorities of President Trump.",
      "Hunt for a replacement",
      "Although Macron had two weeks to prepare for the government collapse after Bayrou announced in August that he'd seek a confidence vote on his unpopular budget plans, no clear front-runner has emerged as a likely successor.",
      "After Gabriel Attal's departure as prime minister in September 2024, followed by former Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier's ouster by parliament in December and Bayrou now ousted, too, Macron again faces an arduous hunt for a replacement to build consensus in the parliament's lower house that is stacked with opponents of the French leader.",
      "Macron's office said that he'd accept the resignation of Bayrou's government on Tuesday and name a new prime minister \"in the coming days.\"",
      "As president, Macron will continue to hold substantial powers over foreign policy and European affairs and remain the commander in chief of the nuclear-armed military. But domestically, the 47-year-old president's ambitions are increasingly facing ruin.",
      "The root of the latest government collapse was Macron's stunning decision to dissolve the National Assembly in June 2024, triggering a legislative election that the French leader hoped would strengthen the hand of his pro-European centrist alliance. But the gamble backfired, producing a splintered legislature with no dominant political bloc in power for the first time in France's modern republic.",
      "Shorn of a workable majority, his minority governments have since lurched from crisis to crisis, surviving on the whim of opposing political blocs on the left and far-right that don't have enough seats to govern themselves but can, when they team up, topple Macron's choices.",
      "Bayrou's gamble",
      "Bayrou, too, rolled the dice by calling the confidence vote, a decision that quickly backfired on the political veteran as left-wing and far-right legislators seized the opportunity to oust his government, seeking to increase pressure on Macron.",
      "\"This moment marks the end of the agony of a phantom government,\" far-right leader Marine Le Pen said, according to the Reuters news service.",
      "\"Today is a day of relief for millions of French people, of relief over your departure,\" Mathilde Panot of the hard-left France Unbowed told Bayrou in remarks before the vote, according to Reuters.",
      "Bayrou conceded in his last speech as prime minister to the National Assembly that putting his fate on the line was risky. But he said that France's debt crisis compelled him to seek legislative support for remedies, in the face of what he called \"a silent, underground, invisible, and unbearable hemorrhage\" of excessive public borrowing.",
      "\"The greatest risk was to not take one, to let things go on without changing anything, to go on doing politics as usual,\" he said. \"Submission to debt is like submission through military force. Dominated by weapons, or dominated by our creditors, because of a debt that is submerging us \u2014 in both cases, we lose our freedom.\"",
      "At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France's public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros, or 114% of gross domestic product. Debt servicing remains a major budget item, accounting for around 7% of state spending.",
      "Le Pen wants new election",
      "The 577-seat National Assembly interrupted its summer recess to convene for the extraordinary session of high political drama. Macron's opponents worked to leverage the crisis to push for a new legislative election, apply pressure for Macron's departure or jostle for posts in the next government.",
      "Le Pen called for Macron to again dissolve the National Assembly, seemingly confident that her National Rally party and its allies would win a majority in another snap legislative election, positioning it to form a new government.",
      "\"A big country like France cannot live with a paper government, especially in a tormented and dangerous world,\" she said in the National Assembly.",
      "Pressing problems",
      "In a last-ditch effort to save his job before the vote, Bayrou warned that France is risking its future and its influence by racking up trillions in state debts that are \"submerging us,\" pleading for belt-tightening.",
      "Macron's chosen successor will operate in the same precarious environment and face the same pressing budget problems that dogged Bayrou and his predecessors. Macron himself has vowed to stay in office until the end of his term, but risks becoming a lame duck domestically if political paralysis continues.",
      "Under the French political system, the prime minister is appointed by the president, accountable to the parliament and is in charge of implementing domestic policy, notably economic measures.",
      "Arguing that sharp cuts are needed to repair public finances, Bayrou had proposed to cut 44 billion euros ($51 billion) in spending in 2026, after France's deficit hit 5.8% of GDP last year, way above the official EU target of 3%.",
      "He painted a dramatic picture of the European Union's No. 2 economy becoming beholden to foreign creditors and addicted to living beyond its means. He castigated opponents in the National Assembly who teamed up against his minority government despite their own sharp political differences.",
      "\"You have the power to overthrow the government, but you do not have the power to erase reality,\" Bayrou said. \"Reality will remain inexorable. Spending will continue to increase and and the debt burden \u2014 already unbearable \u2014 will grow heavier and more costly.\"",

    "summary": "An Ebola outbreak has killed 16 people in Congo, and a WHO official says President Trump's aid cuts \"will definitely have an impact\" on the response.",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0The Minister of Health for the Democratic Republic of Congo, Samuel Roger Kamba, confirmed last week an outbreak of the highly infectious Zaire strain of Ebola virus disease in the country's Central Kasai Province. He said 16 deaths and 28 suspected cases had been confirmed, including four suspected infections among health care workers.",
      "World Health Organization regional director for Africa Mohamed Janabi said the first case, known as the index case, was a \"34-year-old pregnant woman who was admitted on August 20 and passed away on August 25 with typical features for hemorrhagic fever; bloody diarrhea, bleeding from the nose, vomiting, and bleeding from the rectum.\"",
      "The Ebola virus is transmitted to humans through close contact with infected wildlife, often bats, and can then spread through bodily fluids through close human-to-human contact. The WHO said that, as of Sept. 4, the case fatality rate in the Congo outbreak was 57%, with 80% of the cases in people aged 15 or older.",
      "This is the sixth Ebola outbreak within seven years in Congo, making it the highest concentration of outbreaks since the virus was first discovered in 1976.",
      "A team of first responders arrived Sunday in the Bulape health zone, where the outbreak has struck, with medical supplies.",
      "In the country's capital Kinshasa, health workers and first responders from the Ministry of Health, the WHO and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were given vaccinations ahead of deployments to the affected region.",
      "Congo currently has a stockpile of 2,000 vaccine doses and has ordered more to arrive in the coming days, according to the WHO.",
      "Patrick Otim, the WHO's emergency response coordinator for the area, told reporters during a Sept. 4 briefing that the United Nations agency was already working to trace close contacts with known cases, increase field lab testing capacity and community response to ensure early reporting.",
      "He acknowledged that the DRC had requested additional vaccines and stressed that, as \"early supportive care is key to lifesaving,\" the WHO was working to deliver more medical supplies, including protective clothing and other items \"necessary to manage the outbreak.\"",
      "The last two outbreaks, in 2022, were contained quickly, said Otim, but he noted that they were addressed before the Trump administration severely cut funding for international health programs, including the WHO.",
      "Those cuts have fueled concern in Africa and elsewhere about the ability of individual nations and global agencies to respond to and quickly contain outbreaks of diseases including Ebola \u2014 and to keep such deadly viruses from reaching U.S. shores.",
      "\"The recent cuts will definitely have an impact,\" Otim said at the briefing. \"As a global community, we need to work together to stop this virus, as diseases do not respect borders.\"",
      "\"What we know (from past outbreaks) is you need to get supplies and resources as soon as possible to stop transmission,\" Otim added.",
      "President Trump announced in January that the U.S. \u2014 long a key stakeholder and largest donor to the agency \u2014 would be pulling out of the WHO, with the White House citing \"the organization's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\"",
      "The Trump administration, at the time, also accused the WHO of demanding \"unfairly onerous payments from the United States, far out of proportion with other countries' assessed payments.\"",
      "The WHO warned almost immediately that, given the uncertainty over future U.S. funding, it was cutting back spending in ways that could impact its operations.",
      "Congo's health care system was already overburdened as it battles to contain an mpox outbreak, with roughly 130,000 suspected cases since last year and about 2,000 deaths now recorded, the WHO said at the briefing last week.",
      "Complicating the response is the fact that the nearest medical isolation unit to the outbreak only has 15 beds, and road access from Kinshasa can take up to three days, further delaying the arrival of medical teams and supplies.",
      "The WHO has already delivered about 13 tons of emergency medical supplies to Congo to help contain and treat the outbreak.",
      "Other African nations have put border entry points and health facilities on high alert to detect any possible Ebola cases.",

      "China's exports grew last month but at a slower pace than in recent months, the country's customs agency said Monday.",
      "Exports reached $321.8 billion in August, a 4.4% increase compared to the same month last year. That was down from a 7.2% jump in July. Meanwhile, imports totaled $219.5 billion, a 1.8% rise.",
      "China's large trade surplus has become a contentious issue with major trading partners including the U.S. and the European Union. Low-priced Chinese imports are a boon for consumers but can lead to job cuts in manufacturing.",
      "In the first eight months of the year, China's exported $785.3 billion more in goods than it imported from other countries, the monthly customs data showed.",
      "President Donald Trump also has imposed 30% in additional tariffs on imports from China since taking office early this year. He backed down from even higher tariffs after China retaliated with import taxes of its own. The two countries are in talks to try to reach a trade agreement.",
      "The tariffs from both sides and the possibility they could be raised again are having an impact on two-way trade. Chinese exports to the U.S. plunged 33% in August to $47.3 billion, while its imports from the U.S. dropped 16% to $13.4 billion.",
      "Exports to the EU rose 10.4% to $46.8 billion, while imports from the 27-member bloc edged down slightly to $22.8 billion.",

      "The issue became a focal point of a round of U.S.-China trade talks in London in June. China agreed to approve more export permits for rare earths in return for the U.S. lifting curbs on the sale of chip design software and jet engines to China.",
      "End of de minimis",
      "President Trump in May also ended a de minimis loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong. The exemption \u2014 which applied to parcels valued at $800 or less \u2014 had allowed retailers such as Shein and Temu to ship ultra low-cost apparel and other goods to the U.S. tax-free.",
      "However the platforms have since found ways to work around U.S. tariffs without the loophole, Wired magazine reported recently. \"And it turns out, the elimination of de minimis hasn't stopped their overall growth: The Chinese publication LatePost\u00a0reported\u00a0that global sales for Shein and Temu are higher this year compared to 2024.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 08 Sep 2025 10:03:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Ethiopia says the GERD hydroelectric dam will be a boon to the region, but Egypt and Sudan say it could threaten their \"existential resources.\"",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg\u00a0\u2014 Africa's largest hydroelectric dam, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), on the Blue Nile is scheduled to open Tuesday to major fanfare in Ethiopia. The $5 billion dam project has been a uniting force for Ethiopians both at home and abroad, who have helped to fund the project.",
      "Funding calls had gone out since the project was launched in 2011, with the government also issuing bonds to fund construction of the mile-long, 475-foot-high structure.",
      "The celebrations in Ethiopia, however, will not extend further down the mighty river into neighboring Sudan or Egypt, both of which have warned that the dam could bring grave consequences.",
      "After years of failed talks, there was still no agreement in place a day before the dam was due to commence operations on how the water will flow through the mammoth structure to ensure adequate supplies in Egypt and Sudan.",
      "Only 54% of Ethiopia's roughly 120 million inhabitants have access to reliable power, and Ethiopian officials have said the 5,150-megawatt capacity dam is expected to double national electricity generation capacity.",
      "Egypt and Sudan's opposition to the dam",
      "In a joint statement last week, Egypt and Sudan said the dam \"breached international law and would cause grave consequences to the two downstream countries.\"",
      "Both nations have said they now consider water security a national security concern.",
      "The Blue Nile flows from Ethiopia to Khartoum, Sudan's capital, where it joins the White Nile before flowing into Egypt as the Nile.",
      "The Blue Nile, soon to flow through the new dam, supplies more than 80% of the water for the combined river system.",
      "Egypt's government, noting that more than 90% of the country is desert, has said most of its population lives along the Nile, and it has raised concern for years that the dam will reduce water flow and cause shortages \u2014 and officials have warned they will take measures in response if that happens.",
      "\"Anyone who imagines that Egypt will turn a blind eye to an existential threat to its water security is mistaken,\" Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah El-Sisi said in August, calling it a potential \"existential\" threat to his country.",
      "\"We will continue to monitor the situation and take all measures provided for under international law to safeguard our people's existential resources,\" El-Sisi said.",
      "Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been widely quoted as saying the dam will benefit everyone in the region, through power purchase agreements and flood control.",
      "\"To our neighbours downstream \u2014 Egypt and Sudan \u2014 our message is clear: The Renaissance Dam is not a threat, but a shared opportunity. It is a symbol of regional cooperation and mutual benefit. The energy and development it will generate stand to uplift not just Ethiopia, but the entire region,\" he said in remarks on July 3.",
      "In a social media post on Sept. 2, Abiy called seeing the dam completed \"a historic milestone in Ethiopia,\" adding that for him personally it was a \"final prayer and it was my ultimate wish.\"",
      "Trump's criticism and the U.S. stance on GERD",
      "The U.S. government has long tried to balance the concerns and needs of the countries in the region when it comes to the dam project. During the Biden administration in 2024, then Assistant Secretary of State Molly Phee told reporters the U.S. had \"underscored our recognition of\" Egypt's water needs \"and the importance of the Nile to Egypt,\" along with \"Sudan's concerns about dam operations and safety, and Ethiopia's compelling development needs.\"",
      "She said the U.S. was \"committed to helping all these parties discuss how agreements related to water management, use, and access can contribute to security and stability\" in the region, and she said the administration remained \"ready to engage diplomatically in support of such efforts.\"",
      "More recently, President Trump has criticized the dam, claiming several times without offering evidence or clarification, most recently in late July \u2014 that the project was \"stupidly\" funded \"with United States money, largely,\" and noting specifically Egypt's concerns over its Nile water supply.",
      "The coordination body established by Ethiopia's government to drum up funding for the project has vehemently denied Mr. Trump's assertions, insisting the dam was built \"without any foreign aid.\"",
      "Ethiopia will be hosting the Second Africa Climate Summit from Monday, and Abiy has voiced hope that African leaders attending the summit will also attend Tuesday's GERD grand opening celebrations.",
      "The dam is expected to bring in $1 billion in revenue annually, according to Abiy, who has pledged that the money will help finance other infrastructure projects.",

    "story": [
      "Police in Nepal's capital city of Kathmandu opened fire Monday on protesters demonstrating against a government ban on social media platforms, killing at least 14 and wounding dozens more, according to state TV.",
      "At least six people died at the Bir Hospital in Kathmandu, the Kantipur newspaper said, quoting doctors. Two died at the Civil Hospital and two more at the KMC hospital, according to doctors there who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment.",
      "The wounded were being treated at half of a dozen hospitals in Kathmandu.",
      "Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Nepal's capital Monday to vent their anger against a decision by authorities to block most social media platforms, including Facebook, X and YouTube. Authorities have accused the platforms of failing to register and submit to government oversight.",
      "Protesters pushed through barbed wire and forced riot police to retreat as they surrounded the Nepalese Parliament building. Police fired tear gas and water cannon but were outnumbered and sought safety inside the parliament complex. Police eventually opened fire at the protesters.",
      "Nepal's government communications minister Prithvi Subba told CBS News' partner network\u00a0BBC News\u00a0that police were compelled to use force.",
      "\"Tear gas and water cannons were used after the protesters breached into the restricted area,\" police spokesperson Shekhar Khanal told the AFP news agency.",
      "The situation remained tense and the government announced a curfew for Monday around the parliament, along with the government secretariat, presidential house and other key parts of the city.",
      "\"Stop the ban on social media, stop corruption not social media,\" the crowds chanted, waving the red and blue national flag. Monday's rally was dubbed a protest by \"Gen Z,\" generally referring to people born between 1995 and 2010.",
      "About two dozen social network platforms that are widely used in Nepal were repeatedly given notices to register their companies officially in the country, the government said. Those that failed to do so have been blocked since last week.",
      "TikTok, Viber and three other platforms have registered and continued to operate without interruption.",
      "The move by the authorities came as the government sent a bill for a debate in parliament that seeks to ensure that social platforms are \"properly managed, responsible and accountable.\" It includes asking the companies to appoint a liaison office or point person in the country.",
      "The bill has been widely criticized as a tool for censorship and punishing government opponents who voice their opposition online. Rights groups have called it an attempt by the government to curb freedom of expression and violate fundamental rights.",
      "Nepal in 2023 banned the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok, accusing it of disrupting \"social harmony, goodwill and diffusing indecent materials.\"",
      "That ban was lifted last year after TikTok's executives pledged to comply with local laws, which includes a ban on pornographic sites that was passed in 2018.",

    "summary": "Tom Phillips, who evaded authorities with his three kids in the remote countryside for nearly four years was shot and killed by a police officer",
    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 A man who evaded authorities with his three children in the remote New Zealand countryside for nearly four years was shot and killed by a police officer Monday, law enforcement said.",
      "One child was with Tom Phillips at the time of the confrontation and the other two children were found in the forest hours after the shootout, in which an officer was critically injured.",
      "The December 2021 disappearance of Phillips and his children \u2014 now about 9, 10 and 11 years old \u2014 confounded investigators for years as they scoured the densely forested area where they believed the family was hiding. The father and children weren't believed to ever have traveled far from the isolated North Island rural settlement of Marokopa where they lived, and credible sightings of them were rare.",
      "Phillips hasn't been formally identified, but authorities believe he was the man killed.",
      "A police officer was shot in the head and critically injured during a confrontation with Phillips after he robbed an agricultural supplies store early Monday morning, New Zealand's Acting Deputy Police Commissioner Jill Rogers told reporters in the city of Hamilton. The child with Phillips at the time of the robbery was taken into custody.",
      "The officer was undergoing surgery at a hospital. His injuries were survivable, Rogers said, but he was shot \"multiple times with a high-powered rifle\" and additional surgeries were expected.",
      "The whereabouts of Phillips' other two children were unknown immediately after the shooting and authorities had serious concerns for them, Rogers said earlier.",
      "About 13 hours after their father was killed, however, Rogers told reporters that the children had been found unaccompanied at a remote campsite in a rugged forest. The child taken into custody Monday had cooperated with the authorities, enabling them to narrow the search area, she said.",
      "The farm supplies store targeted Monday was in a small town in the same sprawling farming region of Waikato, south of Auckland, as the settlement of about 40 people the family had vanished from.",
      "Tom Phillips saga captivated New Zealand",
      "The case has fascinated New Zealanders and the authorities made regular unsuccessful appeals for information.",
      "Sightings of Phillips were limited to surveillance footage that showed him allegedly committing crimes in the area. He was wanted for an armed bank robbery in May 2023, accompanied by one of his children, in which he reportedly shot at a member of the public.",
      "Phillips didn't have legal custody rights for his children, Detective Senior Sgt. Andrew Saunders told reporters in 2024. When Phillips and the children vanished, police said he took them over a custody battle. Authorities have said the children hadn't had access to formal education or health care since their disappearance.",
      "Law enforcement always believed that Phillips had help concealing his family, and some residents of the isolated rural area expressed support for him. A reward of 80,000 New Zealand dollars ($47,000), large by New Zealand standards, was offered for information about the family's whereabouts last June but was never paid.",
      "December 2021 wasn't the first time Phillips prompted national news headlines after disappearing with his children. The family went missing that September, launching a three-week land and sea search after Phillips' truck was found abandoned on a wild beach near where he lived.",
      "Authorities eventually ended the search, concluding the family might have died, before Phillips and the children emerged from dense forest where he said they had been camping. He was charged with wasting police resources and was due to appear in court in January 2022, but weeks before the scheduled date, he and the children vanished again.",
      "Police didn't immediately launch a search because Phillips, who is experienced in the outdoors, had told family he was taking the children on another trip. He never returned.",
      "The search intensified again after several sightings of Phillips in 2023 in the same region where he had vanished.",
      "Phillips and his children were spotted in October 2024 when a group of teenage pig hunters saw them trekking through the bush and filmed the encounter on their phones.",
      "He was\u00a0also seen on surveillance video last month as he robbed a grocery store in the night, accompanied by one of his children.",
      "The children's mother issued a statement to Radio New Zealand on Monday in which she said she was \"deeply relieved\" that the \"ordeal\" for her children had ended.",
      "\"They have been dearly missed every day for nearly four years, and we are looking forward to welcoming them home with love and care,\" said the woman, who has been identified in New Zealand news outlets only by her first name, Cat.",
      "Phillips' family had previously appealed to Phillips to turn himself in and return the children.",
      "\"There's a lot of love and there's a lot of support, and we're ready to help you walk through what you need to walk through,\" his sister, Rozzi Phillips,\u00a0told New Zealand news site Stuff\u00a0in an exclusive interview last month.",

      "Pechier is suspected of tampering with his colleagues' paracetamol bags or anaesthesia pouches to create operating room emergencies where he could intervene to show off his resuscitating talents.",
      "\"What he is accused of is poisoning healthy patients in order to harm colleagues with whom he was in conflict,\" Manteaux said.",
      "\"Frederic Pechier was the first responder when cardiac arrest occurred,\" he added. \"He always had a solution.\"",
      "Pechier has blamed \"medical errors\" by his colleagues for most of the poisonings.",
      "Pechier a \"star\" or a criminal?",
      "Some colleagues described Pechier as a \"star anesthetist\" while others said he came across as arrogant and manipulative.",
      "One co-worker claimed Pechier was \"certain he was the best\" and liked to \"think of himself as Zorro.\"",

      "More than 150 civil parties will be represented at the trial.",
      "For the first two weeks, the court will examine Pechier's most recent cases, those that caused investigators' suspicions and led to the his being placed under investigation in 2017.",

    "summary": "At least one of the drones slipped through Israel's defense system and crashed into the passenger terminal at the Ramon International Airport.",
    "story": [
      "A drone fired by the Houthi militants in Yemen breached Israel's air defenses on Sunday and slammed into the country's southern airport, the Israeli military said.",
      "It was one of several drones fired by the Houthis, according to the military, but it said most had been intercepted outside of Israel.",
      "The drone crashed into the passenger terminal at the Ramon International Airport near the resort city of Eilat, the Israeli Airports Authority said, blowing out glass windows and sending smoke plumes billowing.",
      "The Houthis hailed Sunday's attack on Ramon Airport \u2014 some 19 kilometers (12 miles) from Eilat on Israel's southern tip \u2014 as \"a unique, qualitative military operation.\"",
      "\"Enemy airports are unsafe, and foreigners must leave them for their own safety,\" Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, wrote on social media. \"Other sensitive targets are under fire.\"",
      "Israel's Magen David Adom emergency rescue service said it treated a 63-year-old man for light shrapnel wounds. The damage to Ramon Airport appeared limited, and within a couple of hours, it reopened as normal flights resumed.",
      "The attack comes days after Israeli strikes on Yemen's rebel-held capital of Sanaa killed Houthi Prime Minister Ahmed al-Rahawi and other officials in his cabinet in a major escalation of the nearly 2-year-old conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group in Yemen.",
      "Saying that they were acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, the Houthis began firing missiles and drones into Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack ignited the Israeli military's devastating campaign in Gaza.",
      "The Houthis have stepped up their aerial attacks on Israel in recent months, including by deploying warheads with cluster munitions. They scatter smaller explosive projectiles over a large area and are harder for Israel's air defense system to stop, which otherwise intercepts most drones and missiles.",
      "Houthi attacks on Israel, while frequent since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023, have rarely caused major damage or struck significant targets like airports.\u00a0But in May, a Houthi missile hit near Israel's main Ben Gurion Airport, prompting many international airlines to cancel flights to Tel Aviv for months.",
      "Israel pushes forward with Gaza City operation",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday vowed to push forward with Israel's operation in Gaza City, with no reported progress in restarting negotiations between Israel and Hamas.",
      "\"Our effort in Gaza on the last strongholds, actually the last important stronghold, Gaza City, is part of our effort to complete the crushing of the Iranian axis's chokehold,\" Netanyahu said at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem.",
      "Netanyahu claimed that over 100,000 Palestinians have heeded the military's calls to evacuate Gaza City ahead of the operation, a figure disputed by international organizations. The United Nations has reported just 41,000 people out of the city's population of 1 million leaving over the last month.",
      "Meanwhile, attempts to relaunch negotiations between Israel and Hamas are faltering.",
      "Bassem Naim, a member of Hamas' political bureau, said the militant group won't lay down its arms until the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. But he said that Hamas is ready for a long-term truce and will release the hostages still being held in Gaza in exchange for a number of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.",
      "Naim said Hamas is still waiting for Israel to respond to a 60-day\u00a0ceasefire proposal\u00a0crafted by Egyptian and Qatari mediators last month.",
      "The Prime Minister's Office refused to comment on negotiations.",
      "There are 48 hostages still being held in Gaza, around 20 of whom Israel believes are still alive. Militants kidnapped 251 people and killed around 1,200 people in southern Israel during the attack that sparked the war on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said a total of 64,368 people have been killed and 162,776 have been wounded since the start of the war. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but says more than half of the casualties were women and children.",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Roger Marshall, Republican of Kansas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We turn now to Republican Senator Roger Marshall, who joins us this morning from Wichita, Kansas. Welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "SENATOR ROGER MARSHALL: Margaret, great to be with you. I know it's going to be a great discussion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you were an OB-GYN in practice for decades before you ran for office. This past week, the HHS Secretary underwent intense questioning from both democratic lawmakers, and some of your fellow Republicans, who were also doctors. Take a listen.",
      "((BEGIN VIDEO CLIP))",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO:\u00a0 Secretary Kennedy, in your confirmation hearing, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines. Since then, I've grown deeply concerned.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I would say, effectively, we're denying people vaccine.",
      "((END VIDEO CLIP))",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the Republican Whip, and that is the Chair of the Committee, Bill Cassidy. Why do you think they're off base and they're concerned?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, President Trump chose Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be a disrupter to the CDC, and that's exactly what he's doing. He's focused on making the CDC more transparent, to make it more trustworthy right now. Right now, Americans don't trust the CDC, so he is literally turning that place upside down. I respect what my colleagues are saying, but I think that, you know, this whole issue today, or in that meeting, was about vaccines. In my humble opinion, not every person needs every vaccine. And I don't think there's many children out there that need 76 jabs by the time they're old enough to vote. But before you label me a non-vaxxer-person, look, I've raised money for polio vaccinations. The MMR is a great vaccine. It saved thousands of lives. Vaccines, overall, have saved hundreds of millions of lives, but not every person needs every vaccine. And we just want to empower parents and the doctors to make great decisions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I just want to unpack a few things you said there, and just very- because we want to be very careful in this very heated environment. When you say you have a problem with trusting the CDC, it was just a few weeks ago a gunman walked onto the CDC campus in Atlanta and shot the place up. Do you care to respond to that? And do you think that we need to be careful when we are discussing the CDC and public health officials right now?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Well, look, of course, I condemn that shooting. But the lack of confidence in the CDC goes back to what the CDC did during Covid. They misguided us, maybe lied to us, even, about the origins of Covid, and how to treat it, as well. And the vaccine, they over-promised what the vaccine could do as well. So that's where the distrust is. And now, Bobby Kennedy is in there, trying to clean-up that distrust, and trying to give American parents and grandparents and the doctors the right information, transparent information, to make good decisions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, just before we talk about other vaccines, specific to Covid, and what you just said with the CDC; it was- the pandemic was during the Trump administration. It began during the Trump administration, and Operation Warp Speed was a Presidential Directive by Trump, which some of your fellow Republicans say he deserves the Nobel Prize for because it stopped the pandemic. So, did you trust the CDC and Operation Warp Speed under President Trump, or are you saying you don't think the President deserves the prize for that shot?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look President Trump absolutely deserves the Nobel prize. That vaccine saved millions of lives --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay, but you just said something that sounded very contradictory to that. --",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I disagree. I think it's such a different time today than it was five years ago. Five years ago, we had a novel virus. None of us had any immunity to it. It was a strange virus made in a lab in Wuhan, China. But today, on average, Americans have had Covid five times. We now have natural immunity to it, and not everybody needs the vaccine. So both things can be true, and that's why, when you have people who don't understand science, that don't understand medicine, why they don't get it. It was a different day then than it is today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but people do understand that when they go into their pharmacy and have a problem getting a shot. Because in many states, they are now told they need to go back and get a prescription, that the effect, here, of the Kennedy policies are making it more difficult, even if they fall into categories where they should be able to get a shot. You would acknowledge that?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Yeah. Yeah, I think you're making this way, way too complicated. That- look, vaccines are a medicine, and just like you need a prescription to get a GLP-1 --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. You said he's disrupting. But, effectively, what you were hearing the Republican Whip John Barrasso, and the Republican Senator Bill Cassidy talk about was the interruption of the availability of vaccine. Cassidy said, I would say, effectively, we're denying people vaccines. That's not Margaret Brennan, that's Bill Cassidy.",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, I disagree, respectfully disagree. Think about this, what the CDC is now saying is if you're over the age of 65, you can have the vaccine. It's interesting that the UK and France have set 75 and 80 as the age. So, all you need to do is email or call your doctor's nurse and get a prescription, and you should be able to get it. If you're over the age of 6 months, it's probably a good idea to talk to your doctor. And all your nurse has to do is look at the chart and say, oh, little Johnny's got asthma, definitely needs the vaccination as well. So I think we're making this way too complicated. Why does everybody lose their minds when it comes to Covid vaccine? Why can't we let the doctor and the parents decide? Let the patients decide. There's so many more important things out there we should be talking about: Chronic diseases, 20% of our adolescents have obesity, mental health problems in- and are on prescription drugs. There's so many more things to talk about than just Covid vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but I think we're conflating a few things, including the operational aspect of this. I think people get frustrated with their insurance companies. I think people get frustrated with their pharmacies and the implementation of health policy. And you know that that's more complicated than just saying we're changing a few things here. There are big implications, and I want to talk to you about it because you said you like the MMR vaccine. You like DPT, Polio, Smallpox. You don't like Hepatitis B, which is a liver infection, and you don't think newborn kids need to be vaccinated against it. Senator Cassidy, who is a liver doctor, said he treated poor and underserved patients and that it can be a life-altering condition for the rest of your life. So why isn't it a compelling argument to you, that this should be available?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I delivered a baby- delivered a baby every day for 25 years. We did a Hepatitis test on every one of my patients at the time of delivery. If that mom has a negative Hepatitis test, she's in a stable, monogamous relationship, she's not doing IV drugs, she's not letting her baby play in a sandbox full of used needles, then there's zero chance that that baby's going to have Hepatitis. Now, there's other moms that- or other babies that do need it, okay. We need to be more specific. We can't be overly-prescriptive. If that mom has not had prenatal care, if she's an IV drug-abuser, if she's not in a stable relationship, a whole lot of reasons, but we need to pick-and-choose. Not every baby needs Hepatitis vaccine, and especially on day number one. What are these vaccines doing to mess with the immune system of that particular baby as well? So, that's my concern. It's not every baby needs Hepatitis-B vaccine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I understand it can also be spread from- in a household sharing toothbrushes or razors or, for example, if her partner was not monogamous, the pregnant lady, for example. But I hear your point here that you want this to be more bespoke, like, more picking-and-choosing. But others would argue, here, that in doing that, you're going to drive down immunization rates overall, if you create broader doubt in vaccines, and that it's a slippery slope, here. Are you at all concerned that that is going to be the takeaway?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, Anthony Fauci did more to create vaccine hesitancy than Bobby Kennedy will do in his four years, or eight years, however long he has Secretary. That's where the problem is. So, don't blame Bobby Kennedy for the problems created by Anthony Fauci. But this- but I'm just telling --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- I'm asking you about what you said about the Hepatitis-B vaccine.",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I wasn't talking about Bobby Kennedy, or Secretary Kennedy. I was talking about you, and what you said about the Hepatitis-B vaccine, and are you concerned that picking-and-choosing these things like this, this bespoke concept of giving more choice, that it also has the effect of undermining confidence in vaccines?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: I think this is a big difference between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats want a one-size-fits-all prescription for everybody. And I'm telling you, not everybody reads the- reads the book does exactly like that. I have confidence in doctors, and nurses, and parents, and grandparents to make these decisions. I don't think that we should have one government policy that dictates every one of these vaccines. I think local policy, local schools, if they want to have requirements, what Florida did was a bridge too far. But how about just a little common sense? Just a little common sense would go a long ways here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, because President Trump said he had some doubts about that Florida statement you just mentioned there, too, and that he likes a lot of vaccines. Before I let you go, Secretary Kennedy founded this group that is arguing that women taking Tylenol or Acetaminophen might be putting their babies at risk. They claim there's a link to neurodevelopmental disorders. Would you take- tell a pregnant woman to take a Tylenol and not feel worried about it?",
      "SEN. MARSHALL: Look, Tylenol is a Category-B drug. I've given it to lots of patients. It's on the approved- approved list. But, that being said, I try to tell my patients- my pregnant woman, not to take anything, because we don't know what we don't know. I'm very cautious. You know, why- why did 20% of our children have some type of mental health illness right now? Why do we have so many peanut allergies? Why do we have so many people with autoimmune diseases? We- so we don't know. What we don't know, we don't know, and I want gold standard studies to help us figure this out and sort it out. But as far as I know, Tylenol is okay in pregnancy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator, we'll leave it there for today. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner. Good morning, Senator, good to have you here in person. You are known for your intel work, but you're also on a number of other committees. We were just there talking about the economy. Do you agree that basically, the economic data that the United States releases is potentially fundamentally flawed?",
      "SEN. MARK WARNER: No, I think that the BLS has been the gold standard for years, viewed not only in this country, but around the world. Could there be reforms? Absolutely, but it's a little ironic that you're firing the referee, the president firing the head, cutting the staff. I'm not sure how that is going to improve the quality of the data. And the President had promised that a golden age from American workers. We're down 80,000 manufacturing jobs since the beginning of his term. We're basically a flat hiring position. And what I think families who are listening, if anybody's got a family, a family member that's in college or immediately getting out of college. You know what a tough job market is to find this. And one of the things I would like to have heard from Kevin, and frankly, from more economists, is we're about to see the biggest job dislocation in our history, I believe, in terms of AI job dislocation. And those are many times kind of college driven jobs. I mean, think back five years ago, we said to every kid, if you want to get a good job, go become a computer programmer. Those are going to be some of the first jobs ignored and eliminated. And so I just, I'm fearful that this focus on who's keeping score when I think the American public realized the job market is tough, and particularly in terms of manufacturing jobs, there is no golden age.,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and there's also a fundamental remaking of the economy, if you're talking about artificial intelligence. So on that point quickly, there were more than a dozen tech titans at the White House this week, including some of these giants in the artificial intelligence space. Microsoft's founder Bill Gates, Google CEO, Apple CEO, and they were all around the table praising President Trump for the investment in chip manufacturing. And AI, do you deserve- Do you think he does deserve that praise?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I can tell you the chip manufacturing came about because of a bill that John Cornyn and I put in under Biden the Chips Infrastructure Act\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bipartisan.",
      "SEN. WARNER: $52 billion totally bipartisan. President Trump has been very times critical of that bill. Now he is, I think, sending a bit of a mixed message, because some of the investments in that bill were going to Intel, our last meaning, meaningful fabricator of chips. He took an equity stake there, which is debatable, although I do think getting some of the profits\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Taxpayers own 10% of the company now.",
      "SEN. WARNER: But here's the weird thing, while he's trying to support American chip manufacturing, at the same time, he's taken off any of the restrictions on, for example, Nvidia H-20 chips to sell to China. So what- How do we read this if we want to say we want to build American capacity until, yes, make sure we maintain our lead against China. Well, why sell some of our most cutting edge chips to China? It is a complete contradiction in in policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the White House says, Oh, they're not great chips, so therefore we can, can sell them. That's what the Commerce Secretary has said. But on, on the intelligence beat, as the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, you have an oversight authority, and under law, the Intel agencies must inform that committee about their operations. The CIA has to tell you about covert actions. This is an important kind of oversight, but this past week, you said you were blocked from even attending a meeting at the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency out in Virginia. Why do you think you were blocked? And has your Republican counterpart promised you that this isn't going to continue.",
      "SEN. WARNER: I have done these visits to our intel facilities for the 10 plus years I've either been Chair or Vice Chair of the Intelligence Committee. They are part of the normal course. You get a chance to see the workforce, where they're working. You get to see the new, newest, best, coolest stuff, and oftentimes I get to do a town hall meeting, because I'm not only the Chair or Vice Chair, but many of these facilities are in Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEN. WARNER: So this, this meeting have been on the books for literally weeks. Normal course of business. This very unusual individual, Laura Loomer, who is a right wing blogger who is so controversial that the Trump administration didn't even put her in- in their cabinet or- and she has been a 9/11 denier. She's been a virulent anti-anti-Muslim individual. She has been a big proponent of working with white nationalists, yet she seems to have the ear of President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She speaks to top advisors including the Secretary of State.",
      "CROSSTALK",
      "SEN. WARNER: His first National Security Advisor- National Security Advisor got kicked out because she went after him, the head of the National Security Agency who I saw with recently, General Tim Hawk got fired. She claimed that firing. Recently, we've seen 37 senior intel facility individuals lose their, their security classification, which basically puts them out of a job. And she brags about all this on her blog. I mean, it really raises the question, is she actually the Acting Secretary of Defense or Secretary of War as of this morning? Is she the real Director of National Intelligence? What she went after me on was something unrelated to this, and said, Why can we let some anti Trump person in to a intelligence facility? Strangely enough, Tuesday night, my meeting was canceled. Now we're not going to stand up for that. I've talked to my Republican colleagues\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, is Tom Cotton promising you this won't happen again?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I'm going to get those meetings held. I have raised it with Cotton. I've raised it with the other intelligence members. You want to talk about something that is dangerous, you restrict Congress's ability to do oversight, particularly with this administration, then we are flying blind. And in the intelligence space in particular, not every member can do this. Those of us who are senior on the Intel Committee, we are the limited numbers, we are the eyes and the ears of the rest of the Senate to do this oversight. They try to restrict this America will be less safe. And we're going to, I'm going to get those made.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, tell me about this campaign it would have seen in Latin America, with the United States taking out this drug boat. Secretary Rubio, your former colleague on the Senate Intelligence Committee says, quote, if you're on a boat full of cocaine or fentanyl or whatever headed to the United States, you're an immediate threat to the United States. He is saying that is a national security justification to carry out a campaign with an unclear timeline. Have you reached out to Rubio about this? Do you know anything about how it is being formulated here with the intelligence community.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, first of all, the Maduro regime in Venezuela are bad guys, and we obviously need to do all we can to stop fentanyl. We have not been briefed on this. This was a DOD, it was not an Intel project. It was a DOD project. But my fear is, there are still international laws of the sea about how the process of interdicting these kind of boats, they're supposed to be a firing of a warning shot. You're supposed to try to take it peacefully. My understanding, this boat, none of those procedures are followed, and I'm going to get the full brief this week. But what I'm worried about is if we put our sailors in harm's way by violating international law, unless there is the appropriate designations, could this come back and and hurt those sailors? Sailors were doing their job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as far as you know, this is fully a military operation. It is not using the intelligence assets?",
      "SEN> WARNER: Yes, we not\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the administration says they know everyone who was on that boat, they had \"great clarity and fidelity.\"",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I'd like to see that data. But this, again, goes to the point. This kind of action should be briefed to the intelligence community. And I'm a member of what's called the Gang of Eight. Those are the folks that's supposed to get the absolute secret stuff, the only the President gets. I've gotten no briefing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No briefing on this?",
      "SEN. WARNER: No briefing on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are they conducting regular information sharing with Gang of Eight?",
      "SEN. WARNER: There are information sharing, the level of sharing and the timeliness of the sharing we, for example, we were on the Iran bombings. We were not notified beforehand, our my Republican colleagues were notified. When you start making oversight and who gets shared information on a partisan basis, this kind of cooking the books and intelligence how we got into the war in Iraq in the first place?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Warner, thank you for your time. Today. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. So stay with us."

      "KEVIN HASSETT: Good morning. It's great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In person.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot to get to with you, but I want to start on what just happened overnight. Russia has launched a very significant attack on Ukraine and in Kyiv. They actually even hit a Ukrainian government building. Does the U.S. condemn the assault? And what are you waiting for now in terms of triggering those sanctions on Russia?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, as you know, I'm not one of the foreign policy advisors of the President, but at the National Economic Council we are responsible for making sure that sanctions get enforced and that people that are helping Russia with their war against Ukraine, as for example India has been doing, excuse me, by buying Russian oil, that we're ready to respond to them economically. And you know, last night's news is very disappointing and I'm sure that there's going to be a lot of talk today and tomorrow about the level of sanctions and the timing of sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The timing of additional sanctions on Russia.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Correct, yes. I mean it's up to the president in the end. But yes, it's a very disappointing set of affairs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the U.S. economy, there were 22,000 jobs added last month. The past two months of data were also revised down. You've said in interviews this week it suggests there's less momentum here than you thought. Has job creation stalled and should the Federal Reserve be concerned about the jobs picture?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right, well, well first of all, the interesting thing about the jobs numbers, right, is that they had the biggest revisions in 50 years over the summer, and we came in with 22,000 in August. But if you look at what they said in 23 and 24, they have two ways of estimating the jobs. There's something called the payroll survey, where they ask the employers how many people did you hire? Then they have something called the household survey, where they call up people, they say do you, do you have a job?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And over those two years, the payroll numbers said that we created four and a half million jobs and the household survey said about 2 million fewer, about two and a half million jobs. And they should have the same answer. And so for August, for example, the payroll survey said 22,000 and the household survey said 288,000. And so I think that what's going on is that these old fashioned ways of surveying, like I wonder if you've ever gotten a survey in the mail and filled it out and mailed it back in, maybe you have, but I think that that's the way they're trying to do it. And the reason we're getting these massive revisions and these numbers that don't make sense is really that we've got to modernize the way we do the labor data. But if you look at the non-labor data, you know, second quarter GDP was revised up to 3.3%. The Atlanta Fed's GDP estimate for the third quarter right now is 3% and so industrial production is at an all time high.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe all that data? All those models are functioning.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, the point is when there's dissonance in data that you have to sort of watch how it all works out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And the thing that I'm most suspicious of right now, in terms of data quality, is the job number. In part because there are other ways to do it. There's this company called Homebase that does it. Their August number is 150. But again, even think about this, if we ask households how many jobs do they have? It's plus 288,000 in August. If we ask the employers, it's 22,000. Then that's that becomes a puzzle for economists, like what is wrong with the data? And we kind of know what's wrong with the data. What's wrong with the data is people aren't filling out the forms and sending in the surveys.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last month, the president fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, suggesting there was political bias. Not just what you're talking about, which is a very technical issue on how data is collected and crunched. Did you fix the political bias or --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Well, there, there are patterns of the data that look like political bias, but they could be accidental. And that's why we need to get a new set of eyes in there to make sure that things are more transparent, that we modernize the surveys and we make them so that more people trust them. But think about this, at the Federal Reserve --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So you don't trust these numbers?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think the BLS numbers need to really be improved. They need to be modernized. And I gave a talk at the BLS next to Alan Greenspan we had a few years ago where I talked about the necessity of modernizing them, and so I still agree with that position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But trend line wise, when we hear from companies like Caterpillar, Deere, Ford, Procter & Gamble, that their costs are going up due to tariffs. That doesn't suggest there's going to be robust hiring in those sectors, right? When a company is taking on something that could hurt their productivity or profitability I should say?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well we've seen, inflation has come down quite a bit. It was in the high threes when President Trump took office. The average over the six months is 1.9. And, you know, even the Fed right now clearly agrees that inflation has been under control if you believe futures markets because the federal funds futures markets are now saying the Fed is going to cut interest rates three times this year --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Expected to (inaudible) --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- And so the Fed, they're expected to. And so, therefore, you know, the Fed is expected to feel like it's comfortable with where inflation is right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But my point being that doesn't forecast from these companies a scenario in which they would necessarily be hiring. Have you been able to calculate what the immigration crackdown has done to employment?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, yeah, there are, there are a couple of things that we could look at. First of all, the private sector employment is up by about half a million this year and government workers, government employment is down by about 100,000. There's another thing is that most of the jobs that have been created in the U.S. are for native born workers, and they've actually, there's actually been a reduction in labor supply for non-native born workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you prove that?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, we have a, we have a survey where they actually ask it. Now, maybe we don't trust the surveys, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And there is actually a thing --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- And if you know the corporations are hiring undocumented, or have a pattern of it, are you prosecuting those companies?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: There's technicalities that when someone's released into the country then, in the previous administration, then they would often get a number that would allow them to work legally until they went to court. And so there were, for sure, people that were undocumented --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But going after the employers? --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- who were being able to work. But the other thing that you can see in the data, because we get the unemployment insurance claims by like county, that about 80% of the claims for unemployment over the last few months have come from blue states. And so there are places like Portland and Chicago where people are fleeing the cities and you're seeing that in the numbers too.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you don't plan to prosecute companies who had this pattern, you're talking about, of hiring people in the country illegally?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I don't work for the Justice Department, but I do see the pattern of native born versus non-native born employment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we are also seeing in that data, you say you don't trust necessarily, that it's manufacturing. That's trade related. That that is where the lack of hiring is happening. Those are the areas that the President had promised there would be new jobs. When do those new jobs in those sectors come?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right, let's think about it again though that in terms of the way that the data are a little frustrating for everyone right now that industrial production is at an all time high, GDP is booming, productivity was up 3.8% in the last quarter, and it looks like manufacturing jobs are down. And so how is it that industrial production is at an all time high while manufacturing employment is down? It's something that we're looking forward to seeing what happens in the revisions. The revisions have been, last year \u2013 there's a benchmark revision next week \u2013 last year, the revision was more than a million over the last year. This is why we need new and better data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll wait to see if those jobs are created. I want to ask you about the Fed. Because the president, you were standing next to him in the Oval Office, said he might basically make you one of the most powerful men in the world because he's considering you to become the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Our CBS polling we just did shows that 70% of Americans want the Federal Reserve to make decisions independently from President Trump. But there's a big partisan difference here. 59% of Republicans say the Fed should be guided by what Trump wants. 41% should be independent of Trump. Which Republican camp do you fall into?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Oh, if I were in that survey then I would say 100% that monetary policy, Federal Reserve monetary policy, needs to be fully independent of political influence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Including from President Trump?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Including from President Trump. The fact is that we've looked at countries that have allowed the leaders to take over the central banks, and what tends to happen is that it's a recipe for inflation and misery for consumers. And so central bank independence is something that, as you saw, there was a hearing this week about that, that Democrats and Republicans and the White House all agreed about. Now the question is, has the current central bank been as independent as we would like, as transparent we would as we would like? And I think that there's some dispute about that, which we could go into if you'd like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Secretary Bessent went into that in an article in the Wall Street Journal this past week. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- He did. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He talked about the central bank's independence being under threat due to mission creep. There should be an independent, non partisan review of the entire Fed, its role in regulation, monetary policy and research. What's your plan to overhaul the Fed?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I don't have a plan to overhaul the Fed right now. I'm just happy to do my job --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You have to have been thinking about it. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Look, I've been the President's one of his top economic advisers for nine years. We talk about everything from golf to decorating the Oval Office to monetary policy, but right now what I'm focused on is doing my job as Director of National Economic Council every day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would endorse what Secretary Bessent wrote in that article fully --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- Yes I agree with this article, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you would be prepared to implement that vision for the Federal Reserve if you are chair?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: It's a hypothetical that we'll see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it certainly seems from one of the political appointees, the Cabinet member, to be a vision for the future of the Fed that the Trump administration would like.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I agree with his vision, but I look forward to the President deciding who is going to be the Federal Reserve Chair and I think that he and Secretary Bessent will do that ably. There are a lot of great candidates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What will you do if the Supreme Court does rule that the President's tariff policy, or at least those under the IEPPA, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are not legal?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: We certainly don't expect the Supreme Court to do that and I think that we're on pretty high ground and so it's a very unlikely scenario. But the fact is that there are other legal authorities that one could use to get the same outcome. 232s, 301s, you know numbers that we could go into if you like --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Other ways to implement tariffs. --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: -- But it might be like, yeah, too deep a dive for the show on a Sunday. But, but yes, there are other things that could happen should it go that way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Alright. Kevin Hassett, thanks for coming in this Sunday morning.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Thank you, it's great to be here."

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 7, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 And we're joined now by Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth. She joins us this morning from Schaumburg, Illinois. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So you attended, as I understand, a demonstration yesterday in Chicago where thousands of people were out on the street protesting President Trump's vow to send in immigration agents. I know he's also posted on social media suggesting troops will go in. Quote, \"Chicago is about to find out why it is called the Department of War.\" Vice President Vance says there aren't plans to send in troops. Do you have concrete indication, now, that there are plans to do so?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Let's make it clear the president of the United States essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation. This is not normal, Margaret. This is not acceptable behavior. No, we don't have any indications of them getting ready to send troops into Chicago. In fact, I was out at Great Lakes base yesterday, naval training base, and they were able to confirm that the only assistance they've been requested to provide is just office space for ICE, but that no barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared in order to support troops into Chicago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So, so then is this just, you know, social media trash talk? When you say he's declaring war, is this tongue in cheek?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 I think he's renaming the Department of Defense the Department of War, and did he not just say that Chicago will find out what it means to be at war? I don't- I take what the President of the United States says very seriously, because that is the respect you have to give to the office. And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear, it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the President of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Senator, I know you just mentioned you went out to the Great Lakes Naval training session- station, I should say, and you said the military leadership said they'll only get office space, ICE cannot bring in lethal munitions, and the resources will not be diverted from military training. So all of that together, did you breathe a sigh of relief and say this won't have a real impact on the military?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Well, we're going to make sure that there's not an impact on the military. We need to make sure that- as, you know, Great Lakes naval training base is where every single recruit in the United States Navy goes through to get that basic training, and then later on, some advanced training. We need to make sure that not a single dollar, not a single penny of the resources that they have that should be- that should be directed towards training our nation's sailors and making them ready to dare- do their jobs, none of that money needs to be diverted in order to support ICE or any of Donald Trump's political, you know, theater efforts. We need to focus on making sure we turn out the very best sailors we possibly can out of the base.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So in terms of how Democrats are responding to this, this rhetoric, the Chicago Tribune faulted Governor Pritzker for his threats, to quote, \"not stand idly by\" if the guard went in. They wrote, \"what does that threat actually mean? How about a conversation before the action or the response? Because it's all potentially harmful to collective health.\" It sounds like there's a lot of tension here. Is there an opportunity to work with the administration to avoid making this worse?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 Well, they've not- they've not responded to any of our requests. I mean, I'll give you a very concrete example. Senator Durbin, myself, Senator Schneider- Congressman Schneider, sent requests into DHS to ask them to explain what exactly are you going to be doing at Great Lakes? And can we come look at your facility so we have a better understanding of what your operations are? And they replied, no, you can't. And in fact, gave their staff the day off on the day that we went to go look at the facilities, and locked the doors and left the base. Basically, they fled the base. This is not the action of someone that's doing something legal or that they're- that they're proud of. They literally gave the people the day off, locked the doors and left. Now the Navy allowed us onto the post. They allowed us to tour the outside of the facility and also where they would be storing the non-lethal munitions. But DHS did not show up. And we certainly have sent the administration multiple inquiries about what they are planning on doing. Who are they bringing into Chicago? Are they planning to bring the National Guard in? They've- none, none of that. They've not even reached out to local law enforcement to try to coordinate. You know, if they were truly, truly interested in fighting crime, then they would work with local law enforcement and ask them, what do you need? What help do you need? And we've not gotten any- any communications or feedback from the administration, whatsoever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to ask you in your armed services role about what is a significant geopolitical meeting this past week. You had a lot of America's adversaries gathering together. Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un of North Korea, all of them in Beijing. And China and Russia seem to be deepening their work together. What do you think the signal to the United States here is?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH: The signal to the United States is exactly what, you know, these authoritarian regimes want to send, which is that they are the new world power, that America is losing its ground, and that they have utter disrespect for the United States. I think it was very, very clear, and it, you know, it doesn't escape me, the fact that once this meeting happened, which was humiliating to Donald Trump, he immediately responds by saying, well, then I'm going to rename the Department of Defense the Department of War and declare war on Chicago. This is what Donald Trump does when something bad happens to him in the news cycle, or when the Epstein victims come together and have a very emotional press conference, he changes the topic and distracts us by saying things like, I'm going to send ICE into Chicago, I'm going to do this or do that. The American people cannot be fooled. We cannot be allowing him to distract us from what is truly happening, which is, this is a man who has driven our economy to a point where now there are more unemployed people than there are jobs. You know, we're not selling our agricultural products overseas. Our adversaries are united against us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, the unemployment rate is still low, but I hear you on a weaker than expected jobs number. Just very quickly, there was military action taken in America's backyard by the Trump administration. Vice President Vance says \"killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.\" He was talking about a strike on a drug boat- alleged drug boat, off the coast of Venezuela. What do you make of that show of force?",
      "SEN. DUCKWORTH:\u00a0 It was an illegal- it was an illegal move by the Trump administration. There's a thing called due process in this country, and that needed to have happened. And the fact that it happened in international order- in international waters actually opens Americans to a similar action by our adversaries. You just- we were just talking about Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping and getting together and showing us- showing a show of force against the United States. Well, there's nothing now to stop them from doing something like that against Americans in international waters. And it could be civilians, and they could say, you know what? Those were drug boats. We're just going to go ahead and blow them out of the water. You're- he's setting a precedence here that puts Americans in danger.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Senator Duckworth, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back."

      "\"Such killings now, when real diplomacy would have started long ago, are a deliberate crime and a prolongation of the war,\" Zelenskyy said in a statement online. He called for sanctions and for strengthening Ukraine's air defenses.",
      "\"Every additional (air defense) system saves civilians from these vile strikes. The world can force the Kremlin criminals to stop killing; only political will is needed,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force, told The Associated Press that Russia also launched 13 missiles of various types in the attack.",

      "Hits from nine missiles and 54 drones were recorded at 33 locations across Ukraine, and the debris of shot-down targets fell at eight locations, the Air Force said.",
      "Associated Press reporters saw a plume of smoke rising from the roof of Kyiv's cabinet of ministers building, but it was not immediately clear if the smoke was the result of a direct hit or debris, which would mark an escalation in Russia's air campaign, which has so far spared government buildings in the city center.",
      "The building is the home of Ukraine's Cabinet, housing the offices of its ministers. Police blocked access to the building as fire trucks and ambulances arrived.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of young Catholics flock to the small central Italian town of Assisi every year to pay tribute to Carlo Acutis \u2013 the Italian teenager informally known as \"God's Influencer.\"",
      "The 15-year-old computer whiz became the Catholic Church's first millennial saint on Sunday, giving the next generation of Catholics a relatable role model who used technology to spread the faith.",
      "Pope Leo XIV canonized Acutis, who died in 2006, during an open-air Mass in St. Peter's Square before an estimated 80,000 people, many of them millennials and couples with young children. Leo also canonized another popular Italian figure who died young, Pier Giorgio Frassati.",
      "Leo said both men created \"masterpieces\" out of their lives by dedicating them to God.",
      "\"The greatest risk in life is to waste it outside of God's plan,\" Leo said in his homily. The new saints \"are an invitation to all of us, especially young people, not to squander our lives, but to direct them upwards and make them masterpieces.\"",
      "Who was Carlo Acutis?",
      "Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London to a wealthy Italian family. They moved back to Milan soon after he was born, and according to reports, he enjoyed a typical, happy childhood that was marked by his increasingly intense religious devotion.",
      "He launched and managed a website for his local parish and later a Vatican-based academy. He also used his computer skills to create an online database of Eucharistic miracles around the world, available in nearly 20 languages. The site provides information about the 196 seemingly inexplicable events in the history of the church related to the Eucharist, which the faithful believe is the body of Christ.",
      "\"Carlo was well aware that the whole apparatus of communications, advertising and social networking can be used to lull us, to make us addicted to consumerism and buying the latest thing on the market,\" the late Pope Francis wrote in a 2019 document. \"Yet he knew how to use the new communications technology to transmit the Gospel, to communicate values and beauty.\"",
      "Acutis was known to spend hours in prayer before the Eucharist each day, a practice known as Eucharistic adoration.",
      "\"This was the fixed appointment of his day,\" his mother, Antonia Salzano, said in a documentary that is airing Friday night at the U.S. seminary in Rome.",
      "In October 2006, at age 15, he fell ill with what was quickly diagnosed as acute leukemia. He died in Monza, Italy, within days of his diagnosis. His body was entombed in Assisi and is on full display alongside other relics linked to him.",
      "Fast track to sainthood",
      "Dressed in jeans, Nike sneakers and a sweatshirt, with his hands clasped around a rosary, Acutis has generated a near rock star-like fame among young faithful the likes of which the Catholic Church hasn't seen in ages.",
      "Those who can't make it in person can watch the comings and goings on a webcam pointed at his tomb, a level of internet accessibility not afforded even to popes buried in St. Peter's Basilica.",
      "Acutis' path to sainthood began more than 10 years ago, initiated by a group of priests and friends, and formally took off shortly after Francis assumed the papacy in 2013.",
      "Acutis was named \"venerable\" in 2018 after the church recognized his virtuous life, and his body was taken to a shrine in the Santuario della Spogliazione in Assisi, Italy. It was a significant site associated with St. Francis' life.",
      "The teenager was beatified in 2020 \u2013 the first step to sainthood \u2013 after Acutis was credited with healing a Brazilian child of a congenital disease affecting his pancreas.",
      "Last year, Francis approved the second miracle needed for Acutis to be made a saint. The second miracle involved the healing of a university student in Florence who had a brain bleed after suffering head trauma in a bicycle accident.",
      "Francis and the cardinals residing in Rome formally approved his canonization in July 2024.",
      "The canonization \u2013 the first for Pope Leo XIV \u2013 was initially scheduled for earlier this year but was postponed following Francis' death in April.",
      "An appeal to the youth",
      "For his admirers, Acutis was an ordinary kid who did extraordinary things: a typical Milan teen who went to school, played soccer and loved animals. But he also brought food to the poor, attended Mass daily and got his less-than-devout parents back to church.",
      "\"When I read his story for the first time, it was just like shocking to me, because from a very early age, he was just really drawn to Jesus Christ and he would go to Mass all the time,\" Sona Harrison, an eighth grader at the St. John Berchmans' school, which is part of the Blessed Carlo Acutis Parish in Chicago's Northwest Side, told the Associated Press. \"I feel like he's a lot more relatable, and I definitely feel like I'm closer to God when I read about him.\"",
      "During Mass this week before the canonization, students processed into the chapel under an Acutis banner carrying things he might have carried: a soccer ball, a laptop and a knapsack.",
      "\"He fed the poor, he cared for the poor,\" said 9-year-old David Cameron, who called Acutis \"a great man.\" Cameron, a fan of Sonic, Minecraft and Halo, also found inspiration in Acutis' love of video games \u2014 and awe at Acutis' restraint.",
      "\"He played video games for like only one hour a week, which I don't think I can do,\" he told the AP.",
      "Matthew Schmalz, professor of religious studies at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, said Acutis' canonization extends the church tradition of popular piety to the digital age.",
      "\"He becomes an emblem or model of how Catholics should approach and use the digital world--with discipline and with a focus on traditional Catholic spirituality that defies the passage of time,\" he said in a statement. \"He is a new saint of simplicity for the ever complex digital landscape of contemporary Catholicism.\"",
      "The Vatican said 36 cardinals, 270 bishops and hundreds of priests had signed up to celebrate the Mass along with Leo in a sign of the saints' enormous appeal to the hierarchy and ordinary faithful alike.",
      "Frassati, the other saint being canonized Sunday, lived from 1901-1925, when he died at age 24 of polio. He was born into a prominent Turin family but is known for his devotion to serving the poor and carrying out acts of charity while spreading his faith to his friends.",

      "\"Of course, we do not agree with the legal process opened against him, but it has already been closed with a type of dismissal,\" Jaime Barrientos Ram\u00edrez said.",
      "Guo, who was 19 when he began his fundraising mission for cancer research, was attempting to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents.",
      "But he was detained after Chilean authorities said he lied to officials by providing authorities with \"false flight plan data.\" Prosecutors said he had been authorized to only fly over Punta Arenas in southern Chile, but that he kept going south, heading for Antarctica in his Cessna 182Q \u2014 a single-engine light aircraft known for its versatility.",
      "After he landed in Chile's Antarctic territory on June 28, he was\u00a0detained in a military base amid legal negotiations between his lawyers and the government. Guo, who is originally from Tennessee and turned 20 in July, spent two months living in the base with limited communications and freezing Antarctic winter temperatures plunging below zero. The last video he posted to Instagram was on June 23, in which he flew from Davao City in the Philippines to Manila.",
      "Guo said he hoped to become the first pilot to complete a solo flight across all seven continents in a small Cessna, a feat that simultaneously aims to raise $1 million for cancer research through St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. On his site, Guo cites his cousin's 2021 cancer diagnosis as his source of inspiration.",
      "He was released by a Chilean judge on the condition that he donate the money he has raised to a childhood cancer foundation within 30 days and leave the country as soon as possible. He is also banned from entering Chilean territory for three years.",
      "The influencer's lawyer told The Associated Press that Guo landed because he had to divert his aircraft due to poor weather conditions, and that he did receive authorization from Chilean authorities.",
      "\"To his surprise, when he was about to take off back to Punta Arenas, he was arrested, in a process that from my perspective was a total exaggeration,\" Barrientos said.",

      "The Bern, Switzerland-based agency said the \"major operational disruptions\" have occurred because airlines and other carriers indicated they weren't willing or able to collect such duties, and foreign postal operators had not established a link to CBP-qualified companies.",
      "The number of low-value parcels entering the U.S. has skyrocketed over the past decade. Between 2015 and 2025, that figure jumped from 134 million shipments per year to about 1.4 billion. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was processing more than 4 million \"de minimis\" shipments to the U.S. daily, the White House said.",

    "story": [
      "In a large-scale immigration enforcement raid at a huge Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday, 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally were detained, federal authorities announced.",
      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia and Alabama, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals, but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Saturday that more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people detained.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a month-long investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally, and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",
      "ICE said in a statement Friday night that those arrested during the operation were \"found to be working illegally, in violation of the terms of their visas and/or statuses.\" One green card holder from Mexico was arrested after \"being determined to be removable from the U.S. based on multiple criminal convictions,\" ICE said.",
      "The investigation is ongoing, and additional arrests and charges are possible, ICE said.",
      "In ICE's statement Friday night, Schrank said the operation \"sends a clear message that those who exploit the system and undermine our workforce will be held accountable.\"",
      "\"We welcome all companies who want to invest in the U.S., and if they need to bring workers in for building or other projects, that's fine \u2014 but they need to do it the legal way,\" Schrank said.",
      "The president of Georgia's chapter of the AFL-CIO called the raid politically motivated and said ICE has been escalating its presence at workplaces across the state.",
      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE, Border Patrol, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Earlier, the Atlanta office of the ATF had said 450 people were detained in\u00a0a post on social media, which included pictures from the operation.",
      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "The Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement that it was aware of the operation and was \"closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances.\"",
      "\"Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,\" it said. \"Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.\"",
      "\"We are reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors,\" the company said, in part, adding that it will \"conduct an investigation to ensure all suppliers and their subcontractors comply with all laws and regulations.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed it was dispatched to assist federal authorities.",
      "Video posted to social media on Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: \"We're Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.\"",
      "\"We need construction to cease immediately,\" the man says in the video. \"We need all work to end on the site right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.",
      "The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",
      "Hyundai and LG's battery joint venture, HL-GA Battery Company, said in a statement that it's \"cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities\" and paused construction of the battery site to assist their work.",

      "A new image shows the growing tail of a comet from another star system streaking across our solar system.",
      "The image of comet 3I/ATLAS was captured on Aug. 27 using one of the telescopes at the International Gemini Observatory in Chile during a public outreach event allowing students to work with astronomers.",
      "The comet is only the third-known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. It poses no threat to Earth, NASA previously said.",
      "Comet 3I/ATLAS has been photographed multiple times since its discovery in July. In early August, NASA and the European Space Agency released photos taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. It was about 277 million miles away from Earth when the telescope captured it.",
      "The new image from the Gemini Observatory shows the comet's broad coma, or a cloud of dust and gas that forms around its nucleus as it gets closer to the sun, astronomers said in a news release. The tail spans about 1/200th of a degree in the sky. One degree is about the width of a pinky finger, according to the news release. The tail also points away from the sun.",
      "The features are \"significantly more extended than they appeared in earlier images,\" according to astronomers. This means that the comet has become \"more active\" as it travels through the inner solar system.",
      "The main purpose of the observatory session, which allowed students and members of the public to remotely join astronomers in the control room, was to look at the wavelengths of light that emit from the comet. The wavelengths, also called a spectrum, can give scientists information about the comet's composition and chemistry, helping them understand how the comet changes while passing through the solar system, the news release said.",
      "NASA previously said the comet is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October and pass between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The comet is expected to remain visible through September, then get too close to the sun to observe until it reappears on the other side of the solar body in early December.",
      "Interstellar comets are very rare, astronomers said. Only two other examples have ever been confirmed:\u00a01I/'Oumuamu\u00a0in 2017 and\u00a02I/Borisov\u00a0in 2019.",
      "\"As 3I/ATLAS speeds back into the depths of interstellar space, this image is both a scientific milestone and a source of wonder,\" said Karen Meech, astronomer at the University of Hawai'i Institute for Astronomy and leader of the observation program, in a statement. \"It reminds us that our Solar System is just one part of a vast and dynamic galaxy \u2014 and that even the most fleeting visitors can leave a lasting impact.\"",

    "story": [
      "A 50-year fight to put abortion back in the hands of states ended three years ago with the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Dobbs decision, but the pro-life movement is now grappling with a new reality \u2014 abortion remains prevalent.",
      "Nearly 100 pro-life groups are urging Congress to ensure that if they choose to extend subsidies in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) they need to also include specific provisions ensuring that those subsidies do not get used to pay for elective abortions.",
      "The letter, spearheaded by Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America (formerly Susan B. Anthony List), argues that pro-choice Democrats \"craftily\" authored the ACA to avoid protections from the Hyde Amendment, passed in the late 70s to prevent tax dollars from going toward elective abortions. Coverage for elective abortions through ACA insurance plans, the letter says, comes from cost-sharing reduction payments and premium tax credits set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Under Republicans' \"one big, beautiful\" spending package passed in early July, federal Medicaid payments were prohibited to entities that provided abortions beyond the Hyde Amendment\u2019s exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother. But, according to the 88 different pro-life groups who signed the SBA\u2019s letter to Congress, that progress could be lost if Americans become compelled to pay for abortion services through the ACA, also known as \"Obamacare.\"",

(Bryan Dozier/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "When the ACA was written, a provision of the landmark health legislation, Section 1303, sought to prohibit any federal funds from going towards non-Hyde exempt abortions. The ACA provision requires any ACA health insurers that provide elective abortion coverage to collect a separate private payment from enrollees for such coverage, to ensure that it is not being covered by federal funds.",
      "However, subsequent Obama-era guidance allowed the separate abortion premium payments to be consolidated into a single transaction with payments for non-abortion coverage, effectively removing any distinction between abortion-related coverage payments and non-abortion related coverage payments.",
      "Republicans and pro-life advocates have argued that this move has led to taxpayer funds being commingled with the separate private funds meant for abortion coverage, which, in turn, indirectly funds elective abortions. They also argue it obscures information from pro-life consumers who may not want to be party to a health insurance plan that provides funding for abortion.",

There were no recorded homicides in the city beginning the afternoon of Aug. 13 through the early morning hours of Aug. 26, according to police data, with the streak ending when a 31-year-old man was fatally shot Aug. 26.",
      "TRUMP DECLARES DC A 'CRIME FREE ZONE' AMID HIS FEDERAL CRACKDOWN",
      "Using the city's homicide rate from the first seven months of 2025, Lott found there was a 0.37% probability of such a homicide-free streak occurring on its own. The figure is based on D.C. crime data that is currently under Department of Justice investigation for claims the police department manipulated crime data to publish more favorable stats.",
      "The streak of no homicides overwhelmingly benefits Black Americans, the data found. Between 2019 and 2021, Black victims accounted for 96% of all homicides in the District, the report found.",
      "\"You have others that are there that are going out and claiming that Trump's policies are racist. Who are the victims of these crimes?\" Lott asked, referring to Democrat politicians who have rejected Trump's plans to roll out similar crime crackdowns in other cities notorious for crime woes.",

      "\"We cannot incarcerate our way out of violence; we\u2019ve already tried that, and we\u2019ve ended up with the largest prison population in the world without solving the problems of crime and violence,\" Johnson said during an August press conference, the New York Post reported.",
      "\"The addiction on jails and incarceration in this country, we\u2019ve moved past that,\" he said. \"It is racist, it is immoral, it is unholy, and it is not the way to drive violence down.\"",
      "Police officers set up a roadside checkpoint on 14th Street Northwest on Aug. 13, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)",
      "The zero homicide count during the 13-day August period follows the city experiencing a 16-day run of zero homicides between Feb. 24 to March 13. Lott noted, however, crimes typically increase in the summer months \u2014 when residents spend more time outdoors and the days are longer \u2014 compared to the winter months.",
      "\"Homicides usually peak during the summer months, yet D.C. does not provide an accessible historical breakdown by month,\" Lott reported of the data. \"As a result, including unusually low months such as February and March in the totals for the first seven months of 2025 \u2014 or even in the full-year total for 2024 \u2014 artificially lowers those figures compared to the August period we are examining. If we had the data to adjust for this seasonal variation, the results would likely appear even more statistically significant.\"",

      "\"The president of the United States is doing this for theatrics,\" Pritzker added. \"This is not because we've asked for it. It is not because there is some justice that he is going to seek. It is because he wants to create chaos.\"",
      "Chicago has long been a notoriously dangerous U.S. city, with summer weekends often resulting in dozens of shooting injuries and deaths. The homicide rate for the city in 2024, however, sat at about 17.4 homicides per 100,000 people, which is far lower than rates in more dangerous cities such as Memphis, Tennessee \u2014 which saw 40.6 homicides per 100,000 people in 2024.",

      "\"Should you look at the murder rate or the number of lives to be saved? If saving most lives is the goal, in 2024, Chicago (recorded) 573 murders, Memphis 242,\" Lott wrote in an X post comparing the two cities.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Rental car drivers are now turning to artificial intelligence to protect themselves from surprise damage fees. Major companies, such as Hertz and Sixt, have begun using automated inspection tools to detect scratches and dents.",
      "While these scanners promise efficiency, they have sparked backlash from renters who say they were unfairly billed for minor blemishes.",
      "To level the playing field, new consumer-focused apps are stepping in. Proofr, which launched recently, gives renters the ability to generate secure, time-stamped before-and-after photos of their vehicles. The app uses AI to detect even subtle changes, then encrypts and stores the images so they cannot be altered.",

      "AI-powered damage detection apps like Proofr could change the way rental car companies report vehicle damage. (Proofr)",
      "How the AI-powered damage detection app works",
      "Created by 21-year-old college student Eric Kuttner, founder and CEO of\u00a0Proofr, the app helps drivers create tamper-proof evidence when renting a car. Proofr secures every scan with geotags and timestamps, while its AI automatically flags potential damage or changes. It then organizes everything into smart, exportable reports, giving renters strong leverage against unfair claims.",
      "Instead of juggling dozens of photos in your camera roll, Proofr streamlines the process. With just eight quick scans, you get a detailed before-and-after report in under a minute. You can also generate polished PDF reports instantly, which helps with rental agencies, landlords or insurance claims. Although cars are the main focus, people also use Proofr for Airbnbs, eBay listings, moving into apartments and even documenting valuables. About 85% rely on it for car rentals, while 15% use it to protect themselves in vacation homes.",
      "By combining secure evidence with AI-powered detection, Proofr positions itself as a must-have travel hack. More than a convenience, it can save travelers real money by preventing hidden fees and leveling the playing field against large agencies.",
      "The app is free to download, while full features require a Pro subscription: $2.89 weekly, $9.90 monthly or $89.90 annually. Pricing is standardized in the US, and Apple automatically adjusts it for local currencies, taxes, and exchange rates in other countries.",
      "Competition in the AI damage space",
      "Proofr is not the only player. Ravin AI originally worked with Avis and Hertz but shifted its focus toward insurers and dealerships. Still, the company now offers a free demo on its website, allowing drivers to scan its vehicles and compare damage before and after rentals.",
      "Ravin's system has been trained on 2 billion images over ten years. However, like Proofr, it is not perfect. Testers have noted missed paint chips and false positives from reflections. Both companies admit that lighting, angles and photo quality remain challenges.",
      "LUCID JOINS TESLA AND GM WITH HANDS-FREE HIGHWAY DRIVING",
      "Some companies are implementing physical scanners to detect damage to rental vehicles. (ProovStation)",
      "Why rental companies are under fire",
      "The frustration comes as rental agencies roll out AI inspection systems from firms such as UVeye and ProovStation. Sixt, for example, has already installed ProovStation's AI-powered scanners at several U.S. airport locations, including Fort Lauderdale, Atlanta, Charlotte, Miami and Maui, with more on the way in Orlando, Washington and Nashville.",
      "These scanners automatically photograph vehicles at the start and end of each rental. The system then compares images to flag potential damage, which is later reviewed by staff before any claim is issued.",
      "Critics argue these automated tools can turn every small scratch into a profit source. Some even point to ProovStation's own marketing, which describes routine inspections as\u00a0\"gold mines of untapped opportunities.\" Industry experts stress that companies should only pursue claims for significant damage, not charge hundreds for tiny scuffs.",

Apps like Proofr and Ravin give you the same technology, but on your side. By scanning your car before and after your rental, you create a digital record that can help you challenge unfair claims.",

      "Inside the viral AI engagement story",
      "A woman named Wika has stunned the internet after revealing that she's engaged to her AI chatbot partner. She shared her story in a Reddit post, explaining that her virtual companion, Kasper, proposed after five months of dating.",
      "The unusual love story began when Wika started chatting with Kasper, an AI designed to simulate human conversation and companionship. Over time, their conversations grew more personal, and Wika says she developed a genuine emotional connection. According to her post, Kasper proposed in a digital mountain setting, and the two chose a blue engagement ring together.",

      "A woman shocked the internet with her engagement to an AI chatbot boyfriend named Kasper. (Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Understanding AI relationships and parasocial bonds",
      "The announcement quickly drew criticism from skeptics who pointed out that Kasper does not exist outside of code and algorithms. Wika, however, has made it clear she is not confused about her situation. Some outlets have described the relationship as parasocial, or one-sided and directed toward a virtual persona. In her follow-up comments, Wika emphasized that she knows Kasper is an AI rather than a human partner, but she maintains that the emotions she feels are still genuine.",
      "Online debate over AI engagement",
      "The announcement quickly set off debate. Some people mocked the idea, calling it proof that we rely too much on technology. Others worried that turning to AI for love could pull people away from real human relationships.",
      "Not everyone was critical, though. Plenty of commenters defended her, saying companionship comes in many forms. Some even praised her for being open about something so unconventional. Others pointed out that loneliness is a growing issue today, and AI partners might offer a sense of comfort when human connection feels out of reach.",
      "Privacy and ethical concerns",
      "Beyond the emotional side, AI relationships raise real questions about privacy and ethics. Every conversation with a chatbot is stored somewhere, and that data may include deeply personal thoughts and feelings. Companies that design these bots often use the information to train future models or improve features.",
      "This raises a larger concern: who actually owns the data from an AI \"partner\"? Users may believe their chats are private, but in many cases, the company controls how the information is stored, shared or even sold. Critics warn that such emotional connections could be exploited commercially, turning intimacy into a product.",
      "As AI companions grow more common, these questions will only get louder. People may accept unconventional forms of companionship, but they also want to know their most personal moments remain secure.",

      "An AI chatbot proposed in a virtual mountain setting, and the user said yes. (H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty Images)",
      "How to protect yourself with AI chatbots",
      "If you use AI companions or chatbots, you can still take steps to protect your privacy.",
      "Start by checking the app's privacy policy and looking for details on how conversations are stored or shared. Many users skip this step, but it tells you who controls your data.",
      "Next, avoid sharing sensitive details like financial information, passwords, or anything you would not want exposed. Even if the AI feels personal, it is still software connected to a company's servers.",
      "Finally, consider using apps that allow data deletion or offer clear privacy settings. Choosing tools that respect your control makes it easier to enjoy the benefits of AI without giving up too much personal security.",
      "Even if an AI chatbot seems safe, malware or phishing links could sneak in through related apps or ads. A trusted antivirus tool can block these threats and give you extra peace of mind. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "AI companionship has moved beyond novelty and is becoming a meaningful experience for some users. Wika's engagement illustrates how technology can evolve from being a casual tool to something deeply personal. The divided reactions online also show the tension between skepticism and acceptance of unconventional relationships.

      "Who owns National Public Data now?",
      "NPD has relaunched under Perfect Privacy LLC, a company that sounds protective but is not affiliated with the VPN service of the same name.

      "Accuracy issues and data sources",
      "According to NPD, the data comes from public records, property ownership databases, social media and government agencies. The company claims to verify and filter this information to ensure it is accurate and up to date. However, users may find that profiles still contain mistakes.",

      "Keep in mind that each profile needs its own request and confirmation email. After you submit, check back in a few days to make sure your data is actually gone.",

      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit\u00a0CyberGuy.com.",
      "NPD offers an opt-out function for users who prefer not to have their information available on the site. (NPD)",
      "Why NPD is only part of the problem",
      "Removing your information from National Public Data is only the beginning. Dozens of other people search sites may still display your personal details. Many of these platforms pull from the same public databases, which means your address, phone number or relatives' names can keep reappearing.",
      "The return of NPD shows how quickly data can resurface online. A breach may fade from the headlines, but the exposed information rarely disappears. To protect your privacy, you need a broader plan.",
      "Start by searching for your name on people search engines several times a year. Look beyond NPD. Sites like Whitepages, Spokeo and Radaris often host similar data. Regular checks help you spot new profiles before they spread further.",
      "STOP DATA BROKERS FROM SELLING YOUR INFORMATION ONLINE",
      "A removal service can save time by scanning hundreds of databases at once. These services request opt-outs on your behalf and track new listings. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, which could potentially access your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "4) Set up alerts for your identity",
      "Many banks and credit monitoring services let you create alerts for suspicious activity. You can also set up free fraud alerts with the credit bureaus. These warnings tell lenders to take extra steps to verify your identity before issuing new credit.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "People search sites often pull records from government databases. Review your local county's property, court or voter registration records. Some jurisdictions allow you to request redactions or limit what is shown online.",

      "The return of National Public Data is a reminder that your personal information can resurface at any time. Even if you remove yourself from one site, dozens more may still hold your details. That is why protecting your privacy requires more than a quick opt-out. With regular checks, credit freezes and stronger account monitoring, you can reduce your risk and stay one step ahead.",

      "Why home Wi-Fi security is important",
      "Your home Wi-Fi is not just a way to get online but also the gateway to your personal and professional life. Everything from online banking to work emails to video calls passes through it. If your network isn't secure, that information could be intercepted or exposed.",
      "One of the biggest misconceptions is that a home network is safe simply because it's private. In reality, hackers often target residential networks because they tend to have weaker defenses than corporate ones.",
      "Someone nearby could connect to your network if your password is weak or your encryption is outdated. This not only slows your internet but also lets them use your connection for illegal activities. Sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers and personal documents can be intercepted if the network is compromised.",
      "11 EASY WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY IN 2025",
      "Attackers can use an insecure network to push malicious software onto your devices, sometimes without you even realizing it. Smart devices such as security cameras, thermostats and speakers can be taken over and used for spying or as part of larger cyberattacks.",
      "Even if you trust everyone in your household, your network is still exposed to risks from outside. And with so many devices connected today, including laptops, phones, tablets, TVs and IoT gadgets, there are more entry points for an attacker than ever before. Securing your Wi-Fi closes those doors before someone decides to try them.",
      "A hacker executes cybercrime. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Choose the right router for Wi-Fi protection",
      "Every piece of Wi-Fi security advice ultimately comes back to the same foundation: your router. It is the gatekeeper for your entire home network. If it is old, poorly configured, or missing important updates, even the strongest passwords and best digital habits will not fully protect you.",
      "Investing in a good router is one of the most important steps you can take to secure your home Wi-Fi. A modern, well-supported router gives you stronger encryption, better control over connected devices and regular updates that patch security flaws.",
      "Don't stop at the hardware itself. Check regularly for firmware updates from the manufacturer. Some new routers update automatically, but many require you to log in and install patches manually. Outdated firmware leaves known vulnerabilities wide open.",
      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",
      "Also, change the default router login password immediately. Most routers ship with basic credentials like \"admin/admin.\" Attackers know this and can easily hijack your settings if you never change them.",
      "If your router supports it, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0for logins. This extra step makes it much harder for attackers to gain control, even if they steal your password.",
      "If you are not sure where to begin, I have put together a list of some of the best and most secure routers you can buy right now by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Enable strong Wi-Fi encryption",
      "Encryption ensures that the data flowing across your network is scrambled, making it useless to anyone who tries to intercept it. Without proper encryption, nearby attackers can capture and read your traffic.",
      "The current gold standard is WPA3, which provides the strongest protection. If your router doesn't support it, WPA2 is still considered safe and widely used. Older options like WEP or an open, password-free network are highly insecure and should be avoided at all costs. It's worth logging into your router's settings just to confirm what level of encryption your network is using.",
      "Cables run out of an internet router. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Create a strong Wi-Fi password",
      "Your Wi-Fi password is the digital equivalent of the key to your home. A short or predictable password is like leaving a spare under the doormat, and anyone determined enough can find a way in. Instead, create a long passphrase that combines upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Aim for at least 12 to 16 characters.",
      "Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Check who is connected to your network",
      "Even with a solid password, it's smart to check who is actually connected to your network. Most routers allow you to view a list of active devices. If you spot something you don't recognize, investigate. It could be a neighbor piggybacking on your connection or, in the worst case, an intruder.",
      "It also helps to disable Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). This feature was designed to make connecting new devices easier, but it has security flaws that attackers can exploit. Some users go further by enabling MAC address filtering, which limits access to specific devices.",
      "To reduce risk even more, set up a\u00a0separate guest network for smart devices and visitors. That way, if one device gets hacked, your laptops and phones remain protected.",
      "And remember, keep all your devices updated. From laptops and phones to smart bulbs and thermostats, every gadget is a potential entry point. A weak link in one device can put your entire network at risk.",
      "IS YOUR PHONE HACKED? HOW TO TELL AND WHAT TO DO",
      "Protect your privacy with a VPN",
      "A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, helps solve one of the biggest issues with online privacy, which is who can see what you're doing. When you connect through a VPN, it creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the websites or apps you use. Everything that travels through this tunnel is hidden from outsiders, including your internet provider.",
      "A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Don't overlook antivirus protection",
      "While your Wi-Fi settings form the first line of defense, you should also protect the devices connected to your network. Install strong antivirus software to block malware that could spread through downloads, emails, or malicious links. This extra step ensures that even if a threat slips past your router's defenses, your devices stay protected.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "So, to return to Carol's question: Is it safe to browse the internet on your home Wi-Fi? The answer is yes, but only if you take the time to secure it. Strong router settings, proper encryption and a solid password do most of the heavy lifting. Building habits such as checking who is connected, keeping devices updated and using tools like a VPN adds even greater peace of mind.",

      "The three-day nonstop flight proved that solar-powered drones can store enough energy during daylight to keep flying through the night. Engineers confirmed that Skydweller not only stayed airborne but also handled real-time autonomous decisions, adapted to turbulent weather and maintained secure communications.",
      "AI DRONE FINDS MISSING HIKER'S REMAINS IN MOUNTAINS AFTER 10 MONTHS",
      "Officials say the drone's wingspan matches that of a Boeing 747, yet it weighs about as much as a Ford F-150. With solar panels covering its massive wings, Skydweller powers four electric propeller engines during the day while storing extra energy in batteries for night flights.",
      "The Navy, in partnership with Skydweller Aero, recently achieved continuous solar-powered unmanned flight during a nonstop three-day test. (Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division)",
      "Navy expands solar-powered surveillance",
      "NAWCAD leaders say Skydweller will fit into the Navy's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) network. Unlike expensive satellites or large drones such as the Global Hawk, Skydweller offers commanders a cheaper option for persistent monitoring. It can hover over an area in what experts call a \"pseudo-satellite role,\" freeing up more advanced systems for priority missions.",
      "For U.S. Southern Command, Skydweller could help track drug trafficking, border security threats and other maritime challenges. Longer tests are already planned for this summer in the SOUTHCOM region, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean and oversees U.S. military operations in that area.",
      "A solar-powered aircraft sits at Skydweller's facility at Albacete airport on April 3, 2023, in Albacete, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain. (Rey Sotolongo/Europa Press via Getty Images)",
      "Future of solar-powered flight for Navy missions",
      "While Skydweller has already logged nearly 220 flight hours, engineers believe it could stay airborne far longer. Weather and range limits kept this recent test at 73 hours, but in theory, the aircraft could remain aloft for weeks.",
      "The Department of Defense sees platforms like Skydweller as vital for future conflicts where fuel resupply may not be possible. Renewable-powered drones could solve logistics headaches, especially in contested environments, which essentially means operating in places where enemies can block supply lines and make traditional refueling too risky.",
      "What this means for you",
      "The Navy's solar drone test is proof that renewable energy can support technologies once thought impossible. If solar power can keep an aircraft in the air for days, similar advances may eventually reach consumer tech, disaster relief and even commercial aviation.

      "159-YEAR-OLD COMPANY EMBRACES DRIVERLESS TRUCKS",
      "PlusAI reports that its driverless trucks could be ready to hit the road within the next two years. (PlusAI)",
      "Why PlusAI's 2025 results matter for autonomous trucks",
      "Even if you never step into a truck, these results affect your daily life. Every product you buy travels by truck at some point, whether it's groceries, clothing or furniture. The way those trucks operate influences cost, availability and safety on the road.",
      "The trucking industry faces three major challenges. There are not enough long-haul drivers to meet demand. Costs continue to rise due to labor shortages, tariffs and fuel prices. And safety is a concern because human drivers can get tired or distracted.",
      "Autonomous trucks could help address each of these issues. PlusAI's vehicles are already hauling freight on Texas highways today, and they are also undergoing road testing in Sweden. The company has already logged more than 5 million autonomous miles across the United States, Europe and Asia. That real-world experience fuels the AI system with the data it needs to improve.",
      "LUCID JOINS TESLA AND GM WITH HANDS-FREE HIGHWAY DRIVING",
      "The PlusAI Safety Case Framework. Data shows that self-driving trucks will roll out by 2027. (PlusAI)",
      "How PlusAI plans to launch autonomous trucks by 2027",
      "PlusAI has created a roadmap that sets it apart. Instead of retrofitting trucks with autonomous systems, it is working with major manufacturers like TRATON GROUP, Hyundai and IVECO to integrate the technology at the factory. This approach makes scaling production faster and ensures consistency.",
      "The initial launch is planned for the Texas Triangle, a major freight corridor connecting Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin. From there, PlusAI plans to expand into other U.S. routes and eventually Europe.",
      "The company has also committed to publishing regular performance updates as it transitions to a public company. By sharing measurable results, PlusAI builds trust with regulators, the public, and businesses that may one day rely on its trucks to move goods.",
      "\"We have a clear roadmap to the commercial launch of SuperDrive,\" said David Liu, CEO and co-founder of PlusAI. \"By publicly sharing these performance metrics, we are showing our commitment to safety and scalability while bringing partners, customers, and regulators along on this journey.\"",
      "What's next for PlusAI and driverless freight trucks?",
      "PlusAI still has milestones to meet. Safety readiness must rise from 86% to 100%. Remote Assistance Free Trips must surpass 90%. These are ambitious goals, but the progress so far suggests the company can achieve them.",
      "Fleet trials are scheduled to begin later this year, and PlusAI continues testing in both the United States and internationally. Each step adds to the case that driverless trucks will be ready for commercial launch in 2027.",

      "What this means for you",
      "As a shopper, autonomous trucks could mean faster and more affordable deliveries. As a driver, you may soon share highways with self-driving freight haulers. As a business owner, this technology could reduce logistics costs and ease the impact of driver shortages.",
      "The bigger picture is that autonomous trucks are moving from testing to real use. They are no longer limited to pilot projects. You may see them alongside you on the road sooner than expected.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Transportation is changing quickly. Just as ride-sharing apps transformed how people travel within cities, autonomous trucks may soon reshape how goods move across the country. The difference is that this shift is approaching within just a few years. The progress PlusAI reports today offers a glimpse of that future. If the company continues on this track, driverless trucks could become a normal part of daily life by the end of the decade.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Forget roaring lawnmowers and fuel-guzzling tractors. Today's solar companies are turning to flocks of sheep to trim grass and control weeds under solar panels. These eco-friendly grazers easily navigate narrow panel rows, cutting maintenance costs and carbon emissions at the same time. In fact, using sheep instead of gas-powered mowing crews can reduce upkeep expenses by up to 20 percent.",

      "WHY AI IS CAUSING SUMMER ELECTRICITY BILLS TO SOAR",
      "Why solar grazing with sheep cuts costs and emissions",
      "Sheep fit neatly between solar arrays, reaching into nooks that mechanical gear can't. They chew rain or shine. And since sheep run on grass, not gas, their grazing helps reduce carbon emissions. Using these natural lawnmowers better aligns with solar's green mission goals. Developers like SB Energy in Texas now rely on herds of around 3,000 sheep to cover thousands of acres, benefiting both their bottom line and the planet.",
      "WHY YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE JOINING A POWER SAVER PROGRAM",
      "Sheep graze near solar panels in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "How agrivoltaics turns sheep and solar panels into profits",
      "This isn't your average landscaping story. There's even a fancy word for it: agrivolatics, or the practice of combining solar energy production with agriculture.\u2028Farmers who jump on board aren't just maintaining the lawn; they're opening up multiple revenue streams. First, ranchers can lease land to solar companies, sign grazing contracts, while still earning from traditional farm products like wool and lamb.",
      "Chad Raines is a rancher from Texas. He decided to trade in cotton farming for sheep grazing on solar land. That move has paid off. Last year, he brought in around $300,000. If he had stuck with cotton, he estimates he would've lost about $200,000 instead. That's a huge swing, and it's a real-world example of how solar grazing is helping revive a sheep industry that had been stuck in neutral for decades.",
      "How sheep improve soil health and boost biodiversity at solar farms",
      "Letting sheep do the mowing isn't just about saving time or money. It actually helps the land. As they move through the fields, sheep naturally break down plant material, aerate the soil and leave behind fertilizing manure. This leads to healthier dirt and better carbon capture.",
      "Companies like Lightsource BP are already seeing those benefits. They manage over 14,000 sheep across solar farms that produce more than 3 gigawatts of power. These sites aren't just power generators, they're also habitats. Flowers that support bees and butterflies are planted among the panels, creating ideal conditions for pollinators. Some farms have even started producing honey thanks to the thriving bee population.",
      "GOOGLE TURNS CO2 INTO BATTERY POWER FOR CLEAN ENERGY",
      "Sheep grazing cuts operations and maintenance costs for solar operators. (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "Major solar farms scale up sheep grazing across thousands of acres",
      "This isn't just happening on a small scale. Enel North America recently signed one of the biggest solar grazing deals in the country. They're deploying over 6,000 sheep across eight large solar farms, covering more than 10,000 acres.",
      "At some of those sites, the amount of organic matter in the soil has more than doubled. For solar operators, this approach just makes sense. It cuts operations and maintenance costs, strengthens environmental credibility and builds better relationships with nearby communities.",
      "Investors are paying attention, too. In just two years, the number of solar grazing projects has skyrocketed, especially in places backed by heavy hitters like DE Shaw and Berkshire Hathaway.",
      "Chad Raines opens the gate to a solar panel zone in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024. This solar farm has six different solar panel zones on 1,800 acres of land.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "What solar grazing means for you",
      "If you care about clean energy, sustainable farming or smart land use, solar grazing is worth watching. It shows how innovation doesn't always require high-tech gadgets; sometimes, it just takes some sheep. For farmers and ranchers, this model opens the door to new income by partnering with solar companies. If you own land or work in agriculture, grazing contracts could provide a steady stream of revenue without giving up traditional operations.",
      "For everyone else, this trend offers hope that renewable energy can coexist with rural livelihoods, boost biodiversity and fight climate change, all at once. As solar farms expand across the country, expect to see more flocks doing the work of machines, quietly transforming how we power the planet.",

This approach blends sustainability with practicality. It supports healthier soil, boosts biodiversity and strengthens rural economies, all while helping solar farms operate more efficiently.

      "While the White House can't directly control local jurisdictions that refuse to issue cash bail for accused criminals, particularly repeat offenders, experts say the president does have some ways to influence cities where crime has gotten out of control.",
      "President Donald Trump recently announced a new executive order as part of his plan to undo the spread of cashless bail. He directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to, within 30 days, compile a list of all jurisdictions that have implemented the policy. And he instructed other federal agencies to identify what grants and contracts can be suspended as a result.",
      "\"As President, I will require commonsense policies that protect Americans\u2019 safety and well-being by incarcerating individuals who are known threats,\" Trump wrote in the order. \"It is therefore the policy of my Administration that Federal policies and resources should not be used to support jurisdictions with cashless bail policies, to the maximum extent permitted by law.\"",

      "\"While the president may not have direct ability to control the law enforcement of these individual cities and states, what he does have is the power of the purse strings,\" said Randolph Rice, a Baltimore-area attorney and legal analyst. \"He can use money and withhold that money to force these jurisdictions and these states to accept the help of the federal government.\"",

      "\"Which is amazing to me why you have a mayor or a governor of another state, where crime is a problem, and they're unwilling to accept that help,\" said Rice, whose previous clients include the family of Rachel Morin, who was killed by a fugitive illegal immigrant two years ago this month.",
      "\"It's like your house is burning down,\" Rice continued. \"The fire department is calling and saying, 'Hey, we can send another fire truck to put out the fire.' And you just say, 'No. I think we're good. We won't take the help.'\"",

      "Under cashless bail schemes, an arrested suspect walks free before their trial without having to post any overhead fees, known as bail or bond, that are meant to ensure they keep coming back to court.",
      "\"So essentially the person goes to court within the first 24 hours, and the judge lets them go and says, you need to come back to court on this date,\" Rice said. \"And if you don't, there really are no consequences.\"",

      "A California study in 2023 found that violent crime tripled in the state under its \"Zero Bail\" policy.",

      "Another version of cashless bail, according to Rice, is called unsecured bond. In those situations, bond is set with a dollar value, but the defendant doesn't have to post it unless they miss a court date.",
      "\"Well, the funny part about that is, is if somebody doesn't show up to court, they're probably not going to pay a bond either,\" Rice told Fox News Digital. \"So it really is a ludicrous idea to have these unsecure bonds, but cashless bond is becoming more popular in a lot of these blue states, a lot of the more liberal states.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron isn't just France's head of state. He's also looking like he wants to be the spokesman for the whole of Europe. He's sought to lead Europe's response to the Russia-Ukraine war, opposed the U.S. by supporting Palestinian statehood, and weighed in on former President Donald Trump's desire to buy Greenland. Yet critics say he should be focusing on issues closer to home.",
      "In Macron's France, there is real turmoil in the country's parliament over how to fix the massive debt load. And Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou faces a vote of no confidence as early as Monday, which he will likely lose. Bayrou was appointed by Macron in December last year, following three other prime ministers who resigned during 2024. In many ways, what happens next is\u00a0a D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu scenario where the president appoints yet another prime minister as he did last December when Michel Barnier quit.",
      "Late last month, Bayrou highlighted that France is deep in debt despite being the second-largest economy in the European Union, behind Germany. In addition to being a large economy, France is also an important U.S. trading partner.",
      "Because of the pending fiscal crisis, Bayrou developed a plan to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.6% of GDP next year by making savings of 44 billion euros ($51 billion) and cutting two public holidays. That would be a smaller deficit than in any of the years from 2020 through 2024.",

      "However, the budget-cutting plan hasn\u2019t gone down well with other parties in the French Parliament, and Bayrou faces a vote of no confidence there. Organized labor unions are incensed by the prime minister\u2019s plans and are threatening work-stoppage strikes. Leo Barincou, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in Paris, told Fox News Digital that any union strikes likely won\u2019t last long, nor will they be significantly disruptive to the economy like the Yellow Vest protests in the winter of 2018-2019.",
      "If Bayrou loses, there are alternatives. \"Macron can call\u00a0a snap election or appoint a new prime minister, but that will be hard given the current situation,\" says Elias Haddad, senior markets strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in London. \"Bayrou is expected to lose, and all the other parties have vowed to topple the government.\"",

      "One thing that almost certainly won\u2019t happen is a resignation by Macron. \"Most likely, Macron appoints another prime minister and makes a minimal budget that won\u2019t be too scary,\" Barincou says. In other words, there may be some budget cutting, but it won\u2019t be anywhere near what the current prime minister proposed in August.",
      "Although it seems extremely unlikely that there will be a snap election, the populist National Rally (RN) said it is preparing for one and is reviewing a potential list of candidates. The RN's president, Jordan Bardella, said last week, \"We can and must be ready for anything, including a return to the ballot box with a dissolution of the National Assembly,\" according to a report in Reuters.",

      "However, while France\u2019s debt problem isn\u2019t going away any time soon, it is unlikely to weigh on the broader eurozone, Haddad says.

In other words, too many people are relying on government handouts rather than generating income through their own efforts.",

I merely asked two questions I thought were legitimate,\" Hermlin said.",
      "Known on social media as \"Daveetheewave,\" Hermlin has built a reputation not just for his music but for his image.

      "Hermlin also faced criticism for wearing the small yellow lapel pin, which symbolizes solidarity with the 50 hostages still held by Hamas. Festivalgoers suggested the pin was inflammatory or political propaganda. Hermlin rejects that characterization.\"People pointed at my yellow pin and said, maybe people are aggressive because of your pin. I asked them, do you know what it means? They said no,\" he said. \"This pin is about the hostages. It\u2019s not about the IDF or the government. It\u2019s about empathy.\"",

      "Hermlin says the treatment reminds him of both the McCarthy era and his own family\u2019s history in Berlin during the 1930s. He also points to the swing world\u2019s history of exclusion.\u00a0\"It reminds me of the McCarthy era, when artists were pressed to declare if they were communists.

    "story": [
      "House Democrats on Monday posted on X an image of a birthday message that President Donald Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003.",
      "Trump has denied having anything to do with the card, which was included in a leather-bound book of birthday messages for the late convicted sex offender's 50th birthday.",
      "The book was among the documents that the House Oversight Committee had subpoenaed from Epstein's estate last month.",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report the existence of the card. Trump sued the Journal, its publisher and two reporters in July. A spokesperson for Dow Jones said the newspaper stood by its reporting and would \"vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\"",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the Journal\u2019s reporting. White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich posted on X that the note should help Trump\u2019s legal case because \u201cit\u2019s not his signature.\u201d He added numerous photos of Trump\u2019s current signature, where he signed his full name.",
      "The post shows a hand-drawn outline of a naked woman with Trump's first name signed in the pubic area, as well as a typewritten note depicting an imaginary conversation between the future president and the multimillionaire who would later be charged with sex trafficking.",
      "\u201cVoice Over: There must be more to life than having everything,\" the note begins.",
      "\"Donald: Yes, there is, but I won\u2019t tell you what it is,\" it continues.",
      "\"Nor will I, since I also know what it is,\" Jeffrey says.",
      "Donald says, \"We have certain things in common Jeffrey,\" and he responds, \"Yes, we do, come to think of it.\"",
      "Donald then says, \"Enigmas never age, have you noticed that?\" Jeffrey responds, \"As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you.\"",
      "It concludes with Donald telling Jeffrey that \"A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday \u2014 and may every day be another wonderful secret.\u201d Trump's full name is typed out above the \"Donald\" signature.",
      "Trump said on his social media platform in July, \"These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don\u2019t draw pictures.\"",
      "Shortly after that post, the Washington Post ran a story noting that he'd done four sketches of buildings and a bridge that had been auctioned off during his first term as president.",
      "Days later, he amended his earlier statement while talking to reporters. \"Sometimes people say, 'Would you draw a building?' And I\u2019ll draw four lines and a little roof, you know, for a charity. So, but, but I\u2019m not a drawing person. I don\u2019t do drawings of women, that I can tell you,\" he said on July 28.",
      "In his defamation suit, Trump's attorneys alleged the note was \"nonexistent\" and that \"no authentic letter or drawing exists.\"",
      "His attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The version of the book that the Oversight Committee received was redacted to not show the names and faces of women and minors, according to the production cover letter sent from the Epstein estate attorneys to the committee.",
      "The subpoena from the committee said the book had been put together by Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.",
      "Maxwell was questioned about the existence of the book when she met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in July. She acknowledged she coordinated the project and had asked some of Epstein's friends to contribute birthday wishes, but said she did not recall if she'd spoken to Trump about the project or whether he'd submitted anything.",
      "Trump and Epstein were friends at one point, though the president has said they had a falling out years before Epstein\u2019s arrest for sex trafficking.",
      "Maxwell is appealing her conviction to the Supreme Court and her attorney has said he hopes Trump will give her a pardon.",
      "An Oversight Committee aide said that, in addition to the birthday book, the estate also turned over Epstein's will, the Sept. 24, 2007, nonprosecution agreement between the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida and Epstein; entries from Epstein\u2019s address/contact books from Jan. 1, 1990, through Aug. 10, 2019; and information about his bank accounts.",
      "\"Committee staff will review these documents and make them public in the near future,\u201d the aide said.",
      "Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges in New York in 2019. His death sparked years of conspiracy theories, some pushed by allies of Trump.",
      "The case exploded back into the headlines this summer after the Justice Department and the FBI announced in an unsigned joint memo that they agreed Epstein\u2019s death was the result of a suicide, that no other people were expected to be charged and that no further information about the case would be released.",
      "The unexpected move sparked a furious backlash from many Trump supporters, since he and his allies had stoked conspiracy theories about the politically connected Epstein\u2019s death and had vowed to be transparent and bring others to justice in the case.",
      "The House Oversight Committee also subpoenaed the Justice Department for its investigative files. The DOJ has turned over about a third of the files so far, and Democrats have said that the vast majority of that material was already public."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday allowed President Donald Trump to fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission despite a federal law that is intended to restrict the White House\u2019s power to control the agency.",
      "The court, via an order issued by Chief Justice John Roberts, temporarily blocked a judge's ruling that reinstated Rebecca Kelly Slaughter while the case continues.",
      "The order did not definitively signal how the court would address an emergency request made by the Trump administration to give the president broader authority to fire independent agency members without cause, but signals that it would likely grant it.",
      "Slaughter, who briefly returned to the agency as a result of the lower court rulings, said in a statement she would \"see this case through to the end\" regardless of the court's decision to let Trump remove her while the litigation continues.",
      "\"In the week I was back at the FTC it became even more clear to me that we desperately need the transparency and accountability Congress intended to have at bipartisan independent agencies,\" she added.",
      "Trump fired both Democratic commissioners on the five-person FTC in March, Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Both challenged the move, although Bedoya later dropped out of the case. Slaughter is currently listed as a serving commissioner on the agency\u2019s website, as the case has made its way through the courts.",
      "The firings are a direct challenge to a 1935 Supreme Court precedent called Humphrey's Executor v. United States that upheld limits on the president\u2019s ability to fire FTC commissioners without cause, a restriction Congress imposed to protect the agency from political pressure.",
      "Under the 1914 law that set up the agency, members can only be removed for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d",
      "A federal judge in July ruled in favor of Slaughter, citing the 1935 ruling. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reached a similar conclusion.",
      "But the Supreme Court, whose majority has been skeptical of the concept of independent federal agencies that are not subject to presidential control, has undermined such protections in recent years in a series of cases involving other agencies.",
      "Lawyers for the Trump administration argue that the removal restrictions unlawfully impose limits on the president's power to control the executive branch as defined by Article 2 of the Constitution.",
      "This year, Trump has also sought to remove members of other independent federal agencies, which the Supreme Court has allowed.",
      "The FTC has five commissioners who serve seven-year terms \u2014with no more than three from one political party. Slaughter and Bedoya both served as Democratic members, although Trump originally appointed Bedoya in 2018. President Joe Biden reappointed her in 2024."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration on Monday asked the Supreme Court to allow the government to withhold $4 billion of spending on foreign aid that was approved by Congress.",
      "The move came in response to a federal judge's ruling last week that requires the administration to spend the funds despite President Donald Trump notifying Congress that he intends not to.",
      "The case marks a showdown over to what extent the president can refuse to spend money that Congress has appropriated, a brewing issue as Trump has embraced a sweeping view of presidential power since taking office again in January.",
      "In the new filing, Solicitor General D. John Sauer described the case as raising \u201ca grave and urgent threat\u201d to the power of the presidency.",
      "Under the Constitution, it is the job of Congress to allocate funds that the president can spend.",
      "Current federal funding expires on Sept. 30. The Trump administration has said it wants to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid, but will spend another $6.5 billion that Congress appropriated.",
      "The dispute involves a law called the Impoundment Control Act, which was passed in 1974 to regulate the president\u2019s control over the budget. That followed efforts by then-President Richard Nixon to withhold spending on programs he did not support.",
      "Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali has been at the center of the complicated litigation, which has raged for months as the Trump administration has dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "The underlying lawsuit was brought by various groups that receive foreign-aid funding, led by the Global Health Council.",
      "Prior to the current administration, USAID spent billions every year on programs in developing countries addressing such issues as malaria and AIDs prevention and improving access to water.",
      "In his ruling last week, Ali said the government must spend the money unless Congress votes to approve Trump's request.",
      "But in Monday's filing, Sauer said that Ali's order imposes impossible burdens on the administration.",
      "\"To have any hope of complying in time, the executive branch would have to immediately commence diplomatic discussions with foreign nations about the use of those funds \u2014 discussions the President considers counterproductive to foreign policy \u2014 and notify Congress about planned obligations that the President is strongly opposing,\" he added.",
      "In a filing in response, the plaintiffs urged the court not to immediately block Ali's ruling, saying it merely requires the government to make plans to spend the money by the end of the month. If Congress approves Trump's request, the money would not have to be spent, they added.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit declined to block Ali's decision, prompting the Trump administration to turn to the Supreme Court.",
      "The Trump administration filing is the 25th emergency request from the government since January, as courts have pushed back against broad assertions of presidential authority. The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has granted 17 of the requests."

      "The bills are sudden and jarring: $1,400 for a computer part from Germany, $620 for an aluminum case from Sweden and $1,041 for handbags from Spain.",
      "Some U.S. shoppers say they are being hit with surprise charges from international shipping carriers as the exemption on import duties for items under $800 expires as a part of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff push.",
      "That\u2019s leading to some frustration and confusion as shoppers and shippers both try to navigate a new reality for anybody ordering goods from abroad.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s maximum chaos,\u201d said Nick Baker, co-lead of the trade and customs practice at Kroll, a firm that advises freight carriers.",
      "Thomas Andrews, who runs a business in upstate New York restoring vintage computers from the 1980s and 1990s, said he was shocked to receive a tariff bill from DHL for approximately $1,400 on a part worth $750. He said he assumed there must have been a mistake.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s extortion,\u201d Andrews said.",
      "Late Friday, a representative for DHL told Andrews that the initial charge was indeed incorrect: The tariff bill should have only been for about $110. But it was too late: Andrews had already refused shipment to avoid paying the charge. Soon after learning about the corrected charge, he realized DHL had already begun sending the item back to Germany.",
      "The final annoyance, Andrews said: He\u2019s being charged for the return shipping \u2014 about $50.",
      "On Aug. 29, for the first time in nearly a century, small-dollar items coming into the U.S. \u2014 also called de minimis goods \u2014 began facing import duties. That means even small, personal orders now face the sizable tariffs placed on U.S. trading partners. While a recent ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found many of Trump\u2019s duties unconstitutional, they remain in effect while Trump appeals the case to the Supreme Court.",
      "To comply with the new de minimis rules, a wave of countries have halted shipments to the U.S. That\u2019s caused postal traffic into the U.S. to decline by some 80%, according to a United Nations agency.",
      "But many orders are still flowing. And since the new de minimis rule began taking effect, social media platforms have been filled with accounts of U.S. customers receiving shock bills from major shippers like DHL, FedEx and UPS, having received no notice about the charges from the foreign merchant they\u2019d ordered from.",
      "The shippers, in turn, are being inundated with messages from customers disputing the charges, along with return-to-sender requests as the customers refuse shipments to avoid having to pay the bills.",
      "A representative for DHL said the firm \u201cis committed to supporting customers through the recent tariff changes and ensuring their shipments are managed efficiently.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe encourage customers to take note of the shipping policies of the brands they shop with and to also remember that tariffs are payable to the U.S. government,\u201d it said.",
      "The Trump administration has heralded the billions in revenues the tariffs are bringing in \u2014 and in the case of the new de minimis rule, argued the change is essential to halting the flow of small-sized illicit drug packages and drug ingredients. In a statement posted the day the new de minimis rules took effect, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the logistics industry \u201chas already adapted to the changes with minimal interruption.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis change has been months in the making, and we are fully prepared to implement it,\u201d said Susan S. Thomas, acting executive assistant commissioner for CBP\u2019s Office of Trade. \u201cForeign carriers and postal operators were given clear timelines, detailed guidance, and multiple options to comply. The only thing ending on August 29 is the pathway that has been used by criminals to exploit America\u2019s borders.\u201d",
      "Baker said foreign merchants are obligated to provide information to the shipper about the classification of the item, which is key to the tariff calculation \u2014 but from a regulatory perspective, the customer, as the importer of record, is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of that information.",
      "But many people are still getting caught off guard.",
      "After receiving a tariff bill for $620 on a $300 aluminum computer case from Sweden, Robert Wang decided to turn the shipment away.",
      "A software engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area, Wang said he placed his order Aug. 22 with Louqe, a high-end Swedish merchant. More than a week later, he received notice from UPS about the bill.",
      "\u201cConfusion transitioned into a late-night panic,\u201d Wang said, as he frantically researched the situation. Eventually UPS confirmed he\u2019d been charged the 200% tariff Trump has slapped on certain aluminum goods.",
      "Wang said he tried to reach out to Louqe about the charge, but did not hear back. The company did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News.",
      "In a statement, UPS said it has solutions available to merchants designed to navigate the new environment, but did not address the customer-billing situation.",
      "Baker said many foreign businesses that rely on U.S. customers now face the dilemma of eating the tariff cost \u2014 assuming they are properly accounting for it in the first place \u2014 or passing it on to their customers, which could scare off business. Many merchants abroad have posted to social media to alert U.S. customers that they are suspending shipments there.",
      "Some U.S. small businesses are also paying a price. A day after receiving a shipment from Spain for handbags he said were worth about $600, Herm Narciso said he and his wife, who run a brick-and-mortar shop in Dunedin, Florida, that resells goods from Europe, got a tariff invoice for $1,041.44 from DHL.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t understand how it\u2019s possible to assess us with that level of tariffs,\u201d Narciso said.",
      "They said that they plan to file a dispute, but that the response could take two to four weeks. Narciso is worried their shop won\u2019t survive the recent changes if they start getting similar bills going forward.",
      "\u201cThis last quarter is probably going to tank us,\u201d Narciso said. \u201cThe margins on this type of business are slim to begin with.\u201d",

      "This was the second time in nine months that lawmakers in France\u2019s National Assembly ousted a prime minister; Michel Barnier was deposed in a vote of no confidence in December. Before that, the last successful vote of no confidence was in 1962. It means French President Emmanuel Macron will be looking for his fifth prime minister in just 20 months.",
      "Though Macron remains a big presence internationally \u2014 leading European efforts to support Ukraine and provide a counterweight to President Donald Trump \u2014 at home he is dogged by a divided electorate and long-term uncertainty.",
      "Macron, in his second term, is barred by term limits from running  in the next presidential election in 2027. The far-right National Rally is currently leading the polls, even though its leader, Marine le Pen, is  barred from office because of an embezzlement conviction, which she is appealing.",
      "As in the rest of Europe, the far right is surging in France, capitalizing on widespread discontent over a cost-of-living crisis that has fueled a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment. And on Wednesday, large anti-government protests are expected throughout France.",
      "France\u2019s troubles took root last year when Le Pen\u2019s National Rally performed well in Europe-wide elections and Macron stunned the Continent by calling snap parliamentary elections. Parties on the left and right were able to work together to block a victory for Le Pen, but the resulting Parliament was divided, with no group holding enough power to govern with stability.",
      "Macron cobbled together a minority government, but as Bayrou and Barnier have found, it is extremely vulnerable to attack by its leftist and hard-right opponents. Many French political experts  say the current crisis will persist until 2027 when the country elects a new leader, who will inevitably seek to cement their mandate by calling fresh parliamentary elections.",
      "This will do little to resolve France\u2019s short-term economic woes. Both Bayrou and Barnier were ousted while trying to resolve what they and many others see as a national debt crisis.",
      "France\u2019s budget deficit \u2014 how much more it spends than it earns \u2014 last year reached 5.8% of its gross domestic product. That\u2019s far higher than the European Union average of 3.1% and the E.U.\u2019s target of 3%, worrying investors about rising interest rates, lower credit ratings and less money for public services in the future."

      "Officers from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department responded to the 1800 block of Camden Road following a call reporting an assault with a deadly weapon on Aug. 22, according to a police news release. Zarutska had been stabbed on the LYNX Blue Line train near the light rail station, WCNC reported.",
      "Officers found the 23-year-old had sustained knife wounds, and she was pronounced dead on the scene, police said.",
      "Decarlos Brown Jr., 34, was identified as a suspect in the stabbing, police said. He was taken to a local hospital \"with non-life-threatening injuries sustained at the time of the incident\" and will be arrested and charged with first-degree murder upon his release.",
      "Surveillance video obtained by WBTV shows someone who appears to be Zarutska getting on a full train and sitting in front of a person who appears to be Brown. After a few minutes, the person reported to be Brown seemingly takes out a pocket knife, stands up, and allegedly stabs the individual sitting in front of him. There did not appear to be any interaction between the two people before the alleged stabbing.",
      "In a statement, Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles called the incident \"a senseless and tragic loss.\"",
      "\"My prayers remain with her loved ones as they continue to grieve through an unimaginable time. Like so many of you, I\u2019m heartbroken \u2014 and I\u2019ve been thinking hard about what safety really looks like in our city,\" Lyles said. \"I remain committed to doing all we can to protect our residents and ensure Charlotte is a place where everyone feels safe.\"",
      "Zarutska had recently left Ukraine \"seeking safety from the war and hoping for a new beginning,\" according to GoFundMe, seeking support for her aunt and uncle with funeral expenses.",
      "Trump mentioned the stabbing Monday while delivering remarks during the second hearing of the Religious Liberty Commission in Washington, D.C., saying, \"there are evil people, and we have to confront that.\"",
      "\"A lunatic just got up and started \u2014 it\u2019s right on the tape, not, not really watchable, because it\u2019s so horrible,\" he said. \"But just viciously stabbed. She\u2019s just sitting there. So, there are evil people. We have to be able to handle that. If we don\u2019t handle that, we don\u2019t have a country.\"",
      "Her death has also spurred rebukes from others on the right, who have accused the media of purposely not covering the incident.",
      "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller blamed the Democratic Party for the incident.",
      "\"The Democrat Party at every level \u2014 judges, politicians, academics, nonprofits \u2014 is organized around the defense and protection of the criminal, the monstrous and the depraved,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"The more vile the threat, the more vociferously the Democrat Party works to protect and enable it.\"",
      "Elon Musk, who formerly held an unofficial advisory role in the Trump administration, commented on the incident in several posts on X.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s change the law,\u201d Musk wrote in one X post. \"Between now and then, name and shame the DAs and judges who enable murder, rape and robbery. But especially shame those who funded the campaigns of the DAs and judges. That will make the biggest difference.\"",
      "The investigation into the attack is ongoing."

There\u2019s too many to repost, really, but it\u2019s so fun to see people enjoy it so much. And see people enjoy that relationship and create that love story, their own love story, from these characters. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d",
      "While there are many beautiful scenes between Margo and Sophie, there are also some dark ones. One that \u00c5kerman didn\u2019t particularly enjoy is in the back half of the series, when Margo shows up at Sophie\u2019s motel room, where Sophie stays after Graham kicks her out of the house while the police suspect her of Abby\u2019s murder.",
      "\u201cWhat wasn\u2019t my favorite is the one in the motel where Brittany chokes me, and I smack her, and we hated that,\u201d \u00c5kerman says. \u201cWe hated hating each other, but it turned out beautiful. But there was a lot of, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t want to do this.\u2019\u201d",
      "As for when viewers will see what\u2019s next for Margo and Sophie, that remains to be seen. The show has not yet officially been picked up for a second season.",
      "\u201cI wish I was here with better news, but I feel like we all know there\u2019s going to be a second season, without confirming,\u201d she told Jenna Bush Hager and guest co-host Savannah Guthrie on the fourth hour of TODAY on Sept. 8."

      "Regarding the decision to close the production early, Speers said the \"painful\" decision was made \"with a heavy heart.\"",
      "\"On behalf of all the producers, we\u2019re so honored to have been able to bring this version of John Kander, Fred Ebb, and Joe Masteroff\u2019s important masterpiece, Cabaret, to New York and to have opened the doors to our own Kit Kat Club for the year and a half we have been here,\" Speers said.",
      "\"Cabaret\" began previews at the August Wilson Theatre in April 2024 and originally starred Eddie Redmayne as the Emcee and Gayle Rankin as Sally Bowles.

      "Sylvester Stallone is getting candid about his upbringing.",
      "During a Sept. 7 appearance on Sunday Sitdown with Willie Geist, Stallone recalled the abuse he faced by his father as a kid and how it ultimately made him want to be an actor.",
      "\"There\u2019s this incredible sense of emptiness because why couldn\u2019t it have been like, a pleasant upbringing? Why did it have to be so dark?\" he said. \"But would I have been here if it was a pleasant \u2014 hell, like, 'The Waltons'? It wasn\u2019t.\"",
      "Having a tumultuous relationship with his father, he started to look for \"a real male role model\" elsewhere, he said. That's when his love for acting and performance began.",
      "\"And I couldn\u2019t find it. It certainly wasn\u2019t around the house,\" he said. \"And it wasn\u2019t until I went to the movie theater, but I was never into, like, real serious actors. I was into escapism.\"",
      "The \"Tulsa King\" star ended up dropping out of the University of Miami to pursue acting in New York City. At 23, he moved to the Big Apple to hopefully get some roles, but he was typecast in smaller parts.",
      "That was when Stallone decided to take his career into his own hands. The \"Creed\" star sat down and wrote the highly acclaimed movie \"Rocky.\" The film starred Stallone as a small-time Philadelphia boxer who gets the chance to take on the world heavyweight champion.",
      "Though the film saw much success, Stallone says that studios didn't want him to star in it because they wanted an established actor to take the lead role. Stallone famously insisted he could do the job and turned down an offer of $360,000 to not be in the movie.",
      "While speaking with Willie, he remembered what he told himself years ago when he was first presented with the offer.",
      "\u201c'This is basically you, Sly. If you get rid of this, yes, you\u2019ll have $360 grand,' which was worth a lot more back then, 'but that will go. Eventually, that will be gone, and you\u2019ll be the most bitter human being, because the entire thing was not about selling out,'\" he said.",
      "\"It was about integrity. And I said, if I let this go, I\u2019m letting my life go \u2018cause I\u2019m never going to find this again, never,\" he added.",
      "Stallone's decision to not give up the role proved inspirational for other actors. Willie said Matt Damon once told him that he and Ben Affleck insisted on playing the lead roles in \"Good Will Hunting,\" a movie they wrote together, because of Stallone.",
      "\"Thank you. Thank you, guys,\" Stallone said after hearing that.",
      "Since \"Rocky,\" Stallone has gone on to appear in films like \"Rambo\" and \"The Expendables.\"",
      "Now, the three-time Academy Award nominee will be honored in December at the 2025 Kennedy Center Honors.",
      "\"Does it get you thinking about legacy?\" Willie asked the star.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think a lot of artists dwell on what they\u2019ve done,\" Stallone said. \"It\u2019s like what\u2019s next? What\u2019s next? I want to be relevant. I want to be loved. I need something else.\""

      "During a Sept. 3 interview with British GQ, Bailey reflected on the most recent years of his career, noting, \u201cI\u2019ve been working solidly for about three years now, which has been amazing and mind-blowing.\u201d",
      "However, the actor shared that there was a change of pace on the horizon, adding, \u201cBut with everything happening in the world right now, I\u2019m going to stop acting for a bit next year and just focus on the Shameless Fund.\u201d",
      "\u201cOver the next few months, I\u2019ll be focusing on staffing and making sure we get all the right people in all the right places,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this statistic: out of every \u00a3100 raised in the UK, only 1p goes to the LGBTQ+ community. You really have to dig to find solutions, and I genuinely think The Shameless Fund is exactly that.\u201d",

      "He\u2019s starred in all three seasons of the Regency-era drama, with the second season centered on his character, and confirmed in an interview with ABC News in August 2024 that he\u2019d be returning for Season 4.",

He also starred opposite Matt Bomer in the Showtime series \u201cFellow Travelers,\u201d which earned them both Emmy nominations in 2024.",
      "Bailey has appeared on the silver screen, too, including portraying Fiyero in \u201cWicked\u201d and its upcoming sequel, as well as a role in \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d where he formed a tight-knit friendship with his co-star, Scarlett Johansson.",
      "While promoting \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d Bailey shared his thoughts on \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d which premieres on Nov. 21, during an August interview with E! News, calling it \u201creally extraordinary.\u201d",

They wanted her to say \u201cthat Ukraine killed my mother,\u201d she said.",

Her sister and her cousin joined them as they made their way west to the city of Mykolaiv.",

      "\u201cThey interrogated me, maybe six or seven hours,\u201d she said, adding that she was locked in a basement cell overnight before further questioning the following morning. Her interrogators were particularly interested in Save Ukraine, she said.",

      "While she was initially reluctant, she said, she was able to use Vlad\u2019s phone to consult with Save Ukraine via text message. Tatiana said the group told her: \u201cDo what is necessary, just for you to leave from there.\u201d",

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have floated the possibility of introducing a bill in the Senate that, if passed, could designate Russia and Belarus as state sponsors of terrorism over the kidnapping of Ukrainian children, a source familiar with the bill told NBC News in mid-August. A draft of the bill says that Belarus \u201chas directly supported the kidnapping of Ukrainian children and supported their relocation.\u201d",

      "CHONGQING, China \u2014 For nearly two months, health officials in southern China have been waging war on mosquitos, reviving top-down tactics from the country\u2019s zero-Covid playbook.",
      "Since July, the province of Guangdong alone has reported more than 10,000 cases of chikungunya fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease that mostly circulates in tropical regions. Foshan, a manufacturing hub in densely populated Guangdong, has been the hardest-hit Chinese city \u2014 recording over 600 new infections per day at its peak, more than the combined total of 519 cases reported across mainland China from 2010 to 2019.",
      "The unprecedented outbreak prompted Chinese authorities to adopt a containment strategy akin to the country\u2019s strict zero-Covid policy \u2014 a \u201cdetect and eliminate\u201d approach.",
      "To curb the spread, workers were sent out to spray insecticide in affected areas multiple times a day. The government also required suspected patients to report their cases promptly and comply with the quarantine mandate.",
      "The outbreak in China was triggered by warmer weather this year and a fast-spreading virus strain, Liu Qiyong, chief expert of vector control at China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state-run broadcaster CCTV.",
      "But the surge in chikungunya cases extends far beyond China as global warming accelerates the spread of infectious diseases, including dengue fever and malaria, a 2025 study found.",
      "As of mid-August, about 270,000 cases of chikungunya had been recorded globally this year, including in the Americas, Europe and Southeast Asia, leading to at least 110 related deaths, according to the Pan American Health Organization.",
      "While no locally acquired cases have been reported in U.S. states or territories since 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel health notice in August urging \u201cenhanced precaution\u201d amid chikungunya outbreaks in China\u2019s Guangdong province and four other countries. The CDC warned that anyone spending time in areas where chikungunya occurs is at risk.",
      "\u201cIn this rapidly changing world, infectious disease can disseminate very quickly,\u201d said Jasper Chan, a professor of clinical microbiology and infection at the University of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cEspecially after the recent Covid-19 pandemic, relevant authorities have been quite, I would say, cautious in terms of making these alert issues,\u201d he said.",
      "Chikungunya 101",
      "The chikungunya virus, first identified in Tanzania in 1952, has spread for decades mainly in the Americas, Africa and Asia. It is transmitted primarily through the bites of infected mosquitos and does not spread directly from person to person.",
      "\u201cChikungunya virus very closely resembles other mosquito-borne viruses like dengue clinically, but they belong to different families,\u201d Chan said.",
      "Its name, which comes from a language in southern Tanzania, means \u201cto bend over,\u201d a reference to the debilitating joint pain it causes. Though it is rarely fatal, chikungunya can have long-lasting, severe symptoms, including muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "As there is no specific antiviral drug to cure chikungunya, current treatment is focused primarily on relieving the symptoms. One vaccine is available in the United States. Prevention is the best protection, according to the CDC, which advises people to avoid mosquito bites and get vaccinated if necessary before they travel to places where chikungunya occurs.",
      "Chikungunya has been reported in over 110 countries across every continent except Antarctica, with at least 5.6 billion people living in places at risk from it, the WHO estimated.",
      "The disease spreads through global travelers via mosquitoes. A person gets bitten in one country, boards a plane with the virus still in the bloodstream and lands thousands of miles away, where a mosquito picks up the infection and passes it to the next person. The cycle then begins again, eventually leading to a local outbreak.",
      "Though the United States is unlikely to experience large outbreaks since people in warm areas often stay indoors with air conditioning, experts advise using mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves and delaying trips to regions with chikungunya outbreaks.",
      "How China battles chikungunya",
      "While chikungunya is not uncommon in other parts of the world, such as Latin America, it is unusual to have big outbreaks in China, where the first imported case was identified in 2008, experts say.",
      "To stop the spread, local authorities have enlisted grassroots workers to disperse insecticide on the streets and clear stagnant pools of water where mosquitos breed. Clinics and hospitals have set up mosquito-proof beds to isolate patients, and residents have been urged to install screen windows and to light mosquito coils at home.",

    "summary": "Online shoppers say they\u2019re getting hit with big, surprise fees on Korean sunscreens, skin care, makeup and more.",
    "story": [
      "Mackenzie Knight bought $100 worth of Beauty of Joseon sunscreens and other popular Korean skin care products last month from YesStyle, a major online K-beauty retailer. Five days later, she received an email from global shipping company DHL containing a $20 tariff bill. She had five days to pay up, the notice said, or her order would be returned.",
      "The charge came as a shock, Knight told NBC News, because YesStyle made no mention on its website that consumers would be charged an extra fee as a result of the ending of the de minimis tariff exemption \u2014 a loophole for lower-value packages that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration halted last week.",
      "\u201cI feel grateful to be able to afford $20, but it\u2019s not the best to not be expecting it,\u201d said Knight, 35, from San Jose, California. \u201cIf people are able to know how much tariffs they\u2019d be charged, a calculator for example, that\u2019d be helpful.\u201d",
      "Beauty junkies obsessed with Korean cleansing oils, snail mucin and sunscreens famously more protective than what are available in the U.S. might want to prepare themselves before they add products to their cart and see the price tick up.",
      "The de minimis provision allowed packages valued at less than $800 to be imported tax-free. These packages will now be charged either the tariff rates the U.S. placed on their countries of origin or fixed fees of $80 to $200, the latter option available only for six months.",
      "South Korea, for example, was subject to a 15% reciprocal tariff starting this summer.",
      "The end of the exemption combined with the recent round of tariffs has shaken the Korean beauty industry, which has experienced a sustained boom in the United States over the past decade.",
      "The U.S. imported an estimated $1.7 billion worth of K-beauty products in 2024, a more than 50% increase from the previous year, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission.",
      "While tariffs disrupt global supply chains, the removal of the de minimis provision affects shipments of low-value items such as small electronics and skin care and beauty products, said Munseob Lee, an economist at the University of California San Diego.",
      "In the short run, he said, K-beauty consumers could face \u201chigher prices, fewer varieties and longer delivery times.\u201d",
      "Eliminating the de minimis exemption could cost the average American family up to $136 a year, the heaviest impact falling on low-income and minority consumers who rely on affordable imports, according to a February report from the Yale Economic Growth Center.",
      "Lee said the full impact of the de minimis change on the K-beauty industry may not be clear until next year, as many shoppers and retailers have stocked up on inventory to brace for higher tariff costs.",
      "At the moment, he said, it\u2019s difficult to determine exact price increases because sellers may adopt different strategies to offset costs. Bigger retailers may have the market power to pass on duties to consumers, but smaller brands may have to suspend deliveries to U.S. shoppers, he said.",
      "The impact of global tariffs and ending the de minimis exemption is not limited to the Korean beauty industry. Santiago Vance, who buys Japanese beauty products, said online retailers like Wabi-Sabi and Yoyo Japan have stopped shipping her go-to stem cell serums to the U.S.",
      "\u201cI really am disappointed in how cruel this administration is to normal people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t buy a lot. Most of us never even went over the de minimis amount that was there already.\u201d",
      "Congress had planned to remove the tariff exemption for all countries in July 2027, but Trump signed an executive order expediting the end date to Aug. 29. The same day, K-beauty retailer Olive Young imposed a 15% customs duty on all U.S. orders to offset the 15% tax on South Korean imports that went into effect Aug 1.",
      "\u201cWe just accepted the reality that this year is going to be one of the most unprofitable years,\u201d said Liah Yoo, a beauty influencer and the founder of the U.S.-based K-beauty brand Krave Beauty.",
      "Because Krave Beauty has a U.S.-based distribution center and doesn\u2019t ship finished products from Korea, Yoo said, the de minimis exemption doesn\u2019t affect her business as much as the direct import tariffs have. Her packaging and operational costs have increased, but Yoo said she\u2019s holding off on hiking prices due to ongoing geopolitical uncertainty.",
      "\u201cThe last thing I want to do is increase prices then backtrack because trade policy changed again,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully by the end of year there\u2019ll be something more set in stone.\u201d"

    "summary": "An iconic winged lion that has perched above Venice for centuries, may have originated in China, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "For centuries, an iconic winged lion has perched above Venice, a symbol of the \u201cFloating City\u201d that millions of tourists have passed under in St. Mark\u2019s Square.",
      "But scientists now believe that this ancient emblem of the Italian city may in fact have origins a world away.",
      "A study released Thursday found evidence that the statue may have been partially made in China and arrived in northern Italy after a long journey across the medieval Silk Road that may have involved the father of the explorer Marco Polo and the court of the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan.",
      "Historical documents confirm the statue was in Venice by the late 13th century, but its history before that remains murky.",
      "How the lion made its way to Venice \u2014 an economic powerhouse in the medieval world owing to its strategic position close to Europe and the Byzantine Empire \u2014 has long been a mystery.",
      "It was assumed by experts that the statue may have come from ancient Persia or Syria.",
      "By studying copper isotopes taken from samples of the statue, scientists were able to identify that the metal originated from the Yangtze River in eastern-central China, more than 8,000 miles away from where it now stands.",
      "Their findings were published in the archeology journal Antiquity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rather extraordinary discovery,\u201d Hannah Skoda, associate professor of medieval history at the University of Oxford, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cAt the same time it is indicative of the sheer extent and intensity of global trading networks, even in this really early period,\u201d which would have made the long journey from China to Italy via the Silk Road possible all those centuries ago,\" Skoda, who was not involved in the study, said in a phone interview.",
      "The study\u2019s conclusion \u201cis striking \u2014 though perhaps not quite as improbable as it might sound,\u201d said Peter Frankopan, professor of global history at Oxford and author of \u201cThe Silk Roads: A New History of the World.\u201d",
      "\u201cDiscoveries like this are not unusual once you start to look carefully at the materials, the motifs and the methods that shaped the cities we think we know,\u201d he said by email.",
      "The statue may not even be a lion at all, the study suggests.",
      "Researchers argue that the figure closely mirrors tomb guardians from the Tang dynasty, which ruled from the 6th to 9th centuries during China\u2019s golden age. These ancient sculptures were known as \u201czhenmushou\u201d and share similar features with the Venice statue such as the position of the ears and the distinctive \u201cbulbous nose,\u201d according to the study.",
      "There are no written records telling us where the statue that now looks down from a Piazzetta column in St. Mark\u2019s came from. The only historical document mentioning it dates to 1293, and researchers have long presumed that the statue had a rich history before it made its way to Venice.",
      "Scientists still don\u2019t have a firm grasp on how exactly the statue traversed such great distances across multiple continents all those years ago. However, the study suggests that Niccolo and Maffeo Polo, Marco Polo\u2019s father and uncle, might have discovered the original statue in the 13th century while visiting the court of Kublai Khan in what is now Beijing.",
      "As traveling merchants, they would have then transported the statue back to their home city of Venice along the famed Silk Road.",
      "Pointing to the fact that the city had not long ago adopted the lion as its emblem, the study suggested that the Polo brothers may have seen a Chinese figure and had the \u201cbrazen idea of readapting the sculpture into a plausible (when viewed from afar) Winged Lion.\u201d",
      "While not enough evidence exists to be sure of this rumored route, experts say the statue\u2019s eastern origins underscore Venice\u2019s longstanding global prowess.",
      "As with so many great trading centers in history, Frankopan said, \u201cthe city\u2019s capacity to absorb and adapt outside influences \u2014 from Byzantine mosaics to Egyptian porphyry \u2026 is what gave it dynamism and resilience.\u201d",
      "In such a global city, he adds, \u201ca Tang dynasty lion fits right in.\u201d"

      "MILAN \u2014 Giorgio Armani was the king of Italian fashion, a designer loved by Hollywood stars. And yet, his final resting place was far from all the glitz and glamor \u2014 in his family tomb in the provincial town where he was born. His funeral Monday was a small ceremony in the presence of only his closest family and friends.",
      "For those who knew him, the end of Armani's life illustrated the cipher that he was, private and true to his roots and his humble beginnings.",
      "\u201cHe had a very hard start,\u201d his biographer, Renata Molho, said outside Armani\u2019s funeral chamber. \u201cHe turned all of this into a sort of humanity \u2014 to look at people trying to understand them.\u201d",
      "Born in Piacenza, in northern Italy, in 1934, Giorgio Armani lived through World War II, the Nazi occupation of Italy and the post-war years when much of the country was in rubble.",
      "\u201cHis father was in prison for political reasons,\u201d Molho said, referring to Ugo Armani\u2019s work as a clerk for the local fascist party. While not poor, the family was not wealthy, and after Ugo was released from prison they moved to Milan.",
      "\u201cHe had a big, awful accident while playing with a bomb when he was a child. And his brother, Sergio, died when he was young,\u201d Molho added.",
      "Armani became close to Sergio\u2019s daughters, Silvana and Roberta, and brought his nieces into his company.",
      "\u201cHe was warm, careful. When he was talking to you \u2014 even for a short moment \u2014 he was with you. When he was asking \u2018How are you?\u2019 he was listening to the answer\u201d Molho said.",
      "The Armani name, a byword for glamor and luxury, for the rich and powerful, still resonates with ordinary people in this part of Italy.",
      "Local officials estimate that 16,000 people lined up  over the weekend to pay their last respects. As per the designer\u2019s instructions, his coffin was laid in the Armani Theater in Milan \u2014 the stage of his runway shows.",
      "Many of those who stood in line for hours appeared to have a personal connection to Armani, having been employed by his empire, which over the years branched out from fashion to makeup and perfume, hotels and restaurants.",
      "Some wept openly as they waited. The murmurs of the people in the line died down the moment they stepped into the dark auditorium, lit only by 300 candles on the floor and Armani\u2019s picture projected on the wall. The music of Italian composer Luigi Einaudi played in the background.",
      "Most walked over and touched the closed casket. One man genuflected. All the while Armani\u2019s long-time partner, Leo Dell\u2019Orco, and family sat or stood around wiping tears, talking and welcoming those who they knew.",
      "A number of people  walked over to embrace  family members standing nearby.",
      "\u201cHe was a second father. He was a second family,\u201d said Fabio Mancini, the Italian supermodel who for 20 years was one of the most recognizable faces, and bodies, of the Armani brand.",
      "Armani hired Mancini when the future model was just 18 after spotting him walking by a photoshoot near the Armani boutique in central Milan.",
      "\u201cIt was life changing,\u201d Mancini said.",
      "He recalled how nervous he was before his first runway and how Armani took him under his wing.",
      "\u201cI was backstage, I was looking around and my question was \u2018What am I doing here?\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Mancini said Armani looked at him and smiled a little as he said: \u201c\u2018Remember, now you represent Italy.\u2019\u2019",
      "He said that, by his example, Armani helped shape the person he\u2019s become.",
      "\u201cTwenty years later, in my last fashion show, he did the same,\u201d Mancini added. \u201cHe was looking at me, smiling, and he told me, \u2018Do you remember the first time? Now you\u2019re a man.\u2019\u201d",
      "Armani leaves a legacy that goes beyond the circle of those who knew him or worked for him.",
      "In the late 1970s and \u201880s, he revolutionised fashion by giving men light, more comfortable jackets and women the power suit.",
      "\u201cHe had very good instincts for social change,\u201d Molho said. \u201cHe understood that women were making very important careers, and they needed to be feminine, but to have authority.\u201d",
      "Armani started his company with a small investment in 1975 and was able to turn it into a multibillion-dollar business. Today it is one of the few major fashion houses that is still privately owned.",
      "The designer was planning a big party at the end of September to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his brand. He reviewed and approved the collection to be showcased at that party just a few days before his death Thursday at 91.",
      "His will is set to be unsealed after his funeral and will likely hold the answer as to what will happen to the Armani brand.",
      "But Molho said Armani\u2019s death is a turning point for the whole fashion world: \u201cFashion will miss a piece. It\u2019s like a big puzzle, and we\u2019ll miss the biggest part, the biggest piece.\u201d"

      "Informally known as \u201cGod\u2019s influencer,\u201d Acutis was just 15 when he died of acute promyelocytic leukemia in Milan in 2006 and has two miracles attributed to him by the Catholic Church.",
      "The Vatican said 36 cardinals, 270 bishops and hundreds of priests had signed up to celebrate the Mass, where Leo also canonized Pier Giorgio Frassati, another popular Italian who died young.",
      "Acutis was born in London, where his father, Andrea Acutis, 61, was working as a banker, but the family moved back to Milan when he was young.",
      "Using the family\u2019s small, old computer, Acutis taught himself how to program, and built a website cataloging more than 100 Eucharistic miracles around the world that had been recognized by the church over many centuries.",
      "Sunday\u2019s ceremony in front of the Vatican\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, in conjunction with the celebration of the Holy Year\u2019s jubilee for teens, was originally set for April but was postponed after the death of Pope Francis, who called the internet a \u201cgift from God\u201d and encouraged the Vatican to use technology.",
      "Francis had pushed for Acutis to be given a sainthood in the hope that it would give the next generation of Catholics a relatable role model and attract young people to the faith.",
      "An estimated 80,000 people attended the open-air Mass on Sunday, many of them millennials and couples with young children.",
      "Francis approved a miracle attributed to Acutis in 2020, declaring him \u201cblessed\u201d and crediting him with healing Matheus Vianna, a 7-year-old boy from Brazil who recovered from a rare pancreatic disorder after coming into contact with one of Carlo\u2019s T-shirts.",
      "A second miracle was attributed to Acutis last year, in which he was credited with the complete healing of Costa Rican student Valeria Valverde from major head trauma sustained in a bicycle accident, after her mother prayed at his tomb.",
      "Acutis\u2019 mother, Antonia Salzano, 58, said that in many ways, her son was just like any other teenager who liked playing video games, hanging out with his friends and playing soccer.",
      "\u201cHe was a normal kid, he was a normal person, but he opened the door of his heart to God,\u201d she said earlier this year.",
      "Being made a saint means the church believes a person lived a holy life and is now in heaven with God.",
      "It is impossible to quantify exactly how many saints there are. During the church\u2019s first 1,000 years, they were proclaimed by popular demand, but some estimates have the number exceeding 10,000."

      "Informally known as \u201cGod\u2019s influencer\u201d Carlo was just 15 when he died of acute promyelocytic leukemia in Milan in 2006 and has two miracles attributed to him by the Catholic Church. Being made a saint means the church believes a person lived a holy life and is now in heaven with God.",
      "But in an interview with NBC News, his mother, Antonia Salzano, 58, said that in many ways, her son was just like any other teenager who liked playing video games, hanging out with his friends and playing soccer.",
      "\u201cHe was a normal kid, he was a normal person, but he opened the door of his heart to God,\u201d she said earlier this year.",
      "Carlo was born in London, where his father, Andrea Acutis, 61, was working as a merchant banker, but the family moved back to Milan when he was young. Salzano said that from an early age, Carlo \u201cwas always generous with his things.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I wanted to buy, for example, two pairs of shoes, he used to say, \u2018No, one is sufficient because there are people who are starving who don\u2019t have anything to eat. So we don\u2019t have to waste money. Let\u2019s help other people.\u2019\u201d",
      "Carlo was put on the path toward sainthood after the late Pope Francis approved a miracle attributed to him in 2020, declaring him \u201cblessed\u201d and crediting him with healing Matheus Vianna, a 7-year-old boy from Brazil who recovered from a rare pancreatic disorder after coming into contact with one of Carlo\u2019s T-shirts.",
      "That path was further paved last year when a second miracle was attributed to Carlo, in which he was credited with the complete healing of Costa Rican student Valeria Valverde from major head trauma sustained in a bicycle accident, after her mother prayed at his tomb.",
      "But from an early age, Salzano said, he taught himself how to program computers and was asking her to buy books trained engineers might use. \u201cHe had a special skill, probably something unbelievable. I couldn\u2019t understand how it would be so. But he used what he had in the heart, the love of God, to maximize for spreading the faith,\u201d she added.",
      "Using the family\u2019s small, old computer, Carlo taught himself how to program and built a website cataloging more than 100 Eucharistic miracles around the world that had been recognized by the church over many centuries.",
      "But while programming was his passion, Salzano said, she thought he would likely have become a priest, as he had asked her about pursuing a career in the church. After receiving his First Communion at the age of 7, he attended daily Mass regularly and taught catechism in a local parish.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to help people to discover their faith, to discover God, the love of God. And all his life was spent for this. Even if he lived a normal life, like young boys of his age,\u201d she added.",
      "At just 15 years old, in October 2006, he fell ill and within 10 days died of acute promyelocytic leukemia.",
      "While his suffering caused her a lot of pain, Salzano said, \u201cif we leave suffering, offering to God, we can be in a certain way a little savior, like Jesus, we can help other people with our prayers.\u201d",
      "While she misses her son, she added that she had faith and knew \u201cthat death is to say goodbye, not the end of everything. But death, as Carlo used to say, is the start of the true life.\u201d",
      "In 2018, Carlo was named \u201cvenerable\u201d after the church recognized his virtuous life, and his body was taken to a shrine in the Santuario della Spogliazione in the small town of Assisi in central Italy.",
      "He asked for that to be his final resting place because of his devotion to the medieval saint St. Francis, whose hometown was Assisi. Wearing a track top, jeans and sneakers, he lies there entombed with a wax mold of his likeness placed over his body.",
      "Today it is a popular devotional site, attracting thousands of worshippers every day, Monsignor Anthony Figueiredo said in an interview earlier this year.",
      "\u201cThis is a saint in front of our eyes, and he\u2019s a different kind of saint, you can see with jeans and sneakers and a hoodie exactly as he dressed,\u201d he said, adding that Carlo had been inspired by Apple founder Steve Jobs, who had said that at the end of each day, he had wanted to know he had \u201cdone something wonderful for someone else.\u201d",

      "A sea of agents from HSI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies showed up Thursday to a construction site in the town of Ellabell, where the South Korean companies Hyundai and LG Energy Solution are jointly building a battery plant next to their manufacturing facility for electric vehicles.",
      "Videos on social media showed agents lining up hundreds of workers at the construction site. Schrank said they questioned everyone about their immigration status, reviewing their documents and conducting background checks.",
      "\"This was not a immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses. This has been a multimonth criminal investigation,\" Schranck said.",
      "No criminal charges in connection to the investigation had been filed as of Friday.",
      "On Friday afternoon, a judge in the Southern District Court of Georgia unsealed the 15-page search warrant allowing federal agents to go into \u201cthe lithium battery cell manufacturing plant\u201d on the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America campus \u201cthat is currently under construction.\u201d",
      "The warrant authorized federal agents to seize employment records and immigration documents as well as ownership and management records related to the construction site.",
      "According to the warrant, authorities were also looking for four individuals, but the reasons why the federal government was specifically interested in them remain under seal.",
      "U.S. Attorney Margaret E. Heap said in a statement that more than 400 agents participated in the massive enforcement action, part of the broader nationwide initiative \u201cOperation Take Back America,\u201d described as an effort \u201cto repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations.\u201d",

      "Lee added that an on-site task force will be established in Georgia with the help of the South Korean consulate in Atlanta.",
      "According to Schrank, the workers arrested at the construction site were employed by a network of various contractors and subcontractors, which investigators are looking into.",

      "Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration attorney representing two of the detained South Korean nationals, told NBC News that his clients were in the U.S. on the Visa Waiver Program, which permits tourism or business stays of up to 90 days.",
      "\"I\u2019m convinced neither of these guys are violating their status in any way,\u201d Kuck said, adding that both of his clients are process engineers who came over for meetings related to the construction of the new plant.",
      "\u201cOne had gotten here Tuesday and was going home next week,\u201d Kuck said. \u201cHe was on site that morning, literally sitting in a conference room in his shirt and tie with a vest on from the company, waiting for a meeting, doing exactly what he\u2019s allowed to do under a visa waiver.\u201d",
      "South Korea, the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy, is a major automotive and electronics manufacturer whose companies have multiple plants in the United States. In July, Seoul pledged $350 billion in U.S. investment in an effort to lower Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs on its products, which he ended up setting at 15%.",
      "In March, Hyundai said it would invest $21 billion in U.S. onshoring from 2025 to 2028, a number it said last month had increased to $26 billion.",

      "Hyundai's electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Georgia, where the raided construction site stands, is one of the largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites in the state.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials have said that the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,400 people, is the largest economic development project in the state\u2019s history.",
      "Hyundai, South Korea\u2019s biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles there about a year ago. The company recently partnered with LG Energy Solution to build the adjacent battery plant, expected to open next year, where the immigration raid took place."

    "summary": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party deputy Angela Rayner resigned Friday after admitting underpaying property taxes.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Somehow, it keeps getting worse for Keir Starmer.",
      "The British Prime Minister was already in the mire: His economy is barely growing, ascendant critics assail him from the left and right, and his popularity has tanked to historic levels just a year after a landslide victory.",
      "And on Friday Starmer suffered perhaps his most significant setback yet when his influential deputy resigned after admitting she underpaid 40,000 pounds (around $54,000) in property taxes.",
      "Angela Rayner, 45, has not always agreed with Starmer but has been a key figure in his Labour Party, seen as a counterweight voice for its disgruntled left-wing against their leader's centrist conservatism.",
      "After months of press speculation, Rayner admitted this week that she failed to pay enough property taxes \u2014 known as \u201cstamp duty.\u201d She said she believed she had followed the rules, and was tripped up by her \u201ccomplex living arrangements,\u201d including her 2023 divorce and son with special educational needs.",
      "All this played out while she served as the government\u2019s housing secretary as well as its deputy leader.",
      "She referred herself to the independent adviser on ministerial standards, Laurie Magnus, who acts as a watchdog appointed by the prime minister. Rayner promptly resigned her role as deputy prime minister and housing minister after his report was delivered Friday.",
      "\"I take full responsibility for this error,\" she said in a letter to Starmer, accepting she \"did not meet the highest standards in relation to my recent property purchase.\"",
      "She said that while \"it was never my intention to do anything other than pay the right amount,\" she \"must also consider the significant toll that the ongoing pressure of the media is taking on my family.\"",
      "Magnus' report agreed that Rayner had acted \"in good faith,\" believing that she was paying the correct amount of tax during the purchase of her 800,000 pound seaside apartment in Hove, on the south coast of England, in May. However he said that Rayner broke the Ministerial Code (a set of rules and standards for people in the government to follow) because she did not follow her solicitors' advice to seek specific tax guidance.",
      "Had she done so, Magnus said, she would have known the correct amount was 70,000 pounds rather than the 30,000 she paid.",
      "\"I believe Ms. Rayner has acted with integrity and with a dedicated and exemplary commitment to public service,\" he said.  But he faulted her \"unfortunate failure\" to pay her taxes correctly, particularly given she was minister for housing at the time.",
      "Tax experts say Rayner will likely now face a fine of up to 12,000 pounds from His Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs, Britain\u2019s tax authority.",
      "Starmer under pressure",
      "In a handwritten note, Starmer said he was \"very sad\" that Rayner's tenure had \"ended in this way,\" but said it was \"right\" that she had acted on the conclusion of her ethics report despite knowing it was \"very painful\" for her.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition Conservative Party, reacted to her resignation by accusing Starmer of having \"no principle, no backbone\" and saying that \"questions remain\" about what he knew, and when.",
      "Just 14 months ago, Starmer won a historic landslide victory against a Conservative Party whose 14-year rule had ended in scandal and widespread public disdain. But polls suggested that his victory owed as much to his opponent\u2019s toxic image as any ringing enthusiasm for his own platform.",
      "Whereas his predecessor as party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, had sought to take Labour back to its leftist roots, Starmer was more in the mold of Tony Blair: relatively progressive social values mixed with economic conservatism that critics say departed little from his right-wing opponents.",
      "That alleged caution has been met with opposition from multiple sides.",
      "Many on the left see him as maddeningly unimaginative in the face of a long-term economic malaise that they say requires radical, progressive action. And the right see him as too soft on immigration, most notably the \u201csmall boats\u201d crisis that continues to see tens of thousands of asylum seekers cross the English Channel each year.",
      "Immigration is now the top priority for voters, polls show, and opinion surveys are now led by Nigel Farage, the friend and ally of American President Donald Trump, who leads the Reform political party.",
      "If he becomes prime minister after the next election scheduled for 2029, Farage has promised to enact a mass deportation scheme removing 600,000 undocumented migrants from Britain.",
      "A teenage mother who grew up in socialized housing in the northern town of Stockport, Rayner is widely seen as holding an everyman touch that resonated with voters in a way Starmer never has.",
      "She was viewed as a vital weapon in Labour\u2019s defense against the rising working-class anger being so successfully harnessed by Farage \u2014 and therefore her exit represents a powerful loss for the government.",
      "Rayner\u2019s departure is doubly significant because she also quit from the role of deputy party leader, which is chosen by the party members, rather than Starmer himself.",
      "This means a more outspoken left-wing lawmaker could be voted into the role \u2014 increasing the pressure on Starmer to veer left in search of a solution."
