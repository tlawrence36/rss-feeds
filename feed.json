      "Miles Mykkanen has come a long way since his musical theater dreams shifted to opera at Juilliard",
      "NEW YORK -- Miles Mykkanen grew up wanting to sing and dance on Broadway, but he was turned down by the musical theater programs he applied to for college. So he had to \u201csettle\u201d for studying opera at the Juilliard School at Lincoln Center.",
      "\u201cAt 18, when your sights are set on 42nd Street and then you\u2019re getting called to 65th Street, it was weirdly a letdown,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut after a few hours I kind of slapped myself and said \u2018Miles, pull yourself together.\u2019\u201d",
      "That was 16 years ago, and he has since pulled himself together to such an extent that at age 34 he\u2019s just opened the Metropolitan Opera season in a leading role in a new opera, \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.\u201d",
      "With a libretto by Gene Scheer and score by Mason Bates, the opera is based on the novel by Michael Chabon. Mykkanen portrays Sammy Clay, a Jewish kid growing up in World War II-era Brooklyn who teams with his cousin, Czech refugee Joe Kavalier, to create a comic strip hero modeled on Superman.",
      "He\u2019ll also be back at the Met in the spring in another modern opera, Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho\u2019s \u201cInnocence.\u201d He plays the Bridegroom, a part he first sang in 2024 when San Francisco Opera gave the work\u2019s U.S. premiere.",
      "Mykkanen had sung at the Met before, mostly attracting little attention in small parts, though his haunting rendition of the Holy Fool in Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cBoris Godunov\u201d in 2021 drew critical acclaim.",
      "\u201cBut this season is so ideal,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cAll of a sudden my schedule came together, and I thought, my God, where did this all come from.\u201d",
      "When the Met was casting \u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d it was Michael Heaston, the artistic administrator, who thought of Mykkanen for the role of Sammy.",
      "\u201cI first became acquainted with Miles when he was still a student at Juilliard, and he immediately impressed me,\u201d Heaston said. \u201cHe is a singer who can straddle genres, that rare artist who can sing a heartfelt operatic aria in one moment and then turn on a dime to a classic tune from the American Songbook.",
      "\u201cWhen I looked at Mason\u2019s score and considered the vocal and acting demands alike, it seemed tailor-made for Miles.\u201d",
      "Mary Birnbaum, who taught Mykkanen acting at Juilliard, said she\u2019s not surprised at his sudden rise to prominence.",
      "\u201cHonestly it\u2019s what I thought he would do all along,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very American sound, and it\u2019s appealing and it\u2019s lush. But also he\u2019s bold as an actor \u2026 and he makes material look better for being in it.\u201d",

      "By coincidence, both his roles this season are people who have something to hide. \u201cThey are characters with two huge secrets that are kind of gnawing away at them,\u201d Mykkanen said.",
      "In Sammy\u2019s case, it\u2019s his sexuality and ambivalence about his attraction to actor Perry Bacon.",
      "\u201cAs a gay man myself, it\u2019s been really rewarding for me to be working on this role, thinking back to my coming out process 20 years ago now,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cSammy wants to believe there\u2019s a future for him, but he keeps struggling and wondering if the world will ever get past its prejudice and accept him.\u201d",
      "\u201cInnocence\u201d deals with the lingering effects of a school shooting 10 years later, and as secrets are peeled away, the Bridegroom\u2019s role in the horrific events is gradually exposed.",
      "Mykkanen relishes the very different musical challenges the two roles provide. Saariaho\u2019s score for \u201cInnocence,\u201d he said is composed with a kind of \u201cmathematical\u201d precision. \u201cWhen I first cracked it open, it was overwhelming because of the time signatures, the key signatures. You\u2019re trying to figure out, what was she thinking, how do you put this all together?\u201d",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d written in a style that uses what Bates calls \u201csymphonic electronica,\u201d has been easier to learn. \u201cI almost feel it\u2019s starting to carve a new genre in opera,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cSomething American opera has been trying to find in the last decade or so. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to stay to say it\u2019s musical theater, but at times it\u2019s very colloquial.\u201d",
      "Mykkanen grew up in the remote Ironwood region of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, where both his parents were high school band directors. Though he displayed a talent for singing at a young age, it was show music rather than opera that inspired him. When his parents found him a classical voice teacher, \u201cFor me it was a means to an end, to develop my voice so I could sing on the Broadway stage.\u201d",
      "Though his career now takes him all over the U.S. and to Europe, Mykkanen still calls the Ironwood region home. In 2019, he launched an arts festival called Emberlight that has grown into a two-month summer program of live performance, film, art shows and talkbacks with visiting artists. When he\u2019s not on site he handles logistics remotely and also relies heavily on volunteers.",
      "\u201cJust being the person who with a lot of other people behind me brings art to this region which is rural and remote \u2026 It\u2019s been one of the big blessings of my life,\u201d he said.",
      "And when he isn\u2019t performing, he returns. \u201cI have a room in my parents\u2019 basement where I store my stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m between contracts I come back here and stay with my mom and dad. \u2026 I\u2019lll call them from Amsterdam and say \u2018OK, what are we having for dinner next Tuesday when I land.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay\u201d runs through Oct. 11. Also starring are baritone Andrzej Filo\u0144czyk as Joe; soprano Lauren Snouffer as his sister, Sarah; soprano Sun-Ly Pierce as Rosa Saks, and baritone Edward Nelson as Perry Bacon. Met music director Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin conducts the production directed by Bartlett Sher.",

      "The box office success of \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which was shot entirely on large-format film ( a combination of 70mm and IMAX ), and made over $976 million worldwide made many in the industry reconsider the mass audience appeal of a format that not too long ago was in danger of extinction. Just over a decade ago, facing bankruptcy and an industry that seemed to be migrating to digital, Kodak nearly stopped film production. Filmmakers like Nolan, Martin Scorsese and others rallied to keep it going. Earlier this year, Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners\u201d helped prove the point again.",
      "Nolan will take over for outgoing president Lesli Linka Glatter, who led the group for four years through the Hollywood strikes of 2023. He said he looks forward to collaborating with Glatter and the board \u201cto achieve important creative and economic protections for our members.\u201d",

      "The North American box office has slowed down after a strong September.",
      "Neither a Jordan Peele-produced horror nor a Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell romantic drama were enough to continue the September hot streak at the movies. After back-to-back weekends that had films majorly overperforming, first \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rights\u201d followed by the anime \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Infinity Castle,\u201d the North American box office slowed significantly.",
      "Overall ticket sales were down nearly 50% from last weekend, with the holdover champion \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d edging out the newcomer \u201cHim\u201d for first place, according to studio estimates Sunday. Crunchyroll and Sony Pictures\u2019 \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d added $17.3 million over the weekend, bringing its total to $104.7 million, which makes it the highest grossing anime film ever in North America.",
      "The football horror \u201cHim\u201d opened in second place with an estimated $13.5 million in ticket sales. Universal Pictures opened \u201cHim\u201d in 3,168 North American theaters, where the audience was 52% male and 65% over the age of 25. Internationally, it earned $400,000.",
      "Produced by Peele\u2019s Monkeypaw and directed by Justin Tipping, \u201cHim\u201d is about a promising young quarterback (Tyriq Withers) who is invited to train with a veteran (Marlon Wayans) at an isolated compound.",
      "\u201cHim\u201d scored with neither critics (it carries a 29% on Rotten Tomatoes) nor audiences, who gave the film a C- CinemaScore. In his review for The Associated Press, film writer Jake Coyle wrote that the film \u201cwas made with the potent premise of bringing the kind of dark, satirical perspective that characterizes a Monkeypaw production to our violent national pastime. But that promise gets fumbled in an allegorical chamber play that grows increasingly tedious.\u201d",
      "\u201cHim\u201d was also nearly upstaged by another horror, \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rights,\u201d which made an estimated $13 million in its third weekend. With a global total of $400 million, it\u2019s now the biggest film in the Conjuring universe.",
      "They are two of three horror movies in this weekend's top 10, including \u201cWeapons.\u201d According to data firm Comscore, this year that genre alone has generated $1.1 billion in domestic box office receipts, just several million short of the 2017 record driven by \u201cIt\u201d and \u201cGet Out.\u201d",
      "\u201cHorror movies have been on a bit of a hot streak,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore's head of marketplace trends. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a record-breaking year.\u201d",
      "In addition to \u201cDemon Slayer,\u201d Sony had a new film this weekend as well: The original romance \u201cA Big Bold Beautiful Journey,\u201d starring Robbie and Farrell, but that fizzled with audiences, earning only $3.5 million from 3,300 locations. It also received largely negative reviews and currently has a 37% on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cAudiences are selective in what they want to see,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cNegative reviews can create really strong headwinds for original films with no brand recognition.\u201d",
      "In its second weekend, \u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale\u201d added another $6.3 million, bringing its running total to $31.6 million. The Stephen King adaptation \u201cThe Long Walk\u201d is also estimating $6.3 million in weekend two, down only 46% from its opening. Its domestic total of $22.7 million has already exceeded its production budget of $20 million (though that sum does not account for marketing and promotion).",
      "Ron Howard\u2019s 1995 hit \u201cApollo 13\u201d played in 200 theaters this weekend for its 30th anniversary as well. It made an estimated $600,000. The 30th anniversary re-release of \u201cToy Story,\u201d now in its second weekend, added $1.4 million.",
      "Next weekend there is excitement surrounding the new Paul Thomas Anderson film \u201cOne Battle After Another,\" although his biggest hit to date remains the 2007 film \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d which made just over $76 million worldwide, not accounting for inflation.",

      "Kamala Harris shares her candid reflections in her new book, \"107 Days,\" about her 2024 presidential campaign against Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- When it was all over, Kamala Harris couldn't believe it. \u201cI could barely breathe,\u201d she writes in her new book about learning she had lost the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump.",
      "One of her aides peeled \u201cMadame President\u201d off celebratory cupcakes before serving them to crushed staffers. Harris kept asking, \u201cMy God, my God, what will happen to our country?\"",
      "The next morning was no easier. \u201cI was ashamed to realize I was in the denial and bargaining stages of grief, a very long way from acceptance,\u201d she wrote.",
      "It's one of several raw admissions in Harris' book, \u201c107 Days,\u201d that is scheduled for release Tuesday. The title refers to the length of the hyperspeed campaign that the former vice president launched against Trump after Joe Biden dropped out of the race.",
      "Although Harris earned a reputation as guarded and circumspect, the book has the tone of someone who is finished biting her tongue. She concedes mistakes, reveals frustrations and details some of the stranger moments from her race.",
      "The book isn't a winding memoir or a political treatise, and Harris doesn't disclose any future plans. Instead, it reads like a ticking time bomb, with each chapter counting down to Election Day.",
      "Here's some memorable moments.",
      "Harris insists in the book that she had no concerns about Biden's ability to serve as president. \u201cIf I believed that, I would have said so.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut at eighty-one, Joe got tired,\" Harris wrote. \"That's when his age showed in physical and verbal stumbles.\u201d",
      "Harris wrote that Biden's inner circle \u201cshould have realized that any campaign was a bridge too far.\" However, \u201cit seemed that the worse things got, the more they pushed him.\u201d",
      "The tenuous situation unraveled when Biden and Trump faced off with each other. \u201cAs soon as he walked onto the debate stage in Atlanta, I could see he wasn't right,\" Harris wrote.",
      "Biden's team appeared to be in denial. Afterward, they gave Harris talking points that said \u201cJOE BIDEN WON.\"",
      "Harris wrote warmly of her partnership with Biden, but there were frosty moments too. As Biden faced calls to drop out of the race, he invited Harris to join him for a Fourth of July celebration at the White House.",
      "First lady Jill Biden pulled Harris' husband Doug Emhoff aside. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you supporting us?\u201d",
      "Later, in private, Emhoff erupted in anger. \u201cThey have to ask if we\u2019re loyal?\u201d",
      "Another difficult episode came after Harris had replaced Biden at the top of the ticket and was preparing for her own debate with Trump.",
      "Shortly before she took the stage, Biden called to say he heard from his brother that Harris had been badmouthing him, upsetting some power brokers in Philadelphia. Then he rambled about his own debate performances while Harris was \u201cbarely listening.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just couldn't understand why he would call me, right now, and make it all about himself,\" she wrote.",

      "Harris admits some mistakes of her own, particularly a damaging appearance on \u201cThe View\u201d talk show. When one of the hosts asked what she would have done differently than Biden during the previous four years, Harris blanked on the talking points she had prepared and simply said, \u201cThere is not a thing that comes to mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cI had no idea I\u2019d just pulled the pin on a hand grenade,\" Harris writes. Around the studio, \u201cmy staff were besides themselves\u201d about how she had just given a \u201cgift to the Trump campaign.\u201d",
      "Harris wrote that she didn't want to criticize Biden or litigate any of the areas where they disagreed. But she also didn't understand how much her association with the president was holding back her candidacy.",
      "David Plouffe, a senior adviser, told Harris bluntly that \"people hate Joe Biden.\u201d",
      "There's plenty of grist in the book that could make the next Democratic convention a little more awkward.",
      "Harris wrote that Pete Buttigieg, Biden's transportation secretary and a former mayor from Indiana, was her first choice to be her running mate. He's also gay, and Harris thought it was \u201ctoo big of a risk\u201d to pick him while already asking voters to accept a Black woman as president.",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was another possibility. But Harris \u201chad a nagging concern that he would be unable to settle for a role as number two and that it would wear on our partnership.\u201d",
      "She ended up going with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, but his debate performance against JD Vance left her yelling at the television screen. \u201cYou're not there to make friends with the guy who is attacking your running mate,\u201d she said.",
      "There's only one reference to California Gov. Gavin Newsom in the book. When Harris reached out to him after Biden ended his reelection campaign, he texted, \u201cHiking. Will call back,\" but he never did.",
      "Harris' brother-in-law is Tony West, a former top Justice Department official and member of her inner circle of political advisers. While Harris was serving as vice president, West put together what was known as the \u201cRed File,\u201d a collection of plans in case something happened to Biden.",
      "West argued that it would be foolish not to prepare. Harris writes that she \u201cdidn't want to dwell on such an eventuality\u201d and \u201cI left it in his hands.\u201d",
      "He kept refreshing the document as people pressured Biden to drop out, which came in handy when Biden finally pulled the plug on his reelection campaign.",
      "Harris writes that Biden was planning to wait a day before endorsing her as his successor, an idea that horrified her.",
      "\u201cIf you want to put me in the strongest position, you have to endorse me now,\" she recalled telling him. Harris prevailed, and the endorsement happened shortly after Biden announced that he was done.",
      "Campaigns can be hallucinatory affairs, and this one was full of bizarre moments.",
      "Harris writes that she warmed up for her convention speech with a professional voice coach who \u201cwanted me to stand there and emit animal noises.\u201d A little hesitant, Harris got her entire team to make \u201chums, grunts and trills\" with her.",
      "Harris also writes about talking with Trump after a second assassination attempt against him. Despite tearing into her on the campaign trail, Trump proceeded to flatter his opponent.",
      "\u201cHow do I say bad things about you now?\u201d he said. \u201cI'm going to tone it down. I will. You're going to see.\u201d Then Trump said that his daughter Ivanka \u201cis your big fan.\u201d",
      "When the call was over, Harris was left marveling at Trump's ability to turn on the charm. \u201cHe's a con man,\u201d she thought. \u201cHe's really good at it.\u201d",

      "MILAN -- MILAN (AP) \u2014 Italian rapper Fedez has apologized for publishing musical lyrics saying that tennis player Jannik Sinner speaks with \u201cAdolf Hitler\u2019s accent,\u201d which prompted the musician to be accused of inciting racial hatred.",
      "Fedez recently posted an Instagram story featuring lyrics of a new song that said in Italian: \u201cItalian has a new idol named Jannik Sinner. Pure-blooded Italian with Adolf Hitler\u2019s accent.\u201d",
      "A city council member in Bolzano \u2014 the capital of the German-speaking autonomous province of Alto Adige in northern Italy where Sinner is from \u2014 on Thursday filed a formal complaint with prosecutors over Fedez\u2019s lyrics based on an article in Italy\u2019s penal code that sanctions incitement of racial hatred and propaganda.",

      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to pull it off and all I can do is apologize,\u201d Fedez added. \u201cIf something like this isn\u2019t understood, it\u2019s because of a mistake made by whoever wrote it. So I take responsibility.\u201d",
      "The reference to \u201cpure-blooded Italian\u201d recalls Italian fascist propaganda from the 1930s, according to Giuseppe Martucci, the city council member, who added that the reference to Hitler was unacceptable.",

      "Curtis, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Crickets in 2012, died Friday, his wife of more than a half-century, Louise Curtis, confirmed to The Associated Press. His daughter, Sarah Curtis, wrote on his Facebook page that he had been suddenly ill.",
      "Curtis wrote or co-wrote hundreds of songs, from Keith Whitley's country smash \u201cI'm No Stranger to the Rain\u201d to the Everly Brothers' \u201cWalk Right Back,\u201d a personal favorite Curtis completed while in Army basic training. Bing Crosby, Glen Campbell, Bruce Springsteen and the Grateful Dead were among other artists who covered his work.",
      "Born during the Great Depression to cotton farmers outside of Meadow, Texas, Curtis was a childhood friend of Buddy Holly's and an active musician in the formative years of rock, whether jamming on guitar with Holly in the mid-1950s or opening for Elvis Presley when Elvis was still a regional act. Curtis' songwriting touch also soon emerged: Before he turned 20, he had written the hit \u201cSomeday\u201d for Webb Pierce and \u201cRock Around With Ollie Vee\u201d for Holly.",
      "Curtis had left Holly's group, the Crickets, before Holly became a major star. But he returned after Holly died in a plane crash in 1959 and he was featured the following year on the album \u201cIn Style with the Crickets,\u201d which included \u201cI Fought the Law\u201d (dashed off in a single afternoon, according to Curtis, who would say he had no direct inspiration for the song) and the Jerry Allison collaboration \u201cMore Than I Can Say,\u201d a hit for Bobby Vee, and later for Leo Sayer.",
      "Meanwhile, it took until 1966 for \u201cI Fought the Law\u201d and its now-immortal refrain \u201cI fought the law \u2014 and the law won\u201d to catch on: The Texas-based Bobby Fuller Four made it a Top 10 song. Over the following decades, it was covered by dozens of artists, from punk (the Clash) to country (Johnny Cash, Nanci Griffith) to Springsteen, Tom Petty and other mainstream rock stars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my most important copyright,\u201d Curtis told The Tennessean in 2014.",
      "Curtis' other signature song was as uplifting as \u201cI Fought the Law\u201d was resigned. In 1970, he was writing commercial jingles when he came up with the theme for a new CBS sitcom starring Moore as a single woman hired as a TV producer in Minneapolis. He called the song \u201cLove is All Around,\u201d and used a smooth melody to eventually serve up lyrics as indelible as any in television history:",
      "\u201cWho can turn the world on with her smile? / Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile? / Well it's you girl, and you should know it / With each glance and every little movement you show it.\u201d",
      "The song's endurance was sealed by the images it was heard over, especially Moore's triumphant toss of her hat as Curtis proclaims, \u201cYou're going to make it after all.\u201d In tribute, other artists began recording it, including Sammy Davis Jr., Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and Minnesota's H\u00fcsker D\u00fc. A commercial release featuring Curtis came out in 1980 and was a modest success, peaking at No. 29 on Billboard's country chart.",
      "Curtis would recall being commissioned by his friend Doug Gilmore, a music industry road manager who had heard the sitcom's developers were looking for an opening song.",

Brooks.",
      "\u201cJames L. Brooks came into this huge empty room, no furniture apart from a phone lying on the floor, and at first, I thought he was rather cold and sort of distant, and he said 'We're not at the stage of picking a song yet, but I'll listen anyway,'\u201d Curtis recalled. \u201cSo I played the song, just me and my guitar, and next thing, he started phoning people, and the room filled up, and then he sent out for a tape recorder.\u201d",
      "Curtis would eventually write two versions: the first used in Season 1, the second and better known for the remaining six seasons. The original words were more tentative, opening with \u201cHow will you make it on your own?\u201d and ending with \u201cYou might just make it after all.\u201d By Season 2, the show was a hit and the lyrics were reworked. The producers had wanted Andy Williams to sing the theme song, but he turned it down and Curtis' easygoing baritone was heard instead.",
      "Curtis made a handful of solo albums, including \u201cSonny Curtis\u201d and \u201cSpectrum,\u201d and hit the country Top 20 with the 1981 single \u201cGood Ol' Girls.\u201d In later years, he continued to play with Allison and other members of the Crickets. The band released several albums, among them \u201cThe Crickets and Their Buddies,\u201d featuring appearances by Eric Clapton, Graham Nash and Phil Everly. One of Curtis' more notable songs was \u201cThe Real Buddy Holly Story,\u201d a rebuke to the 1978 biopic \u201cThe Buddy Holly Story,\u201d which starred Gary Busey.",
      "Curtis settled in Nashville in the mid-1970s and lived there with his wife, Louise. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1991 and, as part of the Crickets, into Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007. Five years later, he and the Crickets were inducted into the Rock Hall, praised as \u201cthe blueprint for rock and roll bands (that) inspired thousands of kids to start up garage bands around the world.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Born during the Great Depression with sun-kissed California looks, Robert Redford never failed to epitomize something quintessential and hopeful about the American character.",
      "Redford, who died Tuesday at the age of 89, left a movie trail etched into land. He seemed to reside as much across the American landscape as he did on movie screens. He was in the Rocky Mountains of \u201cJeremiah Johnson,\u201d the Wyoming grasslands of \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\u201d the Washington, D.C., alleyways of \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d and the Montana streams of \u201cA River Runs Through It.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the time I was just a kid, I was always trying to break free of the bounds that I was stuck with, and always wanted to go outside,\u201d Redford told The Associated Press in 2018.",
      "Redford, a movie-star paragon, was surely savvy with how he played with and used his all-American image. No one who starred in the baseball drama \u201cThe Natural\u201d (1984) and gave Bernard Malamud\u2019s novel a storybook ending couldn't have some sense of self-mythology. But it was one of Redford\u2019s greatest feats that, despite his fame, he remained innately connected to some aspirational American ideal. Redford, an open-air actor of easy, rugged charm, evoked the kind of regular guy decency that stars like Jimmy Stewart did before him \u2014 only Redford did it through an era of distrust and disillusionment.",
      "\u201cHe was to me a throwback to the actors that I was nuts about when I was growing up and going to movies: real, classical, traditional, old-fashioned movie stars who were very, very redolent of some kind of American essence,\u201d said Sydney Pollack, who directed Redford in \u201cJeremiah Johnson,\u201d \u201cThe Way We Were\u201d and \u201cThree Days of the Condor,\u201d in 1993. \u201cThey were very much a part of the American landscape and they were heroic in a kind of understated way.\u201d",
      "That was most true, perhaps, in Utah. Wanting to escape paved-over Los Angeles, Redford first began buying land there early in his career. In Utah, he would fight to protect both untrampled wilderness and a spirit of moviemaking that had grown increasingly difficult in Hollywood. As a longtime trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group, Redford was an outspoken environmentalist. In the 1970s, he successfully opposed a pair of rural Utah proposals: a six-lane highway and coal-fired power plant.",
      "In the Utah mountains, Redford also launched the Sundance Institute. Beyond Sundance's annual festival for independent film, the institute has been a lifeblood young filmmakers. Its year-round laboratory \u2014 the part of Sundance that Redford was most proud of \u2014 has helped nurture some of the most vital voices in American cinema for decades.",
      "\u201cFor me, the word to be underscored is \u2018independence,\u2019\u201d Redford once said of his legacy. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed in that word. That\u2019s what led to me eventually wanting to create a category that supported independent artists who weren\u2019t given a chance to be heard. The industry was pretty well controlled by the mainstream, which I was a part of. But I saw other stories out there that weren\u2019t having a chance to be told.\u201d",
      "That spirit of independence often infused his films, too. When Redford wanted to make \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d the seminal 1976 film directed by Alan Pakula about Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein\u2019s Watergate investigation, few in the film industry thought there was much drama to be found in a story that was then several years old.",
      "\u201cNixon had already resigned, and the held opinion (in Hollywood) was \u2018No one cares. No one wants to hear about this,\u2019\u201d Redford, who also co-produced the film, said in 2006. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018No, it\u2019s not about Nixon. It\u2019s about something else. It\u2019s about investigative journalism and hard work.\u2019\u201d",
      "If \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d one of the greatest newspaper movies, detailed the hard-earned revelations of Watergate, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d \u2014 one of the greatest political thrillers \u2014 captured the paranoia and disillusionment that followed. If anyone was completely unfamiliar with why Redford was so good, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d would be a good place to start.",

No one has ever been better at playing the regular guy trying to think fast on his feet, and make sense of an ever-darker world.",
      "Though some called for him to, Redford never entered politics, himself. He remained outspoken \u2014 he's in some way the model for the modern Hollywood activist \u2014 on a wide range of issues, including Indigenous and LGBTQ+ rights. The closest he came to running for office was Michael Ritchie's 1972 satire \u201cThe Candidate,\u201d in which Redford played an idealistic lawyer enlisted to challenge a highly favored incumbent Republican senator. Redford\u2019s candidate ultimately wins, but not without sacrificing his principles and seeing much of what he stands for diluted.",
      "Redford\u2019s place, instead, was outside politics. The perfect bookend to his \u201970s movies is \u201cSneakers,\u201d Phil Alden Robinson\u2019s absurdly underrated 1992 caper starring Redford as a former \u201960s radical now living under a false moniker and leading a band of security specialists. They stumble into possession of a computer device that brings the attention of the NSA, CIA, FBI and many others, forcing Redford to, yet again, try to figure out what\u2019s moral in a dangerous (and now newly digital) America.",
      "The world that Redford\u2019s films often presciently depicted seemed to push him further into the wilderness, on screen and off. He largely retreated into retirement over the last decade. When Redford died, he was at his home in the Utah mountains, outside Provo. One of his last films was 2015's \u201cA Walk in the Woods,\u201d playing Bill Bryson ambling along the Appalachian Trail.",
      "The most fitting and elegiac swan song, though was J.C. Chandor\u2019s \u201cAll Is Lost,\u201d a near-wordless 2013 drama about an old man at sea. Redford plays a solo mariner whose sailboat collides with a shipping container. Though terse, the movie reverberates with economic and ecological metaphor. A visibly older and weathered Redford \u2014 no longer the golden, freckled face of his youth \u2014 suffers through increasingly rough and stormy seas, improvising his survival.",
      "For an actor who had covered so much ground, \u201cAll Is Lost\u201d was one last frontier. Redford's unnamed character was credited only as \u201cOur Man.\u201d",

      "Robert Redford, who died Tuesday at 89, transformed the film industry with the Sundance Institute and Film Festival",
      "Robert Redford was disillusioned with the Hollywood mainstream. The Sundance Kid, who died Tuesday at age 89, knew that there were more stories out there, ones that weren\u2019t getting made into films because of the rigidity of the business. So he made something different, founding Sundance Institute and the Sundance Film Festival as an alternative avenue for emerging filmmakers, where independence was a virtue, not a liability.",
      "Over the past four decades, the institute and the festival have given an early platform to countless young filmmakers, including Steven Soderbergh, Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Ryan Coogler, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, Nicole Holofcener, Nia DaCosta, Taika Waititi, Ava DuVernay, Rian Johnson, Gina Prince-Bythewood, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert and many more.",
      "\u201cFor me, the word to be underscored is \u2018independence.\u2019 I\u2019ve always believed in that word. That\u2019s what led to me eventually wanting to create a category that supported independent artists who weren\u2019t given a chance to be heard,\u201d Redford told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe industry was pretty well controlled by the mainstream, which I was a part of. But I saw other stories out there that weren\u2019t having a chance to be told and I thought, \u2018Well, maybe I can commit my energies to giving those people a chance.\u2019 As I look back on it, I feel very good about that.\u201d",
      "In 2019, Redford said he intended to step back from his public facing role at the festival, though he remained the organization's president and founder until his death.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re at a point where I can move on to a different place, because the thing I\u2019ve missed over the years is being able to spend time with the films and with the filmmakers and to see their work and be part of their community,\u201d he said at the 2019 kickoff. \u201cI don\u2019t think the festival needs a whole lot of introduction now: It runs on its own course, and I\u2019m happy for that.\u201d",
      "Redford\u2019s love affair with Utah began much earlier, on a cross-country motorcycle road trip in 1961 when he bought 2 acres of land. By 1969, with more money in his pocket from his film successes, he\u2019d purchased 5,000 acres, some of which was a mountain resort but most of the land was for wilderness preserves. He named it Sundance, after his character in \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d",
      "In 1981, the year he won best picture and director for \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d he established the Sundance Institute, a nonprofit organization and held the first filmmakers lab at the Sundance Mountain Resort, about 13 miles northeast of Provo. A few years later, in 1985, the institute took over what was then known as the U.S. Film Festival, which would later be renamed the Sundance Film Festival. The festival in the mid-80s hosted the Coen brothers \u201cBlood Simple\u201d and Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u201cStranger Than Paradise.\u201d",
      "The festival was really put on the map when Soderbergh premiered \u201csex, lies and videotape\u201d in Park City in 1989. A true indie, the film went on to win the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes and get an Oscar nomination, but it was its box office success that ignited a veritable indie film boom. And Sundance was where all the discoveries were happening. In 1991, the festival premiered \u201cDaughters of the Dust,\u201d \u201cParis is Burning\u201d and \u201cSlacker,\u201d in 1992, Tarantino\u2019s \u201cReservoir Dogs,\u201d in 1993, Wes Anderson brought \u201cBottle Rocket,\u201d and in 1994 \u201cHoop Dreams\u201d and \u201cClerks.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Robert Redford, independent art houses might not have succeeded,\u201d said Gary Meyer, cofounder of Landmark Theatre, and a former festival director at Telluride who also worked with Redford. \u201cHaving the \u2018Sundance Kid\u2019 give his stamp of approval to independent features and documentaries brought audiences to our theaters, while helping launch the careers of dozens of filmmakers \u2026 He made it \u2018cool\u2019 to see adventurous movies when they came to commercial neighborhood theaters.\u201d",
      "In 1994, the Sundance Institute also made a commitment to Indigenous filmmakers by launching a festival program to showcase Native and Indigenous films that continues to this day.",
      "The festival might get the most headlines, but it\u2019s the year-round work of the Institute that has really left a mark on independent cinema. The screenwriting and directing labs have been just as, if not more, influential in helping to launch the first films of many of Hollywood\u2019s top filmmakers over the past 40 years, under the leadership of Michelle Satter, who has helped shepherd projects from \u201cHard Eight\u201d to \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d and \u201cLove & Basketball.\u201d",
      "\u201cSundance changed the trajectory of my career,\u201d filmmaker and labs adviser Gina Prince-Bythewood told the AP in 2023. \u201cHow many of these special projects would have never seen the light of day without Michelle, without Robert Redford\u2019s vision, without this incredible place? It\u2019s actually really scary to think about.\u201d",

      "Redford had worried for years that the festival had outgrown Park City, Utah. In 1996, an estimated 15,504 attended the festival. In 2015, the number had ballooned to 46,100. It peaked in 2018 with 124,900 festivalgoers. The festival estimated that the 2025 edition had 85,472 in-person attendees, a 17% increase from 2024.",

      "There were already plans in the works to celebrate the vision of Redford. In the wake of his death, that tribute will be even more deeply felt.",
      "Former Sundance director John Cooper, a close friend of Redford\u2019s who led the festival from 2009 to 2020, told The Associated Press in an interview earlier this year that he felt like his role was \u201cto be a keeper of the flame for Robert Redford and his legacy.\u201d Now, Cooper, the artistic director of Sonoma's True West Film Center who is still a regular presence at Sundance said, that mission is more important than ever. It\u2019s \u201ca lot to process, going from a legacy that was alive in him to one we have to carry on,\u201d Cooper told the AP. That legacy, he said, centers on spreading the power of storytelling.",

      "Anthony Roth Costanzo, who introduced $11 tickets to Opera Philadelphia, aims to surprise audiences again with the company\u2019s new season as it celebrates its 50th anniversary",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Anthony Roth Costanzo, the man who brought $11 opera tickets to Philadelphia, hopes to keep surprising audiences during the company\u2019s new season.",
      "\u201cIt is very much opera. It\u2019s dramatic, it\u2019s cathartic, it\u2019s collaborative in interdisciplinary ways,\u201d Costanzo said of Opera Philadelphia\u2019s 50th anniversary season \u2014 the first he\u2019s been able to plan since taking charge of the financially teetering company last year. \u201cBut it\u2019s different from what your perception of opera might be.\u201d",
      "He slated a work by Rossini to kick things off, with opening night set for Friday. But instead of choosing a repertory staple, Costanzo picked the less-familiar \u201cIl viaggio a Reims.\u201d And the production will be anything but traditional: Director Damiano Michieletto has changed the original setting from an inn to an art gallery where the portraits come alive and sing.",
      "After that the offerings become even more adventurous. There\u2019s a multimedia piece by playwright Sarah Ruhl set to music by Vivaldi \u2014 including \u201cThe Seasons\u201d \u2014 and starring Costanzo, who maintains a flourishing performing career as a countertenor. Then comes a world premiere with libretto by Pulitzer-winner Michael R. Jackson and a score by 10 different composers. Another new opera follows, by Gregory Spears, in which the chorus has the starring role. Finally, bass-baritone Dav\u00f3ne Tines performs a \u201cvaudevillian rendering\u201d of a poem by Langston Hughes.",
      "\u201cAs I put all of the pieces together, I thought, how can I encapsulate this in just a few simple words,\u201d Costanzo said. \u201cAnd what occurred to me was: \u2018Opera, but different.\u2019 And that is the slogan of the season.\u201d",
      "His pride in the lineup is understandable, especially given that when he took over it wasn\u2019t certain there would even be a 2025-26 season.",
      "The company was nearing bankruptcy and needed to quickly raise $4 million, he recalled.",
      "Almost immediately he instituted a \u201cpick your price\u201d policy under which people could buy tickets to any seat in the house starting at $11. (The website gives buyers a range of higher options and invites them to make a donation on top of the purchase. Season subscriptions at higher prices are also still available.)",
      "\u201cI said OK, I have to think like a venture capitalist,\u201d Costanzo said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to spend money to make money. Besides, he said, the old pricing system was projected to bring in only 8% of the revenue the company needed, so little was at risk from the new policy.",
      "The publicity and good will generated by the move helped the company quickly raise $7 million in donations, more than enough to retire the debt. When tickets went on sale for 2024-25, all three operas sold out within three weeks, and the season ended with a surplus of $2.4 million.",
      "Corrado Rovaris, the company\u2019s longtime music director, was on the podium for the season-opening performance last fall of Missy Mazzoli\u2019s \u201cThe Listeners,\u201d a recent work having its U.S. premiere.",
      "\u201cIt was amazing to see the reaction in the house,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBeautiful to see a full house but also to see such an enthusiastic house. Beautiful and very moving.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant idea,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause the tickets only cover a fraction of the cost of an opera. But the whole point is to spread good will, bring in new people, bring in young people, people who have never been to an opera. And good will is priceless.\u201d",
      "In a good portent for the growth of the company\u2019s audience, two-thirds of those who chose the \u201cpick your price option\u201d had never bought tickets to Opera Philadelphia before, and most were under 45 years old. This year a similar percentage are either first-timers or repeats from last season.",
      "As a result of the brighter financial outlook, the new season offers twice as many performances as last, though the budget is still substantially lower than it was in 2017, when the company launched an adventurous festival format that had several different works in performance over a period of two weeks.",
      "Just how did Costanzo settle on that $11 figure?",
      "\u201cAt first I thought it should be $25,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the problem is that everywhere across the country I see \u2018tickets starting at $25\u2026\u2019 and I thought people would see that and think, Oh, yeah, you can sit up in the top balcony.",
      "\u201cSo I wanted to really distinguish it, and I thought a round number was less sticky \u2026 you don\u2019t remember $15 or $10.\u201d",
      "Marc Scorca, president and CEO of Opera America, said he\u2019s watching the company\u2019s initiatives with great interest, but he cautions that it\u2019s too soon to predict long-term victory.",

      "\u201cI think the learning from it will be important not only to the company but to the field,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAnd that will probably not play out for another couple of years until we see how much of that audience becomes a bona fide public for the company or just took advantage of an opportunity to experiment with something at a low price.\u201d",

      "Major League Baseball has canceled plans to play games in London next season due to scheduling conflicts with West Ham's Olympic Stadium and TV commitments",
      "NEW YORK -- Major League Baseball has abandoned plans to play two games in London next season because of scheduling issues with West Ham's Olympic Stadium and the sport's television partner.",
      "MLB had hoped to have the New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays meet in London on June 13 and 14, but West Ham is home for its Premier League finale against Leeds on May 24. That left too little time to convert the field to baseball, and MLB was unable to schedule games there for later in June because Fox lacked available broadcast slots due to World Cup commitments.",
      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday after his question-and-answer session at Front Office Sports' \u201cTuned In\u201d event that the London games were definitely off.",
      "MLB played in London for the first time in 2019 when the New York Yankees swept two games from the Boston Red Sox. A planned two-game series between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs in 2020 was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, and series were split there by the Cardinals and Cubs in 2023 and the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies in 2024.",
      "MLB's labor contract included games in Paris for 2025 but they were called off because MLB and the players' association couldn't find a promoter.",
      "\u201cWe remain interested in Europe. We think London is an important jumping off point for us,\u201d Manfred said during his Q&A session. \u201cWe have a facility that has come a long way since the first Yankee-Red Sox game. It\u2019s a much better ballpark now than it was due to their willingness to make investments in that. We continue to believe that there\u2019s an opportunity there and that we can get at the developed economies in Europe through that London entree.\u201d",
      "Manfred said MLB is working on grassroots initiatives in India because of that nation's affinity for cricket.",
      "\u201cWe're really starting from the bottom up,\u201d he said.",
      "Mexico also is a priority. MLB played regular-season games at Monterrey in 1996, 1999, 2018 and 2019, and at Mexico City in 2023 and 2024. Arizona and San Diego are likely to play at Mexico City next April 25 and 26.",
      "\u201cWe have worked very hard to develop better relationships with the Mexican professional leagues,\" Manfred said. \"We think we can ultimately build those relationships in a way that they look like Japan and Korea: The domestic professional league thrives, but we have enough players coming to the U.S. to play that it drives our business here in the U.S.\u201d",
      "MLB has gained in the Asian market, especially in recent years because of Shohei Ohtani's following. MLB opened the season at Tokyo in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2019 and this year, and at Seoul, South Korea, in 2024.",
      "\u201cOur approach to international has always been country by country, largely because we find the places we\u2019re interested in to be in different stages of development,\u201d Manfred said. \"With respect to Japan and Korea, we made investments there. We monetarily, and players, in terms of the sweat equity involved, of making the trip to Tokyo to open the season, making the trip to Seoul to open the season, that we have started to see return on those investments.",
      "\u201cI think that the opportunity to monetize the great fan base that we have in Japan and Korea will show up in terms of purely international revenue, but it will also show up in our national media. My prediction is there will be some of the more media companies \u2014 the streamers will be really interested in the ability to get access to well-developed economies where they don\u2019t have as much penetration as they do in countries like the United States and Canada. So it\u2019s going to show up in different places out of those developed economies.\u201d",

It's celebrating its 10th anniversary this year and, as always, seeking submissions that \u201cexhibit fearlessness.\u201d The award also honors musical theater.",
      "\u201cBeing able to create under financial stress is so difficult, and so anything we can do to give artists a little breathing room is what we want,\u201d says Katz.",
      "The award was inspired by Katz's friend and collaborator Philip Seymour Hoffman, the late actor who was described as relentless in his pursuit of truth in his art. A musical theater honor was added after the 2020 death of another of Katz's friends, Fountains of Wayne co-founder Adam Schlesinger.",

      "The play \u201cArt\u201d returns to Broadway with a fresh revival and a starry cast",
      "For evidence of how high inflation has gotten, look no further than Broadway. The fancy painting at the heart of the play \u201cArt\u201d cost the equivalent of $40,000 in 1998. In a crackling new revival, it's a hefty $300,000.",
      "The painting in question is a 4-by-5-foot white-on-white work with white lines. Playwright Yasmina Reza puts it at the center of an escalating fight between three male, middle-aged friends that exposes their fault lines, leading to a night in which each are ripped apart by the others and putting a 25-year friendship in jeopardy.",
      "If $300,000 sounds like a ridiculous price for a monothematic canvas, you'll side with Marc, played with pitch-perfect exasperation by Bobby Cannavale. If the painting speaks to you, you'll be with Serge, a flinty, slightly full-of-himself Neil Patrick Harris. If you just want to hang out and not talk about the painting any more, you'll identify with James Corden's hapless Yvan.",
      "Under Scott Ellis' tight and enthralling direction and with three perfectly cast actors who seem to be having a ball at the Music Box Theatre, \u201cArt\u201d frequently erupts in laughter but still has plenty to say about friendship, power dynamics and how we get on each others' nerves. The 90-minute play opened Tuesday night.",
      "This is the first time \u201cArt,\u201d translated from the original French by Christopher Hampton and which won the Tony Award for best play in 1998 starring Alan Alda, Victor Garber and Alfred Molina, has returned to Broadway, and it feels nothing like an antique. Designer David Rockwell puts the latest three lads in an elegant gray, spare living room that reeks of chilly luxury but also has little personality.",
      "Marc believes that Serge \u2014 by buying the Modernist painting against the express aesthetic rules followed by Marc \u2014 is indicating that he has stepped out of Marc\u2019s shadow. It is for him nothing less than a betrayal. Serge finds a new intolerance and inflexibility in his friend and a hostility to things new. They both lobby Yvan to be on their side, and when he vacillates, he is declared a spineless amoeba.",

      "Cannavale's Marc is prone to outbursts and patting his friend's shoulders, less out of affection than an expression of dominance. Harris' Serge goes from needy to flinty to icy, and Corden fills his Yvan with the comedian's gift for physical comedy, literally plunging into a sofa to search for something or looking sheepish as he buttons a jacket.",
      "A highlight is a hysterical scene in which the three men, still festering their grievances, silently eat olives and drop the pits in a bowl with a loud ting. And Corden triggers a mid-show ovation after nailing a 900-word monster of a monologue that smacks of Mark Rylance doing something similar in the same theater in \u201cLa B\u00eate.\u201d",
      "\u201cArt\u201d has never been a discussion about Modern art, despite its title. The white painting is merely the playwright's way to get at microaggressions and competition among friends, and how seemingly small things \u2014 like the way one waves away cigarette smoke or the tone of a suggestion \u2014 can fester in the other.",

      "It's not because their parents didn't think they could handle the responsibility or because dogs can be messy. It's because there was a body walled up in the basement.",
      "\u201cHow could our parents act like nothing ever happened?\u201d Noah Robles asks. \u201cThat\u2019s worse than the killing. It\u2019s not, but still. They called it the \u2018playroom.\u2019\u201d",
      "That 30-year-old corpse will soon unleash a suburban comedy of errors as the bungling brother and sister \u2014 raised on TV police procedurals \u2014 try to find a way out of this mess without losing their freedom or precarious lifestyles.",
      "\u201cI wrote for two seasons on \u2018Blue Bloods.\u2019 I know how cops think,\u201d says Noah Robles, a wonderfully childlike loser played by Josh Gad. His man-boy is a failed screenwriter in an Alamo Drafthouse T-shirt with maxed out credit cards.",
      "Director Alex Winter and screenwriter Michael M.B. Galvin combine for a pitch-perfect black comedy that has a nifty satirical edge, inverting the movie convention of discovering that the kids are monsters.",
      "Meg \u2014 played with lovely comic timing by a languid Kaya Scodelario \u2014 brings her young children to a dangerous payoff meet because she couldn't get child care and loses her cool when she's mocked for missing a yoga class. \u201cHave a good day. Make good choices,\u201d she tells her kids even as she clearly doesn't.",
      "Not long after the body in the basement is found, more bodies start piling up, as does the extortion, sword play, swirling detectives and so-called heavies who look the part even if they're really lambs.

      "A vaccine advisory committee handpicked by U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. met in Atlanta for two days this week to consider various vaccine recommendations",
      "NEW YORK -- A vaccine advisory committee handpicked by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met in Atlanta this week to consider whether to revise recommendations on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B, and a combination shot that protects children against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.",
      "The panel, which is charged with making vaccine recommendations, declined to recommend COVID-19 vaccines, saying instead that people could make individual decisions \u2014 a move that adds confusion as people weigh whether to get a dose this fall.",
      "During the sometimes chaotic two-day meeting, the panel also recommended new restrictions for a vaccine that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. In a surprise move, the group indefinitely postponed an expected vote on hepatitis B shots given to infants on the day they are born.",
      "With Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, leading the country's health agencies, the meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, struck a different tone from past gatherings. Among the 12 members, all chosen this year by Kennedy after he fired the previous 17-member panel, are people who have criticized and spread misinformation about vaccines. Critics say the panel's makeup and agenda could sow distrust in the shots.",
      "The panel's recommendations will be sent to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that has been rocked by disagreements over Kennedy's vaccine policies. The panel's recommendations are usually adopted by the CDC, and then widely followed by doctors and insurers.",
      "Here are some takeaways from the meeting.",
      "The panel on Friday debated COVID-19 vaccinations as the virus has remained a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths last fall and winter, according to CDC data.",
      "Until now, the vaccinations had been routinely provided to nearly all Americans who wanted them. The Food and Drug Administration recently put new restrictions on this year\u2019s shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, reserving them for people over 65 or younger ones who are deemed at higher risk from the virus.",
      "Panelists declined to recommend the shots for anyone, including seniors and high-risk populations. They said individuals could make their own decisions. Removing the recommendations that were previously in place may confuse Americans trying to decide whether and how to get their fall boosters.",
      "The panel also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around claims of vaccine risks, despite pushback from outside medical groups who said the shots had a proven safety record from the billions of doses administered worldwide.",
      "The divided panel narrowly avoided urging states to require a prescription for the shot.",
      "Several states have announced policies to try to ensure people's access to COVID-19 vaccines, worried about Friday\u2019s ACIP decision. And a group representing most health insurers, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said earlier this week that its members will continue covering the shots through 2026.",
      "The committee recommended that a combined vaccine known as MMRV should not be given to children under 4. Instead, they said in an 8-3 vote with one abstention, children in this age group should get separate vaccines \u2014 one for MMR and another for varicella, or chickenpox.",
      "Their discussions centered on rare feverish seizures that can occur in kids who receive the first dose, between the ages of 1 and 2. Medical experts agree these seizures, while potentially frightening for families, are not linked to brain function or school problems.",
      "In 2009, the ACIP changed a previous recommendation to advise that either the combination shot or separate shots were acceptable for the first dose.",
      "Some doctors and public health experts say they are not aware of any new safety data that would explain the revisiting of those vaccination recommendations.",
      "About 85% of children already receive separate doses for the first round, according to information presented at the meeting.",

      "Ever since the ACIP panel in 2005 recommended a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, cases of the liver virus among infants have dropped by more than half.",
      "Nonetheless, the committee opted to revisit the guidance in this week's meeting, with members questioning whether babies born to moms who test negative for hepatitis B really need a vaccine at birth.",
      "The panelists considered whether to recommend delaying that initial vaccination \u2014 something doctors and parents already can choose to do.",
      "One committee member asked if the vaccination right after birth was \u201casking our babies to solve an adult problem.\u201d Hepatitis B can spread through sex, sharing needles, or from an infected mother to a newborn baby.",
      "But several outside medical experts criticized that the committee was debating the issue at all and said the vaccine is safe and successful at reducing infant infections.",
      "After discussing it on Thursday, the panel decided Friday morning to indefinitely postpone a vote on the issue.",
      "Chairman Martin Kulldorff opened the meeting by challenging former CDC directors to a public debate. Several doctors representing outside medical groups accused the panel of not following the CDC\u2019s long-established guidelines in weighing evidence for making recommendations.",
      "CDC staff, as usual, presented numerous studies on the topics being debated, explaining how they chose which research to discuss. But a few times, panel members cited different papers they had found, including ones done in mice, which are not generally considered applicable.",
      "The committee also took a vote on Thursday that they had to redo on Friday morning concerning the government\u2019s Vaccines for Children program, which covers vaccine costs for about half of U.S. kids. On Friday, they voted to align coverage under the program with their guidance on MMRV shots. A day earlier, they had voted no on the idea.",

      "A government watchdog has raised concerns about high administrative costs in Georgia's Medicaid program",
      "ATLANTA -- A federal watchdog reported Thursday that Georgia\u2019s program requiring able-bodied adults to document low-paying work to get Medicaid has spent much more on administrative costs than on providing health care.",
      "The U.S. Government Accountability Office report on Georgia Pathways comes after Republicans mandated similar work requirements throughout the U.S. as part of the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d signed into law by President Donald Trump.",
      "Starting in 2027, most adults who seek Medicaid coverage must first show they are working, taking classes or performing community service for at least 80 hours a month. And they must be extremely poor, earning incomes no higher than the federal poverty line.",
      "The report attributes most of the administrative costs to the implementation of changes in determining eligibility and enrolling people, along with duplicative technology, training and coordination while the state litigated to overcome Biden administration objections.",
      "\u201cNow the entire country can see what we in Georgia already know \u2014 Georgia\u2019s Medicaid work reporting requirement program is the real waste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d Sen. Raphael Warnock, one of the Georgia Democrats who requested the report. \u201cThis report shows that Pathways is incredibly effective at barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer,\" his statement said.",
      "A spokesperson for Republican Gov. Brian Kemp countered that Democrats are responsible for the extra spending.",
      "\u201cNow, as other states prepare to adopt our model and reject one-size-fits-none big government healthcare, Democrats like Senators Ossoff and Warnock are trying to rewrite history after four years of inaction and blame the State for costs associated with their own stonewalling.\"",

At Monday's joint kick-off event, the candidates largely focused on the economy and stricter measures on immigration.

As agriculture minister for Ishiba, Koizumi released an emergency rice stockpile to lower prices and stabilize supply. Koizumi vowed to rebuild his party and listen to the people's voices more closely to address their concerns, such as rising prices, growing foreign population and public safety, but stayed away from divisive issues. If elected, he will be Japan's youngest leader since Hirobumi Ito, who in 1885 became the first Japanese premier at 44.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un says he still has good memories of U.S. President Donald Trump and urged Washington to drop its demand the North surrender its nukes as a precondition for resuming long-stalled diplomacy.",
      "Speaking to Pyongyang\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament on Sunday, Kim stressed that he has no intention of ever resuming dialogue with rival South Korea, a key U.S. ally that helped broker Kim\u2019s previous summits with Trump during the American president\u2019s first term, according to a speech published by state media on Monday.",
      "Kim suspended virtually all cooperation with the South following the collapse of his second summit with Trump in 2019 over disagreements about U.S.-led sanctions against the North. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have worsened in recent years as Kim has accelerated his weapons buildup and aligned with Russia over the war in Ukraine.",
      "Kim\u2019s comments came as South Korean President Lee Jae Myung departed for New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly, where he is expected to address nuclear tensions on the Korean Peninsula and call on North Korea to return to talks.",
      "Trump is also expected to visit South Korea next month to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, prompting media speculation that he may try to meet Kim at the inter-Korean border, as they did during their third meeting in 2019, which ultimately failed to salvage their nuclear diplomacy.",
      "During his latest speech at the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly, Kim reiterated that he would never give up his nuclear weapons program, which experts say he sees as his strongest guarantee of survival and the extension of his family\u2019s dynastic rule.",
      "\u201cThe world already knows well what the United States does after forcing other countries to give up their nuclear weapons and disarm,\u201d Kim said. \u201cWe will never lay down our nuclear weapons \u2026 There will be no negotiations, now or ever, about trading anything with hostile countries in exchange for lifting sanctions.\u201d",

      "Kim has stepped up testing activities in recent years, demonstrating weapons of various ranges designed to strike U.S. allies in Asia and the U.S. mainland. Analysts say Kim\u2019s nuclear push is aimed at eventually pressuring Washington to accept the idea of the North as a nuclear power and to negotiate economic and security concessions from a position of strength.",
      "Kim is also trying to bolster his leverage by strengthening cooperation with traditional allies Russia and China, in an emerging partnership aimed at undercutting U.S. influence.",
      "He has sent thousands of troops and huge supplies of military equipment to Russia to help support President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine. He visited Beijing earlier this month, sharing the spotlight with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Putin at a massive military parade. Experts say Kim\u2019s rare foreign trip was likely intended to boost his leverage ahead of a potential resumption of talks with the United States.",
      "There\u2019s growing concern in Seoul that it could lose its voice in future efforts to defuse the nuclear standoff on the peninsula, as the North seeks to negotiate directly with the United States. Such fears were amplified last year when Kim declared that he was abandoning North Korea\u2019s long-standing goal of peaceful unification with South Korea and ordered a rewriting of the North\u2019s constitution to cement the South as a permanent enemy.",

Researchers estimated crowd sizes using drone photos.",
      "\u201cRight-wing mobilizations have typically been three times larger than those of the left,\u201d Ortellado said. \u201cIn recent months, that pattern has changed. The opposition\u2019s support for (U.S. President Donald) Trump\u2019s tariffs and for the amendment has brought the left back to the streets.\u201d",
      "Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years and three months in prison on Sept. 11 for attempting to stay in power after losing a 2022 reelection bid. He is the first former president convicted of trying to overturn an election in Latin America\u2019s largest economy. Bolsonaro has denied any wrongdoing.",

      "Conservationists mark world rhino day on Monday while they are still in a constant battle against poaching",
      "DINOKENG GAME RESERVE, South Africa -- The Dinokeng Game Reserve in South Africa has a thriving rhino population, but their exact numbers and the details of the security operation that keeps them safe from poaching are closely guarded secrets.",
      "They are the protocols that reserves with rhinos follow to ensure they're not the next target for poachers who still kill on average one rhino every day in South Africa for their horns despite decades of work to save the endangered species.",
      "South Africa has the largest populations of both black and southern white rhinos of any country and sees itself as the custodian of the animals' future.",
      "As conservationists mark World Rhino Day on Monday, South Africa remains in a constant and costly battle against poaching nearly 30 years after black rhinos were declared critically endangered, and more than a half-century since southern white rhinos were on the brink of extinction with just a few dozen left.",
      "South Africa has more than 2,000 of the 6,700 black rhinos left in the wild or in reserves and 12,000-13,000 of the world's 15,000 remaining southern white rhinos, which are now listed as near threatened after a turnaround. Those two species are only found in the wild in Africa. South Africa has a pivotal place in saving them but also is the epicenter of rhino poaching that is linked to organized crime.",
      "South Africa's rhinos are spread between government-run parks and private owners like Dinokeng.",
      "The country has made marked progress in the last decade with that public-private collaboration, bringing the number of rhinos killed by poachers from well over 1,000 every year to 420 last year. Yet, 195 rhinos were killed by poachers in the first half of this year, according to the South African Environment Ministry, still one every day.",
      "\u201cPlease do not tell a ranger that we\u2019re not going to win this war,\u201d said Marius Fuls, a wildlife monitor and ranger at Dinokeng. \"If we as conservationists stop believing that we\u2019re going to win this, then we have lost it. We\u2019re the last thin green line between the extinction of rhinos.\u201d",
      "In South Africa and elsewhere, anti-poaching efforts now employ high-tech tactics to help rangers. Reserves are using drones, night surveillance equipment, radar technology, motion-sensing cameras and artificial intelligence. Rhinos at Dinokeng are fitted with tracking devices so rangers know where they are. Rangers also patrol with K-9 dog units.",
      "Dinokeng has been successful in protecting its rhinos, but there is no letup. \u201cIt would be naive to think that poaching is not a threat even though we haven\u2019t had incidents in many years,\" Fuls said. \"Poaching is always a threat.\"",
      "Some reserves continue to dehorn their rhinos to make them useless to poachers who kill them because of the high demand for rhino horn products for medicinal and other uses in parts of Asia. Studies indicate that rhino horn products sold through illegal markets sometimes fetch higher prices than gold.",
      "The fight against poaching is always looking for new ways to stop rhinos being killed. This year, a group of scientists in South Africa working with the International Atomic Energy Agency launched a program to inject small amounts of radioactive material into rhinos' horns. The aim is to make them unsellable, but also detectable if they are smuggled through borders.",
      "The scientists said the radioactive material does not harm the rhinos.",
      "Conservationists are also moving rhinos to new areas in a repeat of South Africa's famous Operation Rhino of the 1960s. That operation was a reaction to the drastic situation of southern white rhinos, which were nearly extinct. It moved some of the last remaining white rhinos in eastern South Africa to other areas so they could be better protected and establish new breeding populations. It is credited with saving the southern white rhino.",

      "Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa has arrived in New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa arrived in New York on Sunday to take part in the U.N. General Assembly, the first president of Syria to do so in nearly six decades.",
      "The last time a Syrian head of state attended the General Assembly was in 1967. That was before the 50-year rule of the Assad family dynasty, which came to an end in December when then-President Bashar Assad was ousted in a lightning insurgent offensive led by al-Sharaa. Assad\u2019s fall also brought to an end nearly 14 years of civil war.",
      "Since then, al-Sharaa has sought to restore ties with Arab countries and the West, where officials were initially wary of his past ties with the al-Qaida militant group. The rebel group he formerly led, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, was previously designated by the United States as a terrorist group.",
      "Since assuming power, al-Sharaa has preached coexistence and sought to reassure Syria\u2019s minority communities, but the country\u2019s fragile recovery has been threatened by outbreaks of sectarian violence. Fighters affiliated with the new government were also accused of killing hundreds of civilians from the Druze and Alawite religious minorities.",
      "Along with his appearance at the U.N. General Assembly, al-Sharaa is likely to use his visit to push for further sanctions relief for Syria as it attempts to rebuild its war-battered economy and infrastructure.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump met with al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia in May and announced that he would lift decades of sanctions imposed on Syria under the Assads\u2019 rule.",
      "He followed through by ordering a large swathe of sanctions lifted or waived. However, the most stringent sanctions were imposed by Congress under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act passed in 2019 and will require a congressional vote to permanently remove them.",

      "Another topic that will loom large during al-Sharaa\u2019s visit is his country\u2019s relations with U.S. ally Israel. Since Assad\u2019s fall, Israel has been suspicious of al-Sharaa\u2019s government and has seized a formerly U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in southern Syria and launched hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military sites.",
      "Negotiations have been underway for a security deal that al-Sharaa has said he hopes will bring about a withdrawal of Israeli forces and return to a 1974 disengagement agreement. While al-Sharaa said last week that a deal could be reached in a matter of days, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in remarks Sunday appeared to downplay the odds of a breakthrough.",
      "\u201cThere is some progress\u201d but the deal is \u201cstill a vision for the future,\u201d he said.",
      "Also on Sunday, Syrian elections officials announced that the country\u2019s first parliamentary elections since the fall of Assad will take place on Oct. 5. The members of the People\u2019s Assembly will not be chosen via a direct popular vote, however, but through an electoral college system with electoral bodies in each province voting for two-thirds of the seats, while al-Sharaa will directly appoint one third.",
      "Officials have said that holding direct elections at this stage would be too logistically challenging since many Syrians have lost personal documentation or are living as refugees abroad after the nearly 14-year civil war.",

      "JALALABAD, Afghanistan -- The Taliban government on Sunday rejected U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s bid to retake Bagram Air Base, four years after America\u2019s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan left the sprawling military facility in the Taliban's hands.",
      "Trump on Saturday renewed his call to reestablish a U.S. presence at Bagram, even saying \u201cwe\u2019re talking now to Afghanistan\u201d about the matter. He did not offer further details about the purported conversations. Asked by a reporter if he\u2019d consider deploying U.S. troops to take the base, Trump demurred.",

      "It had been consistently communicated to the U.S. in all bilateral negotiations that Afghanistan\u2019s independence and territorial integrity were of the utmost importance, he said.",
      "\u201cIt should be recalled that, under the Doha Agreement, the United States pledged that \u2018it will not use or threaten force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Afghanistan, nor interfere in its internal affairs,\u2019\u201d he said. The U.S. needed to remain faithful to its commitments, he added.",

      "Earlier Sunday, the chief of staff at the Defense Ministry, Fasihuddin Fitrat, addressed Trump's comments. \u201cCeding even an inch of our soil to anyone is out of the question and impossible,\u201d he said during a speech broadcast by Afghan media.",

      "After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department's attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising.",
      "The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue.",
      "Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a \u201cremedy\u201d trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions.",
      "Although the judge hasn't set a timetable for making that decision, it's unlikely to come down before the end of this year because additional legal briefs and courtroom arguments are expected to extend into November before Brinkema takes the matter under submission.",

      "The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive.",
      "If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology \u2014 a proposal that the company's lawyers warned would \u201cinvite disruption and damage\u201d to consumers and the internet's ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years.",

      "The legal battle over Google's advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct.",
      "In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month.",
      "Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist \u2014 a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion \u2014 an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April.",
      "In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial.",
      "As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's \u201cradical\u201d proposals.",
      "The Justice Department is \u201cfighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed,\" Google's lawyers argued leading up to the trial.",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed a bill extending the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday extended a signature state program aimed at reducing planet-warming emissions through 2045, a move Democrats cheered but Republicans warned would raise gas prices.",
      "The program known as cap and trade sets a declining limit on total greenhouse gas emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their pollution. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.",
      "It was set to expire after 2030. The law Newsom signed Friday at the Morrison Planetarium in San Francisco potentially boosts carbon-removal projects and requires the program to align with California's target of achieving so-called carbon neutrality by 2045. That means the state will remove as many carbon emissions as it releases. The law changes the name to \u201ccap and invest\u201d to emphasize that the money goes toward other programs.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doubling down on our best tool to combat Trump\u2019s assaults on clean air \u2014 Cap-and-Invest \u2014 by making polluters pay for projects that support our most impacted communities,\u201d Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement.",
      "Newsom also signed a law committing $1 billion in program revenue for the state\u2019s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.",
      "He approved other measures aimed at advancing the state\u2019s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians. They include laws to speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze and allow the state\u2019s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states.",
      "Newsom also signed a bill that would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.",
      "California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state\u2019s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.",

The program's \u201ccap\u201d applies to planet-warming emissions, not other pollutants impacting air quality. Cap and trade doesn't set emissions limits for individual facilities, meaning an industrial polluter could continue to emit the same amount of greenhouse gases over time so long as it has the right amount of credits or offsets.",
      "Other critics of the cap-and-trade extension are worried about it raising costs. The program has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played \u201ca very small role\u201d in increasing electricity prices because the state\u2019s grid isn\u2019t very carbon intensive, the report says.",

      "The total national average credit score dropped two points this year to 715, according to the report from credit scoring company FICO. But Gen Z's average score dropped three points to 676, the largest year-over-year decrease among any age group since 2020.",
      "A credit score is a mathematical formula that helps lenders determine how likely you are to pay back a loan. Credit scores are based on your credit history and range from 300 to 850.",
      "The report found that 34% of Gen Z consumers have open student loans, compared to 17% of the total population, and the decline in credit scores is primarily due to the resumption of student loan delinquency reporting.",
      "The U.S. Department of Education paused federal student loan payments in March 2020, offering borrowers relief during the economic chaos of the coronavirus pandemic. Though payments were set to resume in 2023, the Biden administration provided a one-year grace period that ended in October 2024.",

      "The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, or BOEM, filed a motion in federal court Thursday seeking to take back its approval of the SouthCoast Wind project\u2019s \u201cconstruction and operations plan.'' The plan is the last major federal permit the project needs before it can start putting turbines in the water.",

The ocean agency has concluded that its prior weighing of the project's impacts was \u201cdeficient\u201d and intends to reconsider that analysis to make a new decision, the department said.",

Others taking the stage at the University of Minnesota's football stadium will include Dave Matthews,Margo Price,Kenny Chesney,Wynonna Judd, and Nathaniel Rateliff.",
      "This year\u2019s concert comes at a worrying time for American farmers. Farm profitability has been falling. Crop prices are low while production costs are rising. And the Trump administration\u2019s trade wars have added to the insecurity. China has not bought any of the 2025 U.S. soybean crop so far and has turned to America's competitors, such as Brazil, to meet its needs.",
      "A labor dispute nearly derailed the festival this year. Organizers said they would not cross the picket lines of striking teamster service workers at the university, saying \u201cthe farm and labor movements are inseparable.\u201d Nelson got on the phone with Gov. Tim Walz. The university and union reached a deal late last week.",

      "A National Transportation Safety Board report last year determined the probable cause of the crash was inadequate inspections, resulting in an eventual loosening of hardware and subsequent loss of helicopter control. A post-crash examination of the flight controls showed hardware that should have been connected to a part on the main rotor was disconnected and the connecting hardware was missing, the final NTSB report says.",

      "It would be the second call with Xi since Trump returned to the White House and launched sky-high tariffs on China, triggering back-and-forth trade restrictions that strained ties between the two largest economies.

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve just cut its benchmark rate for the first time since last year, but that doesn't guarantee mortgage rates will keep dropping",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Hoping that mortgage rates will keep dropping following the Federal Reserve's first rate cut since last year? Don't bank on it.",
      "As expected, the central bank delivered a quarter-point cut Wednesday and projected it would lower its benchmark rate twice more this year, reflecting growing concern over the U.S. job market.",
      "Here's a look at factors that determine mortgage rates and what the Fed's latest move means for the housing market:",
      "Mortgage rates have been mostly falling since late July on expectations of a Fed rate cut. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage was at 6.35% last week, its lowest level in nearly a year, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.",
      "A similar pullback in mortgage rates happened around this time last year in the weeks leading up to the Fed\u2019s first rate cut in more than four years. Back then, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage got down to a 2-year low of 6.08% one week after the central bank cut rates.",
      "But it hasn't come close to that since.",
      "Mortgage rates didn't keep falling last year, even as the Fed cut its main rate two more times. Instead, mortgage rates rose and kept climbing until the average rate on a 30-year home loan reached just over 7% by mid-January.",
      "Like last year, the Fed's rate cut doesn't necessarily mean mortgage rates will keep declining, even as the central bank signals more cuts ahead.",
      "\u201cRates could come down further, as the Fed has signaled the potential for two more rate cuts this year,\u201d said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. \u201cHowever, there are still risks of a reversal in mortgage rates. Inflation heated up in August and if the September inflation report shows another bump in consumer prices, it\u2019s possible we could see rates rise.\u201d",
      "No. Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Fed's interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation.",
      "Mortgage rates generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "That's because mortgages are typically bundled into mortgage-backed securities that are sold to investors. To keep mortgage-backed securities attractive to investors, their yield \u2014 or annual return -- is adjusted to be competitive with the yield offered by the U.S. on its 10-year government bonds. When those bond yields rise, they tend to push up mortgage rates, and vice-versa.",
      "The 10-year Treasury yield has been mostly easing since mid-July as growing signs that the job market has been weakening fueled expectations of a Fed rate cut this month.",
      "Until now, the Fed had kept its main interest rate on hold this year because it was more worried about inflation potentially worsening due to the Trump administration's tariffs than about the job market.",
      "At the same time, inflation has so far refused to go back below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.",
      "When the Fed cuts rates that can give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it can also fuel inflation. That, in turn, could push up mortgage rates.",

      "\u201cIt's not just about what the Fed is doing today, it\u2019s about what they\u2019re expected to do in the future, and that\u2019s determined by things like economic growth, what\u2019s going to happen in the labor market and what do we think inflation is going to be like over the next year or so,\u201d said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\u201cIf the Fed keeps lowering rates, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean mortgages will go down,\u201d said Stephen Kates, financial analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIt means that they probably could go down more, and they may trend in that direction, even if they don\u2019t move in lockstep.\u201d",
      "Ahead of the Fed's rate cut, the futures market had priced in expectations that the central bank would cut its key interest rate at upcoming policy meetings this year and into 2026. But the Fed's latest projections show a less aggressive path of rate cuts than the market has been expecting.",
      "\u201cThis ongoing gap between market and Fed expectations means that some risk of upward pressure on mortgage rates remains,\u201d said Hale, adding that the decline in mortgage rates \u201cis likely to continue at least through this week.\"",
      "Hale recently forecast that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will be between 6.3% and 6.4% by the end of this year. That's in line with recent projections by other economists who also don't expect the average rate to drop below 6% this year.",
      "The late-summer pullback in mortgage rates has been a welcome trend for the housing market, which has been in a slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years and have remained sluggish so far this year.",
      "While lower rates give home shoppers more purchasing power, mortgage rates remain too high for many Americans to afford to buy a home. That\u2019s mostly because home prices, while rising more slowly than in years past, are still up by roughly 50% nationally since the start of this decade.",
      "\u201cWhile lower rates will bring some buyers and sellers into the market, today\u2019s cut will not be enough to break up the housing market logjam,\u201d said Sturtevant. \"We will need to see further drops in mortgage rates and much slower home price growth, or even home price declines, to make a dent in affordability.\u201d",
      "If mortgage rates continue to ease, home shoppers will benefit from more affordable financing. But lower mortgage rates could also bring in more buyers, making the market more competitive at a time when sellers across the country are having a tougher time driving a hard bargain.",
      "Predicting when mortgage rates will decline and by how much is daunting because so many variables can influence their trajectory from one week to the next.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to buy at current rates may be better off buying now if they find a property that fits their needs, rather than attempt to time the market, said Kates.",
      "Many homeowners looking to refinance have already seized on the decline in rates, sending applications for refinance loans sharply higher in recent weeks.",
      "One rule of thumb to consider when refinancing is whether you can reduce your current rate by at least one percentage point, which helps blunt the impact of refinancing fees.",

      "When we make mistakes at work, it can lead to a cycle of negative thinking",
      "NEW YORK -- When we make mistakes at work, it can lead to a cycle of negative thinking.",
      "The damaging thoughts swirl: \u201cI\u2019m an impostor.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not smart enough.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m failing at my job.\u201d",
      "Feeling like an impostor \u2014 doubting one\u2019s own abilities despite a track record of success \u2014 is common, especially among women and members of marginalized groups. Even on days when everything\u2019s going right, it can be hard to shift out of a cycle of self-doubt.",
      "But there are ways to interrupt that downward spiral.",
      "Many people have found cognitive behavioral therapy, a form of talk therapy, helpful to examine internal monologues such as \u201cI\u2019m going to say the wrong thing\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not good enough\u201d \u2014 and replace them with neutral or positive mantras.",
      "\u201cWhat we do in cognitive behavior therapy is help people identify these negative thoughts, and then we teach them to evaluate those thoughts and see how accurate they are,\u201d said Judith Beck, president of the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy, based in Pennsylvania.",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019re not accurate, we discuss what\u2019s a more realistic perspective on this,\u201d she said.",
      "To reach students with social, emotional and behavioral challenges, Randolph Public Schools, a district outside of Boston, held a recent seminar about helping children reframe their negative feelings using cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT.",
      "\u201cWe want our students\u2026 to really have the mindset that they can do things confidently,\u201d said Alpha Sanford, chief of development and student services, who started the initiative.",
      "During the training, Christin Brink, an assistant principal for special education, thought to herself, \u201cWow, I need this just as much as the kids do.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing a younger administrator in this role, it\u2019s something new to me,\u201d Brink added. \u201cA lot of times I\u2019ll have impostor syndrome, and I\u2019ll make a choice that I later regret.\u201d",
      "If you find yourself having negative thoughts frequently, you\u2019re not alone. There are evolutionary reasons for it.",
      "\u201cWhen we were cavemen, it was very important for us to be alert for danger,\u201d Beck said. Preparing for the worst possible outcome helped people stay alive. Some worries \u2014 such as \u201cI don\u2019t have enough time to complete this project\u201d \u2014 can motivate people to get things done, she said.",
      "But lingering on what\u2019s going wrong can be unhealthy. We sometimes filter out positive reinforcement, downplaying recognition we\u2019ve received and overemphasizing mistakes, said Kristene Doyle, director of the Albert Ellis Institute, a psychotherapy training organization based in New York.",
      "Practicing your positive beliefs by saying them to yourself with force, vigor and frequency can help you build a healthier thinking muscle, she said.",
      "One of the first steps to reframing unhelpful thoughts is to identify those that are recurring in your mind. Examine whether they have any validity. What evidence is there to support them?",
      "\u201cTelling myself \u2018I\u2019m not good enough to be here\u2019 is only going to lead me down a path of a self-fulfilling prophecy, and you make that worst-case scenario happen,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cWhat makes somebody good enough to be in the room? What makes somebody good enough to have a job?\u201d",
      "When someone is thinking they\u2019re an impostor, \u201clook for reasons why they\u2019re not an impostor. What are their strengths? Why were they hired?\u201d Doyle asked.",

      "Now, instead of jumping to the worst conclusion, she pauses to examine the thought. \u201cWhat did they actually say to you?\u201d she asks herself. \u201cDid they say the actual words, \u2018You\u2019re terrible?\u2019 Did they actually say, \u2018You have to throw out the whole lesson?\u2019\u201d",

      "Some therapists get creative when working with clients to identify negative feelings or beliefs. Avigail Lev, a psychologist with the Bay Area CBT Center in San Francisco, has clients write down the phrases, such as \u201cThey don\u2019t value the work that I\u2019m doing\u201d or \u201cI haven\u2019t done enough to get a raise.\u201d",
      "After that, she leads clients through exercises to diffuse the strength of those thoughts, such as reading the sentences backward, counting the words in the statement, or writing the phrases on a cloud.",
      "It can take time and practice to successfully reframe negative thoughts that have been replaying in our mind for years. When Renee Baker was studying architecture in college, professors and instructors frequently tore into her work. The critiques were designed to thicken her skin. But they had a lasting impact.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the self-doubt that comes with being told, literally, \u2018You\u2019re not good enough. Your ideas aren\u2019t good enough. Your work isn\u2019t good enough,\u2019\u201d said Baker, who\u2019s now director of project management at Inform Studio, a design firm. \u201cAt the heart of a lot of my self-doubt is feeling like my voice, and what I think, what I believe, what I am passionate about, isn\u2019t as important as the next person's.\u201d",
      "So Baker worked with a therapist to challenge her damaging core beliefs, exchanging them for more neutral thoughts. At work, she practiced speaking up even when her throat felt tight with anxiety. Over time, she became less anxious and more comfortable sharing her ideas.",
      "You can get specific when you're searching for alternative, healthier mantras.",
      "\u201cWhen we look at this sentence, \u2018They don\u2019t value the work that I\u2019m doing,\u2019 do you have any examples of when you felt your work was valued? Do you have examples of when people appreciated your work?\u201d Lev asked.",
      "You can also reframe your thoughts about other people who are part of your workday.",
      "Eleanor Forbes, a social worker in Randolph Public Schools, helps teachers and administrators learn to apply CBT techniques. When staff members complain that a young person is being manipulative, she helps them reframe the thought. \u201cHow about we just say that this young person is just using survival skills?\u201d she said.",
      "Brink, the assistant principal, learned to reframe her own negative thoughts, saying to herself: \u201cI made a lot of great choices today,\u201d or \u201cThis was what went well,\u201d and \u201cTomorrow we can try again with x, y and z.\u201d",
      "Having scripted phrases ready to go helps when negative thoughts resurface, she said.",

      "CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA. -- Wide receiver Trell Harris caught a trio of first-quarter touchdown passes as Virginia raced away from visiting Stanford, 48-20, on Saturday night at Scott Stadium.",
      "\u201cYou dream and you pray for a half like that,\u201d Harris said.",
      "Chandler Morris had his most productive game quarterbacking in a Virginia uniform, throwing for 380 yards and four touchdowns and running for another score.",
      "\u201cWe felt like this week we were going to get some opportunities to put the ball in the air,\" UVA coach Tony Elliott said. \"It was good for Chandler to have a game like that.\u201d",
      "Morris threw for 380 yards and four touchdowns.",
      "J'Mari Taylor ran for 85 yards on 15 carries for the Cavaliers, who averaged 5.7 yards per carry.",
      "A week after setting a program record with 700 total offensive yards against FCS William & Mary, the Virginia offense hummed at a similarly high rate against Stanford, blistering the Cardinal for 590 yards.",
      "\u201cWe knew they had a dynamic offense coming in,\" Stanford coach Frank Reich said. \"They put up a zillion yards in the last few games. A lot of points. Running the football at a high level. Hadn\u2019t given up a sack. Quarterback is dynamic.",
      "\u201cWasn't our best outing defensively. I know we\u2019re better than that. There were plays there to be made defensively that I think we would normally make.\u201d",
      "The Cavaliers' defense bottled up Stanford star running back Micah Ford. A week after Ford went for a career-high 157 yards in a win over Boston College, he found no room to run against Virginia, finishing with 44 yards on 13 carries. He did score a 3-yard touchdown in the second quarter.",
      "The Cardinal did make yards through big passing plays. Bryce Farrell had a 60-yard reception in the first half and a 68-yard touchdown catch in the second.",

      "Virginia demonstrated that last week\u2019s offensive outburst wasn\u2019t solely a result of the opponent. Piling up yards against Stanford proves the Cavalier offense has the firepower to be an impact unit this season.",

      "Rodgers\u2019 historic domination of the Cincinnati Bengals was so disruptive the Vikings\u2019 offense had to shush the home crowd at U.S. Bank Stadium for serenading the one-man turnover machine too loudly on the videoboard while Carson Wentz was trying to run a play.",

      "Rodgers\u2019 explosive plays, Browning\u2019s ineffectiveness and Cincinnati\u2019s five turnovers allowed the Vikings defense to steamroll the Bengals, who were without star quarterback Joe Burrow as he recovers from toe surgery.",
      "With Minnesota leading 7-0 early in the first quarter, Rodgers intercepted an off-balance Browning after Smith tipped a pass intended for Chase Brown. The sixth-year cornerback deftly snagged the ball, slipped through a tackle at his 20-yard-line and sprinted up the left sideline to give the Vikings a two-touchdown lead.",
      "\u201cThe crowd kept getting louder and louder as I was getting close,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI just wanted to get into the end zone.\u201d",
      "Later in the second quarter, Rodgers stripped tight end Noah Fant after a 4-yard catch, scooped the ball and raced 66 yards untouched into the end zone.",
      "Topping it off, Rodgers snuffed the Bengals\u2019 next possession by forcing Ja\u2019Marr Chase to fumble after a 15-yard reception, which Jeff Okudah recovered near midfield to set up Jordan Mason's touchdown run.",
      "Rodgers, who signed with Minnesota as a free agent after winning a Super Bowl last year with Philadelphia, became the first player in Vikings history with two defensive touchdowns in a game.",
      "He is the 11th player since the Super Bowl era began in 1966 with interception and fumble return touchdowns in the same game, according to Sportradar. Samson Ebukam was the most recent on Nov. 19, 2018, for the Los Angeles Rams in a 54-51 victory over Kansas City.",

      "The Flyers made the announcement Sunday but provided no immediate details. Parent died overnight in his sleep, said Joe Watson, a star defenseman on their Stanley Cup teams.",
      "Parent's steel-eyed stare through his old-school hockey mask landed him on the cover of Time magazine in 1975 when the Flyers reigned as one of the marquee teams in sports. He won Stanley Cup, Conn Smythe and Vezina trophies in back-to-back seasons when the Flyers won the Stanley Cup in 1974 and 1975, the first NHL expansion team to win the championship.",

More than 2 million fans packed city streets for each of their championship parades.",

      "Parent was one of the more beloved Flyers and remained connected with the team over the years as an ambassador.",
      "The final career highlight came in 2011 when Parent was in the net for an alumni game outdoors at the baseball stadium Citizens Bank Park ahead of the NHL Classic. \u201cBernie! Bernie! Bernie!\u201d echoed throughout the park for the affable goalie, who played 5 minutes, 32 seconds and stopped all six shots. Each save made the \u201cBernie!\u201d chants return.",

      "Ryan Blaney opened the second round of the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs with an emphatic victory for Team Penske, which flaunted its speed at New Hampshire Motor Speedway",
      "LOUDON, N.H. -- In a race in which Fords were fastest at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Ryan Blaney barely was best in class for the second-round opener of the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs.",
      "The 2003 Cup champion led 116 laps in his No. 12 Mustang, including the final 39, but still had to fend off a furious charge by runner-up Josh Berry, who closed within a few car lengths with 10 laps left before overdriving a corner.",
      "Blaney pulled away to win by 0.937 seconds Sunday in his third victory of the season and 16th of his career.",
      "\u201cThat was probably the hardest 20 laps that I drove,\u201d the Team Penske driver said. \u201cI was trying to kind of bide my stuff and pull Josh a little bit, then he really started coming. It was all I could do to hold him off, trying new lanes. That was good and clean racing. I appreciate Josh for not throwing me the bumper when he could have.",
      "\u201cWhat a cool day, what a cool weekend. Super fast car. Really have been strong through the playoffs. It\u2019s great to get a win in the first race of the round.\u201d",
      "Blaney, who is trying to reach the Championship 4 season finale for the third consecutive year, became the first driver to advance into one of the eight available spots in the third round of the Cup playoffs.",
      "Berry, whose No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing Ford has a competitive alliance with Penske, overcame a spin on the 82nd lap and rebounded from his first-round elimination after finishing last in each of the first three races in the playoffs.",
      "\u201cIt was definitely an awesome day,\u201d said Berry, who led 10 laps. \u201cHats off to Ryan at the end. All our cars were really strong, and Ryan did a great job there. I was honestly surprised I was able to keep him honest at the end.",
      "\u201cJust a shame to finish second, but after the last couple of weeks, it feels good. This is definitely what we\u2019re capable of, and hopefully we can keep it going.\u201d",
      "The Fords backed up their impressive performances in qualifying Saturday when Penske star Joey Logano won the pole position to cap a sweep of the top three starting spots with Blaney and Berry. The same trio led 273 of 301 laps Sunday.",
      "William Byron was the highest-finishing Chevrolet driver in third.",
      "\u201cIt was a good day overall,\u201d said Byron, who is the highest-ranked driver behind Blaney in the playoff standings with two races left in the second round. \u201cPenske guys were super fast. I felt like they were in another zip code.\u201d",
      "Logano took fourth after leading a race-high 147 laps in the No. 22 Ford. The Middletown, Connecticut, native started from the pole for the first time at New Hampshire, which he considers his home track.",
      "\u201c(Blaney) was wicked fast in practice, and he showed that again in the race,\u201d Logano said. \u201cWe obviously got a ton of points today, so we did what we needed to do, but I\u2019d rather win. That\u2019s just the greed in me, especially when it\u2019s home.\u201d",
      "After qualifying 27th, last among the 12 playoff drivers, Chase Elliott raced to a fifth-place finish.",
      "Christopher Bell took sixth as the top finishing Toyota driver for Joe Gibbs Racing, which went undefeated in the first round of the playoffs.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Pinch-hitter Patrick Bailey had a tying RBI double during San Francisco\u2019s three-run rally in the eighth, and the Giants battered Dodgers reliever Blake Treinen to avoid a four-game series sweep with a 3-1 victory over Los Angeles on Sunday.",
      "The struggling Treinen (1-7) dramatically blew a 1-0 lead in the eighth, allowing three runs on three hits and two walks while facing only seven batters. Incredibly, Treinen took his fifth loss in his last seven appearances despite pitching just 5 1/3 innings in that stretch.",
      "The 37-year-old Treinen was a big contributor to the Dodgers' championship run last season, but his latest in a series of disastrous outings ballooned his ERA to 5.55. Los Angeles' entire bullpen has largely struggled for weeks, playing a major role in the defending World Series champions' inability to avoid a wild-card playoff series.",
      "Treinen wasted seven stellar innings of one-hit ball by Emmet Sheehan for the Dodgers, whose four-game winning streak ended. With San Diego's win over the White Sox, Los Angeles' magic number stayed at 3 for clinching its 12th NL West title in 13 seasons.",
      "Spencer Bivens (4-3) pitched the seventh and Ryan Walker earned his 16th save for the Giants, whose playoff chances are all but over despite their second win in nine games.",
      "Sheehan was brilliant, striking out 10 with no walks while retiring the final 15 Giants he faced.",
      "Trevor McDonald matched zeros with Sheehan until the seventh inning of his first career start. The Dodgers finally got to McDonald in the seventh when Max Muncy drew a leadoff walk and scored on Michael Conforto's line-drive single.",

      "A goal by Erling Haaland was perhaps to be expected. What Manchester City did next certainly wasn't.",

      "The 32.8% average possession by City is the lowest by a Guardiola team in a top-flight match, according to statistic supplier Opta.",
      "Rice noted City went to a 5-4-1, adding: \u201cI've never seen them do that.\u201d",
      "Back to his prolific best, Haaland made it 13 goals in eight appearances for club and country this season by sprinting upfield and collecting a return pass from Tijjani Reijnders to slot home a finish in the ninth minute.",
      "The Emirates Stadium was then treated to a defensive master class from the visitors as Guardiola, who is famed for cherishing possess, set up City to let Arsenal have plenty of the ball and to defend deep. He kept putting on defenders to protect the lead.",
      "It almost worked, except for the late twist by Martinelli \u2014 who has become something of a supersub for Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta this season.",
      "The result left Liverpool, the defending champion, with a five-point lead after just five games, with Arsenal in second place on goal difference over Tottenham and Bournemouth.",

      "Ahmad Hardy rushes for 138 yards and a touchdown, helping Missouri beat South Carolina 29-20 on Saturday night",
      "COLUMBIA, Mo. -- Ahmad Hardy bounced his way for 138 yards rushing and a touchdown, Beau Pribula led No. 23 Missouri downfield for a go-ahead score in the fourth quarter and the Tigers beat South Carolina 29-20 on Saturday night.",
      "Pribula threw for 171 yards with a touchdown pass, and Jamal Roberts had a nifty touchdown jaunt of his own with 9:32 left to give the Tigers (4-0, 1-0 SEC) the lead, ultimately helping them to their 14th consecutive home win.",
      "\u201cThat was a heck of a battle,\u201d Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz said. \u201cYou could tell they were ticked off about last week's performance and came in and fought. Really proud of our team for not really flinching. ... We just kept hammering away.\u201d",
      "LaNorris Sellers had 302 yards passing and two touchdowns for the Gamecocks (2-2, 0-2), but their star quarterback missed a couple of open receivers in the fourth quarter when the game was on the line. South Carolina twice went three-and-out down the stretch, giving the powerful Missouri ground game the chance to close out the win.",

      "\u201cWhen you're in the red zone like we were and go backwards, it's going to be hard to win,\u201d South Carolina coach Shane Beamer said. \u201cWhen you have opportunities to make plays and we don't get it done, it's going to be hard to win. And having said all that, we had the lead going into the fourth quarter and couldn't finish.\u201d",
      "Missouri rolled into the game amid a perfect start that included a win over rival Kansas, while the Gamecocks limped into town following a lopsided loss to Vanderbilt in which Sellers missed the second half after a hard blow to the head.",
      "There were questions about whether he would play early in the week. By game time, Sellers was off the injury report entirely.",
      "South Carolina needed his magic. The Tigers struck first with a 99-yard drive \u2014 their third full-field march of the season \u2014 before Sellers answered with a 49-yard touchdown throw to Vandrevius Jacobs to give the Gamecocks a 7-6 lead.",
      "Sellers hit Brian Rowe Jr. with his second touchdown throw later in the half, and South Carolina led 14-12 at the break.",
      "Hardy carried the Tigers in the second half, bouncing off defenders like a pinball. The highlight may have been his TD run, when it looked as if he was stood up at the line of scrimmage, spun off the pile and scored to give Missouri an 18-16 lead.",
      "\u201cI didn't even know I was off the ground until I started spinning and my legs started kicking,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cI just kept running.\u201d",

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Fiji scored five tries in a 20-minute spell on either side of halftime, then held on to beat Japan 33-27 Saturday in the final of the Pacific Nations Cup.",
      "Japan started and finished strongly, scoring first and adding the last 17 points of the match. But in between Fiji produced a series of spectacular tries to build a 33-10 lead which only just survived Japan's late comeback.",
      "Two of those tries went to winger Joji Nasova, who scored just before and just after halftime while lock Mesake Vocevoce scored one try and helped to create another. Captain Tevita Ikanivere also scored in the period between the 23rd and 43rd minutes when Fiji took the game away from Japan.",
      "Fiji was hard-pressed to hold on in the second half against a resurgent Japan team which scored tries through hooker Heyate Era \u2014 his second of the match \u2014 and fullback Ichigo Nakakuso to close the margin to six points.",

      "\u201cWe overcame a tough Japan team who came back in the second half because of the pace they brought and the ill-discipline we had,\u201d Ikanivere said. \u201cWe saw the 13 boys who were on the field, the 14 boys just working hard for each other.",
      "\u201cWe talked all five weeks of this competition about plowing the field and coming to harvest today.\u201d",
      "All of Japan's tries were spectacular but perhaps the best of all was finished by center Inia Tabuavou in the 35th minute. It began inside the Fiji 22 with a deft behind-the-back pass to scrumhalf Simione Kuruvoli who broke out and was joined by Vocevoce.",
      "Fiji took the ball almost the length of the field and then from one side of the field to the other before Tabuavou scored.",
      "\u201cWe're a bit disappointed,\" Japan captain Warner Dearns said. \u201cWe probably let them get away from us a little bit in the first half and we couldn't bring it back in the second.\"",

      "DONETSK REGION, Ukraine -- On a battlefield swarming with deadly Russian drones, Ukrainian soldiers are increasingly turning to nimble, remote-controlled armored vehicles that can perform an array of tasks and spare troops from potentially life-threatening missions.",
      "The Ukrainian army is especially eager to deploy what soldiers refer to as \u201crobots on wheels\u201d as it faces a shortage of soldiers in a war that has dragged on for more than 3 \u00bd years. The vehicles look like miniature tanks and can ferry supplies, clear mines and evacuate the wounded or dead.",

      "The robotic vehicles are mostly made by Ukrainian companies and range in cost from about $1,000 to as much as $64,000, depending on their size and capabilities.",

But Ukraine's extensive deployment of these vehicles is noteworthy and could lead to advances, Barry said.",

      "Day and night will get equal time for a brief moment Monday as much of the world heads into fall.",
      "The autumnal equinox arrives Monday, marking the start of the fall season for the Northern Hemisphere and the spring in the Southern Hemisphere. On the equator, the sun will be directly overhead at noon. Equinoxes are the only times when both the north and south poles are lit by sunshine at the same time.",
      "In the Northern Hemisphere, sunlight will gradually diminish each day until the winter solstice on Dec. 21.",
      "Equinoxes have been marked and celebrated worldwide for centuries. The fall equinox is often connected with harvest festivals in the Northern Hemisphere. For example, Dozynki, the harvest festival celebrated in Poland and other Eastern European countries, was thought to have been originally tied to the equinox. At the Mayan site Chichen Itza in Mexico, people gather during the equinox to watch the sun create a shadow pattern that resembles a serpent descending a building called El Castillo.",

      "As the Earth travels around the sun, it does so at an angle.",
      "For most of the year, the Earth\u2019s axis is tilted either toward or away from the sun. That means the sun\u2019s warmth and light fall unequally on the northern and southern halves of the planet.",
      "During the equinox, the Earth\u2019s axis and its orbit align so that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight.",
      "The word equinox comes from two Latin words, meaning equal and night. That\u2019s because on the equinox, day and night last almost the same amount of time \u2014 though one may get a few extra minutes, depending on where you are on the planet.",
      "The Northern Hemisphere\u2019s fall \u2014 or autumnal \u2014 equinox can land between Sept. 21 and 24, depending on the year. Its spring \u2014 or vernal \u2014 equinox can land between March 19 and 21.",

      "Here's a rundown of what the treaty is, why it matters and what is still to come.",
      "Formally known as the Agreement on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction, the treaty is the first legally binding agreement aimed at protecting marine biodiversity in international waters. These areas, which lie beyond the jurisdiction of any single country, account for nearly two-thirds of the ocean and nearly half of Earth\u2019s surface.",
      "Until now, no comprehensive legal framework existed to create marine protected areas or enforce conservation on the high seas.",
      "Despite their remoteness, the high seas are under growing pressure from overfishing, climate change and the threat of deep-sea mining. Environmental advocates warn that without proper protections, marine ecosystems in international waters face irreversible harm.",
      "\u201cUntil now, it has been the wild west on the high seas,\u201d said Megan Randles, global political lead for oceans at Greenpeace. \u201cNow we have a chance to properly put protections in place.\u201d",
      "The treaty is also essential to achieving what's known as the global \u201c30x30\u201d target \u2014 an international pledge to protect 30% of the planet\u2019s land and sea by 2030.",
      "The treaty creates a legal process for countries to establish marine protected areas in the high seas, including rules for potentially destructive activities like deep-sea mining and geoengineering. It also establishes a framework for technology-sharing, funding mechanisms and scientific collaboration among countries.",
      "Crucially, decisions under the treaty will be made multilaterally through what\u2019s called a conference of the parties rather than by individual countries acting alone.",

      "The first conference of the parties must be held within a year of the treaty taking effect. It will lay the groundwork for implementation, including decisions on governance, financing and the creation of key bodies to evaluate marine protection proposals.",
      "Environmental groups are pushing for even more countries to ratify the treaty and to do so quickly \u2014 the more countries that ratify, the stronger and more representative the treaty\u2019s implementation will be.

      "Days after Meagan Brazil-Sheehan\u2019s 6-year-old son was diagnosed with leukemia, they were walking down the halls of UMass Memorial Children\u2019s Medical Center when they ran into Robin the Robot.",
      "\u201cLuca, how are you?\u201d it asked in a high-pitched voice programmed to sound like a 7-year-old girl. \"It\u2019s been awhile.\u201d",

      "\u201cHis face lit up,\" she said about the interaction in June in Worcester, Massachusetts. \"It was so special because she remembered him.\u201d",
      "Robin is an artificial intelligence -powered therapeutic robot programed to act like a little girl as it provides emotional support at nursing homes and hospital pediatric units while helping combat staffing shortages. Five years after launching in the U.S., it has become a familiar face in 30 health care facilities in California, Massachusetts, New York and Indiana.",
      "\u201cNurses and medical staff are really overworked, under a lot of pressure, and unfortunately, a lot of times they don\u2019t have capacity to provide engagement and connection to patients,\u201d said Karen Khachikyan, CEO of Expper Technologies, which developed the robot. \u201cRobin helps to alleviate that part from them.\u201d",
      "As AI increasingly becomes a part of daily life, it's found a foothold in medical care \u2014 providing everything from note-taking during exams to electronic nurses. While heralded by some for the efficiency it brings, others worry about its impact on patient care.",
      "Robin is about 30% autonomous, while a team of operators working remotely controls the rest under the watchful eyes of clinical staff. Khachikyan said that with each interaction, they\u2019re able to collect more data \u2014 while still complying with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA \u2014 and get closer to it being able to function independently.",
      "\u201cImagine a pure emotional intelligence like WALL-E. We\u2019re trying to create that,\u201d he said, referencing the 2008 animated film.",
      "On a recent Friday, a staff member at HealthBridge Children\u2019s Hospital in Orange County, California, read off a list of patients she needed Robin to visit, along with the amount of time to spend with each one.",
      "The robot with a sleek white triangle-shaped frame that Khachikyan said was designed for hugging, rolled into a room with a teenager injured in a car accident. The robot played what it described as his favorite song \u2014 \u201cNo Fear\u201d by DeJ Loaf \u2014 and he danced along. In the hallway, Robin cracked up a young child held by her mother when it put on a series of silly glasses and a big red nose. In another room, the robot played a simplified version of tic-tac-toe with a patient.",
      "Samantha da Silva, speech language pathologist at the hospital, said patients light up when Robin comes into their room and not only remembers their names but their favorite music.",
      "\u201cShe brings joy to everyone,\u201d da Silva said. \u201cShe walks down the halls, everyone loves to chat with her, say hello.\u201d",
      "Robin mirrors the emotions of the person it is talking with, explained Khachikyan. If the patient is laughing then the robot laughs along, but if they're sharing something difficult, its face reflects sadness and empathy.",
      "In nursing homes, Robin plays memory games with people suffering from dementia, takes them through breathing exercises on difficult days and offers them a form of companionship that resembles a grandchild with a grandparent.",
      "Khachikyan recalled a moment last year at a facility in Los Angeles where a woman was having a panic attack and asked specifically for the robot. Robin played songs by her favorite musician and videos of her favorite animal \u2014 Elvis Presley and puppies \u2014 until she had calmed down.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to talk with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday in a push to finalize a deal to allow the popular social media app TikTok to keep operating in the United States.",
      "The call also may offer clues about whether the two leaders might meet in person to hash out a final agreement to end their trade war and provide clarity on where relations between the world's two superpowers may be headed.",
      "It would be the second call with Xi since Trump returned to the White House and launched sky-high tariffs on China, triggering back-and-forth trade restrictions that strained ties between the two largest economies. But Trump has expressed willingness to negotiate trade deals with Beijing, notably for the social video platform that faces a U.S. ban unless its Chinese parent company sells its controlling stake.",
      "The two men also spoke in June to defuse tensions over China\u2019s restrictions on the export of rare earth elements, used in everything from smartphones to fighter jets.",

      "He said his relationship with China is \u201cvery good\u201d but noted that Russia's war in Ukraine could end if European countries put higher tariffs on China. Trump didn\u2019t say if he planned to raise tariffs on Beijing over its purchase of Moscow's oil, as he has done with India.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Thursday didn\u2019t confirm the call or any upcoming summit between the leaders, but spokesperson Liu Pengyu said \u201cheads-of-state diplomacy plays an irreplaceable role in providing strategic guidance for China-U.S. relations.\u201d",
      "Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center, predicted a positive discussion.",
      "\u201cBoth sides have strong desire for the leadership summit to happen, while the details lie in the trade deal and what can be achieved for both sides from the summit,\u201d Sun said.",
      "Following a U.S.-China trade meeting earlier this week in Madrid, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the sides reached a framework deal on TikTok's ownership but Trump and Xi likely would finalize it Friday.",
      "Trump, who has credited the app with helping him win another term, has extended a deadline several times for the app to be spun off from its Chinese parent company ByteDance. It is a requirement to allow TikTok to keep operating in the U.S. under a law passed last year seeking to address data privacy and national security concerns.",

      "\u2014 After notching one of the summer\u2019s biggest box-office hauls, James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d has flown to HBO Max and is available there now. The film, the first from a rebooted DC Studios, stars David Cornswet as the Man of Steel, alongside Rachel Brosnahan\u2019s Lois Lane, Nicholas Hoult\u2019s Lex Luthor and Edi Gathegi\u2019s Mr. Terrific. After grossing some $615 million in ticket sales, a sequel has already been greenlit for \u201cSuperman.\u201d In my review, I praised Gunn\u2019s light and earnest touch: \u201cFor anyone who found Zack Snyder\u2019s previous administration painfully ponderous, this \u2018Superman,\u2019 at least, has a pulse.\u201d",

Set in the near future, a matchmaking service that identifies soul mates further complicates matters.",

But after being accosted by pushy local surfers, his world quickly disintegrates. In my review, I wrote: \u201cFor a long, sun-addled stretch, Lorcan Finnegan\u2019s beach-set \u2018The Surfer\u2019 simmers as a deliciously punishing nightmare, driving Nicolas Cage into his most natural state: a boil.\u201d",

      "The suit claimed stories by TMZ and Yahoo amplified and sensationalized the Times\u2019 reporting and smeared the tribe in the process. Yahoo was dismissed as a defendant earlier this month.",
      "Murillo wrote in her ruling that though some may \u201creasonably perceive\u201d the Times\u2019 and TMZ\u2019s reporting as \u201cinsensitive, disparaging or reflecting a lack of respect, the Court need not, and does not, determine which of these characterizations is most apt.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are pleased by the comprehensive and careful analysis undertaken by the court in dismissing this frivolous lawsuit,\" Danielle Rhoades Ha, a spokesperson for the Times, said in a statement Wednesday to The Associated Press. \"Our reporter traveled to the Amazon and provided a nuanced account of tension that arose when modern technology came to an isolated community.\u201d",

      "Nicas reported that in less than a year of Starlink access, the tribe was dealing with the same struggles the rest of the world has dealt with for years due to the pervasive effects of the internet. The challenges ranged from \u201cteenagers glued to phones; group chats full of gossip; addictive social networks; online strangers; violent video games; scams; misinformation; and minors watching pornography,\" Nicas wrote.",

      "Nicas wrote that he spent a week with the Marubo tribe. The lawsuit claimed that while he was invited for a week, he spent less than 48 hours in the village, \u201cbarely enough time to observe, understand, or respectfully engage with the community.\"",

      "Scientists in Colombia\u2019s Amazon are capturing and testing endangered pink river dolphins to monitor mercury contamination from illegal gold mining and deforestation",
      "PUERTO NARINO, Colombia -- A flash of pink breaks the muddy surface of the Amazon River as scientists and veterinarians, waist-deep in the warm current, patiently work a mesh net around a pod of river dolphins. They draw it tighter with each pass, and a spray of silver fish glistens under the harsh sun as they leap to escape the net.",
      "When the team hauls a dolphin into a boat, it thrashes as water streams from its pink-speckled sides and the crew quickly ferries it to the sandy riverbank where adrenaline-charged researchers lift it onto a mat. They have 15 minutes \u2014 the limit for how long a dolphin can safely be out of the water \u2014 to complete their work.",
      "Fernando Trujillo, a marine biologist leading the effort, kneels beside the animal\u2019s head, shielding its eye with a small cloth so it can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening. He rests his hand gently on the animal and speaks in low tones.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve never felt the palm of a hand. We try to calm them,\u201d said Trujillo, sporting a pink dolphin bandana. \u201cTaking a dolphin out of the water, it\u2019s a kind of abduction.\u201d",
      "One person counts the dolphin's breaths. Another wets its skin with a sponge while the others conduct multiple medical tests that will help show how much mercury is coursing through the Amazon\u2019s most graceful predators.",
      "Trujillo directs the Omacha Foundation, a conservation group focused on aquatic wildlife and river ecosystems, and leads health evaluations of river dolphins. It's a painstaking operation involving experienced fishermen, veterinarians and locals that takes months of planning and happens a couple of times a year.",
      "\u201cWe take blood and tissue samples to assess mercury,\u00a8 Trujillo told The Associated Press from the Colombian riverside town of Puerto Narino. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re using dolphins as sentinels for the river\u2019s health.\u201d",
      "Mercury contamination comes mainly from illegal gold mining \u2014 a growing industry across the Amazon Basin \u2014 and forest clearing that washes mercury that naturally occurs in soil into waterways.",
      "The miners use mercury to separate gold from sediment, then dump the sludge back into rivers, where it enters fish eaten by people and dolphins. Rising global gold prices have fueled a mining boom, and mercury pollution in remote waterways has increased.",
      "Mercury can damage the brain, kidneys, lungs and immune system and cause mood swings, memory loss and muscle weakness in people, according to the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Pregnant women and young children are most at risk, with prenatal exposure linked to developmental delays and reduced cognitive function.",
      "\u201cThe maximum any living being should have is 1 milligram per kilogram,\u201d Trujillo said. \u201cHere, we\u2019re seeing 20 to 30 times that amount.\u201d",
      "In previous years, his team found 16 to 18 milligrams per kilogram of mercury in dolphins, which can suffer the same neurological damage, organ damage and other problems as humans. In Colombia\u2019s Orinoco River, levels in some dolphins have reached as high as 42, levels scientists say are among the most extreme ever recorded in the species.",
      "Trujillo said it's difficult to prove the toxin is directly killing dolphins. Further studies are underway, he added, noting that \u201cany mammal with a huge amount of mercury will die.\u201d",
      "When Trujillo and his team tested their own blood three years ago, his results showed more than 36 times the safe limit \u2014 36.4 milligrams per kilogram \u2014 a level he attributes to decades working in mercury-affected areas and a diet heavy in fish. With medical assistance, his levels have dropped to about 7 milligrams.",
      "\u201cMercury is an invisible enemy until it builds up to a sufficient amount, then it starts to affect the central nervous system,\u201d Trujillo told AP after his team managed to capture and test four pink dolphins. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing evidence of it in Indigenous communities.\u201d",
      "A series of scientific studies and reports \u2014 including work by the International Pollutants Elimination Network and academic researchers \u2014 have found high mercury exposure among Indigenous peoples across the Amazon, including in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Suriname and Bolivia. Hair samples showed averages well above WHO's safe threshold of 1 part per million, with one Colombian community registering more than 22 milligrams per kilogram.",

      "BEIJING -- China's Huawei Technologies said Thursday that it would roll out the world's most powerful AI computing clusters over the next two years as it seeks to outperform global leaders despite relying on less powerful domestic semiconductors.",
      "China is racing to develop its own technology as America restricts what can be sold to China, including its most advanced chips. At the same time, the Chinese government has reportedly told companies to stop buying some American chips as it seeks to transform China into a global tech leader and one that is less reliant on imported components.",

      "\u201cThis is a significant milestone,\u201d said Charlie Dai, a technology analyst at the research firm Forrester Research. \"It signals a stronger push toward self-reliance and resilience in the face of export restrictions.\u201d",
      "Huawei announced plans to release the Atlas 950 and 960 superpods over the next two years. Dozens of the \u201cSuperPoDs,\u201d as Huawei brands them, could be connected to form what Huawei said would be the world\u2019s most powerful \u201cSuperClusters.\u201d",

      "Later that same day, Routh called his fianc\u00e9e from the Palm Beach County jail to tell her about his arrest, but she already knew. \u201cEverybody knows, it\u2019s been hours,\u201d the woman can be heard saying on a recording of the call. \u201cThe whole world knows.\u201d",
      "Routh is representing himself in federal court after being charged with trying kill Trump and is set to present his defense Monday, calling just three witnesses.",
      "Seasoned prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida rested their case Friday afternoon after spending seven days questioning 38 witnesses in an attempt to make sure Routh spends the rest of his life in prison.",
      "Prosecutors have said Routh spent weeks plotting to kill Trump before aiming a rifle through shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club.",
      "Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations.",
      "He told U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon on Friday that he only needs half a day or so to present his defense. He has indicated that he plans to call a firearms expert and two character witnesses. He hasn\u2019t said whether he plans to testify himself.",
      "Cannon signed off on Routh\u2019s request to represent himself following two hearings in July. Routh told the judge that his court-appointed federal public defenders were diligent, but they didn\u2019t listen to him and were afraid of him.",
      "\u201cHow are they supposed to represent me and say I\u2019m not a dangerous person when they don\u2019t believe that?\u201d Routh said in July.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has held that criminal defendants have a right to represent themselves in court proceedings, as long as they can show a judge they are competent to waive their right to be defended by an attorney. Routh's former defense attorneys have served as standby counsel since Routh took over his own defense and have been present during trial the past two weeks.",
      "Cannon said attorneys should be prepared to deliver their closing arguments Tuesday, giving each side one hour and 45 minutes. Jurors will begin deliberating after that. Cannon had initially blocked off more than three weeks for the trial at the Fort Pierce federal courthouse, but Routh's relatively short cross-examinations have led to a quicker pace than anticipated.",

      "Yet, that\u2019s just what the Louisiana State Police did, an Associated Press investigation has found. After waiting months to analyze the graphic video and more than a year to even interview Brown, the agency cleared the deputies of wrongdoing. The state police ultimately supported the deputies\u2019 claims that Brown had been the \u201caggressor\" in an altercation that took place after he had been arrested on charges of stealing a car.",

He agreed to a permanent ban from law enforcement in exchange for the charges being dismissed. In another case, a DeSoto Parish deputy was charged with third-degree rape after ordering a woman he arrested to perform oral sex on him.",
      "Russell Graham, a state police spokesperson, declined to explain his agency\u2019s conclusion that there \u201cwas not sufficient evidence\u201d the deputies in Brown's case committed a crime. He attributed delays in the investigation to the COVID-19 pandemic, which began six months after the beating.",

      "A Missouri judge has struck down ballot summary for an anti-abortion amendment backed by Republican state lawmakers",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- A Missouri judge has struck down a ballot summary for an anti-abortion amendment backed by Republican state lawmakers while concluding that it presented an unfair and insufficient description to voters.",
      "Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green ruled Friday that the ballot summary must be rewritten, but he rejected a request by abortion-rights advocates to block the proposed constitutional amendment from going to voters.",
      "The judge said the summary prepared by Republican lawmakers failed to inform voters that the new measure would repeal an abortion-rights amendment adopted by voters last year. He directed the secretary of state's office to write a new summary.",
      "The ruling marks the latest in a series of twists and turns in Missouri\u2019s abortion policies over the past three years.",
      "When the U.S. Supreme Court ended a nationwide right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, that triggered a Missouri law to take effect banning abortions \u201cexcept in cases of medical emergency.\u201d But abortion-rights activists then gathered initiative petition signatures to put their own measure on the ballot.",
      "Last November, Missouri voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy. That measure, known as Amendment 3, also allows later abortions to protect the life or health of pregnant women and creates a \u201cfundamental right to reproductive freedom\u201d that includes birth control, prenatal and postpartum care and \u201crespectful birthing conditions.\u201d",
      "In May, the Republican-led Legislature shut down Democratic opposition and approved a new referendum that would repeal Amendment 3 and instead allow abortions only for a medical emergency or fetal anomaly, or in cases of rape or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. That proposed amendment also would prohibit gender transition surgeries, hormone treatments and puberty blockers for minors, which already are barred under state law.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates had argued in a lawsuit that the entire measure should be stricken, alleging that the combination of abortion and transgender policies violated a constitutional requirement that amendments contain only one subject. But Green agreed with Republican lawmakers that both topics fit under the measure's title of \u201creproductive health care.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has signed a proclamation that will require a new, $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Friday signed a proclamation that will require a $100,000 annual visa fee for highly-skilled foreign workers and rolled out a $1 million \u201cgold card\u201d visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals, moves that face near-certain legal challenges amid widespread criticism he is sidestepping Congress.",
      "If the moves survive legal muster, they will deliver staggering price increases. The visa fee for skilled workers would jump from $215. The fee for investor visas, which are common in many European countries, would climb from $10,000-$20,000 a year.",
      "H-1B visas, which require at least a bachelor's degree, are meant for high-skilled jobs that tech companies find difficult to fill. Critics say the program is a pipeline for overseas workers who are often willing to work for as little as $60,000 annually, well below the $100,000-plus salaries typically paid to U.S. technology workers.",
      "Trump on Friday insisted that the tech industry would not oppose the move. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said \u201call big companies\u201d are on board.",
      "Representatives for the biggest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Friday. Microsoft declined to comment.",
      "Lutnick said the change will likely result in far fewer H-1B visas than the 85,000 annual cap allows because \u201cit\u2019s just not economic anymore.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to train people, you\u2019re going to train Americans.\u201d Lutnick said on a conference call with reporters. \"If you have a very sophisticated engineer and you want to bring them in ... then you can pay $100,000 a year for your H-1B visa.\u201d",
      "Trump also announced he will start selling a \u201cgold card\u201d visa with a path to U.S. citizenship for $1 million after vetting. For companies, it will cost $2 million to sponsor an employee.",
      "The \u201cTrump Platinum Card\u201d will be available for a $5 million and allow foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being subject to U.S. taxes on non-U.S. income. Trump announced a $5 million gold card in February to replace an existing investor visa \u2014 this is now the platinum card.",
      "Lutnick said the gold and platinum cards would replace employment-based visas that offer paths to citizenship, including for professors, scientists, artists and athletes.",
      "Critics of H-1Bs visas who say they are used to replace American workers applauded the move. U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group, called it \u201cthe next best thing\u201d to abolishing the visas altogether.",

      "Lutnick said the H-1B fees and gold card could be introduced by the president but the platinum card needs congressional approval.",
      "Historically, H-1B visas have been doled out through lottery. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient of H-1B visas with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google. Geographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers.",
      "Critics say H-1B spots often go to entry-level jobs, rather than senior positions with unique skill requirements. And while the program isn\u2019t supposed to undercut U.S. wages or displace U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay less by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even if the specific workers hired have more experience.",
      "As a result, many U.S. companies find it cheaper to contract out help desks, programming and other basic tasks to consulting companies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tata in India and IBM and Cognizant in the U.S. These consulting companies hire foreign workers, often from India, and contract them out to U.S. employers looking to save money.",

      "Major technology companies that use H-1B visas sought changes after massive increases in bids left their employees and prospective hires with slimmer chances of winning the random lottery. Facing what it acknowledged was likely fraud and abuse, USCIS this year said each employee had only one shot at the lottery, whether the person had one job offer or 50.",
      "Critics welcomed the change but said more needs to be done. The AFL-CIO wrote last year that while changes to the lottery \u201cincluded some steps in the right direction,\u201d it fell short of needed reforms. The labor group wants visas awarded to companies that pay the highest wages instead of by random lottery, a change that Trump sought during his first term in the White House.",

      "That all changed in June when authorities in Oregon called Nagle \u201cout of the blue\u201d to ask about comparing her DNA to a cold case known as \u201cSwamp Mountain Jane Doe,\u201d she said. Nagle\u2019s DNA ultimately helped confirm that the remains of a woman found near a mountain creek in Oregon\u2019s Central Cascades in 1976 were that of her sister, Marion Vinetta Nagle McWhorter.",
      "Oregon State Police publicly released the news this week after the remains were identified in June.",
      "\u201cI was very surprised that they called,\u201d Nagle, a 62-year-old who lives in Seattle, told The Associated Press. She was 11 when her sister went missing. \u201cI was really glad that they found me through DNA.\u201d",
      "McWhorter was last seen at a shopping mall in the Portland suburb of Tigard when she was 21.",
      "She was the oldest of five siblings, and Nagle was the youngest. Their mother was Alaska Native of the Ahtna Athabascan people, Nagle said, and her big sister had been named for an aunt who died in a boarding school for Indigenous children in Alaska in 1940.",
      "High rates of disappearances of Indigenous people, particularly women, have festered for generations amid inadequate public safety resources.",
      "Nagle, who lived in New York with her parents and one of her brothers at the time of her sister's disappearance, said her mother may have contacted authorities but that she wasn\u2019t sure of the exact extent of the efforts made by her parents to find her sister.",
      "\u201cI mean, there were, you know, efforts to search, but it was limited,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have that much to go on.\u201d",

      "Nearly 20 years later, the aunt shared another detail with Nagle: When McWhorter called her that day, she told her that a man in a white pickup truck had offered to give her a ride. It was unclear why her aunt waited that long to share that information.",

      "Americans' grocery bills are growing, causing some shoppers to cut back on discretionary spending as they find themselves struggling to afford the basics.",
      "Food prices grew by half a percent from July to August, marking the fastest monthly rate of change since the fall of 2022. Behind the rising cost of food items on store shelves are three main culprits, according to experts.",
      "The Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, climate change and a shortage of agricultural workers in the U.S. are the leading causes of grocery inflation, Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst also known as the \"Supermarket Guru,\" told CBS News correspondent Jo Ling Kent.",
      "Price hikes, he added, have been steepest on goods that the U.S. imports from nations facing higher levies. For example, the U.S. imports about 35% of its coffee from Brazil, whose exports are taxed at a rate of 50%.",
      "The latest Consumer Price Index data shows that coffee prices rose 21% in August compared with a year ago.",
      "As companies see their costs rise, they pass along those burdens to consumers. In the case of tariffs, some businesses began raising prices on products even before the levies were in full force.",
      "\"There's no question that what we've seen is, we're seeing companies increased prices because of the impending tariffs,\" said Lempert.",
      "\"What they want to do is they want to protect themselves. A lot of these big food companies are public companies. So what they've gotta do is they've gotta report back to their shareholders on profit margins. So they've been hedging their bets,\" Lempert said.",
      "Sometimes, packaged-goods companies disguise price hikes by offering consumers less product for the same amount of money. The covert inflation strategy has been dubbed \"shrinkflation,\" Lempert explained.",
      "\"What they're doing is they're trying to put less in the package, hoping that you and I are not gonna observe that and keep that price either stable or just slightly increased,\" he said",
      "Climate change",
      "Increasing temperatures and\u00a0shifts in weather patterns have made conditions for growing some fruits and vegetables in the U.S. inhospitable. As a result, a lot of domestic production has been moved to Central and Latin America, according to Lempert.",
      "\"We can't grow our food where we used to grow it,\" he said.",
      "Labor shortage",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump's immigration policies, including raids on workplaces that employ large numbers of immigrants, plus waning interest in agricultural work, have led to an industrywide labor shortage, Lempert explained.",
      "Consumers are reacting to higher prices by looking for deals, purchasing store brand goods instead of name-brands and buying shelf-stable groceries in bulk at shopping clubs like Costco.",
      "Lempert said a little planning can go a long way to ensure that consumers can buy what they need.",
      "\"The number one thing that people want to do if they want to save money \u2014 stop wasting food,\" Lempert said.",
      "\"Forty percent of all of our food in this country is wasted. A lot of that's in our homes. So, take doggy bags from restaurants, use leftovers, freeze leftovers, don't waste food and you'll save a substantial amount of money,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:20:31 -0400",
    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal in the works between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok could include a licensing agreement for the closely guarded secret of the social media company's algorithm, to which access has proved a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. In the meantime, an agreement between the U.S. and China appears to be moving forward. Mr. Trump on Friday said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have\u00a0\"made progress\" in talks over a potential deal to resolve the dispute over TikTok's ownership.",
      "Although key elements of the framework deal remain unclear, when some details were released earlier this week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, thinks ByteDance executives may be urging the Chinese government to strike a deal so the company can continue earning revenue from the algorithm, while maintaining a foothold in the U.S.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "How would a TikTok licensing deal work?",
      "Mr. Trump, asked Thursday about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. So exactly how a licensing deal would work remains unclear, including whether ByteDance could maintain any sort of outside control over TikTok's algorithm once ownership transfers to U.S. owners.",
      "\"What I understand is they would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use it under certain terms,\" said Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization. \"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it.\"",
      "Kreps added that in retaining a measure of ownership over the algorithm, ByteDance could have the right to access internal TikTok metrics and influence how content is ranked in the U.S., akin to how a software vendor can patch or upgrade licensed software.",
      "The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter,\u00a0said\u00a0this week that TikTok would create a new U.S. app and that the company's engineers would re-create content-recommendation algorithms using technology licensed from ByteDance.",
      "A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the contours of the U.S.-China framework deal over TikTok. \"Any details of the TikTok framework are pure speculation unless they are announced by this administration,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, Akoto, the American University assistant professor, said the new arrangement would have to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "When Jingtao, the deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, spoke to the press earlier this week, he indicated the U.S. and China have agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, although its unclear how exactly that would work.",

But the president has repeatedly delayed enforcement of the law through executive action.",

      "As part of a broader investment strategy, Hyundai said it would spend $2.7 billion to increase production capacity at the Ellabell site by 200,000 over the next three years, to a total of 500,000 vehicles a year.",
      "The company first announced the expansion in March at the grand opening of the plant west of Savannah, and had said in August that it would invest an additional $5 billion in the United States overall. But the raid, which included arrests of more than 300 South Korean citizens, led to questions about the wisdom of the Asian nation investing in the U.S.",
      "The company said it now plans to produce 10 models of electric and hybrid gas-electric vehicles in Georgia, up from the current two the plant has been assembling as it ramps up production. Hyundai says it's still on track to expand production worldwide to 5.6 million vehicles a year by 2030. The automaker pledged that 60% of those vehicles will be electric or hybrid powered, targeting sales in South Korea, North America and Europe.",
      "Hyundai said that it plans to make more than 80% of vehicles sold in the United States domestically by 2030, with total domestic content increasing from 60% to 80%. For the first time, the vehicles would include a mid-sized pickup truck, a key vehicle class in the U.S. market. The company already makes the Santa Cruz model, a four-door compact pickup, that it started selling in 2021.",
      "Hyundai CEO Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz has said the immigration raid will delay opening\u00a0the battery plant by at least two to three months. Spokesperson Michael Stewart said Thursday that the facility will open in the first half of 2026.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut-september-2025-rates-loans-mortgages/",
    "published": "Thu, 18 Sep 2025 13:27:19 -0400",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut since December could be followed by more reductions later in 2025. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday delivered its first rate cut since December, a move that will ripple through everything from home loans to credit cards, although not all Americans will notice the change in the same way.",
      "The Fed cut reduces its federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one-quarter point, shaving its target range to between 4% and 4.25%, down from its prior range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "Though incremental, the policy turn is significant. Fed officials foresee two additional cuts in 2025 and one more in 2026, a trajectory that could lower rates by a full percentage point and lighten the load for millions of borrowers. For now, the quarter-point reduction will trickle through unevenly: some borrowers will see relief almost immediately, while others may notice little change, depending on their rates and the products they hold, according to experts.",
      "\"Any reduction is welcome, and especially if this is the first of several to come, which it sounds like it might be,\"Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, said in a statement. \"That's a positive thing.\"",
      "One area where Schulz doesn't expect consumers to see significant change is on credit card rates. While banks will lower their annual percentage rates in response to the cut, it's probably not going to make much of a dent for people who carry a balance, given that the average APR currently stands at about 20%.",
      "\"That quarter point isn't going to make that much of a difference,\" Schulz said.",
      "Here's where you're most likely to feel an immediate impact from the Fed's reduction \u2014 for better and worse.",
      "Home equity line of credit",
      "A home equity line of credit (HELOC) represents one of the financial products where the Fed rate cut could provide a bigger bang for borrowers' bucks.",
      "A HELOC is a line of credit based on the value of your home. In some ways, it is similar to a credit card, because it provides a maximum credit line that borrowers can draw down and their interest rates are variable \u2014 which means they rise and fall based on the prime rate, which in turn is influenced by the fed funds rate.",
      "If you have a HELOC, you can expect your rate to decline by one-quarter point within a month or two, according to Bankrate. The average HELOC today has a rate of about 8.05%, the financial site notes.",
      "\"HELOCs are one of the types of loans that tend to be directly impacted, so if you do have a HELOC, that quarter-point reduction can be pretty significant,\" Schulz said.",
      "According to CBS News' Managing Your Money, that 0.25 percentage-point reduction could trim a borrowers' costs on a $100,000 HELOC by about $173 annually. Bigger savings could be in store if the Fed carries through with additional rate cuts later this year and in early 2026.",
      "Mortgages",
      "House hunters enjoyed a preemptive benefit from the Fed rate cut, as mortgage rates have declined this month in anticipation of lower rates.",
      "Average rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.35%\u00a0this week, its lowest level in nearly a year. Just two years ago, mortgages approached 8%, hitting their\u00a0highest levels since 2000.",
      "Mortgage rates aren't set by the Fed, but they're heavily influenced by its policy moves, as well as bond market investors' expectations for economic growth and inflation.",
      "\"It's not just about what the Fed is doing today, it's about what they're expected to do in the future, and that's determined by things like economic growth, what's going to happen in the labor market and what do we think inflation is going to be like over the next year or so,\" Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, told AP News.",
      "While additional rate cuts later this year aren't guaranteed to result in lower home loan rates, it's a possibility, said Stephen Kates, financial analyst at Bankrate.",
      "\"It means that they probably could go down more, and they may trend in that direction, even if they don't move in lockstep,\" he added.",
      "High-interest savings accounts",
      "Unfortunately, the Fed's rate cut could have a negative impact on one group: Savers.",
      "Since the Fed started hiking rates in 2022 to battle soaring inflation, high-interest savings accounts and certificates of deposit have been the silver lining for consumers. People who had money to sock away in one of those accounts or a CD could get rates as high as 5% in 2024.",
      "Currently, savers can still find high-interest savings accounts offering 4%, but those might drop soon as banks adjust their offers to reflect the Fed's rate reduction, Schulz said.",
      "\"Expect yields on high-interest savings accounts and CDs to drop. Savers may want to act now by locking in today's still-high rates before they fall further,\" he noted.",

    "published": "Thu, 18 Sep 2025 12:36:22 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to allow President Trump to fire Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to allow President Trump to remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors while a legal challenge to her firing moves forward.",
      "In its request for emergency relief from the high court, the Justice Department said that the justices should freeze a lower court decision that ordered Cook to be reinstated to her post on the Fed Board.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled earlier this week that Cook could remain\u00a0in her role while a legal challenge to her firing moves forward.",
      "Mr. Trump's emergency appeal to the high court comes after Cook participated in a two-day meeting of the Fed's committee that sets interest rates this week. The central bank on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, its first cut since December. The president has repeatedly criticized the Fed for moving too slowly to lower interest rates.",
      "\"That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the request to the Supreme Court. \"Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself \u2014 and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations.\"",
      "Lisa Cook's firing",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook last month over allegations she made misrepresentations on mortgage filings. She has not been charged with any crime and denies wrongdoing. Cook's removal by Mr. Trump was unprecedented \u2014 no president has attempted to remove a Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history. Critics warned that it threatened the independence of the Fed.",
      "Cook swiftly filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing her removal violated the Federal Reserve Act. The law specifies that a president can only remove a governor \"for cause.\" Cook also argued her due process rights were violated because she was not provided notice of the allegations against her and a meaningful opportunity to respond.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb sided with Cook earlier this month, finding that her firing likely violated the Federal Reserve Act and her right to due process under the Fifth Amendment. She ordered Cook to be reinstated to her post on the Fed Board.",
      "The Trump administration sought emergency relief from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which left Cobb's order intact. Judge Bradley Garcia wrote in a concurring opinion that Cook is likely to succeed in her claim that Mr. Trump's attempt to terminate her violated her due process rights. But he wrote that the court did not need to address the meaning of \"for cause\" at this stage in the case.",
      "The White House had said the administration would seek the Supreme Court's intervention, as it has done in several other legal challenges to Mr. Trump's efforts to remove Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies. The high court has so far allowed the president to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission, but it acknowledged in May that the Fed is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "In his filing, Sauer argued that Cook received adequate notice and opportunity to contest her removal.",
      "\"The President notified Cook of the charges against her and waited five days for her to respond before removing her,\" he wrote. \"Having declined to bring any defense to the President's attention or to dispute any material facts, Cook cannot complain about insufficient process.\"",
      "The solicitor general noted that the administration is not contesting the constitutionality of the for-cause removal protection for members of the Fed Board, but instead believes the president's firing of Cook complies with it. Still, Sauer said the district court's finding that conduct that occurred before Cook was appointed to the Fed does not constitute \"cause\" under the Federal Reserve Act\u00a0 was \"flawed.\"",
      "\"The President's strong concerns about the appearance of mortgage fraud, based on facially contradictory representations made to obtain mortgages by someone whose job is to set interest rates that affect Americans' mortgages, satisfies any conception of cause,\" he wrote. \"That is especially true here, where Cook has not disputed any material fact or offered any plausible justification for her conduct.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced last month that he was\u00a0firing Cook, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, from the Fed Board of Governors and had \"sufficient cause\" to oust her. Cook's 14-year-term on the Fed is set to end in January 2038.",
      "The president cited as grounds for her removal claims made by Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that Cook made false statements on mortgage documents.",
      "Pulte alleged in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that Cook claimed two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence on mortgage documents from 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Pulte, who was appointed to lead the FHFA by Mr. Trump, has continued to make accusations against Cook related to mortgage documents.",
      "Cook's lawyers have said she \"did not ever commit mortgage fraud.\" Documents obtained by The Associated Press this week showed that Cook referred to the property as a \"vacation home\" in a loan estimate, potentially undercutting the Trump administration's claims of fraud.",

    "story": [
      "Starbucks workers in three states took legal action against the coffee giant Wednesday, saying it violated the law when it changed its dress code but refused to reimburse employees who had to buy new clothes.",
      "The employees, who are backed by the union organizing Starbucks' workers, filed class-action lawsuits in state court in Illinois and Colorado. Workers also filed complaints with California's Labor and Workforce Development Agency. If the agency decides not to seek penalties against Starbucks, the workers intend to file a class-action lawsuit in California, according to the complaints.",
      "Starbucks didn't comment directly on them Wednesday, but the company said it simplified its dress code to deliver a more consistent experience to customers and give its employees clearer guidance.",
      "\"As part of this change, and to ensure out partners were prepared, partners received two shirts at no cost,\" the company said Wednesday. Starbucks refers to its employees as \"partners.\"",
      "The dress code sparked a strike at 75 U.S. stores in May soon after it went into effect, with more than 1,000 workers protesting the new policy, according to Starbucks Workers United, which represents workers at 640 of Starbucks' 10,000 company-owned U.S. stores. The union said the dress code should be subject to collective bargaining but isn't a party to the suits.",
      "The new dress code requires all workers in North America to wear a solid black shirt with short or long sleeves under their green aprons. Shirts may or may not have collars, but they must cover the midriff and armpits.",
      "Employees must wear khaki, black or blue denim bottoms without patterns or frayed hems or solid black dresses that are not more than 4 inches above the knee. The dress code also requires workers to wear black, gray, dark blue, brown, tan or white shoes made from a waterproof material. Socks and hosiery must be \"subdued,\" the company said.",
      "The dress code prohibits employees from having face tattoos or more than one facial piercing. Tongue piercings and \"theatrical makeup\" are also prohibited.",
      "Starbucks said in April that the new dress code would make employees' green aprons stand out and create a sense of familiarity for customers. It comes as the company is trying to reestablish a warmer, more welcoming experience in its stores.",
      "Before the new dress code was imposed, Starbucks had a relatively lax policy. In 2016, it began allowing employees to wear patterned shirts in a wider variety of colors to give them more opportunities for self-expression.",
      "The old dress code was also loosely enforced, according to the Colorado lawsuit. But under the new dress code, employees who don't comply aren't allowed to start their shifts.",
      "Brooke Allen, a full-time student who also works at a Starbucks in Davis, California, said she was told by a manager in July that the Crocs she was wearing didn't meet the new standards and she would have to wear different shoes if she wanted to work the following day. Allen had to go to three stores to find a compliant pair, which cost her $60.09.",

      "\"It looks sad now that everyone is wearing black,\" she said.",
      "The lawsuits and complaints filed Wednesday allege that Starbucks' dress code violates state laws that require companies to reimburse workers for expenses that primarily benefit the employer. Colorado law also prohibits employers from imposing expenses on workers without their written consent, according to that lawsuit. The plaintiffs seek damages on behalf of all Starbucks workers in those states, whether or not their stores are unionized.",
      "Multiple plaintiffs, like Allen, said they requested reimbursement from Starbucks to conform to the dress code but were denied. Gilbert Cruz, an employee in Aurora, Illinois, requested $10 for the cost of removing a nose piercing.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points \u2014 its first cut since December \u2014 as the U.S. grapples with a stalling labor market and slower economic growth.",
      "The Fed cut reduces the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 4% and 4.25%, down from its prior range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The last time the central bank eased borrowing costs was in December 2024, when it also trimmed rates by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "Federal Reserve officials are also penciling in two more rate cuts in 2025, but only one in 2026, according to the central bank's summary of economic projections. That may disappoint Wall Street, with investors before the meeting projecting a total of five cuts over the rest of the year and 2026.",
      "According to those median\u00a0projections, Fed officials expect the nation's unemployment rate, currently 4.3%, to reach 4.5% by year-end before ticking down to 4.4% in 2026 and 4.3% the following year.",
      "Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) \u2014 the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation \u2014 is forecast to level off at 3% this year, well above the central bank's 2% annual target, before receding to 2.6% next year and 2.1% in 2027. The median projections for core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, forecast PCE of 3.1% this year.",
      "The move comes as the Fed contends with a two-fold economic challenge: curbing inflation, which has flared in recent months, while supporting job growth, which has slumped. The Fed typically seeks to tame inflation by nudging up interest rates to slow economic growth, while cutting rates in periods when the economy is faltering to encourage consumer spending and business investment.",
      "\"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" Powell said in a press conference following the Fed's two-day meeting.",
      "He added that recent labor data shows that what he termed \"people at the margins,\" which he said include recent college grads, are now having a harder time finding employment.",
      "\"The overall job-finding rate is very, very low, but the layoff rate is also very low,\" Powell noted. \"The concern is that if you start to see layoffs, the people who are laid off, there won't be a lot of hiring going on.\"",
      "In acting to lower interest rates, the Fed is signaling that it views the slowing labor market as a more pressing concern than rising prices, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell underlined at his\u00a0Jackson Hole address\u00a0last month in Wyoming.",
      "\"Concerns for the labor market's health are rising,\" said Cory Stahle, economist in the Indeed Hiring Lab, in a statement after the Fed's decision. \"Unemployment and layoffs are relatively stable at historically low levels, which is encouraging, but they are unlikely to stay that way if labor market conditions deteriorate further.\"",
      "At the same time, Powell said the Fed now views the pass-through of the Trump administration's tariff as being \"smaller and slower\" than central bank officials had expected earlier this year. \"We continue to expect [inflation] to move up, maybe not as much as we would have a few months ago,\" he said.",
      "The rate cut comes amid intense political pressure on the Fed, with President Trump repeatedly accusing Powell of moving too slowly to ease borrowing costs and shore up economic activity.",
      "Mr. Trump is also seeking to put his imprint on the Fed. To that end, he has\u00a0sought to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook from her seat on the central bank's board, alleging that she engaged in mortgage fraud. She has denied committing fraud and challenged Mr. Trump's authority to fire her, with an appeals court ruling Monday that Cook can keep her job.",
      "One vote for a jumbo cut",
      "An economic adviser to Mr. Trump, Stephen Miran, was\u00a0confirmed by the Senate\u00a0on Monday to take an open spot on the Fed's Board of Governors. He will also sit on the 12-member Federal Open Markets Committee, or FOMC, which sets interest rates for the Fed.",
      "\"Stephen Miran was a last-minute addition to the FOMC, but his vote won't drastically alter the outcome. He joined too late to submit an economic projection and path for monetary policy,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a report this week ahead of the Fed's rate cut.",
      "All of the voting FOMC members except one \u2014 Miran \u2014 voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, according to the central bank's statement. Miran voted for a larger cut of 0.50 percentage points, the Fed noted.",
      "A key question for consumers and businesses is whether the Fed trimming borrowing costs for the first time in nearly a year augurs additional cuts in 2025 and heading into 2026. Fed officials have two more meetings this year, set for October and December.",
      "Although the FOMC members were largely united on the size of today's cut, their projections of future cuts show a difference of opinion about the path of monetary policy moving forward. Many of the group's members don't expect the panel to make any more cuts this year, according to the summary of economic projections.",
      "\"That median hides the deep split on the FOMC \u2013\u2013 nine of 19 members don't anticipate further cuts this year,\" Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report.",
      "Powell noted that a quarter-point cut isn't likely to make a huge difference to the economy, but added, \"You have to look at the path\" of future cuts expected later this year and in 2026. \"It starts with a 25 basis point cut \u2014 it's not just one action,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Americans could get some financial relief next year when the IRS adjusts its federal income tax brackets for inflation, a change that could help lower taxes for millions of households.",
      "Each fall \u2014 typically in October or November \u2014 the IRS announces inflation adjustments that affects everything from the tax brackets people are subject to based on their income to the size of the standard deduction. Some experts are already projecting those changes by analyzing the same inflation data the tax agency uses as part its annual reset.",
      "Based on that analysis, the IRS is likely to apply an inflation rate of 2.7% in adjusting its brackets and other items, according to Bloomberg Tax. It based its projection on chained Consumer Price Index data for the past 12 months.",
      "Separately, the bottom two tax brackets will see a bigger adjustment next year because of the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which applies a more generous inflation bump for those bands. Those brackets will see a roughly 4% increase in their income thresholds next year, Bloomberg Tax calculated.",
      "The IRS tweaks those thresholds to avoid so-called \"bracket creep,\" which can occur if the bands fail to keep up with inflation. Without those annual adjustments, workers who get a cost-of-living pay increase could be pushed into a higher tax bracket even though their standard of living hasn't changed.",
      "\"If they didn't do it year after year, for example with the standard deduction, it would become less and less meaningful each year for taxpayers,\" Amber Gorski, an analyst at Bloomberg Tax and Accounting, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In other words, you'll have to earn more income next year to reach each higher band of taxation. For instance, a single taxpayer who earns $50,000 in 2025 would have a top tax rate of 22%, but in 2026 their highest marginal rate would be 12%, according to Bloomberg's projections.",
      "How the adjustments could impact you",
      "Some Americans could see a tax break due to the higher thresholds for each bracket.",
      "\"Going into 2026, they could use that information to estimate what their tax return potentially is going to be, and what they might owe in taxes,\" Gorski said.",
      "On top of the higher income thresholds for 2026, some seniors and workers could also benefit from changes implemented under the \"big, beautiful\" bill. Those include an extra $6,000 senior deduction and the elimination of some taxes on tipped income and overtime pay for qualifying workers.",
      "The passage of the tax and spending bill in July ensures that next year's tax bracket rates will remain the same. That means the individual tax rates will remain at 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%, although the thresholds for each band will edge higher because of the inflation adjustments.",
      "Without the new tax law, enacted \u00a0by President Trump in July, the bracket rates would have reverted to their levels before the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Prior to that law, for instance, the highest individual income bracket stood at 39.6%.",
      "The IRS has based its annual inflation adjustments on the so-called\u00a0\"chained Consumer Price Index,\"\u00a0as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Bloomberg notes that some of its projections could vary slightly from the IRS' official announcement, which typically arrives in October.",
      "\"The IRS will issue authoritative guidance, as it usually does, sometime between mid-October and early November,\" an IRS spokesman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "How tax brackets work",
      "There's a common misconception that your top tax rate is what you pay on the entire amount of your annual income, but that's incorrect. Each bracket represents the percentage you'll pay in taxes on each slice of income within that band.",
      "Take the example of the worker who earns $50,000 per year. In 2026, that taxpayer would pay 10% on the first $12,400 of earned income, and then 12% on any income above $12,401 and up to $50,400.",

At least six types of arthropods were found preserved, according to the study.",
      "Almost all known amber deposits from the past 130 million years have been in the Northern Hemisphere, and it's long been \"an enigma\" that scientists have found few in southern regions that once comprised the supercontinent Gondwana, said David Grimaldi, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the discovery.",
      "This marks the first time researchers have identified ancient beetles, flies, ants and wasps in fossilized tree resin in South America, said Ricardo P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente, a paleoentomologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, who also was not involved in the new study.",
      "\"Amber pieces are little windows into the past,\" P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente said, adding that the discovery will help researchers understand the evolving interactions between flowering plants and insects that lived during the era of the dinosaurs.",
      "The researchers uncovered hundreds of fragments of amber, some containing ancient insects, pollen and tree leaves, at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador that's on the edge of what is today the Amazon basin.",
      "Two types of amber were discovered, according to the study: There was a more common form of amber found around the roots of resin-producing plants, and a rarer form of the material formed from resin exposed to air. The amber formed around the roots did not hold any specimens, the study said.",
      "\"A different kind of forest\"",
      "The discoveries provide evidence that the area was once a \"humid, resinous forest ecosystem,\" according to the study.",

    "story": [
      "In the forests of Uganda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, chimps crowd into fig and plum trees, feasting on fruit that's sweet, soft and just a little boozy. A new study shows those daily snacks quietly add up to the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages for humans.",
      "A team of scientists at University of California Berkeley and other institutions tested the fruit chimps actually snack on: figs in Uganda's canopy and the plum-like fruits on the forest floor in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Collecting the data wasn't easy \u2014 with little electricity beyond solar panels and constant humidity threatening the instruments, researchers spent three seasons hauling equipment and calibrating test kits to measure alcohol in many different tropical fruits.",
      "In the end, they found that on average, the fruit's alcohol content came in at about .3% by weight. This is kombucha-level, but when chimpanzees eat 10 pounds of fruit a day and weigh around 90 pounds, it adds up to about 14 grams of ethanol, equating to about two cocktails for a human.",
      "But don't picture chimps swinging drunkenly from the trees. To actually get drunk, they'd have to binge on fruit until their bellies ballooned, the researchers said. Instead, they're exposed to a steady low dose, a quiet buzz from nature's own fermentation process.",
      "Senior author of the paper and UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology Robert Dudley first floated the \"drunken monkey\" hypothesis in 2000, arguing that our attraction to alcohol could come from ancestral fruit-eating habits. Dudley argued that it makes sense primates would be tuned to alcohol, since their diets have long revolved around ripe fruit.",
      "\"Once you start eating, it acts as an aperitif,\" he said. \"The pleasure of association with drinking alcohol increases feeding rates.\"",
      "Other animals chase the same buzz too.",
      "\"Open a bottle of beer outside and a fruit fly appears almost instantly,\" Dudley said.",
      "Spider monkeys in Panama, slow lorises in Malaysia and even elephants have been documented consuming naturally fermented fruit or nectar.",
      "What makes this study different is that it provides the first direct chemical measurements of ethanol in the fruits that wild chimps routinely eat, and then connects those numbers to daily intake.",
      "The open question is whether chimps are actually selecting fruit for its alcohol content or just chasing sugar and calories. Either way, Dudley says the story connects to us.",
      "\"We inherited the taste for alcohol,\" Dudley said. \"Even though our diets have diversified \u2026 that bias to consume quickly when this molecule is present could still be a powerful force.\"",

      "A new research, conducted by two NASA scientists and published earlier in September in the peer-reviewed\u00a0Astrophysical Journal Letters, shows that solar activity has ramped up after 2008 \u2014 an unexpected reversal following a decades-long decline that was initially thought to foreshadow a period of historic inaction on the surface of the sun.",
      "\"All signs were pointing to the Sun going into a prolonged phase of low activity,\" Jamie Jasinski, a space plasma physicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the study's lead author, said in a statement. \"So it was a surprise to see that trend reversed.

      "An uptick in solar activity could influence space weather, potentially leading to more solar storms,\u00a0solar flares\u00a0and coronal mass ejections, the researchers found. Space weather patterns have the potential to directly impact spacecraft operations and the safety of astronauts, but\u00a0they may be felt on Earth, too, as space weather can affect power grids, GPS systems and radio communication, according to NASA.",
      "The downward trend was documented from the 1980s until 2008, when the space agency determined that the sun had reached its weakest point on record. The sun's action, or inaction, tends to fluctuate in 11-year cycles, according to NASA, although some patterns draw on longer.",
      "Earth is currently in\u00a0Solar Cycle 25, which began in 2020. The last cycle maintained an average length of 11 years and was the weakest solar cycle to occur in a century, according to the National Weather Service.

    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:20:31 -0400",
    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal in the works between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok could include a licensing agreement for the closely guarded secret of the social media company's algorithm, to which access has proved a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. In the meantime, an agreement between the U.S. and China appears to be moving forward. Mr. Trump on Friday said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have\u00a0\"made progress\" in talks over a potential deal to resolve the dispute over TikTok's ownership.",
      "Although key elements of the framework deal remain unclear, when some details were released earlier this week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, thinks ByteDance executives may be urging the Chinese government to strike a deal so the company can continue earning revenue from the algorithm, while maintaining a foothold in the U.S.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "How would a TikTok licensing deal work?",
      "Mr. Trump, asked Thursday about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. So exactly how a licensing deal would work remains unclear, including whether ByteDance could maintain any sort of outside control over TikTok's algorithm once ownership transfers to U.S. owners.",
      "\"What I understand is they would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use it under certain terms,\" said Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization. \"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it.\"",
      "Kreps added that in retaining a measure of ownership over the algorithm, ByteDance could have the right to access internal TikTok metrics and influence how content is ranked in the U.S., akin to how a software vendor can patch or upgrade licensed software.",
      "The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter,\u00a0said\u00a0this week that TikTok would create a new U.S. app and that the company's engineers would re-create content-recommendation algorithms using technology licensed from ByteDance.",
      "A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the contours of the U.S.-China framework deal over TikTok. \"Any details of the TikTok framework are pure speculation unless they are announced by this administration,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, Akoto, the American University assistant professor, said the new arrangement would have to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "When Jingtao, the deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, spoke to the press earlier this week, he indicated the U.S. and China have agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, although its unclear how exactly that would work.",

      "Nvidia said it will spend $5 billion to buy Intel common stock at $23.28 a share. The investment, which is subject to regulatory approvals, comes a month after the U.S. government took a 10% stake in Intel.",
      "\"This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel's CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem \u2014 a fusion of two world-class platforms,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. \"Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.\"",
      "The two companies said they will work on \"seamlessly connecting\" their architectures.",
      "In morning trading, Intel shares jumped 25%, its biggest one-day percentage gain in decades. Nvidia shares added 2%.",
      "For data centers, Intel will make custom chips that Nvidia will use in its AI infrastructure platforms. While for PC products, Intel will build chips that integrate Nvidia technology.",
      "The agreement provides a lifeline for Intel, which was a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, but fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel fell even farther behind in recent years amid the artificial intelligence boom that's propelled Nvidia into the world's most valuable company. Intel lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, and expects to slash its workforce by a quarter by the end of 2025.",
      "The U.S. government stepped in last month to secure a 10% stake, making it one of Intel's biggest shareholders. Federal officials said they invested in Intel in order to bolster U.S. technology and domestic manufacturing.",
      "The deal is \"bullish for U.S. tech,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a client note.",
      "\"This is a game-changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game,\" Ives said. \"Along with the recent U.S. government investment for 10% (equity stake in Intel) this has been a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors.\"",
      "Nvidia, meanwhile, has soared because its specialized chips are underpinning the artificial intelligence boom. The chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, are highly effective at developing powerful AI systems.",
      "The deal between the two chipmakers comes as China moves to be less dependent on U.S. semiconductor technology. This week, Chinese officials reportedly forbade several large domestic technology companies from purchasing Nvidia chips, and Huawei announced that it was expanding its development of AI chips and manufacturing.",
      "While Nvidia and Intel will work together to develop new chips, a manufacturing deal has yet to be struck between the two. The potential access to Intel's chip foundries by Nvidia poses a risk to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which currently manufactures the tech giant's flagship processors.",

      "The Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) received nine reports on \"inoperable door handles,\" with the most commonly reported issues involving parents' inability to reenter the car after placing their child in the back seat before going on a drive, or to remove their child from the back seat at the end of a drive.",
      "Some Tesla owners reported having to break a vehicle's window to regain entry, the NHTSA documents state. (NHTSA's number for the preliminary examination is PE25010 and can be viewed\u00a0here.)",
      "\"Entrapment in a vehicle is particularly concerning in emergency situations, such as when children are entrapped in a hot vehicle. For awareness, NHTSA has a Child Heatstroke Campaign that highlights the dangers to children entrapped in hot vehicles,\" the agency states.",
      "While Tesla vehicles have internal manual door releases, they cannot be operated by small children, according to the safety watchdog.",
      "According to the regulator's preliminary review, the handles on some Model Y vehicles appear to become inoperable \"when the electronic door locks receive insufficient voltage from the vehicle.\" However, no warnings prior to the exterior door handle failures \u2014 such as a low voltage battery warning \u2014 have been reported by owners, according to NHTSA.",
      "The investigation involves 174,290 Tesla Model Y SUVs from model year 2021 and is focused on the functionality of the electronic door locks from outside of the vehicle. The agency said it \"will continue to monitor any reports of entrapment involving opening doors from inside of the vehicle, and ODI will take further action as needed.\"",

    "summary": "Technology company Oracle is among a consortium of firms that would enable TikTok to continue operations in the U.S. if a framework deal is finalized, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "Technology company Oracle is among a consortium of firms that would enable TikTok to continue operations in the U.S. if a framework deal between the United States and China to take over the social media company is finalized, sources with knowledge of the negotiations tell CBS News.",
      "The precise structure of the final deal was unclear Monday night, but will include multiple companies, the sources said. It's not clear what level of involvement Chinese firms \u2014 including TikTok's current parent company ByteDance \u2014 will have in the deal, and who will control TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm. Presidents Trump and Xi are expected to talk on Friday.",
      "The deal includes a blend of new investors, including Silver Lake, a private equity firm based in California, and existing investors, the sources said.",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday morning declined to say which companies are purchasing TikTok, but said they will be announcing that soon.",
      "\"We have a group of very big companies that want to buy it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And, you know, the kids wanted it so badly. I had parents calling me up. They don't want it for themselves. They want it for their kids. They say, if I don't get it done, they're in big trouble with their kids.\"",
      "Oracle declined to comment. A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment. A spokesperson for Silver Lake didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington responded on Tuesday morning that China will \"firmly defend its national interests, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, and will carry out technology export approvals according to relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "The statement continued that the Chinese government \"also fully respects the will of enterprises and supports them in conducting business negotiations on an equal footing in accordance with market principles.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday in Madrid after meetings with Chinese officials on a range of issues, including TikTok, that the commercial terms had been agreed upon.",
      "Oracle \u2014 the tech company co-founded by billionaire Larry Ellison \u2014 has long been seen as a possible buyer if the U.S. government forced a TikTok sale. Mr. Trump has described Ellison as a friend. (Larry Ellison's son, David Ellison, is the chairman & CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison Family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "In 2020, Mr. Trump endorsed a deal that would see Oracle and Walmart taking a 20% stake in a U.S.-based entity called TikTok Global. And in recent years, as TikTok has sought to regain trust with American users and regulators, it has partnered with Oracle to route U.S. TikTok users' activity through the Texas-based company's servers.",
      "Mr. Trump was circumspect about a deal with reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. \"We may let it die, or we may, I don't know, it depends. Up to China. It doesn't matter too much. I'd like to do it for the kids. They like it.\"",
      "Last year, Congress passed and then-President Joe Biden signed a bill that essentially gave TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, an ultimatum: either divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the law in a unanimous 9-0 decision. But Mr. Trump has issued a series of orders unilaterally delaying its enforcement. The latest came in June, when he pushed back the deadline for enforcing the measure until this Wednesday.",
      "The president's orders have directed the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against tech companies such asApple and Google for failing to comply with the law by offering the TikTok app on their platforms.",
      "The TikTok divestiture law was passed in 2024 after years of bipartisan concern over possible national security risks posed by the ultra-popular video app. Those include worries that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to divulge information on U.S.-based users or manipulate the platform's algorithm to control what Americans see. TikTok has long denied that the Chinese authorities exert any influence on the platform.",
      "The concerns stretch back to Mr. Trump's first term. The president signed an executive order to ban TikTok in the U.S. in 2020 on national security and data privacy grounds, but the move was blocked by a judge. Four years later, Mr. Trump\u00a0 changed his view and expressed support for the app, which he has credited for his improved performance among younger voters in last year's election.",

      "And he engaged. He took the risk to make a summit with President Putin in Anchorage. And \u2013 and he asked for negotiations. And I think he's right.",
      "But, at the same time, I have to \u2013 just to recognize that there is no clear willingness of President Putin to be sincerely engaged in such a move, because, as we were working on a diplomatic way, as we were trying to organize bilateral, trilateral, quadrilateral summit, the Russians were increasing the assaults in Donbass, but not just in Donbass, intensified provocations on one side and attacks on Kyiv on the other side.",

We will work to provide to Ukraine security guarantees. And we delivered. A few days ago here in Paris, we gathered what we call the coalition of the willing.",
      "You have 30 countries working together in order to provide the day-after peace security guarantees to Ukraine. So we have all these elements now with an historical commitment of the Europeans who provide the security guarantees to Ukraine. What we need now is Ukraine to be at the table with Russia and negotiating what the peace agreement could be on territory, on security guarantee, on the escalation, on recovery, et cetera.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's now more than a month since that Alaska Summit, that big risk you said President Trump took. When he's been asked, so why not put sanctions or secondary tariffs on Russia, he points back here at Europe and the consumption of Russian oil and gas that still takes place.",
      "I know Hungary and Slovakia, for example, continue to use it.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: This is true. And we are fixing it. And we had discussion with Ursula von der Leyen. And she made great work with her teams to fix that.",
      "But let's be honest. This is very marginal. This is not a key driver today. We decreased by more than 80 percent the consumption of oil and gas. And I can tell you, because we were not the most impacted as a country because we were less dependent on this oil, oil and gas coming from Russia.",
      "But we have to finalize, to finish the job. This is true. But now it's clearly much more that when we are to do \u2013 what we have to do. We \u2013 we have to step up our support to Ukraine, and we have to provide the way to better resist to the new attacks on Kiev and civilians.",

      "GARY COHN: So, look, I think the Fed gave us a lot of important information this last week. As you said, they started down the path of cutting interest rates, going to 4 \u2013 to 4.25.",
      "They also gave us their outlook. So, the 17 governors gave us their projections to where they think interest rates are going. So that plot that they put out shows that, overall, they believe that interest rates will be cut two more times over the course of this year. Now, it's not 100 percent clear because the committee is divided.",
      "There are about seven members of the committee that do not want another cut this year, but there are 10 members of the committee that want at least two more cuts, and one wants more than two cuts. So that averages out to two cuts this year, which would take the federal funds rate \u2013 and it's important to understand it's the federal funds rate \u2013 would take that down to 3.6 percent for the \u2013 for year-end.",
      "Well, what is also important is, the committee was fairly unanimous. I think people were worried about the independence of the Fed. I think the Fed clearly showed themselves to be independent thinkers. They took into account all of the economic data, and they came out with a \u2013 projections that made sense based on what is going on in the economy today.",

      "Unfortunately, American consumers borrow money on more of the five-year, the seven-year, the 10-, and the 30-year rates, because that's where automobile loans, credit card loans, student loans, and mortgages are indexed to. Those interest rates are not determined by the Federal Reserve. They're determined by the open market.",
      "Those rates, in fact, after they cut rates earlier this week, went up a little bit. That said, they are down over the last few months, but those rates do not automatically go down when the Federal Reserve cuts rates. They have more to do with the market. And it's a supply-demand situation that determines those rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the other things the Fed highlighted here is that the labor market is \u2013 quote \u2013 \"really cooling off.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The administration, the treasury secretary says, data is bad. They're not seeing that in the jobs numbers.",
      "So, which is it? What's happening here?",
      "GARY COHN: Well, the chairman went out of his way to talk about the dual mandate that the Fed has. The Fed has two requirements that they're supposed to run interest rate policy off of. One is called stable prices, which means 2 percent inflation. The other is full employment. Full employment is exactly what it sounds like.",
      "The chair said, look, we are going to have to deal with the full employment part of the equation, even though we still have inflation in the system. So the Federal Reserve itself and the Board of Governors admitted that we are having a declining job market. And we see that. The data over the last three or four months, we have gone from creating well over 100,000 jobs a month to creating less than 50,000 jobs a month.",
      "It may be temporary. It may be quite temporary, but the reality is, we have seen the job market degrade. We have also seen companies announce an enormous amount of CapEx and \u2013 capital expenditures that's going to come into the system.",
      "I think it's interesting to take a step back and look at what's going on in the world today. I do think that we have seen companies cut back on the amount of employees they have. When you take companies, and you put them in a very difficult environment, and you increase the cost of input costs \u2013 and inputs have been going up because of tariffs. They have been going up other reasons.",
      "And they're not able to raise prices to the final consumer. The one lever they can pull to make sure they keep their margins intact is, they can cut down on the cost of labor. We came out of a tough situation in COVID, where companies were actually afraid about being able to attract and retain people. So they were hoarding labor.",
      "So we went from a hoarding labor situation to a situation today where companies are being very aggressive about managing their expenses. And the one expense they can manage is the cost of labor. So they're letting their labor force decline naturally as people retire out of the labor system. And we're seeing that in the data.",
      "And I think it's clearly showing up. And the Federal Reserve recognized that in this \u2013 in this week's action.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you ask the administration about this point, they will say, well, productivity is going to increase, and there are these technological shifts that are happening, so this data is distorted.",
      "Are you speaking specifically about tech, or are you saying across the board?",
      "GARY COHN: I'm saying across the board.",
      "I mean, we are \u2013 we have seen across the board. And we see anecdotal evidence of this. I have seen and I have heard it directly from corporate CEOs in every business line that they have gone out of their way to cut their human capital overhead.",
      "So, just the data for Q2 was pretty \u2013 pretty interesting. Corporate revenues rose about 6.3 for Q2, and corporate profits rose close to 12 percent. The way you do that, unless you're raising prices on the consumer \u2013 and we haven't seen a lot of prices go up to the consumer \u2013 is, you have to cut something out of the expense bucket.",
      "The one thing they're cutting is, they're cutting labor costs. We have seen it in the U.S. data. We have seen it in the private data. And we have seen it in the anecdotal data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president signed an executive order on Friday that I want to ask you about, because you have this role at IBM and some insight into tech.",

      "It's been cleaned up over the weekend. So, at this point, there's not a panic in the system. Everyone who's got an H-1B visa understands their status and understands how it \u2013 how it's \u2013 how it's going to work. I actually think this is a good idea.",
      "If you understand the H-1B visa program in the United States, historically, it has been a lottery system. So companies have turned in for these visas, and then the U.S. government lotteries them off. If you're now telling a company, look, you need to spend $100,000 to get one of these visas, you're not just going to ask for a visa and put a name in the lottery unless that is a highly skilled person who you need who you cannot hire in the United States.",
      "This visa program is meant for high-skilled labor where you cannot hire that person in the United States. So if that's what it's used for, ultimately, we're going to bring high-skilled people into the United States. It's going to help grow our economy. And that's good for all of us.",

      "Why do you disagree with that sequencing?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: I think probably this is an excessive word, and I disagree with this approach. Why? Because the objective of Hamas is absolutely not to create a Palestinian state. The objective of Hamas is to destroy Israel, to convince a maximum number of people that they have no chance to have peace and stability in precisely a Palestinian state, and \u2013 and to kill the maximum number of Israeli people. And this is why. If we \u2013 we want to stop this war, if we want to isolate Hamas, the recognition process and the peace plan which goes with this recognition process is a pre-condition.",
      "So, my first point is to say, I don't answer (INAUDIBLE). I don't mix the expectations of Hamas. Hamas is just opposite (ph) by destroying Israel. But I recognize the legitimacy of so many Palestinian people who want a state, who are a people, they want a nation, they want a state, and we should not push them toward Hamas. If we don't offer them a political perspective and such a recognition, the unique answer would be security, and they will be completely tapped by Hamas as a unique (ph) option.",
      "My second point is, thanks to the recognition, and thanks to the diplomatic move we launched, we started to isolate Hamas because we, at the New York declaration, which was voted, as you know, by 142 countries, we gathered all of (INAUDIBLE) states, all of the leaders of the regions to work closely with us to precisely dismantle and disarm Hamas. To know that we're not engaging in such a move.",
      "Now, we gathered all these states, all these people who work closely with us in this move. So, I think this is why we can create the condition of a concrete action first to give this right to the Palestinian people, second, to isolate Hamas from the rest of the Palestinians in the whole region and precisely build security.",
      "But let me tell you something which for me very important in this context. Israel had wonderful security results against Hezbollah, Hamas, top leaders, and they managed to \u2013 to \u2013 to neutralize (ph) a lot of top decision makers of (INAUDIBLE). They did it. This is their merit.",

      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Because they \u2013 they killed all of the key leaders. This is a success. But at the beginning of this war, you had more or less 25,000 Hamas fighters. The Israeli army killed probably half of them. But Hamas managed to recruit the equivalent. You have as many fighters as at the very beginning, which is the best evidence of the fact, if we want to dismantle Hamas, the total war is not the answer because it's just killing the credibility of Israel. And, by the way, weakening and killing our own credibility if we don't make a move as the one we are organizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you just pointed to something that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu would say, well this is why we need to continue until we get rid of every Hamas member. You're saying, you can't kill that idea. You need to provide a different idea?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Exactly. But this is so \u2013 this is the whole perspective. And look at the situation, not just by the way in Gaza, but everywhere in the region. Hamas was clearly not backed by a lot of people before the 7th of October. If you took the pulse (ph) in Gaza, but in all the countries of the region, they were very low in all the polls (ph). Today, the level of support is much higher because they are making the mistake, in fact, to reduce all of the perspective of the Palestinians to Hamas. What we have to say is, we want the dismantling of Hamas. You had the success. There is no more top leaders. We want to isolate them. We want to \u2013 to bring everybody working with us to dismantle the Hamas, but recognizing this right to have a Palestinian state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: So, a diplomatic challenge. This is just giving another channel and \u2013 and offering a political way in isolating Hamas. So, I think there is no future with the option which would be just, let's kill the maximum number of Hamas people because they just recruit others and others because each time they launch this type of operations, they kill so many civilians that they are just destroying their own reputation and credibility and they are creating an unsustainable framework of security in the whole region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But since October 7th, popular support in Israeli for a Palestinian state has also declined. Prime Minister Netanyahu has been opposed for a very, very long time. And now he says that, just look at those attacks that day. If you allow for any kind of Palestinian state, it will be a launchpad for terrorism. I mean that is his argument, that this shows you can't allow for the safety and security of Israel if there are two states. Why is he wrong?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: First, I want to \u2013 I want to say that the 7th of October was a total trauma for everybody in \u2013 in our country here because we had so many French people being killed during the 7th of October terrorist attack launched by Hamas. And \u2013 and it was, for us, one of the biggest terrorist attacks against our own fellow citizens. But we \u2013 we did share and we do share the pain and the suffer of the Israeli people and so many families. And for me, the top priority remains the release of hostages.",
      "And I met very regularly families of \u2013 of hostages. And I have to say that what they live is unbearable. And I \u2013 I had the opportunity to met with them. Yeta Hargiz (ph) mother and so many of them. And what they describe is \u2013 is absolutely unbearable.",
      "But I consider that if we want precisely to build a sustainable peace for Israel, it's a \u2013 and for the Israeli people, a political process and the recognition of a Palestinian state, if the state recognizes the right of Israel to leave and defend itself is demilitarized, has security forces with the vetting process by Israel, with obviously a proper governance and reformed governance, and \u2013 and is precisely \u2013 we have a series of reform, which are a part of the process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that that's it, right? You are talking about recognizing the Palestinian Authority, with some governance over the West Bank. Already was working with Israeli Security Forces. But Hamas came to power through the ballot box in the first place.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Look, it's \u2013 if we are honest, it started (ph) different. And this is why I think \u2013 let's accept the fact that a lot of people have worked very hard to kill the credibility of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza years ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Uh-uh.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: And Hamas appeared as a \u2013 precisely a sort of alternative option.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Uh-uh.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: But (INAUDIBLE) attacks were launched by Hamas, not by Palestinian Authority. And if we say all those living in Gaza, and all those backing the Palestinian state are de facto parts of Hamas, there is no end to this war, except that you will kill everybody. And this is \u2013 this is terrible.",
      "So, we have to recognize that the Palestinian Authority has to be reformed, the governance is not satisfactory today. We need a new \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The leader is nearly 90 years old.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: You have a new \u2013 we need a new Palestinian Authority. But let's just remark and please notice with me that thanks to the work of mission process (ph) we launched. For the first time for many years, we got 9th of June a series of clear commitments from the Palestinian Authority. They refused him (ph). Now, the \u2013 the reform, a new vice president being elected, a reform of the education program, (INAUDIBLE) of the (INAUDIBLE) program as well with the monitoring by a U.S. (INAUDIBLE).",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Twenty months later.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: This is true, but for what? Because we made this move.",
      "So, the recognition is the way (INAUDIBLE) to reengage and bring them back and to table. And my point is to say, let's isolate Hamas. And let's focus on the dismantling of Hamas from a military and a political point of view. In order to do so, we have to reengage with those who can be, I would say, a political achievement for the Palestinian people. And this is why the recognition is so important. And if we revert to West Bank, one of the key element which triggered my decision to announce in July the perspective of \u2013 as a recognition for the 22nd of September, is a vote of the Knesset. When the Knesset decided to start the (INAUDIBLE) again, in West Bank, it was the best evidence of the fact that they don't want to \u2013 to fight against Hamas. There is no Hamas in West Bank. They just want to destroy the existing political bodies and the possibility of two states. And I really believe this is a terrible mistake for Israel itself because, in doing so, they just kill any other perspective that (ph) war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. But when you \u2013 I understand the argument you are making, but it has put you at direct odds with the Trump administration, who argue that your decision to make this recognition announcement, along with all these U.N. members, that it, in fact, kills the diplomacy they had underway. They said they were working to get, for example, the tax money from the Israelis to hand back over to the Palestinian Authority. That they were doing practical things on the ground to help Palestinians.",

      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: We \u2013 we \u2013 we are closely coordinated with the U.S. administration when we speak about the ceasefire and the release of hostages. We were always in close coordination with the secretary of state or key \u2013 key \u2013 President Trump's advisers in order to work with Qatar, Egypt and Israel on the release of hostages, a ceasefire.",
      "But your administration is focusing on the day after. And what we propose is a full-fledged plan where we have first the emergency package. So, let's deliver the release of hostages, ceasefire and \u2013 and humanitarian access.",
      "The day we have that, we start the day after. And I think we are very convergent with the work which is being done by \u2013 by your administration. What we want is a de facto governance in Gaza with clearly a sort of transitional administration, including the Palestinian Authority, excluding, clearly, Hamas, but with a vetting process of Israel, and an association of all the neighbors. We have a security package in this \u2013 in this day after approach, which is, let's scale up the training of the policemen and security forces of the Palestinians. And \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will do that?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: We \u2013 we are already are doing that \u2013 are doing so. Many country (INAUDIBLE). It does exist. But we need to scale up. And in parallel, we proposed, and we worked very closely with the United Kingdom and all the leaders of the region precisely to offer a military, I would say, an international force to be deployed in Gaza with a U.N. mandate, which is a unique framework to be defended, and \u2013 which could be legitimate to assist and \u2013 and back, I would say, this policemen and security forces. And \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know Israel does not trust the United Nations at all.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, I \u2013 this is a U.N. framework, but this \u2013 first they would have a vetting process for (INAUDIBLE), and it would involve Jordan, Egypt, and some others \u2013 some others are ready as well to finance. But, obviously, it needs to be made in close coordination with Israel.",
      "And in the second (ph) package of \u2013 is a core element is a dismantling of Hamas. There is no other option. If you want to fix the situation, to disarm Hamas, and precisely to demobilize so many fighters, to organize what we call a DDR (ph) process, which is very familiar to all the experts in this type of situation. And this is in this day after for Gaza, in the security package, as we can organize such a DDR vis-\u2026-vis Hamas and to be sure that Hamas will never be involved in the Golans (ph) but sets \u2013 Hamas will be disarmed, dismantled, with some key people to leave Gaza and some other to be deradicalized and the weapons to be taken.",
      "In order to do so, you need clear security forces here. You need international forces to be here. And, obviously, we have the (INAUDIBLE). On that, I think there is a strong alignment with the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: My point is the recognition and the process we launch with that is the only way to bring with us on this track all the neighbors and key countries in order to deliver such a package. And \u2013 and look at the situation. Today, when Egypt, when so many leaders of the region are not uncomfortable with what is being done, you need to re-engage them. And this is exactly what we are doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: But my point is to see, if we don't have this full package, the day after is impossible because today, de facto, you are accepting the displacement of population in Gaza City. How do you want the day after to be possible if you displace thousands of people?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly on this point. When you say day after, that means when the war ends and some kind of rebuilding happens. What you're talking about with the Trump administration is this idea of having Palestinians leave Gaza, by choice, they say, but some would say that is a step towards ethnic cleansing. In fact, an independent commission set up by the U.S. concluded Israel has a, quote, \"intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza as defined by the genocide convention.\" Does France agree with that report?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, we don't qualify as a genocide who's happening because it is not a political statement. This is judges (ph) or the end \u2013 or the historians to qualify a genocide by a series of evidence and a clear jurisprudence and \u2013 and clear elements.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you reject that report and that finding?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, I don't reject the report. This is not my point. My point is, it should not \u2013 it should not be a political debate. What's happening is clearly a lot of civilians are being killed de facto underground, and the project is to displace people. So, I think this is a big mistake. And this is where I try to convince your administration that if we agree on the day after, and we want this de facto authority, this security package, the dismantling of Hamas and the reconstruction (ph), let's work on the \u2013 on the current day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: If you accept de facto, Israel to displace its people, you will never see the day after. And by the way, I look very carefully at all the plans being shared by your administration or shared by experts working for your administration, they always reiterate, let's work and be together for Gazans. It means that they are ready to preserve and protect Palestinian people because Gazans are those who are living in Gaza. But if the precondition of such a plan is to push them out, this is just a craziness. So, we \u2013 we should not be, for the credibility of the United States, for the credibility of France, we cannot be implicitly or explicitly complacent with such a project because such a project, we know it. And by the way, all of the security expert, even in Israel, are very clear on the fact it will be a humanitarian disaster. And this project will kill the possibility of the day after.",
      "So, we have to be very explicit on the fact that attacking civilians just to get a few \u2013 a few terrorists and a few fighters is clearly not acceptable, but displacing people in order just to take a territory, which is not in the hands of \u2013 of \u2013 of Israel, in order to prepare the day after, is not just a tad crazy,, but unacceptable for all of us.",

      "Do you accept this criticism as \u2013 as genuine and valid?",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Gary Cohn, IBM vice chair and former National Economic Council director in President Trump's first term, said Sunday that \"we've seen the job market degrade,\" though he noted that it may be \"temporary.\"",
      "\"The Federal Reserve itself and the board of governors admitted that we are having a declining job market. And we see that,\" Cohn said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Last week, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, in the first rate cut since December, amid slower economic growth and a stalling labor market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has a dual mandate to ensure that both inflation and unemployment remain low, said \"what's different now is that you see a very different picture of the risks to the labor market.\" And though Powell noted that he didn't want to put \"too much emphasis on payroll job creation,\" he said \"it's just one of the things that suggests that the labor market is really cooling off.\"",
      "\"That tells you that it's time to take that into account,\" Powell said.",
      "Meanwhile the jobs numbers, which have shown an ongoing slowdown in the labor market, have been under scrutiny in recent weeks, as the administration has questioned the validity of the government data. Last month, President Trump fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a disappointing July jobs report.",
      "Cohn pointed to job data on Sunday, saying, \"over the last three or four months, we have gone from creating well over 100,000 jobs a month to creating less than 50,000 jobs a month.\" And he noted that \"I do think that we have seen companies cut back on the amount of employees they have.\"",
      "The IBM vice chair outlined that when companies are put in a \"very difficult environment,\" with input costs going up due to tariffs and other reasons, and they're unable to raise prices on consumers, \"the one lever they can pull to make sure they keep their margins intact is they can cut down on the cost of labor.\"",
      "\"We came out of a tough situation in COVID where companies were actually afraid about being able to attract and retain people, so they were hoarding labor,\" Cohn said. \"So we went from a hoarding labor situation to a situation today where companies are being very aggressive about managing their expenses, and the one expense they can manage is the cost of labor.\"",
      "Cohn said companies are now \"letting their labor force decline naturally as people retire out of the labor system.\" He said in the data, \"I think it's clearly showing up, and the Federal Reserve recognized that in this week's action.\"",
      "Cohn said he didn't think this change is specific to tech, but \"across the board.\" He noted that he's \"heard it directly from corporate CEOs in every business line that they have gone out of their way to cut their human capital overhead.\"",
      "On the rate cut more broadly, Cohn said \"the Fed gave us a lot of important information this last week,\" pointing to the rate cut, along with Fed officials providing their outlook, with projections of where they think interest rates are going. And he also noted that \"what is also important is the committee was fairly unanimous,\" acknowledging concerns about the independence of the Fed that have come to a head in recent weeks.",
      "\"I think the Fed clearly showed themselves to be independent thinkers,\" he said. \"They took into account all of the economic data, and they came out with a projection that made sense based on what is going on in the economy today.\"",

The list goes on.",

      "Americans' grocery bills are growing, causing some shoppers to cut back on discretionary spending as they find themselves struggling to afford the basics.",
      "Food prices grew by half a percent from July to August, marking the fastest monthly rate of change since the fall of 2022. Behind the rising cost of food items on store shelves are three main culprits, according to experts.",
      "The Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, climate change and a shortage of agricultural workers in the U.S. are the leading causes of grocery inflation, Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst also known as the \"Supermarket Guru,\" told CBS News correspondent Jo Ling Kent.",
      "Price hikes, he added, have been steepest on goods that the U.S. imports from nations facing higher levies. For example, the U.S. imports about 35% of its coffee from Brazil, whose exports are taxed at a rate of 50%.",
      "The latest Consumer Price Index data shows that coffee prices rose 21% in August compared with a year ago.",
      "As companies see their costs rise, they pass along those burdens to consumers. In the case of tariffs, some businesses began raising prices on products even before the levies were in full force.",
      "\"There's no question that what we've seen is, we're seeing companies increased prices because of the impending tariffs,\" said Lempert.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is ending the Temporary Protected Status of thousands of immigrants from Syria living in the U.S., arguing it is not in America's interest to continue the humanitarian program, the Department of Homeland Security announced Friday.",
      "The department said conditions no longer prevent Syrians from returning to their war-ravaged homeland. Syria faced a bloody civil war for over a decade until dictator Bashar al-Assad was ousted last year. Sectarian violence has continued even after the Assad government was overthrown.",
      "In a statement, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin also cited terrorist activity in Syria as additional grounds to terminate the TPS program.",
      "\"Syria has been a hotbed of terrorism and extremism for nearly two decades, and it is contrary to our national interest to allow Syrians to remain in our country,\" McLaughlin added. \"TPS is meant to be temporary.\"",
      "Syrians who don't have another legal mechanism to remain in the U.S. once their TPS expires in roughly 60 days will be eligible to be arrested and deported by federal immigration officials. The Trump administration on Friday advised Syrians enrolled in the TPS program to self-deport from the U.S. using its CBP Home smartphone app.",
      "Syria's TPS designation dates back to the Obama administration, which in 2012 announced the program in response to the civil war that broke out there the year prior. The designation was extended multiple times, including by the first Trump administration. Government data indicates nearly 4,000 Syrians in the U.S. had TPS protections as of the end of March.",
      "Since its creation by Congress in 1990, TPS has been used by Democratic and Republican administrations to offer a temporary safe haven to foreigners from nations dealing with an armed conflict, environmental disaster or other crises. It allows recipients to work and live in the U.S. legally, but does not directly give them a path to permanent legal status.",
      "The Biden administration expanded TPS eligibility to a record number of migrants from crisis-stricken countries, including many who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally.",
      "The second Trump administration has sought to dismantle most TPS programs, moving to terminate the legal status of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Pro-immigrant advocates have called the effort the largest de-documentation campaign in U.S. history, challenging the terminations in federal courts across the country.",
      "Trump administration officials have argued that TPS designations have been extended for far too long by Democratic administrations, despite the temporary nature of the policy. It has also argued conditions in many of the affected countries have improved or that the programs are magnets for illegal immigration.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "AI browsers are no longer just an idea; they're already here. Microsoft has built Copilot into Edge, OpenAI is testing a sandboxed browser in agent mode and Perplexity's Comet is one of the first to fully embrace the concept of browsing for you.",
      "This is agentic AI stepping into our daily routines, from searching and reading to shopping and clicking. Instead of simply assisting us, these tools are beginning to replace us.",
      "But with this shift comes a new era of digital deception. AI-powered browsers may promise convenience by handling shopping, emails and other tasks, yet research shows they can stumble into scams faster than humans ever could. This dangerous mix of speed and trust is what experts call Scamlexity, a complex, AI-driven scam landscape where your agent gets tricked, and you pay the price.",

      "Falling for the same old tricks",
      "AI browsers are not immune to classic scams. In fact, they can fall for them even faster. When researchers at Guardio Labs told an AI browser to buy an Apple Watch, it confidently completed the purchase on a fake Walmart store set up in minutes. It autofilled personal and payment details without hesitation. The scammer got the money, while the human never saw the red flags.",
      "AI browsers promise convenience, but security experts warn they can fall for online scams faster than humans. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Handling phishing emails from \"your bank\"",
      "Old phishing tactics also remain effective. In testing, researchers at Guardio Labs sent a fake Wells Fargo email to the AI browser. The browser clicked the malicious link with no verification and even helped the user fill out login credentials on the phishing page. By removing human intuition from the loop, the AI created a perfect trust chain that scammers could exploit.",
      "PromptFix: A modern AI injection scam",
      "The real danger comes from attacks designed specifically for AI. Researchers at Guardio Labs created PromptFix, a scam disguised as a CAPTCHA page. While humans would only see a checkbox, the AI agent read hidden malicious instructions in the page code. Believing it was \"helping,\" the AI clicked the button, triggering a download that could have been malware. This type of prompt injection bypasses human awareness and targets the AI's decision-making directly. Once compromised, the AI can send emails, share files or execute harmful tasks without the user ever knowing.",
      "The growing risks of AI browsers",
      "As agentic AI becomes mainstream, scams will scale at an alarming speed. Instead of fooling millions of people individually, attackers need only to compromise one AI model to reach millions at once. Security experts warn this is a structural risk, not just a phishing problem.",
      "Tips to protect yourself from AI browser scams",
      "AI browsers can save time, but they can also put you at risk if you rely on them too much. Use these practical steps to stay in control and reduce your chances of becoming a victim.",
      "Always double-check sensitive actions like purchases, downloads or logins. Keep final approval in your hands instead of letting the AI complete tasks on its own. This way, you prevent scammers from sneaking past your awareness.",
      "Scammers rely on exposed personal details to make their tricks more convincing. A trusted data removal service can help scrub your information from broker sites, reducing the chance that your AI agent hands over details that are already floating around online. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Buying refurbished electronics sounds like a no-brainer. You get the latest gadgets at a fraction of the cost while giving devices a second life, which is better for the environment. It seems like the perfect solution for those on a budget, but it isn't always that simple. Not every refurbished device is equal, and the fine print matters more than you think.",

      "1) Refurbished does not always mean like new",
      "In the tech industry, the label refurbished carries no uniform standard. From factory-certified devices that meet stringent quality checks to third-party refurbishments that address only surface-level defects, the range is vast. My experience shows that treating refurbished items as \"like new\" is a mistake. Many come with cosmetic blemishes or partially worn components, and some sellers stop at a basic reset and cleaning.",
      "The key is to scrutinize the seller's refurbishment process and request detailed specifications or photos to ensure the item is in good condition. Look for transparency about what has been repaired or replaced. A reputable refurbisher will disclose whether critical components such as screens, batteries or motherboards were replaced or simply tested.",
      "Pro tip: Many refurbishers use a grading system (A, B, C). Grade A means near new, Grade B usually has light scratches, while Grade C shows heavier wear. Knowing the grade helps set realistic expectations.",
      "2) Check the warranty and return policy",
      "One of the most overlooked yet critical aspects of buying refurbished electronics is the warranty and return policy. Through years of testing products, I've seen warranties vary wildly from generous 90-day coverage to none at all. A solid warranty is not just a formality; it's a reflection of the refurbisher's confidence in the quality of the product. Without it, you're taking a gamble.",
      "Industry best practices suggest opting for sellers who provide at least a 90-day warranty and a clear, no-hassle return window. I have consistently seen reliable refurbishers like Amazon Renewed, eBay Certified Refurbished and Back Market stand by their work with transparent policies.",
      "Also look at Apple Certified Refurbished and Dell Outlet, which are industry leaders for high-quality laptops, tablets and phones.",
      "3) Know the seller's reputation",
      "Not all sellers are equal when it comes to refurbished tech. My years covering consumer electronics have made it clear that choosing a reputable seller is more important than chasing the lowest price. Factory-certified refurbishers and authorized resellers tend to follow strict testing and quality control procedures. In contrast, independent sellers often vary in quality and reliability.",
      "I always emphasize researching the seller's history, reading verified customer reviews and ensuring they offer clear refurbishment guarantees. Established marketplaces and brand-certified stores provide additional layers of security, including dispute resolution mechanisms.",
      "Red flags include: vague warranty language, listings with only stock photos, \"open box\" items marketed as refurbished and any product sold \"as-is.\" If you see those, walk away.",
      "4) Don't forget accessories and packaging",
      "A less obvious but important consideration is the state of accessories and packaging. In industry practice, refurbished products rarely arrive in original packaging or with the full set of accessories. I've seen that some sellers ship devices with generic boxes and subpar third-party accessories or omit chargers and manuals altogether.",
      "If accessories are important to your workflow, don't assume they'll be included. Always verify the listing description and, when in doubt, ask the seller directly. Knowing exactly what comes in the box prevents surprises and ensures you don't have to hunt for compatible chargers or cables after the fact, potentially eroding any savings you initially gained.",
      "5) Battery life may not be the same",
      "A common misconception is that refurbished devices come with batteries that perform like new, but that's not the case. Batteries naturally degrade with use, and not all refurbishers replace them.",
      "Some sellers disclose battery replacement while others do not. It is critical to confirm whether the battery is new, tested or original. Otherwise, expect performance issues such as rapid discharge or failure to hold a charge. A device with a worn-out battery is rarely worth the lower upfront cost, as you'll likely need to replace the battery soon after purchase.",
      "SAVE UP TO 64% ON DYSON, DEWALT, ANKER, ADIDAS AND MORE DURING EBAY'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY SALE",
      "A good warranty and return policy are essential safeguards for choosing refurbished devices. (Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "6) Software updates and compatibility",
      "You should only use electronic items like phones, laptops, tablets and smartwatches as long as they're receiving software updates. Many might disagree with this, but the truth is that once software support ends, your device becomes vulnerable to all kinds of unpatchable security flaws. Some good brands known for reliable software support are Apple, Samsung, Google, MSI and Lenovo.",
      "Before purchasing, always verify that the device is still supported with regular updates. This information is often available on the manufacturer's website or through trusted tech resources.",
      "7) Test the device thoroughly after purchase",
      "Testing a refurbished device thoroughly upon arrival is a best practice I've recommended repeatedly in my writing. Even trusted sellers can occasionally miss a defect. I always advise checking every essential function, such as the screen, charging port, Wi-Fi, sound and camera, within the seller's return period. Many problems won't be obvious from photos or descriptions alone.",
      "Immediate testing ensures you catch issues early enough to return or replace the product without hassle. It's a small investment of time that prevents far bigger frustrations later.",
      "And don't forget to perform your own factory reset on\u00a0iPhone,\u00a0Android,\u00a0PC or Mac to ensure no old accounts, locks or data are lingering on the device. For Apple devices, make sure \"Find My iPhone\" has been disabled before purchase, or it may be unusable.",
      "8) Install strong antivirus software",
      "Refurbished devices can sometimes carry hidden risks, especially if the previous owner didn't wipe the device properly or if the seller missed deep software issues. Installing\u00a0 strong antivirus software is essential to protect your device from malware, spyware or other security threats that may be lurking.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "9) Use a password manager",
      "Security doesn't end with antivirus protection. Many refurbished devices come with pre-installed software or misconfigured settings that could expose you to risk. One of the smartest moves you can make is using a reliable password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "10) Know the real value of your savings",
      "Refurbished doesn't always mean a bargain. As a rule of thumb, expect to save 20-40% compared to new, depending on the brand, age and condition. If you're only saving 10-15%, the trade-off on warranty, lifespan or battery may not be worth it. Calculate the long-term cost, especially if you'll need to buy a new battery or accessories soon after.",

      "Refurbished products often arrive without original packaging or accessories, leaving buyers unprepared. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Bonus: The eco-friendly upside",
      "Every refurbished device purchased keeps one more gadget out of the landfill and reduces carbon emissions from manufacturing. Studies show buying refurbished can cut a product's carbon footprint nearly in half. That means you're not only saving money but also helping the planet.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Buying refurbished electronics can be a great way to save money and reduce e-waste. But it pays to be careful. By sticking with certified sellers, knowing what \"refurbished\" really means and insisting on warranties and clear return policies, you can protect both your wallet and your data.",

      "Place the tracker inside your bag rather than on the handle so it can\u2019t be easily removed. Check its location through your phone before leaving the airport, and keep an eye on it during layovers. While AirTags can\u2019t prevent someone from misusing an old luggage tag, they give you proof of where your bag actually is if you ever need to dispute a lost luggage claim or theft.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "While the luggage tag scam may not be widespread yet, it exploits a simple oversight that most travelers rarely consider. Until airlines and airports put better safeguards in place, the burden falls on passengers to protect their own information. That means treating something as ordinary as a bag tag like sensitive data.",

      "The report, issued Tuesday by the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory (COI), said, \"the State of Israel bears responsibility for the failure to prevent genocide, the commission of genocide, and the failure to punish genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "In a statement to Fox News Digital, Cruz said, \"This latest announcement by the United Nations is no different than any of the other antisemitic smears and libels that have been leveled against Israel in their ongoing response to Hamas' atrocities on Oct. 7.",
      "\"This campaign directly undermines American national security interests by eroding Israel's freedom of action against Hamas terrorists who killed Americans and fueling international lawfare against Israel, which will be turned against American servicemembers, and indeed American citizens in general. The Republican Trump administration and Republican Congress have developed tools and sanctions to deal with these threats, and they should be used against everyone involved in this travesty,' his statement concluded.",

      "Anne Bayefsky, director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust and president of Human Rights Voices, told Fox News Digital that \"the latest report of the U.N.\u2019s phony \u2018inquiry\u2019 promotes genocide \u2013 against Jews.\"",
      "Bayefsky said the report \"obscenely rationalizes the crimes against humanity committed by Hamas and other Palestinians on Oct. 7 as an understandable reaction to prior Israeli wrongs,\" and \"downgrades the mass murder, rape, torture, and trauma of Israelis by suggesting that not enough Jews were harmed to pose an \u2018existential threat\u2019 to Israel.\"",
      "Bayefsky said that the COI, which has previously been accused of omitting important facts from its reporting, \"makes zero recommendations for Hamas.\" She also said the report mentions the terror group\u2019s tunnel network, which was \"integral to the Oct. 7 atrocities,\" only \"in the context of criticizing Israel.\"",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz condemned the latest attack against Israel by the U.N.\u00a0 (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)",
      "Salo Aizenberg, director of media watchdog group HonestReporting, pushed back on the COI report\u2019s assertion that Israel has \"impos[ed] measures intended to prevent births.\" He told Fox News Digital that, \"If Israel truly aimed to destroy Gaza\u2019s population, why did it allow WHO teams earlier in 2025 to vaccinate 603,000 children under age 10 \u2014 matching pre-Oct. 7 numbers?\"",
      "He noted that it \"disregards that more than 20,000 Gaza fatalities are fighters from Hamas and other armed groups, obscuring the true dynamics of the conflict.\"",
      "HAMAS TERROR OUTLET QUIETLY CUTS GAZA DEATH COUNT, REVEALS MOST KILLED WERE COMBAT-AGE MEN",
      "In its recommendations, the COI report specifically calls for Israel to \"ensure full, unimpeded access of humanitarian aid at scale\" and \"end the distribution of food aid through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.\" The report cites the commissioner-general of the controversial U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), who has called GHF \"an abomination\" and \"a death trap\" that is \"costing more lives than it saves.\"",
      "According to recent U.N. statistics, however, between July 21 and Aug. 18 there were double the number of deaths along U.N. convoy routes (576) as there were surrounding GHF sites (259).",
      "Hamas terrorists killed civilians, including women, children and the elderly, when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7.\u00a0 (Israel Defense Forces via AP)",
      "Additionally, only 14.5% of U.N. aid trucks sent into Gaza have reached their intended destinations since May due to armed looting and theft. During the same period, GHF has distributed 165 million meals to Palestinians at its secure distribution sites.",
      "GHF released a statement explaining that the COI published its report \"without ever contacting\" the organization, calling its statements \"falsehoods that could have been easily corrected had we been asked.\" GHF said there have been no shootings at its sites, and that claims, particularly that children have been shot, are \"not only false\" but \"reckless.\"",
      "HAMAS PLOTS INFILTRATION AT US-BACKED GAZA AID SITE, FORCES TEMPORARY SHUTDOWN",
      "While the COI currently casts specific blame on three Israeli officials for alleged genocide, COI member Chris Sidoti told the press on Monday, \"there are many, many statements by Israeli political and civilian leaders that incite genocide, and also by others, including some media commentators in Israel, that have been inciting genocide.\"",
      "St\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, did not respond to questions on whether Sidoti\u2019s remarks were an attack on Israel\u2019s media.",
      "Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu hold signs as he addresses the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Friday, Sept. 27, 2024.\u00a0 (Pamela Smith/AP Photo)",
      "In response to press questions about the COI report, Guterres said that \"it is not in the attributions of the Secretary-General to do the legal determination of genocide. That belongs to the adequate judicial entities, namely, the International Court of Justice.\" Guterres said, \"the truth is that this is something that it is morally, politically, and legally intolerable.\"",
      "In a statement to Fox News Digital, a State Department spokesperson condemned the world body for the report: \"Accusing Israel of genocide is the height of hypocrisy. Oct. 7 was a genocidal event undertaken by a terrorist organization with openly genocidal ambitions. Israel went to war in self-defense and has consistently taken steps to minimize civilian casualties. That is not a genocide. This kind of equivocation by the U.N. is further evidence of its moral bankruptcy.",
      "The spokesperson confirmed that the U.S. did not provide funding to the COI, and would not preview sanctions against its members, but noted, \"Ensuring that foreign visitors to the United States do not pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety remains a paramount priority of the U.S. government. Due to visa confidentiality and other considerations, we do not have anything to announce regarding these specific cases.\"",
      "Bayefsky, however, said that while \"U.S. law withholds funds for the COI, but clearly it has not had the intended impact.\" She argued it is \"high time\" to do a \"lot more to terminate the dangers that the U.N. and its COI pose to both the United States and Israel.\"",

Five cases are pending, although the court issued temporary wins to the government in two of them while it decides what next steps to take. Three others resulted in no decision.",

      "The two losses were both in high-profile immigration cases. In one, the court put on hold plans to immediately deport immigrants using a wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act. In the other, the court ruled the court should seek the return to the United States of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador.",
      "But the Justice Department has not turned to the Supreme Court on some of its most contentious moves that were blocked by federal judges, including executive orders that targeted certain law firms and the government\u2019s detention of foreign students who protested against Israel over its military intervention in Gaza.",
      "\u201cThere are some cases that are very likely to be losers they haven\u2019t brought,\u201d said Jonathan Adler, a professor at William & Mary Law School. \u201cThat suggests to me it has been very strategic.\u201d",
      "Other big cases are on the horizon, including a consequential showdown on Trump\u2019s ability to unilaterally impose tariffs on imported goods.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve had a very good few months. But the real ballgame still lies ahead,\u201d said Michael Toner, a litigator and former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, referring to the tariffs case and another showdown over Trump\u2019s attempt to fire without cause a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "Elizabeth Wydra, president of the left-leaning Constitutional Accountability Center, said part of the administration\u2019s success so far has been the rate at which it has brought issues to the court that mirror arguments that have long been favored by the conservative legal movement. That includes empowering the presidency and weakening the power of independent federal agencies.",
      "\u201cTheir winning streak shows that the court is not particularly interested in this moment in acting as a constitutional check on the executive [branch]. We have seen the lower courts step into that role,\u201d she added.",
      "The administration\u2019s more respectful tone toward the Supreme Court is at odds with the fractious relationship officials have had with lower-court judges who have frequently ruled against various White House policies.",
      "Some judges previously told NBC News that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in favor of the administration have served to at least give the appearance of validating harsh criticism of the judiciary made by Trump and his allies. Judges have also accused the administration of defying court orders.",
      "The differing, and more conciliatory tone, the administration had adopted before the Supreme Court was on display in May when the justices heard oral arguments over whether to curb lower-court rulings that blocked Trump\u2019s plan to end birthright citizenship.",
      "Sauer, pressed on whether the administration might defy certain court rulings, said that it was not always obligated to follow lower-court precedents but would always follow what the Supreme Court says.",
      "\u201cSo you\u2019re not hedging at all with respect to the precedent of this court?\u201d asked Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who ultimately wrote the court\u2019s ruling in favor of the administration.",
      "\u201cThat is correct,\u201d Sauer said."

      "The good news for the Kansas City Chiefs: They are no longer winless after a 22-9 victory over the New York Giants on \"Sunday Night Football.\"",
      "The bad news? The Chiefs still hardly resemble the team that has reached at least the AFC Championship game every year since 2018 \u2014 and their once potent offense remains disjointed at best.",
      "Entering Week 3 with a 0-2 record, Kansas City desperately needed a win in any fashion it could get one on Sunday. For a team with a legendary quarterback and Super Bowl aspirations, however, the ugliness of the Chiefs\u2019 offensive slog against the Giants left a lot to be desired moving forward.",
      "\u201cGood win to get, in particular when you haven\u2019t had one,\u201d head coach Andy Reid said after.",
      "Quarterback Patrick Mahomes finished the game 22-of-37 for 224 yards and one touchdown, with an 85.9 passer rating. He has yet to break a passer rating of 90.0 so far this season, despite boasting a career mark of 101.8 before Sunday.",
      "And his so-so game didn\u2019t necessarily come against a great defense \u2014 Mahomes\u2019s passing total and 6.1 yards per attempt were both the lowest for any quarterback who has played New York this year.",
      "Overall, through three games, Mahomes\u2019s passer rating, yards per attempt and completion percentage would all be career lows if they carried through for the rest of the season.",
      "\u201cI feel like we were moving the ball the right way,\u201d Mahomes said postgame. \u201cWe have to clean stuff up and get better and better.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cFor us, just executing all the way throughout a drive and seeing that, that\u2019s what we want to be. We have to continue to do that more often.\u201d",
      "To be fair, Mahomes\u2019s receiving corps still leaves a lot to be desired, even if Tyquan Thornton had some nice moments in the second half against the New York. Kansas City still doesn\u2019t have a player with over 100 yards receiving in a single game yet so far this year.",
      "Travis Kelce, once one of the league\u2019s most feared tight ends, has 10 catches for 134 yards through three games. He is on pace for 759 yards receiving this season, which would be the lowest mark of his career, one year after he set a new career low in 2024. (And that\u2019s with the recent benefit of a 17th regular-season game.)",
      "Perhaps in an attempt to fire him up, Reid was caught in a heated conversation with Kelce late in the second quarter, with him and the tight end bumping chests.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a passionate guy and I love that part,\u201d Reid said of the exchange. \u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot of things with him, that\u2019s all part of it. I love that he loves to play the game.\u201d",
      "The offense wasn\u2019t alone in its struggles, as the Chiefs\u2019 miscues extended to the whole team.",
      "Harrison Butker missed multiple kicks, including a field goal and an extra point.",
      "Kansas City committed eight penalties for 85 yards, including multiple on a first-half drive that led to a Giants touchdown.",
      "It wasn\u2019t exactly a sterling effort from the Chiefs, who were bailed out in large part due to two Russell Wilson interceptions \u2014 as well as a bizarre decision by Wilson to seemingly throw away the ball on a late 4th-and-goal.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been searching for one win and try to figure out how we can get this thing going,\u201d linebacker Nick Bolton said. \u201cThe main thing now is just keep working, keep stacking and try to get another, then get another win.\u201d",
      "For now, Kansas City is certainly happy to come away with a victory. But it\u2019s hard to imagine the team rising to the top of the AFC with more performances like Sunday\u2019s.",
      "Only two of the Chiefs\u2019 next eight opponents have a record under .500, and both of those contests will be against divisional rivals. Meanwhile, over the next two months, Kansas City will have to play the Baltimore Ravens, Detroit Lions, Buffalo Bills, Washington Commanders and the currently undefeated Indianapolis Colts, all of whom have been much more impressive early in the season.",
      "Ultimately, the Chiefs took care of business against a lesser foe on Sunday. If Kansas City continues on its current trajectory, however, it still doesn\u2019t look like the kind of team that could live up to its past success."

      "Throughout their conversation, the two Chicago natives shared laughs, repeated each other's expressions and had several seemingly flirtatious moments. At one point, Palmer complimented Evans on his physique, given he hosts a show requiring him to constantly consume chicken wings.",
      "\u201cYour body looks so nice and trim. I feel like for you to have this kind of gig, I don\u2019t know how you do it,\u201d Palmer told Evans. \u201cYou look great.\u201d",

      "One commented, \u201cBro I\u2019m giggling and kicking my feet watching them both.\u201d",

    "summary": "\u201cThe Paper\u201d stars Oscar Nu\u00f1ez, Gbemisola Ikumelo and Alex Edelman chat with TODAY.com about the Peacock comedy and why they don't see it as a spinoff of \"The Office.\"",
    "story": [
      "At the end of a recent appearance on TODAY, \u201cThe Paper\u201d stars Oscar Nu\u00f1ez, Gbemisola Ikumelo and Alex Edelman were asked to offer their best deadpan expression to the camera. Each actor stared into the camera, as if a mockumentary was being filmed right there in Studio 1A, pretending to show signs of sarcasm and disgust.",
      "That sense of humor that has served the trio so well in their new Peacock series, a successor of sorts to \u201cThe Office,\u201d carried over just minutes later when they settled into a dressing room at 30 Rock to chat with TODAY.com. When it\u2019s mentioned that \u201cThe Office\u201d is one of the most beloved comedies of all time, Edelman, with a straight face, replies, \u201cNever seen it. Not a fan.\u201d (Peacock is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "Officially, Peacock has touted \u201cThe Paper\u201d as a comedy that is \u201cin the tradition of \u2018The Office.\u2019\u201d The two shows are connected in a variety of ways \u2014 for one, both were co-created by Greg Daniels. For another, both feature Nu\u00f1ez, who is reprising his role of Oscar Martinez as he moves on from the Dunder Mifflin paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to the Toledo Truth Teller newspaper in Ohio. (Oscar does drop the occasional reference to his old life in \u201cThe Paper,\u201d including in a phone call to his puzzle-loving former co-worker, Stanley.)",
      "However, the cast has taken care to emphasize that \u201cThe Paper\u201d is not a remake or a spinoff of \u201cThe Office.\u201d In a May interview with Collider, Domhnall Gleeson, who plays Ned Sampson, the new editor-in-chief of the newspaper, said, \u201cThe people are going to have to take the show on its own merits because it\u2019s become something different. It\u2019s a whole new city. It\u2019s not like a remake.\u201d",
      "Nu\u00f1ez shares a similar perspective in the interview with TODAY.com, saying, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a spinoff. It was never presented as one. People want it to be. It\u2019s a different show. It is the same documentary crew visiting another place with new people, and so that part is brand new.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the only glue, the sexy glue, that holds everything together,\u201d he quips.",
      "Edelman, who is a writer on the show in addition to his role as Adam, says that while \u201cThe Paper\u201d has the same \u201caesthetic\u201d of \u201cThe Office,\u201d with its camerawork and the return of directors who previously helmed episodes of the Emmy-winning NBC series, the \u201ccontent\u201d is what separates the two. He wasn\u2019t motivated to re-create the magic of \u201cThe Office,\u201d per se; he was motivated to make a good show with people he considers to be talented and funny.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019m surprised by the questions now about the pressure that one would feel from \u2018The Office,\u2019 because, frankly, you just feel pressure from your really talented co-workers,\u201d he continues.",
      "Ikumelo, who co-stars as Adelola, sees the premise of the show \u2014 that of a failing newspaper \u2014 as something fresh and different.",
      "\u201cI just thought there was so much comedy that could be mined from that and also story, and it felt like a genuine, real, kicking-off point, rather than a, \u2018Oh, we need to create something from a show that\u2019s existed before.\u2019 It felt like, \u2018Oh, no, this is real meat and real story,\u2019 and something that feels like it\u2019s important in terms of what\u2019s happening today,\u201d she says.",
      "\u2018Instant Chemistry\u2019 on the Set",
      "While Gleeson is the on-screen boss of \u201cThe Paper\u201d and has numerous impressive credits to his name, ranging from \u201cHarry Potter\u201d to the Oscar-winning \u201cEx Machina\u201d to \u201cStar Wars,\u201d \u201cThe Paper\u201d is an ensemble comedy in the same way \u201cThe Office\u201d was. Nu\u00f1ez is the link between those two ensembles, but he\u2019s not so sure it was essential that he be included in the new show.",
      "\u201cI surely appreciated it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s neat. I think it\u2019s cool. It\u2019s a little nod.\u201d",
      "Then, emphasizing the talent of a cast that also includes Sabrina Impacciatore, Chelsea Frei and Tim Key, he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s not really my show.\u201d",
      "Nu\u00f1ez and Edelman say the chemistry between the cast members is evident in the final product. Edelman saw from the beginning that the actors were jelling on the set.",
      "\u201cIt was really funny and good from the start, because Greg Daniels directed our pilot, so he knew what we wanted,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut I do think when you watch the show, you see the characters getting more and more comfortable with each other, which is really, really nice, because the narrative of the show is that this group is in sort of a new group.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the season, I was like, man, we really feel like a unit in a way that really makes sense for the narrative, which is really, really nice,\u201d he says.",
      "Ikumelo recalls being in the room as the show was being cast, saying decisions were made meticulously and with intention.",
      "\u201cThat casting, I think, helped in terms of the temperaments and the kinds of funny that people bring to the table. I think that really helps in terms of just generating instant chemistry, because it was cast well,\u201d she notes.",
      "Finding New Fans With \u2018The Paper\u2019",
      "The day before \u201cThe Paper\u201d premiered on Peacock on Sept. 4, the streaming platform announced the show had been renewed for a second season. The first season will also get a run on broadcast TV, when \u201cThe Paper\u201d joins NBC\u2019s Monday-night lineup beginning Nov. 10.",
      "Nu\u00f1ez is hoping as \u201cThe Paper\u201d continues to find an audience that it attracts both fans of \u201cThe Office\u201d and new fans as well.",
      "Edelman chimes in that the show is already being discovered by viewers who may be less familiar with \u201cThe Office.\u201d",
      "By some measures, \u201cThe Paper\u201d is already a hit with viewers and critics. It\u2019s currently one of the most-watched shows on Peacock, and it has an 84% Tomatometer rating on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve made this really beautiful thing on its own terms that we\u2019re all really, really proud of,\u201d Edelman says. \u201cI think as you watch over the course of the season, it just gets funnier and funnier.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait to start shooting\u201d Season 2, Nu\u00f1ez responds."

      "The huge, unanswered questions: Why did she do it? How could a mother do that to her own daughter?",
      "Over two years, Kendra sent thousands of texts to her daughter and her daughter's then-boyfriend that were mean, vulgar, sexually explicit and even dangerous.",
      "In December 2022, Kendra Licari was charged with two counts of stalking a minor, two counts of communicating with another to commit a crime and one count of obstruction of justice, per an Isabella County arrest warrant obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "At her sentencing, Judge Mark Duthie said the case had shown him the \u201cworst in human nature,\u201d according to courtroom reporting from The Morning Sun newspaper.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t imagine any parent saying such horrible things to her own daughter,\u201d he added.",
      "That is the exact thought of so many who have watched the documentary, which builds up suspense before revealing that Kendra has been the one bullying Lauryn all along.",
      "There's no official explanation \u2014 not in the documentary or any public record. If Kendra Licari has any sort of mental health diagnosis that could explain her behavior, it\u2019s not been made public. We may never know the answer. But people close to the case have theories.",
      "\u201cI think it was a cyber Munchausen\u2019s case,\u201d said Bill Chillman, Lauryn\u2019s school superintendent, in the documentary. \u201cShe wanted her daughter to need her in such a way that she was willing to hurt her and this is the way she chose to do that.\u201d",
      "Kendra\u2019s cousin Melissa Perry agreed, saying in the documentary, \u201cI think that\u2019s exactly it.\u201d",

      "TODAY.com reached out to a Stanford psychologist with a clinical specialty in Munchausen by Proxy, plus a 30-year-old woman who experienced a similar type of abuse from her mother.",
      "Both had a lot to say about the documentary and the true story behind it.",
      "\"Unknown Number\": A Psychologist's Perspective",
      "Dr. Mary Sanders, a Stanford psychologist, tells TODAY.com that Munchausen by proxy is \"when someone falsifies illness on behalf of someone else, usually a parent on behalf of a child, and that behavior persists even though there is no external reward,\" she says. \"Basically, it's to meet their psychological needs.\"",
      "The presence of technology has added new opportunities for the disorder to present itself. Dr. Marc Feldman, a psychiatry professor at the University of Alabama and Munchausen expert, has noted the rise of \"Munchausen by internet.\"",
      "\"Even when your mom does the seemingly most evil things you could imagine, you still saw your mom laugh. You were still comforted when your mom hugged you. There was still this good mom that cared so much.\"",
      "Jordyn Hope, Munchausen by proxy survivor",
      "Neither Sanders nor Feldman have personally treated Kendra Licari; they spoke about the condition in general.",
      "\"Online is now another arena to get attention,\" Sanders says.",
      "Sanders says parents with the syndrome use defense mechanisms, rationalization and compartmentalization to inflict harmful behaviors on their child. Sometimes these parents have been lured by Make-a-Wish trips to Disneyland. Other times they simply get a rush from the excitement and admiration they get as the parent of a \"sick\" kid. Few understand the harm they cause.",
      "\"They crave being able to rush in and and be a hero or receive a lot of attention for caretaking,\" says Sanders.",
      "\"Certainly this is abusive, extremely emotionally abusive,\" Sanders says of Kendra's behavior after watching the documentary. \"You know, some might even say sexually abusive as well, and certainly intentional deception.\"",
      "She adds, \"It's so disturbing how much there was about the texts  encouraging her to kill herself.\"",
      "Sanders notes that Kendra claimed to have known that Lauryn wouldn't kill herself, \"but we certainly know of cases in which kids have with far less cyberbullying than this.\" (Sanders says she worked with a parent who spoke similarly to their child, who survived, but did did end up inflicting self-harm.)",
      "At the same time, Sanders says she wants viewers to understand that \"people are complex.\" She says, \"People like Kendra are more than the worst behavior they ever did.\"",
      "Together with UCLA psychologist Dr. Brenda Bursch, Sanders developed the ACCEPTS model for treatment and management of Munchausen by proxy. The acronym stands for ACknowledgement, Coping, Empathy, Parenting, Taking charge and Support.",
      "In the documentary, Kendra says that \"everybody\" breaks the law at some point. This leads Sanders to believe that even after serving time in jail, Kendra has still not truly acknowledged the gravity of her actions.",
      "\"Acknowledgement is first,\" Sanders says. \"So if we don't even get there, the rest don't even matter.\"",
      "\u201cUnknown Number\u201d: A Survivor's Perspective",
      "At the age of 22, Jordyn Hope (who uses they/them pronouns) realized while learning about Munchausen by proxy in college that they were actually a survivor of the disorder.",
      "Jordyn's mother, Donna, took Jordyn to the hospital as a child for reported seizures, iron deficiency, asthma, fevers, anorexia, neutropenia and other conditions.",
      "Now 30, Jordyn has spent years unraveling their childhood of abuse, digging through medical records, confronting pediatricians and even appearing on a televised episode of \"The Doctors\" with their mother.",
      "\"If I get triggered, I don't know if I need to go to the ER or just take a Tylenol,\" says Jordyn, who now works as an independent contractor for Munchausen Support. \"It's definitely a journey.\"",
      "As Jordyn watched \"Unknown Number,\" they say they remember thinking, \"Whoa. I relate to this.\" Seeing Lauryn\u2019s face freeze while learning that her mother was the source of the cyberbullying has haunted Jordyn.",
      "\"One of the big things that really, really struck me was this sense of identity and having believed this whole time that it's you and Mom against the world, that it's you and Mom that are best friends, that Mom is helping you through this really, really hard, scary thing ... and then to find out Mom was actually doing these things to you,\" Jordyn says.",
      "Like Kendra, Donna was present at many of Jordyn's activities, coaching gymnastics and cheerleading \u2014 even winning the \"Best Mom\" title at Jordyn's beauty pageant. Donna died last year, leading to a complicated grieving process for Jordyn, who still occasionally texted and called their mom until the end.",
      "Jordyn completely understands why Lauryn still loves her mom and wants to communicate with her.",
      "\"Even when your mom does the seemingly most evil things you could imagine, you still saw your mom laugh. You were still comforted when your mom hugged you. There was still this good mom that cared so much,\" Jordyn shares, their voice wavering.",
      "\"I imagine most people watch that documentary and think, how could Lauryn still love her mom?\" Jordyn says. \"I just want to tell her that anything she's thinking or feeling is OK. She didn't do anything wrong. When you're a victim to something like this, there's nothing that you could have done wrong.\""

      "In an interview with Vanity Fair, Verrett defined \u201cshaman\u201d as a \u201cperson who\u2019s here to bridge back the spiritual world and the physical world in a tangible way that makes sense in the here and now. And also to give you tools so that you can be able to explore yourself, see yourself, know yourself, love yourself, and be who you truly came here to be.\u201d",

      "\u201cI love Durek\u2019s wisdom and humor and his depth, and that we can talk about any topic under the sun and that he always sees me, and always wants to evolve. I love that about you,\u201d M\u00e4rtha Louise said, adding that he\u2019s also \u201cvery handsome as well.\u201d",

      "\u201cShe\u2019s such a pure heart. She loves her children, she loves her family, she loves people,\u201d he said. \u201cI love how she is willing to be open to new ideas. Really being able to nurture the people around her is so beautiful.\u201d",
      "Why have they faced controversy?",
      "M\u00e4rtha Louise and Verrett have faced criticism through the years for their alternative beliefs and their relationship.",
      "Some of Verrett\u2019s beliefs have come under fire. For example, in his 2019 book, he made the claim that childhood cancer is caused by unhappiness. Following scandal, the Norwegian publisher attached to the project declined to publish it in Norway.",
      "In a post on Facebook, mayor of Oslo criticized Verrett for selling a $222 \u201cspirit optimizer\u201d on his website, which Verrett says can do things like \u201cenergize your food and drinks so they assimilate into your body more easily\u201d and \u201charmonize your space.\u201d",
      "In a joint interview with Vanity Fair, the couple said they receive hate online.",
      "\u201cEvery day I wake up, there\u2019s tons of mail from Norway of what a horrible person I am. And I\u2019m just like, what have I ever done to any of you?\u201d Verrett said.",
      "\u201cPeople are very angry,\u201d M\u00e4rtha Louise added. \u201cThey think that he has put a spell on me, that he\u2019s an awful person. There\u2019s people writing like, \u2018I don\u2019t trust his eyes. Look at his evil eyes.\u2019 They write that a lot. \u2018It\u2019s shameful. It\u2019s terrible. You should never be a part of the royal family being with a Shaman. What is that? Everything he does is just phony and it\u2019s false. How don\u2019t you see through that? It\u2019s terrible. You\u2019re a disgrace.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd of course, with him being Black and I\u2019m being white, you get all that kind of hate as well,\u201d she continued.",
      "Speaking to Vanity Fair, M\u00e4rtha Louise said the relationship opened her eyes to racism in Norway. \u201cBefore I met him, I never thought that there was racism in Norway, because we\u2019re all an open, happy family. But basically, there are not that many people of color in Norway, so it was all a surprise to me,\u201d she said.",
      "The Royal House of Norway condemned racist backlash in a statement in its website, saying, \u201cWe deplore the racist attitudes that Durek Verrett has had to contend with, especially on social media. We consider it a strength that the Royal House reflects Norway\u2019s ethnic diversity.\u201d",
      "M\u00e4rtha Louise also provided a statement on the Royal House of Norway\u2019s website clarifying her beliefs in alternative medicine, saying she is \u201cgrateful\u201d for the country\u2019s health care system, but also thinks \u201cfor many people alternative methods can be an important supplement to help from the conventional medical establishment.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am aware that many people follow what I do and say very closely. My title entails a certain responsibility. It is therefore important to me, including in my business activity, to distinguish between myself as a private person on the one hand and as a member of the Royal Family on the other. Sometimes I stumble, and am grateful to receive supportive advice along the way,\u201d she wrote.",
      "What is the couple\u2019s status as royals?",
      "In November 2022, following controversy around their engagement, M\u00e4rtha Louise said she would no longer officially represent the Norwegian royal house, but would still retain her title.",
      "\u201cThe process with the family has been amicable and loving,\u201d the caption read. As part of her message, she also wrote, \u201cDurek has a right to his autonomy and to speak his mind like everyone else.\u201d",
      "In the same video, Verrett addressed controversy his beliefs stirred.",
      "\u201cI know that some of the things I have said and done have been seen as controversial in Norway. Some have said this has become a problem in Norway. I want to be clear this was never my intention. I wish Martha\u2019s family well and want to do my part to support them in their roles,\u201d he said, but maintained he has a \u201cright to autonomy.\u201d",
      "The Royal House of Norway, in a statement, explained the decision. \u201cThe objective is both to prevent misunderstandings regarding the Royal House and to allow the Princess and Durek Verrett greater freedom in their business activities and other parts of their lives,\u201d a statement read.",
      "The Royal House of Norway shared details about Verrett\u2019s specific role in the monarchy.",
      "\u201cWhen Durek Verrett and Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise are married, Mr Verrett will become a part of the Royal Family, the website said, as M\u00e4rtha Louise\u2019s last husband Ari Behn was. \u201cBut in accordance with tradition he will not have a title or represent the Royal House of Norway.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia officially recognized Palestine as a state Sunday, a significant shift in foreign policy and a step away from their alignment with the United States, with several other European nations and U.S. allies set to follow suit this week.",
      "\u201cToday, to revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis, and a two state solution, the United Kingdom formally recognizes the State of Palestine,\u201d British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement.",
      "Canada had, moments before, become the first Group of 7 nation to recognize the state of Palestine, as Prime Minister Mark Carney promised a \"peaceful future for both the State of Palestine and the State of Israel.\"",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese released a statement shortly after formally recognizing \"the independent and sovereign State of Palestine.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement: \u201cWe will have to fight both at the UN and in all other arenas against the false propaganda against us and the calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state that will endanger our existence and constitute an absurd reward for terrorism. The international community will hear from us on this matter in the coming days.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu accused the foreign leaders of giving Hamas a \u201cprize.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will not happen,\u201d he said. \u201cA Palestinian state will not be established west of the Jordan River.\u201d",
      "The Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement on X that it \u201ccategorically rejects\u201d the declarations by the United Kingdom and other countries.",
      "\u201cThis declaration does not promote peace, but on the contrary \u2014 further destabilizes the region and undermines the chances of achieving a peaceful solution in the future,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Hamas applauded the decision, calling it a \u201crightful outcome of our people\u2019s struggle, steadfastness, and sacrifices on the path to liberation and return.\u201d",
      "The move, which is largely symbolic, grants the Palestinians increased diplomatic standing and the potential for treaty-making.",
      "But it does not fundamentally change the realities on the ground in the Gaza Strip, where the humanitarian crisis continues to worsen after nearly two years of war, or the occupied West Bank, where Palestinians have come under increasing pressure from Jewish settlers and the military.",
      "More than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, including thousands of children, according to the local Palestinian Health Ministry, with much of the territory destroyed and the majority of the population driven from their homes, often multiple times.",
      "Israeli strikes killed at least 34 people in Gaza City overnight, health officials said Sunday, as Israel pressed ahead with its offensive in the enclave's most populous city, where hundreds of thousands of people have been living under famine.",
      "It is against that backdrop that a growing list of countries, many of them traditional backers of Israel, have said they will recognize Palestine.",
      "The U.K. said in July it would recognize Palestine as a state unless the Israeli government \u201ctakes substantive steps to end the appalling situation\" in Gaza, and its official recognition comes amid mounting international criticism of Israel over the war in the enclave.",
      "\u201cIn the face of the growing horror in the Middle East, we are acting to keep alive the possibility of peace and of a two-state solution,\" Starmer said. \u201cThat means a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable Palestinian state \u2014 at the moment we have neither.\u201d",
      "Britain's decision has angered its close ally Israel, as well as the United States, which argues that recognition emboldens extremists and rewards Hamas, the group that led the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage, marking a major escalation in the decadeslong conflict.",
      "Recognition of a Palestinian state is \u201cnothing but a reward for jihadist Hamas \u2014 emboldened by its Muslim Brotherhood affiliated in the U.K.,\u201d Israel\u2019s foreign ministry said on X.",
      "\u201cHamas leaders themselves openly admit: this recognition is a direct outcome, the \u2018fruit\u2019 for the 7 October massacre,\u201d it said.",
      "The Hostage and Missing Families Forum, a group representing hostage families, condemned the decision to recognize a Palestinian state while \"turning a blind eye\" to the hostages who remain in captivity.",
      "\"We believe that any discussion about recognizing a Palestinian state must be contingent upon the immediate release of all hostages,\" it said in a statement Sunday.",
      "Starmer said recognition was \"not a reward for Hamas,\" because it means Hamas can have no future, and no role in government. Albanese also said Hamas must have \"no role in Palestine.\"",
      "The U.K.'s recognition is part of a wider shift among U.S. allies, bringing them closer to the more than 140 out of 193 U.N. member states that have already recognized Palestine as a state.",
      "France is expected to formally declare its recognition Monday at a United Nations conference in New York co-chaired with Saudi Arabia, coinciding with the start of the General Assembly.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday on Israeli television Channel 12 that nations \u201chave to recognize the legitimate right of Palestinian people to have a state.\u201d",
      "He also denounced Israel's new ground offensive in Gaza City as \"absolutely unacceptable\" and \"a huge mistake.\"",

      "Spain, Norway and Ireland recognized a state of Palestine last year.",
      "The creation of a Palestinian state refers to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel occupies both the West Bank and Gaza, meaning the Palestinian Authority is not in full control of its land or people.",

      "LONDON \u2014 After having showcased its finest pomp and pageantry during President Donald Trump\u2019s state visit last week, Britain\u2019s royal family has quickly been plunged back into all-too familiar controversy.",
      "Just days after Trump, the royals and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer largely skirted questions about Jeffrey Epstein that had threatened to complicate the sunny spectacle of his trip, the British press offered new revelations.",
      "A newly surfaced email revealed that Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, described Epstein, the disgraced financier, as a \u201csupreme friend\u201d despite his conviction for sex offenses.",
      "The email was published in two newspapers Sunday. It was sent by the duchess \u2014 the former wife of Prince Andrew, the Duke of York \u2014in 2011, just weeks after she had publicly distanced herself from Epstein.",
      "A spokesperson for the duchess said the email was sent to counter a threat Epstein had made to sue her for defamation.",
      "The story will add new fuel to damaging media coverage about royal links to Epstein, which have centered on Andrew's own close relationship and a lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse \u2014 he denied the allegations by Virginia Giuffre and settled out of court. Giuffre died by suicide this year.",
      "In a 2011 interview, the duchess said her involvement with Epstein \u2014 who was jailed in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor \u2014 had been a \u201cgigantic error of judgment,\u201d promising she would never have anything to do with him again.",
      "\u201cI abhor pedophilia and any sexual abuse of children,\u201d she said at the time, adding that what Epstein did was \"wrong and for which he was rightly jailed.\u201d",
      "But The Sun and the Mail on Sunday reported that shortly after the interview, Ferguson emailed Epstein to reassure him she had not used the word \u201cpedophilia\u201d in reference to him.",
      "\u201cAs you know, I did not, absolutely not, say the \u2018P word\u2019 about you but understand it was reported that I did,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI know you feel hellaciously let down by me. You have always been a steadfast, generous and supreme friend to me and my family.\u201d",
      "The duchess was \u201ctaken in\u201d by Epstein\u2019s lies, her spokesperson said Sunday.",
      "\u201cAs soon as she was aware of the extent of the allegations against him, she not only cut off contact but condemned him publicly, to the extent that he then threatened to sue her for defamation for associating him with pedophilia.\u201d",
      "The spokesperson said Ferguson stood by her public condemnation of Epstein. \u201cThis email was sent in the context of advice the Duchess was given to try to assuage Epstein and his threats,\u201d the spokesperson added",
      "Epstein was found dead by suicide in 2019 while he was awaiting a trial on sex-trafficking charges in New York.",
      "Andrew returned his military affiliations and royal patronages in January 2022 after his lawyers failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss Giuffre\u2019s lawsuit.",
      "Andrew later paid a substantial sum to Giuffre, who alleged he abused her when she was 17. Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegation.",
      "Giuffre died in April, with her family saying in a statement that \u201cthe toll of abuse is so heavy that it became unbearable for Virginia to handle its weight.\u201d",
      "Other royals have rarely appeared in public with Andrew since his fall from grace.",
      "In December, Andrew was caught up in an alleged spying case after he cultivated an \u201cunusual degree of trust\u201d with a Chinese man who was barred from the U.K. on national security grounds, according to court documents."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has said he hopes to see Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan returned to U.S. control, suggesting a renewed American presence in the country now again ruled by the Taliban.",
      "\"We're trying to get it back,\" Trump said of Bagram during a news conference Thursday alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that capped a whirlwind state visit to the United Kingdom.",
      "Taking aim at the Biden administration's fraught withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as a \"total disaster,\" Trump criticized the decision to relinquish Bagram Airfield, which quickly fell under the control of the Taliban as they swept back into power in 2021.",
      "\"We gave it to them for nothing,\" said Trump, who has long criticized the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. \"We want that base back,\" he said.",
      "About an hour's drive north of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, Bagram served for years as a crucial hub in the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. At its peak around 2012, the sprawling airfield saw more than 100,000 U.S. troops pass through its compound.",
      "Late Thursday, Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Afghan Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea of Bagram returning to the U.S.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan and the U.S. need to interact with each other and can have economic and political relations based on mutual respect and common interests,\u201d Jalaly said on the social platform X. \u201cThe Afghans have not accepted a military presence in history, and this possibility was completely rejected during the Doha talks and agreement, but the door is open for further interaction.\u201d",
      "Trump made clear at least one motivating factor for his interest in reclaiming Bagram, noting its proximity to rival superpower China.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,\u201d Trump said during his comments Thursday, which came a day before he was spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid ongoing trade negotiations.",
      "Addressing journalists later on Air Force One, Trump said Bagram was \"one of the most powerful bases in the world in terms of runway strength and length,\" adding: \"You could land anything there.\" He emphasized again that the base was \"an hour away from where they make their missiles \u2014 China.\"",
      "Addressing Trump's comments Friday, Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China \"respects Afghanistan\u2019s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.",
      "\"Afghanistan\u2019s future should be decided by its own people,\" Lin said, adding: \"Stirring up tension and creating confrontation in the region won\u2019t be popular.\"",
      "China, which has made strides in rapidly expanding its nuclear stockpile, is estimated to have accumulated about 600 warheads, according to the Chicago-based nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.",
      "Of course, greater surveillance on China wouldn't be the only advantage to regaining Bagram.",
      "A presence at the base could also aid in regional counterterrorism efforts, among other factors that could appeal to Trump.",
      "It remains unclear to what extent, if any, the U.S. has been in talks with the Taliban on the future of Bagram.",
      "\u201cEven if the Taliban considered this, China most certainly would do everything it can to entice the Taliban to keep the U.S. out of Afghanistan and has far more leverage and enticements to make this happen,\" Bill Roggio, editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Long War Journal, cautioned in comments shared online Thursday.",
      "\"The Trump administration should be very careful not to grant the Taliban concessions only to be prevented access to Bagram in the end,\" he said.",
      "The Taliban have been working to rehabilitate their global standing, with the militant group freeing American George Glezmann, a Delta Air Lines mechanic, in March amid efforts to normalize relations between Afghanistan and the U.S.",
      "On Friday, the Taliban also released British couple Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband, Peter Reynolds, 80, who were detained by the Interior Ministry in February, according to Sky News, NBC News' sister outlet in the United Kingdom.",
      "Trump's comments came as the Pentagon continues to push ahead with a review into the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, during which 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghans were killed at Kabul's airport in a bombing by the Islamic State terrorist group.",
      "Trump, who began the process for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during his first term, has been a fierce critic of the Biden administration's handling of the drawdown.",
      "The White House under President Joe Biden largely blamed the Trump administration for the chaotic withdrawal, with a National Security Council report released in 2023 arguing that Biden's options for executing the operation were \"severely constrained by conditions created by his predecessor.\""

      "Speculation had gone into overdrive prior to the announcement, with experts wondering whether Masaryk may have conveyed a fateful warning before Europe's descent back into war. His words are believed to have been dictated to his son Jan, surviving both World War II and subsequent communist rule.",
      "Jan\u2019s former secretary handed the envelope to the National Archives in 2005 on the condition that it not be opened for another 20 years.",
      "Even the Masaryk family did not know what mystery the white envelope contained. But when it was opened early Friday, it still managed to surprise.",

      "Rather than a final message before his death in 1937, experts assessed that the message was instead dictated three years earlier.",
      "\u201cI am ill, seriously ill \u2014 it is the end, but I am not afraid. You will continue the work, you know how, but you must be careful. You know how to behave; I don\u2019t need to tell you anything more,\u201d the letter read, according to the country's official broadcaster.",

      "Masaryk became the first president of Czechoslovakia in 1918 after it declared independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was defeated in World War I. He served until 1935. Jan became foreign minister at the end of World War II, until his sudden death in 1948.",
      "In the envelope, Masaryk talked extensively about his death and subsequent funeral and reflected on the complex political situation in the ethnically diverse country.",
      "As well as derisive comments about a Slovak politician, he urged keeping the German minority part of the state. \u201cGive them what they deserve, but no more,\u201d he said of the Germans, according to the state broadcaster.",
      "\u201c[This was a] crucial time in Czechoslovakia with Hitler just coming to power in Germany,\u201d said Mark Cornwall, an emeritus professor of modern European history at the University of Southampton in England.",
      "\u201cIt was a very turbulent period in Europe about what was going to happen,\u201d said Cornwall, nodding to the Nazis' subsequent annexation of the Sudetenland, a Czech region that had a significant German-speaking population, and the later outbreak of World War II.",
      "\u201cMasaryk is still very revered\u201d in the country, Cornwall told NBC News in a telephone interview. \u201cI can\u2019t think of an American equivalent. Perhaps he\u2019s George Washington or Abraham Lincoln.\u201d"

    "summary": "U.S. allies called an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Monday after a series of incidents raised alarm about Russian threats to NATO.",
    "story": [
      "Drones over Poland. Fighter jets above Estonia. Surveillance planes over the Baltic Sea.",
      "To U.S. allies in Europe, the pattern is unmistakable: A deliberate campaign of escalation from the Kremlin, designed to probe NATO\u2019s defenses and political resolve.",
      "The question hanging over an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Monday is how exactly the alliance will respond.",
      "As NATO struggles to turn alarm into action, officials and analysts urged a more forceful response and warned that hesitation risks emboldening  Russian President Vladimir Putin. But questions about U.S. support, escalation risks and what this growing threat means for Ukraine remain unresolved.",
      "Estonia, which called for the Security Council meeting after three Russian MiG-31 fighter aircraft entered its airspace for 12 minutes without permission last week, pressed members to address what it described as a \u201cblatant, reckless, and flagrant violation of NATO airspace\u201d and Russia\u2019s \u201crepeated violations of international law.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s actions \u201cundermine principles vital to the security of all U.N. member states,\u201d Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said Sunday in a post on X.",
      "Claims that Russia violated Estonian airspace were \"baseless\" and \"aimed at escalating tensions,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday, adding that Russia operated within international regulations.",
      "So far, NATO\u2019s response has largely been limited to meeting rooms as Moscow's probing exposes a contrast between European leaders\u2019 urgent calls for action and President Donald Trump\u2019s more muted response.",
      "Asked by reporters Sunday whether Washington would come to the defense of Poland and the Baltic states if Russia attacks, Trump said: \"Yeah I would.\"",
      "NATO's response to this ratcheting Russian activity amounts to the launch of operation \"Eastern Sentry\" earlier this month to bolster the defense of Europe\u2019s eastern flank in response to a series of Russian drone incursions over Poland.",
      "After Germany and Sweden scrambled fighter jets Sunday to intercept and track a Russian surveillance plane flying unidentified over the Baltic Sea, one regional leader said Russia was not just testing NATO\u2019s response, but was also aiming to reduce support for Ukraine by compelling countries to redirect resources.",
      "Calibrating how to respond to Russia was not easy, Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said on social media, adding that Russia was doing just enough not to cross a red line.",
      "European confidence about backing from Washington has been shaken by Ukraine, where Trump has so far stopped short of imposing his promised punishment of further sanctions on the Kremlin for refusing peace talks.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he was preparing for an \u201cintense week\u201d at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, where he hopes to build support for efforts to stop Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Ukraine has also submitted a request to attend the Security Council meeting and present its position.",
      "But Europe's security will require decisive action, and that will not happen at a Security Council meeting, \u201cfor the very simple reason that Russia has a veto on the council,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank",
      "Unable to rely on Trump\u2019s \u201cshifting position\u201d on Russia, Giles told NBC News, the \"coalition of the willing\" \u2014 European nations that say they are prepared to underwrite security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 must become the \u201ccoalition of the able and actually doing something.\u201d",
      "Poland will not hesitate to shoot down objects that violate its airspace and pose a threat, its prime minister said Monday. But, he said, his country would take a more cautious approach when dealing with situations that are less clear-cut, and would need to know it had its allies' support.",
      "\"You really need to think twice before deciding on actions that could trigger a very acute phase of conflict,\u201d Donald Tusk told a news conference.",
      "Hesitation, analysts said, risks sending a dangerous signal.",
      "\u201cEurope and NATO have to show the will to respond forcefully to Russia,\u201d said Moritz Brake, a senior fellow at the Center for Advanced Security, Strategic and Integration Studies.",
      "\u201cRussia is trying to gauge whether it\u2019s possible to single out individual elements of the alliance,\u201d he said in a phone interview.",
      "A forceful approach, Brake argued, would involve not just intercepting Russian aircraft, but also sending \u201cmanned fighter jets\u201d that could shoot Russian jets down \u201cat any minute.\u201d",
      "As an example, he pointed to 2015, when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian warplane seconds after it violated the country\u2019s airspace near the Syrian border. Moscow did not retaliate militarily.",
      "\u201cRussia didn\u2019t declare war on Turkey,\u201d Brake said. \u201cWavering is much more dangerous than a forceful approach.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A Palestinian state is getting a powerful new push.",
      "Dozens of world leaders will gather Monday to rally support for a two-state solution, with the U.S. and Israel set to boycott as they find themselves increasingly isolated by a rising tide of traditional allies responding to Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip.",
      "The summit, convened by France and Saudi Arabia, comes after the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Portugal all announced their formal recognition of the state of Palestine on Sunday, with several other nations expected to follow suit at the United Nations General Assembly this week.",
      "These Western powers may be hoping to breathe new life into the idea as a way to resolve the conflict, but Israel's hardline government has instead vowed to retaliate while pressing ahead with its deadly assault on Gaza City that has forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon said both Israel and the U.S. would boycott Monday's summit, branding it a \"circus.\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decried the moves as a \"huge reward to terrorism\" and vowed there \"will be no Palestinian state.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also warned of possible repercussions for countries taking measures against Israel, including France, whose President Emmanuel Macron was expected to officially recognize Palestine later Monday, according to Reuters.",
      "Hopes for a two-state solution have dwindled in the midst of Israel's nearly two-year offensive in Gaza \u2014 and as efforts to negotiate a ceasefire to end the war and free remaining hostages have repeatedly failed.",
      "Palestinian statehood, which would see an internationally recognized state in territories seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, is now formally recognized by around 75% of U.N. member countries. But that recognition remains largely symbolic.",
      "Gershon Baskin, an Israeli who has acted as a mediator with Hamas for decades and a staunch advocate for a two-state solution, said that he welcomed the growing recognition. But without further action, including sanctions against Israel, he said the move will do little to \"change the lives of Palestinians\" on the ground.",
      "\"It's really a step in the right direction,\" Baskin said in a phone interview Monday of the summit at the UNGA. But, calling Israel's offensive in Gaza \"a genocide,\" he said, \"the most important thing now ... is to end the war in Gaza and that comes before everything else.\"",
      "It is unclear how effective Monday\u2019s summit will be in advancing efforts to end the war in the face of furious opposition from Israel and the U.S., which blocked Palestinian officials from even attending the U.N. gathering.",
      "Baskin noted the possibility of retaliation from Israel in response to the diplomatic moves by France, the U.K. and others, with far-right members of Netanyahu's government pushing for the annexation of part of the occupied West Bank.",
      "Speaking with the BBC ahead of Monday's summit, British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said she had directly warned her Israeli counterpart against such a move.",
      "Baskin warned that any \"annexation steps by Israel, which would be illegal against international law\" would only result in further isolation of the country on the international stage.",
      "\u201cThis conflict has to be resolved \u2014 and the only way to resolve it is through the two-state solution,\u201d he said.",
      "Palestinians in the West Bank also welcomed the growing international recognition, but said more must be done.",
      "The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates said it \u201cwelcomes and thanks the countries that have recognized the State of Palestine,\u201d calling their decisions \u201ccourageous and consistent with international law and international legitimacy resolutions.\u201d",
      "\u201cCertainly, these successive recognitions raise the morale of the Palestinian people, as they confirm that the blood of our Palestinian people has not been shed in vain,\u201d one resident of Ramallah, Hussam Abu Nasr, told The Associated Press.",

      "The backlash against Arc\u2019teryx highlights Chinese consumers\u2019 growing preference for practicality and sustainability over grand spectacles that could potentially lead to waste and degradation, said Sho Hu, a Beijing-based public relations consultant and commentator.",
      "\u201cThis is a shift shaped by different stages of China\u2019s economic growth,\u201d Hu told NBC News Monday in a phone interview. \u201cPeople are no longer interested in pursuing grand celebrations.

      "A series of unprecedented Russian incursions into NATO members' airspace in recent weeks has raised the alarm across Europe, which is looking towards an emboldened Kremlin for clues to its intentions and next moves.",
      "The incidents have also exposed a contrast between European leaders' urgent calls for action and President Donald Trump's more muted response, as he continues to hold back on imposing additional sanctions on Moscow as its war on Ukraine rages on.",
      "On Friday, for the second time in 10 days, a NATO ally invoked Article 4 following airspace violations linked to Russia \u2014 a mechanism that prompts urgent talks among allies and that had only been triggered seven times in its 76-year history before this month.",
      "Earlier in the day, three MiG-31 fighter aircraft entered Estonian airspace without permission and remained there for a total of 12 minutes, according to the country's Ministry of Defense. NATO aircraft intercepted the jets, the military alliance\u2019s spokesperson Allison Hart said.",
      "Estonia's Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna called the incursion \"unprecedentedly brazen,\" saying Russia had already violated its airspace four times this year.",
      "It was \u201can extremely dangerous provocation,\u201d added Kaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief.",
      "Russia denied violating Estonian airspace, saying aircraft were making a scheduled flight from from Russia to Kaliningrad, an exclave wedged between Poland and Lithuania, that was conducted in \u201cstrict compliance\u201d with international regulations.",
      "While European leaders have responded with urgency, signaling deep concern and pushing for stronger measures on Moscow amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, President Donald Trump has struck a more restrained note as he continues to hold back on imposing further sanctions on the Kremlin.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t love it,\u201d Trump said Friday on the latest incursion. \u201cI don\u2019t like when that happens. Could be big trouble.\u201d",
      "Although Trump has expressed frustration and disappointment with Putin, saying on Thursday that the Russian leader \u201chas let me down,\u201d relations with the Kremlin have warmed dramatically during this administration.",
      "Trump has also been unwilling to impose further sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, despite repeated threats.",
      "The President said last week he was \"ready to do major sanctions on Russia,\" once NATO nations had \"agreed, and started, to do the same thing,\" and criticized allies for continuing to purchase Russian oil.",
      "Estonia and the United States are members of NATO, which at its core is a mutual defense pact formed after World War II to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union, meaning an attack on one may be considered an attack on all.",
      "Friday's incident marked the third incursion into NATO airspace linked to Russia in ten days.",
      "On Sept. 10, Poland reported Russian drones entering its territory, triggering the first Article 4 request this month. Four days later, Romania scrambled jets to respond to a Russian drone breach. Romania did not invoke Article 4.",
      "Moscow downplayed the incident, saying it had \u201cno plans to target\u201d facilities in Poland, but Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said it was \u201cthe closest we have been to open conflict since World War II.\u201d",
      "Trump, again, offered a more muted response, saying the suspected incursion \"could have been a mistake.\"",
      "His acting U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dorothy Shea, sought to reassure allies. Violating the airspace of a U.S. ally, \u201cintentionally or otherwise,\u201d showed \u201cimmense disrespect for good-faith U.S. efforts to bring an end to this conflict,\u201d she told the U.N. Security Council.",
      "\"Rest assured, we will defend every inch of NATO territory,\" she added.",
      "Moscow has not commented on the Romanian claims.",
      "Brett Erickson, a sanctions expert and adviser to Loyola University\u2019s Chicago School of Law, warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin was testing the West\u2019s resolve, and battlefield readiness.",
      "\u201cIf the West hesitates, Russia will keep testing, probing, and collecting data on our response,\u201d he told NBC News via email. \u201cEvery incursion is a rehearsal. Unless we act decisively now, we are training Moscow to believe NATO is predictable, divided, and slow.\u201d",
      "The divergence between Europe's urgent stance and Trump's restraint comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressed Washington for stronger measures, who has urged Trump to take a clearer position on Moscow.",
      "\"If the war continues and there are no movements towards peace, we expect sanctions,\" he told reporters Friday evening, adding that he expects Trump to take such actions.",
      "Russian air strikes killed at least three people and wounded dozens more as it launched a large-scale missile and drone attack across multiple Ukrainian regions on Friday night.",
      "Poland said it scrambled jets overnight to ensure \"maximum readiness\" and safety in areas bordering the parts of Ukraine under attack.",
      "Loyala's Erickson said sanctions were essential, and must be \u201call-out\u201d and \u201call-together,\u201d urging Washington to align with its allies.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump must put his foot down,\u201d he said. \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d"

    "published": "Sat, 20 Sep 2025 08:30:40 GMT",
    "summary": "After it was barred from the Eurovision Song Contest Russia is reviving a Soviet-era version of the camp competition.",
    "story": [
      "Perhaps the Eurovision ban is starting to bite, because three years after Russia was booted from the beloved song contest following the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it is reviving a Soviet-era version of the camp competition.",
      "The Intervision Song Contest will see 23 artists from around the world \u2014 including one representing the U.S. \u2014 offer a heady mix of musical styles, from moody Belarusian pop to Colombian folk and high-energy Vietnamese rap at an arena in the capital of Moscow on Saturday night.",
      "Unlike the Eurovision Song Contest, which mainly includes European countries and a few others like Australia and Israel, Intervision bills itself as a truly global event by offering artists from countries around the world, including those in the Global South, a chance to compete for the top prize of 30 million rubles (roughly $360,000).",
      "\u201cBack in the Soviet times, the government would decide to promote a positive image of Russia abroad. We need to promote an objective image. We want to be known with all our merits and shortcomings,\u201d Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a news conference this week in response to a presubmitted question from NBC News.",
      "Asked whether Russia was using the competition as an exercise in soft power, he replied, \u201cIf by soft power you mean the opportunity to let people know about us, then of course we\u2019re interested in this.\u201d",
      "A pop phenomenon drawing around 160 million viewers each May, Eurovision began at the height of the Cold War in 1956 as a technical experiment to try and broadcast a simultaneous program across the member stations of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).",
      "A divided continent had mirror organizations like the NATO defense alliance in Western Europe and the Warsaw Pact in Eastern Europe, and the EBU in the West matched by the International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT) on the other side of the Iron Curtain.",
      "In answer to Eurovision came Intervision, which was broadcast by the OIRT on several occasions between 1965 and 1980, with contests held in what was then Czechoslovakia and later in Poland.",
      "But Dean Vuletic, who has written and edited books on Eurovision and led a research project on Intervision, says Russia is getting its history wrong with the relaunch, \u201cpresenting Intervision as something that was Russian- or Soviet-led, but it actually wasn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Instead, he said, the competitions \u201cweren\u2019t that focused on the Soviet participants,\u201d although they had to be invited. Having studied the archives of Czech and Polish TV stations, he said it was \u201castonishing how critical they are of the Soviet participants.\u201d",
      "He added that it was actually created during a period of liberalization in an attempt \u201cto promote East-West cooperation in popular music and television,\u201d and Western performers like Gloria Gaynor were invited to perform in the intervals. Performers from Eastern Europe were also hoping to be signed by Western labels, he added.",
      "Before it was kicked out in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia was frequently a top-10 finalist at Eurovision, which Vuletic called \u201ca huge platform for cultural diplomacy for any country,\u201d big or small.",
      "The country\u2019s leaders \u201csaw it as a very prestigious cultural project and one which could reach a huge amount of people,\u201d he added.",
      "But Eurovision\u2019s embrace of LGBTQ rights drew the ire of conservative Russian lawmakers and the country\u2019s Orthodox Church, particularly after the 2014 victory of bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst.",
      "Saturday\u2019s Intervision contest is getting a full-court press promotion from organizers, who have drafted a series of celebrity \u201cambassadors\u201d to get the word out. Among them are Dima Bilan, a Russian singer who won Eurovision in 2008, and Alexander Ovechkin, the Washington Capitals hockey star, who holds the record for most goals scored in NHL history.",
      "The goal is to \u201cpromote universal, spiritual, family, cultural, ethical, and religious traditions of different nations,\u201d according to the competition\u2019s website, although that seems potentially at odds with the entrant representing the U.S., Vassy, who has a history of performing at Pride events and supporting LGBTQ rights.",
      "Vassy, an Australian-born singer living in Los Angeles, has been a vocalist on dance tracks from David Guetta and Ti\u00ebsto, while several of her own topped Billboard\u2019s Dance Club Songs chart in the 2010s.",
      "The 42-year-old, whose real name is Vasiliki Karagiorgos, was a last-minute addition to the contest after the previous selection pulled out due to \u201cunforeseen family circumstances.\u201d",
      "Her outlook is markedly different from that of Russia\u2019s entrant, Shaman, who mixes politics and pop and rose in popularity after he became a strident supporter of the war in Ukraine.",
      "So vocal is his backing of the Kremlin that he has ended up on Australian and European Union sanction lists.",
      "Russia will be hoping that Shaman\u2019s popularity can bring a younger audience to the contest as well as his fans, many of whom are based outside major Russian metropolises like Moscow and St. Petersburg, according to Yulia Yurtaeva-Martens, a researcher at the Free University of Berlin who has written a book on Intervision.",
      "With his fulsome embrace of Russian nationalism in his music and performances, Shaman is viewed by the government as \u201ca new political symbol for new audiences,\u201d according to Yurtaeva-Martens, adding that it was unlikely they would have chosen anyone else because he \u201cwas the best choice for the Russian government.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Kenya\u2019s Sanaipei Tande is competing with her song \u201cFlavour,\u201d an Afropop tune that mixes English and Kiswahili.",
      "In between rehearsals in Moscow, she said in a Zoom interview this week that she hadn\u2019t heard of Intervision before this year and was only really familiar with Eurovision because 2011\u2019s contest had featured Norwegian-Kenyan singer Stella Mwangi.",
      "For artists who may have had success at home, performing at Intervision is a chance to step onto a larger stage, she said. In her case, this is both metaphorically and literally true because \u201cthe live arena is so huge.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen any stage in my country that\u2019s this big,\u201d she said, adding that coming to the Russian capital \u201cto compete against other international artists \u2014 that, for me, has put me on a whole new level.\u201d",
      "The fact she had been selected and was representing Kenya was a victory in itself, she said.",
      "\u201cI mean, $300,000 wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing to add on to that,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cBut just being here and being able to perform on this stage and experiencing things on a whole new level, that already is a win.\u201d"

      "Trump summarized their conversation, which he said began at 8 a.m. ET, in a Truth Social post in which he said he appreciates \u201cthe TikTok approval,\u201d but stopped short of announcing any kind of finalized deal. As expected, the call also appeared to touch on the ongoing trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.",
      "\u201cI just completed a very productive call with President Xi of China. We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "For more on this story, listen to \u2018Here\u2019s the Scoop,\u2019 a daily evening podcast that brings you a fresh take on the day\u2019s top stories in 15 minutes or less.",
      "Trump said that he agreed with Xi that they would meet at the Oct. 31-Nov. 1 APEC summit in South Korea, that Trump would go to China early next year, and that Xi would eventually come to the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe call was a very good one, we will be speaking again by phone, appreciate the TikTok approval, and both look forward to meeting at APEC!\u201d the president wrote.",
      "The White House is not disputing the characterization that there is no final TikTok deal. An announcement on a final deal would ultimately come from the president, a White House official said.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Friday afternoon, Trump offered some mixed messages on the status of TikTok talks. He said Xi \"approved the TikTok deal,\" and then said \"we look forward to getting that deal closed.\"",
      "Asked directly if the deal was fully approved, Trump said, \"Well, I think so. I mean \u2014 when you say fully approved, I don\u2019t know what that means. We have to get, we have to get it signed. I guess it could be a formality.\"",
      "He added that \"the TikTok deal is well on its way.\"",
      "Separately, Chinese state media said Trump and Xi had a \u201ccandid and in-depth exchange of views\u201d and that the call was \u201cpragmatic, positive, and constructive.\u201d Xi said the U.S. should avoid taking restrictive trade measures \u201cto prevent undermining the outcomes achieved through multiple rounds of consultations,\u201d according to a readout published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "On TikTok, Xi said the Chinese government \u201crespects the will of companies and is pleased to see companies conduct business negotiations on the basis of market rules and reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and balance interests,\u201d the readout said.",
      "\u201cWe hope the U.S. side will provide an open, fair, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies investing in the United States,\u201d it said.",
      "In a statement, TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, thanked Xi and Trump \u201cfor their efforts to preserve TikTok in the United States\u201d and said it will \u201cwork in accordance with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users through TikTok U.S.\u201d",
      "Friday's call was the first between Trump and Xi since June, when Trump said they had spoken for about 90 minutes in a discussion focused on trade.",
      "At the height of trade tensions in April, U.S. and Chinese tariff rates reached as high as 145%, in what amounted to a mutual trade embargo. Since then they have been lowered under another \u201cframework\u201d deal, with new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods capped at 30%, while China imposes a 10% additional tariff on U.S. goods.",
      "The lower tariff rates are set to expire on Nov. 10 unless a deal is reached or the trade truce is extended again.",
      "The two countries also continue to tussle over export controls on strategically important products such as rare earths, which China has a near-monopoly over, and U.S. chip technology.",
      "TikTok, which is estimated to have about 170 million active users in the U.S., faces a ban unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, agrees to sell the app\u2019s U.S. assets to U.S. owners. The sale is required under a law Congress passed last year, citing national security concerns.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump formally extended the deadline for a TikTok deal for a fourth time, until Dec. 16, a day after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Beijing and Washington had struck a \u201cframework\u201d for an agreement, without providing details such as who would be taking over TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "Trump has gone back and forth on the ban, but he credits TikTok with helping him win last year\u2019s presidential election and has expressed concern about alienating its huge and youthful user base. He said Thursday during a visit to the U.K. that the app \u201chas tremendous value\u201d and that \u201cvery rich people and companies are going to be owning it.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials have said the TikTok sale is necessary because of Chinese laws that require Chinese companies to share data requested by the government. They also cite concerns about data collection and the algorithm the app uses to recommend content to users, which they say is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese officials.",
      "TikTok denies sharing user data with Chinese authorities and says the U.S. has never provided evidence of Beijing trying to manipulate the algorithm.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance say the powerful algorithm, which has helped fuel the app\u2019s global success, is proprietary and thus difficult to sell to a U.S. company under Chinese law.",
      "There are concerns that TikTok may continue to use the Chinese algorithm in the U.S.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., the committee\u2019s ranking member, have both expressed opposition to any deal that keeps the algorithm under Chinese control or allows ByteDance to maintain an operational relationship with the new American TikTok.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has all the leverage he needs to strike a deal that saves TikTok and complies with the law \u2014 which means making sure TikTok\u2019s data and algorithm are truly in American hands,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Any deal would most likely need to be approved by Congress as well as ByteDance\u2019s board.",
      "Compared with five years ago, when Trump first called for a ban during his first term, TikTok is more mature as a platform and less likely to keep growing, said Dimitar Gueorguiev, an associate professor of political science and director of Chinese studies at Syracuse University.",
      "\u201cTikTok is, I think, a less valuable bargaining chip from the Chinese perspective, and an easier concession,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, for the United States, it\u2019s as visible and kind of politically salient as ever.\u201d",
      "While the details of the TikTok deal remain unclear, Gueorguiev said, the broader question is \u201ccan the Trump administration, as well as their counterparts in Beijing, convert on whatever progress we observe today and keep it going\u201d to achieve a \u201clarger bargain\u201d between the U.S. and China.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re thinking about what is the ultimate outcome of this, and who wins and who loses, there\u2019s still a lot to be told,\u201d he said."
