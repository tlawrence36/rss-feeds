      "NEW YORK -- MrBeast's new CEO hit Wall Street Wednesday as YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson's media empire looks to develop long-term brand partnerships and, in turn, unlock more funding for its charitable content.",
      "Venture capitalist Jeff Housenbold took over MrBeast leadership last summer with a mandate to professionalize an ever-growing entertainment company. YouTube's most popular creator had reached record audience levels far outpacing its startup days, while vowing to reassess its internal culture amid multiple controversies. But, despite joining Nasdaq's closing bell ceremony on Wednesday, Housenbold said their strategic plan does not currently include a public offering \u2014 or any active funding rounds.",
      "\u201cDo I want to make banger content? Yeah. That\u2019s cool,\" Housenbold told The Associated Press. \"But what can we do with that banger content? Generate profits, make a sustainable business that gives us greater ability to impact people\u2019s lives around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re marching quickly to profitability, so we don\u2019t have to raise additional capital,\u201d he added.",
      "Instead, MrBeast is focused on securing multi-year exclusive advertising deals as opposed to single-video brand partnerships. With 416 million subscribers and legions of impressionable young fans, Housenbold argued that MrBeast is uniquely positioned to deliver more bang for companies' marketing bucks by pointing that \u201cfirehouse of attention\u201d at them.",
      "Along the way, Housenbold said he is encouraging Donaldson to tout the channel's charitable works \u2014 which often feature quantifiable stunts such as building wells, removing ocean plastic or covering cataract surgery costs. The company, in his view, \u201ccan do good while doing well.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe more people who like us \u2019cause we do good, the more people watch our videos,\" he said. \u201cThe more people watch our videos, the more we\u2019re able to drive in fees from our advertising partners... the more we can invest in more content to do more good in the world.\u201d",
      "New projects such as the Amazon Prime reality show and a James Patterson novel from HarperCollins aim to diversify the genders and ages of his audience. Housenbold said that base has historically consisted mostly of 8-to-25-year-olds and men.",
      "But Housenbold acknowledged missteps in last year's production of \u201cBeast Games,\" which prompted allegations of \u201cunsafe\u201d conditions from some contestants who said an unorganized set led to injuries, irregular food provision and lacking access to medication. While describing most of those reports as \u201cinaccurate,\u201d Housenbold said they were \u201cbetter prepared\u201d for the second season's recently wrapped shoot.",

The remastered version arrives Sept. 19 via Rhino Records' high-fidelity series and was sourced from the original analog master tapes. The album will also receive a CD and digital release for the first time, and the opening track, \u201cCrying in the Night,\u201d was available to stream Wednesday.",
      "Buckingham and Nicks were in their early to mid-20s during the making of their album. \u201cIt was a very natural thing, from the beginning,\u201d Nicks says in the re-release's liner notes, written by music journalist David Fricke.",
      "Despite their relative inexperience, \u201cit stands up in a way you would hope it would, by these two kids who were pretty young to be doing that work,\u201d Buckingham says, according to the announcement release.",
      "The reissue announcement was foreshadowed by cryptic Instagram posts last week. Both Nicks and Buckingham shared handwritten lyrics to their official social media accounts.",
      "\u201cAnd if you go forward\u2026\u201d Nicks posted, a line from their song \u201cFrozen Love,\u201d which appears on \u201cBuckingham Nicks.\u201d",

He claimed he was told five days after the group appeared at Radio City Music Hall that the band would tour without him. He says he would have been paid at least $12 million for his share of the proceeds. Later that year, Buckingham said they had settled the lawsuit.",
      "Both Buckingham and Nicks have also released reams of solo music. Some fans had theorized that Nicks and Buckingham were teasing a Fleetwood Mac reunion, which would have been the first since the death of vocalist, songwriter and keyboard player Christine McVie in 2022.",

      "Ozzy Osbourne's image forever changed with the 2002 debut of his family reality show \u201cThe Osbournes.\u201d",
      "LOS ANGELES -- There was Ozzy before \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d and Ozzy after \u201cThe Osbournes.\u201d",
      "For much of his life, the Black Sabbath founder and legendary heavy metal frontman who died at 76 on Tuesday was known to much of the public as a dark purveyor of deeds ranging from decadent to downright Satanic.",
      "Wild stories followed him. Clergy condemned him. Parents sued him.",
      "But with the debut of his family reality show on MTV, the world learned what those who'd been paying closer attention already knew: Ozzy Osbourne was soft and fuzzy under the darkness.",
      "During its relatively short run from 2002 to 2005, \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d became a runaway hit and made stars of his wife Sharon and kids Jack and Kelly. But more than that, it made a star of the domesticated version of Ozzy Osbourne, and in the process changed reality TV.",
      "In 2025, when virtually every variety of celebrity has had a reality show, it's hard to see what a novelty the series was. MTV sold it as television's first \u201creality sitcom.\"",
      "\u201cJust the idea of the Black Sabbath founder, who will forever be known for biting the head off a bat during a 1982 concert, as a family man seems strange,\u201d Associated Press Media Writer David Bauder wrote on the eve of \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d premiere. But on the show, Osbourne was \"sweetly funny \u2014 and under everything a lot like the put-upon dads you\u2019ve been seeing in television sitcoms for generations.\u201d",
      "Danny Deraney, a publicist who worked with Osbourne and was a lifelong fan, said of the show, \"You saw some guy who was curious. You saw some guy who was being funny. You just saw pretty much the real thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not the guy that everyone associates with the \u2018Prince of Darkness\u2019 and all this craziness,\u201d Deraney said. \"And people loved him. He became so affable to so many people because of that show. As metal fans, we knew it. We knew that\u2019s who he was. But now everyone knew.\u201d",
      "Reality shows at the time, especially the popular competition shows like \u201cSurvivor,\u201d thrived on heightened circumstances. For \u201cThe Osbournes,\u201d no stakes were too low.",
      "They sat on the couch. They ate dinner. The now-sober Ozzy sipped Diet Cokes, and urged his kids not to indulge in alcohol or drugs when they went out. He struggled to find the History Channel on his satellite TV. They feuded with the neighbors because, of all things, their loud music was driving the Osbournes crazy.",
      "\u201cYou were seeing this really fascinating, appealing, bizarre tension between the public persona of a celebrity and their mundane experiences at home,\u201d said Kathryn VanArendonk, a critic for Vulture and New York Magazine.",

      "Like family sitcoms, the affection its leads clearly had for each other was essential to its appeal.",
      "\u201cFor some reason, we kind of just fell in love with them the same way that we grew to love Ozzy and Sharon as like a marital unit,\" Caruso said.",
      "What was maybe strangest about the show was how not-strange it felt. The two Ozzies seemed seamless rather than contradictory.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re realizing that these things are personas and that all personas are these like elaborate complex mosaics of like who a person is,\u201d VanArendonk said.",
      "\u201cThe Osbournes\u201d had both an immediate and a long-term affect on the genre.",
      "Both Caruso and VanArendonk said shows like \u201cNewlyweds: Nick and Jessica,\u201d which followed then-pop stars Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey after they married, was clearly a descendant.",
      "And countless other shows felt its influence, from \u201cThe Kardashians\u201d to \u201cThe Baldwins\u201d \u2014 the recently debuted reality series on Alec Baldwin, his wife Hilaria and their seven kids.",
      "\u201c'The Baldwins\u2019 as a reality show is explicitly modeled on \u2018The Osbournes,\u2019 VanArendonk said. \u201dIt\u2019s like you have these famous people and now you get to see what their home lives are like, what they are like as parents, what they\u2019re eating, what they are taking on with them on vacation, who their pets are, and they are these sort of cuddly, warm, eccentric figures.\u201d",

Payne died in October after falling from a hotel balcony in Argentina, not long after the show\u2019s production wrapped.",

      "The show is hosted by McLean, with Pussycat Dolls frontwoman \u2014 and newly minted Tony winner \u2014 Nicole Scherzinger mentoring the bands and Destiny\u2019s Child star Kelly Rowland serving as a guest judge alongside Payne.",

      "Payne first appears in the seventh episode for the showcase, where each band performs in front of a live audience and the judges, only about a week after they form.",
      "\u201cWe were amazing dancers, obviously, in One Direction,\u201d Payne joked in the episode while offering critiques to boy band Midnight \u2019til Morning, whose members expressed hesitations with dancing onstage. Band member Mason Watts then revealed his family had won tickets to sit front row at a One Direction concert when he was 11, stoking applause from the crowd and a heartfelt response from Payne.",
      "\u201cEver since that moment, I wanted to be in a group,\u201d Watts, originally from Australia, said in the episode. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a full-circle moment to be here with a group and performing in front of you. So, thank you, man.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration has announced that it will once again withdraw from the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it will once again withdraw from the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, an expected move that has the U.S. further retreating from international organizations.",
      "The decision to pull U.S. funding and participation from UNESCO comes two years after the Biden administration rejoined following a controversial, five-year absence that began during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. The White House cited similar concerns as it did in 2018, saying it believes U.S. involvement is not in its national interest and accusing the agency of promoting anti-Israel speech.",
      "The decision, which won't go into effect until December 2026, will deal a blow to an agency known for preserving cultural heritage through its UNESCO World Heritage Sites program \u2014 which recognizes significant landmarks for protection, ranging from the Taj Mahal to Egypt's pyramids of Giza and the Grand Canyon National Park. The agency also empowers education and science across the globe.",
      "It is the Trump administration\u2019s latest move to pull support for U.N. agencies under a larger campaign to reshape U.S. diplomacy. Under the \"America First\" approach, the administration has pulled out of the U.N. World Health Organization and the top U.N. human rights body, while reassessing its funding for others. This has left the U.N., which is in the process of its own massive overhaul, reevaluating core programs and initiatives and what the international body would look like without support from the U.S. \u2014 its largest donor.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement that the withdrawal was linked to UNESCO\u2019s perceived agenda to \u201cadvance divisive social and cultural causes.\u201d",
      "She added that UNESCO\u2019s decision in 2011 \u201cto admit the \u2018State of Palestine\u2019 as a Member State is highly problematic, contrary to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization.\u201d",
      "UNESCO director general Audrey Azoulay said she \u201cdeeply\u201d regrets the U.S. decision but said it was expected and that the agency \u201chas prepared for it.\u201d She also denied accusations of anti-Israel bias, saying it contradicts \u201cthe reality of UNESCO\u2019s efforts, particularly in the field of Holocaust education and the fight against antisemitism.\u201d",
      "Azoulay added that \u201cthe reasons put forward by the United States of America are the same as seven years ago, even though the situation has changed profoundly, political tensions have receded, and UNESCO today constitutes a rare forum for consensus on concrete and action-oriented multilateralism.\"",
      "Danny Danon, Israel's ambassador to the U.N., celebrated the announcement, saying in a statement that it is a \u201cfitting response to the consistent misguided anti-Israel bias of UNESCO, an organization that has lost its way.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration had rejoined UNESCO in 2023 after citing concerns that China was filling the gap left by the U.S. in UNESCO policymaking, notably in setting standards for artificial intelligence and technology education.",
      "\u201cUnilaterally withdrawing the United States from UNESCO is another assault by the Trump administration on international cooperation and U.S. global leadership,\" Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said.",

      "The withdrawal, which was first reported by the New York Post, came after a review ordered by the Trump administration earlier this year. While the U.S. had previously provided a notable share of the agency\u2019s budget, UNESCO has diversified its funding sources in recent years as the U.S. contribution has decreased. Today, American assistance represents only 8% of the agency\u2019s total budget.",
      "Bruce hinted later Tuesday that further U.S. withdrawal from international organizations could be coming as a result of the ongoing review to ensure \u201ccontinued U.S. participation in international organizations will focus on advancing American interests with clarity and conviction.\u201d",
      "Azoulay pledged that UNESCO will carry out its missions despite \u201cinevitably reduced resources.\u201d The agency said that it is not considering any staff layoffs at this stage.",
      "\u201cUNESCO\u2019s purpose is to welcome all the nations of the world, and the United States of America is and always will be welcome,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will continue to work hand in hand with all our American partners in the private sector, academia and non-profit organizations, and will pursue our political dialogue with the U.S. administration and Congress.\u201d",
      "The U.S. previously pulled out of UNESCO under the Reagan administration in 1984 because it viewed the agency as mismanaged, corrupt and used to advance the interests of the Soviet Union. It rejoined in 2003 during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency.",
      "France, where UNESCO is based, stated in a press release that it regrets the U.S.\u2019s decision to withdraw from the agency, which was founded in 1946 \u201cto prevent conflicts through education, culture and tolerance.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrance supports UNESCO, which backs several of its priorities at international level, particularly access to education for all, the protection of endangered heritage, the protection of our oceans, the responsible development of artificial intelligence and the fight against anti-Semitism and hate speech,\u201d the French foreign ministry said.",

      "The NBA Summer League in Las Vegas has become more than just basketball",
      "LAS VEGAS -- While Bronny James and other young talent were lighting up the NBA Summer League court in Las Vegas, another game was being played just a few steps away: One with scripts, storyboards and studio buzz.",
      "Inside the Thomas & Mack Center, just as the league wrapped up Sunday, a different kind of crowd formed. Hollywood execs, producers and curious power players were slipping away from the basketball action to catch a slate of 34 film projects created by NBA stars past and present.",
      "More than just film screenings, it\u2019s an emerging playground where sports and the art of storytelling collide. From baseline to backlot, the Summer League Film Festival is generating off-court buzz \u2014 with the likes of Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett, actor-producer Mark Wahlberg and filmmaker Deon Taylor joining the mix. Conversations are building on turning this three-day showcase into a launchpad for athlete-filmmakers, backed by film industry veterans who understand both the creative and business sides of shaping ideas and grooming projects for the screen.",
      "\u201cThis definitely has legs,\u201d said retired NBA player Stacey Augmon after previewing \u201cUNLV: Kings of Vegas,\u201d a documentary chronicling the untold story of the Runnin\u2019 Rebels in the Strip View Pavilion. A 10-minute clip was screened before a packed audience, including Sundance Film Festival director Michelle Satter and production companies like the Wahlberg co-owned Unrealistic Ideas and Alcon Entertainment, the company behind \u201cThe Book of Eli\u201d and \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d",
      "Like other entries, the \u201cKings of Vegas\u201d team showcased select footage, including interviews with high-profile names such as Snoop Dogg, Chuck D and Jimmy Kimmel, alongside UNLV legends Augmon, Larry Johnson, Greg Anthony and others. After the screening, the producers and cast discussed the film\u2019s origins, drawing a standing ovation from the crowd.",
      "The documentary remains in development, but Augmon says the film festival is already proving its worth.",
      "\u201cThis gives us another great avenue,\u201d said Augmon, who played on the Runnin' Rebels team that won the 1990 NCAA championship before his 15-season NBA career. His college teammate, Anderson Hunt, said sharing their authentic, real-life stories offer a major advantage like never before, unlocking new pathways to getting their projects financed and sold.",
      "\u201cWe have control of what's coming out,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cPeople might know about our stories through the internet. But stuff like this takes our platform to the next level. This is great for us, and Deon is like a golden child.\u201d",
      "The festival spotlighted stories produced by NBA stars past and present including Nikola Jokic, Luguentz Dort, Tony Allen, Nate Robinson, Kyle Anderson, Cole Anthony, Keyon Dooling and Udonis Haslem.",
      "Deon and Roxanne Avent Taylor of Hidden Empire Film Group were tapped to infuse the festival with seasoned filmmaking expertise, helping bridge the worlds of sports and entertainment. He played a key role in encouraging Hollywood insiders to show up, especially during the NBA Summer League's final stretch to keep the closing days as enticing as opening week.",
      "Taylor credited NBA Summer League co-founder Albert Hall for having the foresight to spark the collaboration.",
      "\u201cThis is all invaluable,\u201d said Hall, who cofounded the league with Warren LeGarie in 2004. \u201cThe players make money, no doubt about it. They invest in these projects. But they don\u2019t really know what the system can provide or how to approach it. Kind of like a young executive getting into the sport or a young player trying to be seen and get exposure. It\u2019s the same way. They have to be coached up.\u201d",
      "Hall said the partnership with Hidden Empire was a natural next step following their successful collaboration with the NFL and Skydance Sports, where they led film training sessions in March for more than 20 current and former NFL players. He added that having Wahlberg and Archie Gips of Unrealistic Ideas on board brings more industry muscle to strengthen the initiative and help drive it forward.",

You can do that if you've lived and experienced it. You can't do that from a high-rise building with no pain. These guys come from adversity in life and sports.\u201d",
      "EverWonder Studio president Michael Antinoro certainly thinks so, and then some. He sees the film festival as more than a one-off spectacle in Las Vegas.",
      "In Antinoro's eyes, it could become the Oscars of athlete-driven storytelling with satellite versions popping up in the NBA arenas throughout the season. He sees value in helping standout projects secure the final funding and reach the right distributors.",
      "\u201cIf we can add any value, we\u2019re in the rooms talking to all the networks and streamers that distributes films,\u201d said Antinoro, a founding partner of the studio, which specializes in nonfiction content, documentaries and live events. The company served as co-executive producer on \u201cDefiant: The Manny Pacquiao Obsession\u201d in 2019 and produced projects featuring Mike Tyson and Brett Favre.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking to them a lot. It\u2019s all about exposure,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of these films maybe need a little more money just to get them over the line. If it makes sense, we can play a little there too.\u201d",
      "For Michelle Satter, it\u2019s all about fostering a supportive creative community. She sees promising potential in what\u2019s taking shape at the Summer League Film Festival.",
      "While it\u2019s still early, Satter can envision a future where projects from the festival eventually find their way into Sundance.",
      "\u201cWhy not? Of course,\u201d said Satter, a founding figure at Sundance since 1981. She now serves as the founding senior director of Sundance Institute's artist programs. She's exploring how it might support the festival after being invited by Taylor.",
      "Sundance already has an existing partnership with Taylor\u2019s Hidden Empire. She called the opportunity to collaborate on this new venture both exciting and aligned with Sundance\u2019s mission to uplift emerging voices in storytelling.",
      "Satter's late son, Michael Latt, had his documentary short \u201cHoops, Hopes & Dreams\u201d premiere at Sundance early this year. She said Sundance gets about 15,000 short film submissions each year, but there\u2019s room for compelling storytelling that opens up new perspective from an athlete\u2019s lens.",
      "\u201cThat was the power of storytelling, the unity of sports and bringing people together in community,\u201d she said. \u201cI love the idea. These are the stories people need to see. They need to be out there in the world.\u201d",

      "The larger-than-life frontman of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath Ozzy Osbourne has died",
      "NEW YORK -- There are pioneering music figures, and then there is Ozzy Osbourne, the larger-than-life frontman of Black Sabbath, whose personal mythology is eclipsed only by the strength and immortality of his songs.",
      "A godfather and force of heavy metal, Osbourne died Tuesday at 76, just weeks after his last performance.",
      "The English icon's idiosyncratic, throaty voice launched generations of metalheads, both through his work at the reins of Black Sabbath and in his solo career. Across his repertoire, there are songs with total global ubiquity and lesser-known innovations with his unique, spooky aesthetic quality.",
      "To celebrate Osbourne\u2019s life and legacy, we've selected just a few songs that made the man, from timeless tunes to a few left-of-center selections.",
      "Read on and then listen to all of the tracks on our Spotify playlist.",
      "It would be a challenge to name a more immediately recognizable guitar riff than the one that launches Black Sabbath's 1970 megahit \u201cIron Man.\u201d It transcends the metal genre \u2014 an all-timer heard around the world and in guitar stores everywhere.",
      "One of the great Vietnam War protest songs, Black Sabbath's \u201cWar Pigs\u201d is a rare moment where hippies and metalheads can agree: \u201cPoliticians hide themselves away / They only started the war / Why should they go out to fight?\u201d Osbourne sings in the bridge.",
      "Osbourne's heaviest performances are at least partially indebted to Black Sabbath's bassist and lyricist Terry \u201cGeezer\u201d Butler, and there is perhaps no better example than \u201cChildren of the Grave,\u201d the single from the band's 1971 album, \u201cMaster of Reality.\u201d \u201cMust the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?\u201d Osbourne embodies Butler's words, a sonic fist lifted in the air. \u201cCan they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?\u201d",
      "Black Sabbath were in a creative rut in the time period leading up to \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath,\u201d the opening track from their 1973 album of the same name. It's almost hard to believe now \u2014 the song features one of their best-known riffs, and its chorus features some truly ascendant vocals.",

      "Another classic cut from Osbourne's debut solo album, \u201cBlizzard Of Ozz\u201d \u2014 released one year after Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath for his legendary excesses, \u2014 the arena rock anthem \u201cMr. Crowley\u201d pays tribute to the famed English occultist Aleister Crowley and features Deep Purple's Don Airey on keyboard.",
      "The title track and coda of Osbourne's second solo studio album, \u201cDiary of a Madman,\u201d runs over six minutes long, features big strings and a choir so theatrical it sounds like they're scoring a medieval war film. He wanted big, he wanted dramatic, and he nailed it.",
      "It wouldn't be inaccurate to call \u201cMama, I'm Coming Home\u201d a beautiful-sounding song. It's unlike anything on this list, a power ballad featuring lyrics written by the late Mot\u00f6rhead frontman Lemmy and a welcomed deviation.",
      "When Black Sabbath comes to mind, most fans jump to an unimpeachable run of albums released in the '70s and early \u201980s. But \u201cI,\u201d a cut from Black Sabbath's too often overlooked 16th studio album, \u201cDehumanizer,\u201d is worth your ear. And not only because it is the first Sabbath album to feature singer Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice since 1981's \u201cMob Rules,\u201d though that's an obvious plus.",
      "Late in life Ozzy Osbourne was generous with his time and talent, often collaborating with younger performers who idolized the metal legend. One such example is Post Malone's \u201cTake What You Want,\u201d which also features the rapper Travis Scott. Osbourne gives the song a necessary gothic edge \u2014 validating the otherwise balladic song's use of a sprightly guitar solo.",

      "The five-member K-pop group 1VERSE is debuting Friday, with two North Korean defectors alongside members from the United States and Japan",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- With two out of five of its members North Korean defectors, the K-pop group 1VERSE is breaking new ground as it debuts its single album Friday.",
      "The band represents an unusual convergence of backgrounds: North Korea-born rapper Hyuk and singer Seok join Nathan from Arkansas, Kenny from Los Angeles, and Aito from Japan.",
      "While not the first K-pop act to include North Korean defectors \u2014 BE BOYS\u2019 Hak Seong debuted earlier this year \u2014 the diversity of the group's members add a rare dimension to the genre\u2019s growing global diversity.",
      "The group debuts Friday with their single album \u201cThe 1st Verse\u201d under Seoul-based label Singing Beetle. Their title track \u201cShattered\u201d features lyrics co-written by Hyuk and Kenny.",
      "\u201cWith members from different countries all coming together as 1VERSE, I just thought \u2018we can do this regardless of background\u2019 going forward,\u201d said Aito, the group\u2019s youngest member from Chiba, Japan.",
      "Hyuk, who lived in North Korea\u2019s North Hamgyong Province until age 12, defected to the South in 2013. His journey to K-pop stardom began while working in a factory in South Korea, where a chance encounter with the CEO of a music label eventually led to weekend rap lessons in Seoul.",
      "\u201cI went to university but then things went bad. It was when COVID was pretty severe, and a bad incident happened, so I had no choice but to work at a factory,\u201d he said.",
      "Initially skeptical, Hyuk thought the invitation to become a pop star might be a scam. He recalled thinking: \u201cI really have nothing right now, even if you rob me, not even dust would come out.\"",
      "After a year of meetings where the music executive consistently bought him meals and encouraged his training, Hyuk joined the agency in late 2021.",
      "Seok\u2019s path was similarly unconventional. A former soccer player who started playing at 8 years old in North Korea, he defected in 2019. He declined to provide additional details, citing safety concerns.",
      "After arriving in South Korea, he briefly played for a semi-professional team before pursuing physical education studies. During weekend soccer games he was approached about an idol training program.",
      "\u201cI was starting music for the first time, right? So I started with the mindset that if it doesn\u2019t work out, I can just stop and try something else,\u201d Seok said.",
      "Both members\u2019 experiences reflect harsh realities they left behind. Hyuk described spending eight to 10 hours daily collecting firewood as a child just to survive.",
      "\u201cWhere I lived, we had to collect firewood just to cook rice and survive day by day \u2014 it was essential,\u201d he recalled.",

      "Seok had some exposure to K-pop in North Korea, listening occasionally to f(x)\u2018s \u201cLA chA TA\u201d and Super Junior songs despite it being illegal in North Korea to listen to South Korean music. \u201cI probably heard K-pop back in elementary school. But I couldn\u2019t listen often since it was illegal,\u201d he said.",
      "Experts and defectors say K-pop and other South Korean pop culture products have emerged as a challenge to North Korea\u2019s leadership as they steadily gained popularity among the public.",
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has intensified campaigns since the pandemic to eliminate South Korean cultural influence.",
      "Nathan, from Arkansas, first encountered K-pop through his Texas-based cousins who were longtime fans. \u201cI would kind of just pretend to be a hater, like urgh, K-pop. And then I just so happened to come across EXO\u2019s \u2018Growl\u2019 music video on YouTube,\u201d he recalled.",
      "The group\u2019s diverse backgrounds are reflected in their training, which includes courses on global citizenship. \u201cWe want to be inclusive of everyone\u2019s history, everyone\u2019s current situations back home,\u201d Kenny explained.",
      "Seok expressed excitement about connecting with international fans, particularly in America. \u201cSince I came from North Korea, it\u2019s hard to see foreigners there. So I really wanted to see people from other countries,\u201d he said.",
      "The group has already gained traction online. Seok described filming emotional video diaries during difficult early training days, which fans responded to with supportive messages.",
      "\u201cI filmed that diary video with somewhat emotional, slightly teary feelings. And I uploaded it to TikTok or YouTube, and fans sent me comforting letters,\" he said. \u201cAs soon as I saw the first line, tears came out and I was really touched.\u201d",

      "In Alaska, a public radio station general manager took a moment from a busy day warning her community about a possible tsunami for a special task \u2014 sending a text message to Sen. Lisa Murkowski urging her to vote against a measure to strip federal fund...",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Lauren Adams, general manager for KUCB public radio in Unalaska, Alaska, didn't have much time to reflect on Congress, 4,000 miles away, stripping federal funding for public media this week. She's been too busy working.",
      "Sirens blared in the Aleutian Islands community Wednesday warning of a potential tsunami, with a voice over public loudspeakers urging the community's 4,100 residents to seek higher ground immediately and tune into the radio \u2014 to Adams' station.",
      "At the same time in Washington, the Senate was voting on a measure that would eliminate nearly $1.1 billion that had already been appropriated for NPR and PBS \u2014 a process that didn't end until early Thursday morning. The House completed the process in time for President Donald Trump to sign it before a Friday deadline.",
      "Trump had called for the cuts, saying public media's news programming was biased against him and fellow Republicans, and threatened GOP members of Congress with primary challenges if they didn't fall in line.",
      "Adams, her news director, a reporter and an intern kept broadcasting and updating KUCB's social media feed until the danger passed. Then she made time for one more task \u2014 texting U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and urging her to vote against the bill. Murkowski was one of two Republican senators, along with Susan Collins of Maine, to publicly dissent.",
      "\u201cI thought that it was such a telling story of why her constituents have a different relationship to public radio than maybe some other regions of the United States,\u201d Adams said.",
      "The federal money is appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes it to NPR and PBS. Roughly 70% of the money goes directly to the 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations across the country, although that's only a shorthand way to describe its potential impact.",
      "The cuts are expected to weigh most heavily on smaller public media outlets away from big cities, and it's likely some won't survive. Katherine Maher, NPR's president and CEO, estimated as many as 80 NPR stations may face closure in the next year. Some stations are already fielding offers from commercial entities to buy their broadcast licenses, she said.",
      "\u201cMany of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,\u201d said Paula Kerger, PBS president and CEO. \u201cThere is nothing more American than PBS. Despite today's setback, we are determined to keep fighting to preserve the essential services we provide to the American public.\u201d",
      "The measure will cost PBS and NPR stations in Mississippi roughly $2 million, about 15% of the budget, said Royal Aills, executive director of Mississippi Public Broadcasting.",
      "Already, Mississippi Public Broadcasting has decided to eliminate a streaming channel that airs children's programming like \u201cCaillou\u201d and \u201cDaniel Tiger's Neighborhood\u201d to the state's youngsters 24 hours a day, said Taiwo Gaynor, the system's chief content officer.",
      "\u201cThis is important for families, to have access to content that they don't have to pay for,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cThat is a sad thought, to think that we ... might not be able to provide that for a generation of children.\u201d",
      "Maine\u2019s public media system is looking at a hit of $2.5 million, or about 12% of its budget, for the next fiscal year, said Rick Schneider, president and chief executive officer of Maine Public. He said he\u2019s not ready to identify specific cuts, but the system is preparing to reinvent itself to make certain it continues serving the state\u2019s residents.",
      "Maine\u2019s rural residents rely heavily on public media for weather updates and disaster alerts, said Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of ACLU of Maine. Rowles said public media was a \u201clifeline\u201d to her growing up off the grid.",
      "NPR's Maher fears what the cuts might mean for the system's journalism, not just in rural areas where local news can be hard to come by, but in telling the rest of the country what is going on there. Less funding will also mean less support for popular television and radio programming, although it's too soon to tell which programs will be affected.",
      "NPR stations also use millions of dollars in federal money to pay music licensing fees. Now many will have to renegotiate these deals, which could mean less music, or a more limited variety of music, on outlets where music discovery is a big part of their identity. For example, Maher estimates that some 96% of all classical music broadcast in the United States is on NPR stations. \u201cThat is essentially taking an entire art form out of public access,\u201d she said.",

      "Already, public media is seeing an increase in donations from reader and viewers to support its mission, and stations are actively sounding the alarm. In a plea to listeners on its website Thursday, Philadelphia's WXPN radio pointed to its legacy in helping people discover new music. \u201cThe most important thing you can do is support WXPN and the public media system in a way that is meaningful to you,\u201d the station urged on its website.",
      "But donations aren't going to fill the hole left by the loss in federal funding, Maher said. The public media leaders have already turned to lobbying Congress to restore some of the funding through the appropriations process for next year's budget. They don't know how much time they have; Maher said it would be inordinately costly, and perhaps prohibitive, to reopen a radio station that is forced to close.",
      "Public media isn't getting any help from states, either. At least five states have reduced their own outlays for public media this year, either for budget or political reasons.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example, vetoed nearly $6 million that Florida lawmakers had set aside for public broadcasters the day before the state's budget took effect on July 1. \u201cDone in Florida,\u201d DeSantis responded on social media to a Trump post calling public broadcasting a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d that should be defunded.",

Griffin said the station\u2019s board has already agreed on a plan to furlough staff members one day a month, and he\u2019s taking a 50% pay cut.",

The rate in 2023 was 1.621, and inched down in 2024 to 1.599, according to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",

      "What happened? CDC officials said it was due to recalculations stemming from a change in the U.S. Census population estimates used to compute the birth rate.",
      "That's plausible, Root said. As the total population of women of childbearing age grew due to immigration, it offset small increases in births to women in those age groups, she said.",

      "The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for donation by some patients who showed signs of life",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is developing new safeguards for the organ transplant system after a government investigation found a Kentucky group continued preparations for organ donation by some patients who showed signs of life, officials told Congress Tuesday.",
      "While the organ removals were canceled, near misses that some lawmakers called horrifying should never happen. A House subcommittee asked how to repair trust in the transplant network for potential organ donors and families -- some of whom have opted out of donor registries after these cases were publicized.",
      "\u201cWe have to get this right,\u201d said Rep. Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee and whose mother died waiting for a liver transplant.",
      "\u201cHopefully people will walk away today knowing we need to address issues but still confident that they can give life,\u201d Guthrie said, adding that he will remain a registered organ donor.",
      "The hearing came after a federal investigation began last fall into allegations that a Kentucky donation group pressured a hospital in 2021 to proceed with plans to withdraw life support and retrieve organs from a man despite signs that he might be waking up from his drug overdose. That surgery never happened after a doctor noticed him moving and moaning while being transported to the operating room \u2014 and the man survived.",
      "Lawmakers stressed most organ donations proceed appropriately and save tens of thousands of lives a year. But the federal probe \u2013 concluded in March but only made public ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing -- cited a \u201cconcerning pattern of risk\u201d in dozens of other cases involving the Kentucky group's initial planning to recover someone's organs.",
      "The report said some should have been stopped or reassessed earlier, and mostly involved small or rural hospitals with less experience in caring for potential organ donors.",
      "The Kentucky organ procurement organization, or OPO, has made changes and the national transplant network is working on additional steps. But notably absent Tuesday was any testimony from hospitals \u2013 whose doctors must independently determine a patient is dead before donation groups are allowed to retrieve organs.",
      "Here's a look at how the nation's transplant system works.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list and about 13 a day die waiting, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.",
      "Only about 1% of deaths occur in a way that allows someone to even be considered for organ donation. Most people declared dead in a hospital will quickly be transferred to a funeral home or morgue instead.",
      "Several groups are involved in every transplant: the hospital caring for someone dead or dying; the 55 OPOs that coordinate recovery of organs and help match them to patients on the waiting list; and transplant centers that decide if an organ is the right fit for their patients.",
      "Adding to the complexity, two government agencies \u2014 HRSA, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2014 share regulatory oversight of different parts of the donation and transplant process.",
      "Most organ donors are brain-dead \u2013 when testing determines someone has no brain function after a catastrophic injury. The body is left on a ventilator to support the organs until they can be retrieved.",

      "Hospitals are required to alert their area OPO to every potential donor who is declared brain-dead or once the decision to withdraw life support is made. The OPOs by law can't participate in that decision and \"we are not even in the room at that time,\u201d said Barry Massa of Kentucky's Network for Hope.",
      "During the following days of preparation, hospital employees continue caring for the patient \u2013 while the donation team talks with the family about the process, gathers hospital records showing the patient is eligible, requests tests of organ quality, and make arrangements with transplant centers to use them.",
      "Once the hospital withdraws life support and the heart stops beating there\u2019s a mandatory wait \u2013 five minutes \u2013 to be sure it won\u2019t restart. When the doctor declares death, the organ retrieval process can begin.",
      "Organs are only considered usable if death occurs relatively quickly, usually up to about two hours. Sometimes that takes much longer and thus the organs can\u2019t be used \u2013 and HRSA\u2019s Dr. Raymond Lynch told Congress that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything was done wrong. Still, he said HRSA is investigating reports of possible mistakes elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThis is a technically demanding form of care\u201d that requires \u201cgood collaboration between the OPO and the hospital,\u201d he said.",
      "At issue is how doctors are sure when it\u2019s time to withdraw life support from a dying patient \u2014 and the delicate balance of how OPOs interact with hospital staff in preparing for donation once death occurs.",
      "In May, HRSA quietly ordered the U.S. transplant network to oversee improvements at the Kentucky OPO and to develop new national policies making clear that anyone \u2013 family, hospital staff or organ donation staff \u2013 can call for a pause in donation preparations any time there are concerns about the patient\u2019s eligibility.",
      "Lynch said the government now wants more proactive collaboration from OPOs to give hospital staff \u201ca clear understanding\u201d of when to at least temporarily halt and reevaluate a potential donor if their health status changes.",
      "Kentucky's Massa said his group only received HRSA\u2019s reports this week \u2013 but that after learning about last fall\u2019s allegations, it made some changes.

      "Data from the Education Department shows the pace at which it resolves civil rights complaints has slowed as the Trump administration dismantles the agency",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration insists it hasn\u2019t wavered in its duty to protect the civil rights of America\u2019s children even as it dismantles the Education Department. Yet its own data shows the agency has resolved far fewer civil rights cases than in past years despite families filing more complaints.",
      "The Education Department\u2019s civil rights branch lost nearly half its staff amid mass layoffs in March, raising questions about its ability to address a deep backlog of complaints from students alleging discrimination based on disability, sex or race. Pressed on the issue in June, Education Secretary Linda McMahon denied a slowdown.",
      "\u201cNot only are we reducing the backlog, but we are keeping up with the current amount with a reduced staff because we are doing it efficiently,\u201d McMahon said at a Senate budget hearing.",
      "By several measures, however, the output of the Office for Civil Rights appears to have fallen sharply in comparison with previous years. A public database of the office\u2019s resolution agreements \u2014 cases in which schools or universities voluntarily agreed to address civil rights concerns \u2014 suggests the office\u2019s work has slowed.",
      "The database lists just 65 resolutions so far this year, on pace to fall far below previous years\u2019 totals. Last year the office logged 380 resolutions in total, following 561 in 2023. During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, the office averaged more than 800 resolutions a year, including 1,300 during his first year in office.",
      "Other internal data obtained by The Associated Press show a similar trend. Since Trump took office, the total number of resolved cases is down about 40% from the same time frame last year \u2014 including cases that were dismissed, mediated or reached a voluntary resolution. Compared with last year, there also has been a 70% decrease in the number of cases resolved through resolution agreements or action taken by a school to comply with federal law, the internal data shows.",
      "Meanwhile, new complaints have increased 9%. The total number of cases has now climbed beyond 25,000.",
      "An Education Department spokesperson said the Trump administration is fixing a broken system.",
      "\u201cWhen staff levels were at their peak, OCR\u2019s processes still proved to be ineffective, as evidenced by the chronic backlog of tens of thousands of cases that left students\u2019 discrimination claims languishing over many presidential administrations,\u201d spokesperson Julie Hartman said.",
      "Parents and advocates say they\u2019ve noticed a difference.",
      "Adrienne Hazel filed a complaint in April after her 20-year-old son Ricky, who has autism, was placed in a public school program without a certified teacher and was not given an individual learning plan. Hazel, of Southfield, Michigan, has not heard from the federal office after receiving an automatic reply when she filed the complaint.",
      "Things moved faster last year when Hazel filed a separate complaint for her son. The office notified Ricky\u2019s school, which Hazel says spurred the district to reach an agreement with her within about three months. This time, she said, it feels like she\u2019s on her own.",
      "\u201cThere has been zero response to this,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s basically going into a babysitting situation. He\u2019s not getting the things that he needs to grow into independence. And he\u2019ll just be aging without getting an education.\u201d",
      "Marcie Lipsitt, a special education advocate in Michigan who worked with Hazel, said such stories are common. She helps families file complaints but warns it could take at least a year before an investigation opens. Some schools have backtracked on previous agreements, she said, yet parents can\u2019t get a response from the federal office.",

McMahon previously suggested the civil rights work could be managed by the Justice Department.",

      "The Office for Civil Rights is responsible for enforcing civil rights laws across the nation\u2019s schools and is often a last resort for parents and students facing discrimination from schools. The office reviews complaints and, for those that meet certain criteria, opens investigations. Others are dismissed or move to a mediation process.",
      "Of the 65 resolution agreements reported this year, 57 were signed after Trump took office. Of those, the vast majority involve complaints of discrimination based on disability, with smaller numbers based on sex or race.

      "Three Democratic-led states that led the way in offering free health care to low-income people who are in the U.S. without legal permission are either limiting or ending the programs because of significant budget concerns",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- For nearly 20 years, Maria would call her sister \u2014 a nurse in Mexico \u2014 for advice on how to manage her asthma and control her husband\u2019s diabetes instead of going to the doctor in California.",
      "She didn\u2019t have legal status, so she couldn\u2019t get health insurance and skipped routine exams, relying instead on home remedies and, at times, getting inhalers from Mexico. She insisted on using only her first name for fear of deportation.",
      "Things changed for Maria and many others in recent years when a handful of Democrat-led states opened up their health insurance programs to low-income immigrants regardless of their legal status. Maria and her husband signed up the day the program began last year.",
      "\u201cIt changed immensely, like from Earth to the heavens,\u201d Maria said in Spanish of Medi-Cal, California\u2019s Medicaid program. \u201cHaving the peace of mind of getting insurance leads me to getting sick less.\u201d",
      "At least seven states and the District of Columbia have offered coverage for immigrants since mostly 2020. But three of them have done an about-face, ending or limiting coverage for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who aren\u2019t in the U.S. legally in California, Illinois and Minnesota.",
      "The programs cost way more than officials had projected at a time when the states are facing multibillion-dollar deficits now and in the future. In Illinois, adult immigrants ages 42-64 without legal status have lost their health care to save an estimated $404 million. All adult immigrants in Minnesota no longer have access to the state program, saving nearly $57 million. In California, no one will automatically lose coverage, but new enrollments for adults will stop in 2026 to save more than $3 billion over several years.",
      "Cuts in all three states were backed by Democratic governors who once championed expanding health coverage to immigrants.",
      "The Trump administration this week shared the home addresses, ethnicities and personal data of all Medicaid recipients with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. Twenty states, including California, Illinois and Minnesota, have sued.",
      "Health care providers told The Associated Press that everything, especially the fear of being arrested or deported, is having a chilling effect on people seeking care. And states may have to spend more money down the road because immigrants will avoid preventive health care and end up needing to go to safety-net hospitals.",
      "\u201cI feel like they continue to squeeze you more and more to the point where you\u2019ll burst,\u201d Maria said, referencing all the uncertainties for people who are in the U.S. without legal permission.",
      "People who run free and community health clinics in California and Minnesota said patients who got on state Medicaid programs received knee replacements and heart procedures, and were diagnosed for serious conditions like late-stage cancer.",
      "CommunityHealth is one of the nation\u2019s largest free clinics, serving many uninsured and underinsured immigrants in the Chicago area who have no other options for treatment. That includes the people who lost coverage July 1 when Illinois ended its Health Benefits for Immigrants Adults Program, which served about 31,500 people ages 42-64.",
      "One of CommunityHealth\u2019s community outreach workers and care coordinator said Eastern European patients she works with started coming in with questions about what the change meant for them. She said many of the patients also don\u2019t speak English and don\u2019t have transportation to get to clinics that can treat them. The worker spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to protect patients\u2019 privacy.",
      "Health Finders Collective in Minnesota's rural Rice and Steele counties south of Minneapolis serves low-income and underinsured patients, including large populations of Latino immigrants and Somali refugees. Executive director Charlie Mandile said they\u2019re seeing patients rushing to squeeze in appointments and procedures before 19,000 people age 18 and older are kicked off of insurance at the end of the year.",
      "Free and community health clinics in all three states say they will keep serving patients regardless of insurance coverage \u2014 but that might get harder after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services decided this month to restrict federally qualified health centers from treating people without legal status.",
      "CommunityHealth CEO Stephanie Willding said she always worried about the stability of the program because it was fully state funded, \u201cbut truthfully, we thought that day was much, much further away.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are going to die. Some people are going to go untreated,\u201d Alicia Hardy, chief executive officer of CommuniCARE+OLE clinics in California, said of the state's Medicaid changes. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the humanity in the decision-making that\u2019s happening right now.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Health said ending the state\u2019s program will decrease MinnesotaCare spending in the short term, but she acknowledged health care costs would rise elsewhere, including uncompensated care at hospitals.",

Democratic state leaders last month agreed to stop new enrollment starting in 2026 for all low-income adults without legal status. Those under 60 remaining on the program will have to pay a $30 monthly fee in 2027.",
      "States are also bracing for impact from federal policies. Cuts to Medicaid and other programs in the recently signed massive tax and spending bill include a 10% cut to the federal share of Medicaid expansion costs to states that offer health benefits to immigrants starting October 2027.",
      "California health officials estimate roughly 200,000 people will lose coverage after the first full year of restricted enrollment, though Gov. Gavin Newsom maintains that even with the rollbacks, California provides the most expansive health care coverage for poor adults.",
      "Every new bill requires a shift in Maria's monthly calculations to make ends meet. She believes many people won\u2019t be able to afford the $30-a-month premiums and will instead go back to self-medication or skip treatment altogether.",
      "\u201cIt was a total triumph,\u201d she said of Medi-Cal expansion. \u201cBut now that all of this is coming our way, we\u2019re going backwards to a worse place.\u201d",

Providers told the AP that, as immigration raids ramped up, their patients were requesting more virtual appointments, not showing up to routine doctor\u2019s visits and not picking up prescriptions for their chronic conditions.",
      "Maria has the option to keep her coverage. But she is weighing the health of her family against risking what they\u2019ve built in the U.S.",

      "Britain\u2019s Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of two financial market traders accused of manipulating benchmark interest rates in one of the biggest scandals to come out of the global financial crisis in 2008",
      "LONDON -- Britain\u2019s Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed the convictions of two financial market traders accused of manipulating benchmark interest rates in one of the biggest scandals to come out of the global financial crisis in 2008.",
      "The charges against Tom Hayes, a former Citigroup and UBS trader, and Carlo Palombo, who worked for Barclays, centered around alleged efforts to influence the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or Libor, and its euro currency equivalent Euribor, which were used to set the interest rates on trillions of dollars of loans and other financial products around the world.",
      "The court ruled that the convictions of Hayes and Palombo were unfair because the judges in their separate cases gave inaccurate instructions to jurors. That effectively prevented jurors from considering the key question of whether the traders had acted dishonestly.",
      "\u201cThat misdirection undermined the fairness of the trial,\u201d Judge George Leggatt wrote in an 82-page decision backed by all five members of the panel that heard the case.",
      "Hayes was convicted in August 2015 and sentenced to a maximum of 14 years in prison, which was later reduced to 11 years. Palombo, convicted in March 2019, was sentenced to four years in prison. Both men were released in 2021.",
      "\u201cIt destroyed my family, I missed most of my son\u2019s childhood,\u201d Hayes told the BBC.",
      "\u201cFor so long I\u2019ve been an international fugitive \u2026 and now I can move on with my life, or try to,\u201d he added.",
      "The decision came after the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeal in 2022 overturned the convictions of two traders charged with similar crimes in the United States. Hayes and Palombo, whose appeals were repeatedly rejected by British judges, were allowed to take their case to the U.K. Supreme Court after that ruling.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s Serious Fraud Office began investigating alleged efforts to manipulate Libor in 2012. That ultimately led to the conviction of nine bankers.",

      "Libor and Euribor were critical benchmarks that were once used to set the interest rates on everything from business loans to home mortgages and credit card debts. As a result, they also became central to more complex financial transactions such as those used by banks and businesses to bet on interest rate fluctuations.",
      "The benchmarks were vulnerable to manipulation because they were set by banks that could profit from swings in interest rates.",
      "Each day, major international banks were asked to submit the interest rate at which they could borrow money from other banks. An average of those submissions was then used to set the daily Libor and Euribor rates.",
      "During the financial crisis, regulators became aware that some banks were making artificially low Libor submissions to make their institutions seem more creditworthy. Some traders also sought to influence the submissions made by their banks as even small moves in the benchmark rates could boost their profits.",
      "Those risks became even more pronounced during the financial crisis, when lending dried up and bankers had to base their daily submissions on a subjective assessment of the market rather than actual loans.",
      "Libor and Euribor were phased out in recent years, in part because they were seen as worsening the financial crisis.",

      "KABUL, Afghanistan -- For six hours every day after school, Nahideh works in a cemetery, collecting water from a nearby shrine to sell to mourners visiting loved ones\u2019 graves. She dreams of becoming a doctor \u2014 but knows it is a futile dream.",
      "When the next school year starts, she will be enrolling in a madrassa, a religious school, to learn about the Quran and Islam \u2014 and little else.",
      "\u201cI prefer to go to school, but I can\u2019t, so I will go to a madrassa,\u201d she said, dark brown eyes peering out from beneath her tightly wrapped black headscarf. \u201cIf I could go to school then I could learn and become a doctor. But I can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "At the age of 13, Nahideh is in the last grade of primary school, the limit of education allowed for girls in Afghanistan. The country\u2019s Taliban government banned girls from secondary school and university three years ago \u2014 the only country in the world to do so. The ban is part of myriad restrictions on women and girls, dictating everything from what they can wear to where they can go and who they can go with.",
      "With no option for higher education, many girls and women are turning to madrassas instead.",
      "\u201cSince the schools are closed to girls, they see this as an opportunity,\u201d said Zahid-ur-Rehman Sahibi, director of the Tasnim Nasrat Islamic Sciences Educational Center in Kabul. \u201cSo, they come here to stay engaged in learning and studying religious sciences.\u201d",
      "The center\u2019s roughly 400 students range in ages from about 3 to 60, and 90% are female. They study the Quran, Islamic jurisprudence, the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, and Arabic, the language of the Quran.",
      "Most Afghans, Sahibi noted, are religious. \u201cEven before the schools were closed, many used to attend madrassas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after the closure of schools, the interest has increased significantly, because the doors of the madrassas remain open to them.\u201d",
      "No recent official figures are available on the number of girls enrolled in madrassas, but officials say the popularity of religious schools overall has been growing. Last September, Deputy Minister of Education Karamatullah Akhundzada said at least 1 million students had enrolled in madrassas over the past year alone, bringing the total to over 3 million.",
      "Sheltered from the heat of an early summer\u2019s day in a basement room at the Tasnim Nasrat center, Sahibi\u2019s students knelt at small plastic tables on the carpeted floor, their pencils tracing lines of Arabic script in their Qurans. All 10 young women wore black niqabs, the all-encompassing garment that includes a veil, leaving only the eyes visible.",
      "\u201cIt is very good for girls and women to study at a madrassa, because \u2026 the Quran is the word of Allah, and we are Muslims,\u201d said 25-year-old Faiza, who had enrolled at the center five months earlier. \u201cTherefore, it is our duty to know what is in the book that Allah has revealed to us, to understand its interpretation and translation.\u201d",
      "Given a choice, she would have studied medicine. While she knows that is now impossible, she still harbors hope that if she shows she is a pious student dedicated to her religion, she will be eventually allowed to. The medical profession is one of the very few still open to women in Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cWhen my family sees that I am learning Quranic sciences and that I am practicing all the teachings of the Quran in my life, and they are assured of this, they will definitely allow me to continue my studies,\u201d she said.",

      "Among those on the list for Vendin-le-Vieil is Mohamed Amra, nicknamed \u201cThe Fly,\" who staged an escape last year that killed two guards and then fled to Romania before he was captured and returned to France.",
      "The newcomers will have just one hour a day in a prison exercise yard, in groups of no more than five. The rest of the time, they will mostly be confined to individual cells fitted with holes so prison guards can handcuff them before moving them and with ratchet systems so inmates can't yank the doors open or shut when they have to be unlocked.",
      "They will be guarded by 250 wardens \u2014 elsewhere, the ratio is usually 20 guards to 100 inmates, Darmanin told French broadcaster TF1.",
      "Instead of unlimited calls with family members from prison phones, they will be limited to a maximum of two hours, twice a week \u2014 a restriction that Darmanin says will make monitoring their conversations easier.",
      "Prison visiting rooms have also been equipped with security glass dividers, to prevent physical contact between inmates and visitors. Darmanin says this will prevent mobile phones and other contraband from being smuggled in. The new Vendin-le-Vieil inmates also won't have the rights accorded in other prisons of intimate time with partners and family members.",
      "Darmanin said the conditions will be \u201cextremely hard\" but are necessary because France risks \u201ctipping into narco-banditry\u201d in the absence of tough decisions.",

      "She and others also say the tough conditions could inflict an unacceptable toll on the prisoners' mental health.",
      "Vogelhut said her 22-year-old client was a major drug dealer in the southern French port city of Marseille and was convicted and sentenced to 25 years for torturing his victims. He is appealing his sentence.",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The UN\u2019s highest court is handing down a historic opinion on climate change Wednesday, a decision that could set a legal benchmark for action around the globe to the climate crisis.",
      "After years of lobbying by vulnerable island nations who fear they could disappear under rising sea waters, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice in 2023 for an advisory opinion, a non-binding but important basis for international obligations.",
      "A panel of 15 judges was tasked with answering two questions. First, what are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? Second, what are the legal consequences for governments when their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment?",
      "\u201cThe stakes could not be higher. The survival of my people and so many others is on the line,\u201d Arnold Kiel Loughman, attorney general of the island nation of Vanuatu, told the court during a week of hearings in December.",
      "In the decade up to 2023, sea levels have risen by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches), with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels.",
      "Vanuatu is one of a group of small states pushing for international legal intervention in the climate crisis but it affects many more island nations in the South Pacific.",
      "\u201cThe agreements being made at an international level between states are not moving fast enough,\u201d Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu\u2019s minister for climate change, told The Associated Press.",
      "Any decision by The Hague-based court would be non-binding advice and unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol, since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits.",
      "\u201cWhat makes this case so important is that it addresses the past, present, and future of climate action. It\u2019s not just about future targets -- it also tackles historical responsibility, because we cannot solve the climate crisis without confronting its roots,\u201d Joie Chowdhury, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, told AP.",

      "Some scientists worried that maybe the Barbados threadsnake had become extinct, but one sunny morning, Connor Blades lifted a rock in a tiny forest in the eastern Caribbean island and held his breath.",
      "\u201cAfter a year of searching, you begin to get a little pessimistic,\u201d said Blades, project officer with the Ministry of Environment in Barbados.",
      "The snake can fit comfortably on a coin, so it was able to elude scientists for almost 20 years. Too tiny to identify with the naked eye, Blades placed it in a small glass jar and added soil, substrate and leaf litter.",
      "Several hours later, in front of a microscope at the University of the West Indies, Blades looked at the specimen. It wriggled in the petri dish, making it nearly impossible to identify.",
      "\u201cIt was a struggle,\u201d Blades recalled, adding that he shot a video of the snake and finally identified it thanks to a still image.",
      "It had pale yellow dorsal lines running through its body, and its eyes were located on the side of its head.",
      "\u201cI tried to keep a level head,\u201d Blades recalled, knowing that the Barbados threadsnake looks very much like a Brahminy blind snake, best known as the flower pot snake, which is a bit longer and has no dorsal lines.",
      "On Wednesday, the Re:wild conservation group, which is collaborating with the local environment ministry, announced the rediscovery of the Barbados threadsnake.",
      "\u201cRediscovering one of our endemics on many levels is significant,\u201d said Justin Springer, Caribbean program officer for Re:wild who helped rediscover the snake along with Blades. \u201cIt reminds us that we still have something important left that plays an important role in our ecosystem.\u201d",
      "The Barbados threadsnake has only been seen a handful of times since 1889. It was on a list of 4,800 plant, animal and fungi species that Re:wild described as \u201clost to science.\u201d",
      "The snake is blind, burrows in the ground, eats termites and ants and lays one single, slender egg. Fully grown, it measures up to four inches (10 centimeters).",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re very cryptic,\u201d Blades said. \u201cYou can do a survey for a number of hours, and even if they are there, you may actually not see them.\u201d",
      "But on March 20 at around 10:30 a.m., Blades and Springer surrounded a jack-in-the-box tree in central Barbados and started looking under rocks while the rest of the team began measuring the tree, whose distribution is very limited in Barbados.",

      "In 2008, Hedges\u2019 discovery was published in a scientific journal, with the snake baptized Tetracheilostoma carlae, in honor of his wife.",
      "\u201cI spent days searching for them,\u201d Hedges recalled. \u201cBased on my observations and the hundreds of rocks, objects that I turned over looking for this thing without success, I do think it is a rare species.\u201d",

      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has again denied reports that he plans to resign after his party's historic election defeat",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba denied again on Wednesday plans for resignation following a historic defeat of his ruling party in a weekend election despite growing calls for him to step down, saying he wanted to ensure the appropriate implementation of a new tariff agreement with the United States.",
      "Ishiaba met with heavyweights from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party and former prime ministers Taro Aso, Fumio Kishida and Yoshihide Suga on Wednesday at party headquarters. He told reporters afterward that they did not discuss his resignation or a new party leadership contest, but only the election results, voters\u2019 dissatisfaction and the urgent need to avoid party discord.",
      "Despite his business-as-usual demeanor, Ishiba is under increasing pressure to bow out after his ruling party and its junior coalition partner, Komeito, lost Sunday their majority in the 248-member upper house, the smaller and less powerful of Japan's two-chamber parliament, shaking his grip on power.",
      "This came after a loss in the more powerful lower house in October, and so his coalition now lacks a majority in both houses of parliament, making it even more difficult for his government to pass policies and worsening Japan's political instability.",
      "Ishiba had announced Monday he intended to stay on to tackle pressing challenges, including tariff talks with the U.S., so as not to create a political vacuum despite calls from inside and outside his party for a quick resignation.",
      "Japanese media said he is expected to soon announce plans to step down in August.",
      "The conservative Yomiuri newspaper said in an extra edition on Wednesday Ishiba had decided to announce his resignation by the end of July after receiving a detailed report from his chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, on the impact of the U.S. tariffs on the Japanese economy, paving the way for a new party leader.",

He welcomed the new agreement, which places tariffs at 15% on Japanese cars and other goods imported into the U.S. from Japan, down from the initial 25%.",
      "Still, local media are already speculating about possible successors for the ruling party. Among them are ultra-conservative former Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi, who lost to Ishiba in September. Another conservative former Economic Security Minister Takayuki Kobayashi, and Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of former popular Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, are also seen as potential challengers.",

Meanwhile, Trump said a trip to China may happen soon, hinting at efforts to stabilize U.S.-China trade relations.",
      "A preliminary agreement announced in June paved the way for China to lift some restrictions on its exports of rare earths, minerals critical for high technology and other manufacturing. In May, the U.S. agreed to drop Trump's 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days, while China agreed to lower its 125% rate on U.S. goods to 10%. The reprieve allowed companies more time to rush to try to beat the potentially higher tariffs, giving a boost to Chinese exports and alleviating some of the pressure on its manufacturing sector. But prolonged uncertainty over what Trump might do has left companies wary about committing to further investment in China.",

      "President Donald Trump has announced a trade framework with Japan, placing a 15% tax on goods imported from that nation",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump announced a trade framework with Japan on Tuesday, placing a 15% tax on goods imported from that nation.",
      "\u201cThis Deal will create Hundreds of Thousands of Jobs \u2014 There has never been anything like it,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social, adding that the United States \u201cwill continue to always have a great relationship with the Country of Japan.\u201d",
      "The president said Japan would invest \u201cat my direction\u201d $550 billion into the U.S. and would \u201copen\u201d its economy to American autos and rice. The 15% tax on imported Japanese goods is a meaningful drop from the 25% rate that Trump, in a recent letter to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, said would be levied starting Aug. 1.",
      "Early Wednesday, Ishiba acknowledged the new trade agreement, saying it would benefit both sides and help them work together.",
      "With the announcement, Trump is seeking to tout his ability as a dealmaker \u2014 even as his tariffs, when initially announced in early April led to a market panic and fears of slower growth that for the moment appear to have subsided. Key details remained unclear from his post, such as whether Japanese-built autos would face a higher 25% tariff that Trump imposed on the sector.",
      "But the framework fits a growing pattern for Trump, who is eager to portray the tariffs as win for the U.S. His administration says the revenues will help reduce the budget deficit and more factories will relocate to America to avoid the import taxes and cause trade imbalances to disappear.",
      "The wave of tariffs continues to be a source of uncertainty about whether it could lead to higher prices for consumers and businesses if companies simply pass along the costs. The problem was seen sharply Tuesday after General Motors reported a 35% drop in its net income during the second quarter as it warned that tariffs would hit its business in the months ahead, causing its stock to tumble.",
      "As the Aug. 1 deadline for the tariff rates in his letters to world leaders is approaching, Trump also announced a trade framework with the Philippines that would impose a tariff of 19% on its goods, while American-made products would face no import taxes. The president also reaffirmed his 19% tariffs on Indonesia.",
      "The U.S. ran a $69.4 billion trade imbalance on goods with Japan last year, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "America had a trade imbalance of $17.9 billion with Indonesia and an imbalance of $4.9 billion with the Philippines. Both nations are less affluent than the U.S. and an imbalance means America imports more from those countries than it exports to them.",
      "The president is set to impose the broad tariffs listed in his recent letters to other world leaders on Aug. 1, raising questions of whether there will be any breakthrough in talks with the European Union. At a Tuesday dinner, Trump said the EU would be in Washington on Wednesday for trade talks.",

      "BEIJING -- European leaders demanded a more balanced relationship with China at a summit with President Xi Jinping in the Chinese capital on Thursday.",
      "Focusing their opening remarks on trade, they called for concrete progress to address Europe's yawning trade deficit with China.",
      "\u201cAs our cooperation has deepened, so have the imbalances,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. \u201cWe have reached an inflection point. Rebalancing our bilateral relation is essential. Because to be sustainable, relations need to be mutually beneficial.\u201d",
      "Expectations were low for the talks, initially supposed to last two days but scaled back to one. They come amid financial uncertainty around the world, wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, and the threat of U.S. tariffs. Neither the EU nor China is likely to budge on key issues dividing the two economic juggernauts.",

      "He signaled a possible agreement on climate, saying he looks forward to \u201ca strong joint political message\u201d from the summit ahead of annual U.N. climate talks in November in Brazil. That could follow their talks with China's Premier Li Qiang later Thursday.",
      "Xi called on China and Europe to deepen cooperation and mutual trust to provide stability in an increasingly complex international environment, China's state broadcaster CCTV reported online. They should set aside differences and seek common ground, he said, a phrase he often uses in relationships like the one with the EU.",
      "Besides the trade imbalance and the Ukraine war, Von der Leyen and Costa were expected to raise concerns about Chinese cyberattacks and espionage, its restrictions on the export of rare earth minerals and its human rights record in Tibet, Hong Kong and Xinjiang.",
      "The EU, meanwhile, has concerns about a looming trade battle with the United States.",
      "\u201cEurope is being very careful not to antagonize President Trump even further by looking maybe too close to China, so all of that doesn\u2019t make this summit easier,\u201d said Fabian Zuleeg, chief economist of the European Policy Center. \"It will be very hard to achieve something concrete.\u201d",
      "China's stance has hardened on the EU, despite a few olive branches, like the suspension of sanctions on European lawmakers who criticized Beijing's human rights record in Xinjiang, a region in northwestern China home to the Uyghurs.",
      "China believes it has successfully weathered the U.S. tariffs storm because of its aggressive posture, said Noah Barkin, an analyst at the Rhodium Group think tank. Barkin said that Beijing's bold tactics that worked with Washington should work with other Western powers.",
      "\"China has come away emboldened from its trade confrontation with Trump. That has reduced its appetite for making concessions to the EU,\" he said. \u201cNow that Trump has backed down, China sees less of a need to woo Europe.\u201d",
      "China is the EU\u2019s second-largest trading partner in goods, after the United States, with about 30% of global trade flowing between them. Both China and the EU want to use their economies ties to stabilize the global economy, and they share some climate goals.",
      "But deep disagreements run through those overlapping interests.",
      "China and the EU have multiple trade disputes across a range of industries, but no disagreement is as sharp as their enormous trade imbalance.",
      "Like the U.S., the 27-nation bloc runs a massive trade deficit with China \u2014 around 300 billion euros ($350 million) last year. It relies heavily on China for critical minerals, which are also used to make magnets for cars and appliances. When China curtailed the export of those minerals in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, European automakers cried foul.",

They have criticized new EU regulations of medical equipment sales, and fear upcoming legislation that could further target Chinese industries, said Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, a China analyst at the Bruegel think tank.",

The measure seeks to incentivize China to cease its discrimination against EU firms, the bloc said, accusing China of erecting \u201csignificant and recurring legal and administrative barriers to its procurement market.\u201d",

      "Xi and Putin have had a close relationship, which is also reflected in the countries\u2019 ties. China has become a major customer for Russian oil and gas, and a source of key technologies following sweeping Western sanctions on Moscow. In May, Xi attended a Victor Day celebration alongside Putin in Moscow, but didn't attend a similar EU event in Brussels celebrating the end of World War II.",
      "Von der Leyen and Costa will press Xi and Li to slash their support of Russia, but with likely little effect.",
      "Buffeted between a combative Washington and a hard-line Beijing, the EU has more publicly sought new alliances elsewhere, inking a trade pact with Indonesia, heaping praise on Japan and drafting trade deals with South America and Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe also know that 87% of global trade is with other countries \u2014 many of them looking for stability and opportunity. That is why I am here for this visit to Japan to deepen our ties,\u201d Von der Leyen said in Tokyo during an EU-Japan summit on her way to Beijing.",
      "\u201cBoth Europe and Japan see a world around us where protectionist instincts grow, weaknesses get weaponized, and every dependency exploited. So it is normal that two like-minded partners come together to make each other stronger.\"",
      "Promoting ties with Europe is one third of Japan\u2019s new 2025 military doctrine, after sustaining defense links with the U.S. and investing in capabilities at home like missiles, satellites, warships, and drones.",

      "Warner Music Group has announced that it's reissuing the lone album recorded by Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham when they were just a duo",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- They were in love once.",
      "Four years before Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cRumours\u201d became one of the best breakup records of the 1970s \u2014 and, many might say, all time \u2014 Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham were relative unknowns, a young couple putting out their own album, posing nude on the cover like a Laurel Canyon version of Adam and Eve.",
      "Released as \u201cBuckingham Nicks,\u201d the 1973 album has for decades maintained somewhat of a holy grail status in the dusty bins of record stores, selling for $20 to $90 depending on its condition. Now, in addition to new vinyl, it will be available on streaming and CD for the first time when it's reissued Sept. 19 on Rhino, Warner Music Group announced Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt's one of those records that everybody has heard of but not that many people have actually heard,\u201d said Brian Mansfield, a music historian, journalist and record collector in Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cEspecially before everything got put onto YouTube, very few people had heard it because it had never been on CD. But it had this iconic cover that everybody recognized.\u201d",
      "\u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d featured the duo's iconic harmonies and Buckingham's distinct guitar sound, which later fueled Fleetwood Mac's ability to sell tens of millions of records. But \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d bombed upon release and Polydor dropped them from the label, prompting Nicks' return to waitressing and Buckingham to briefly tour with Don Everly.",
      "The rest of the story is enshrined in lore: Drummer Mick Fleetwood heard \u201cFrozen Love\u201d from the album when he visited the studio where it was recorded, Sound City. After guitarist Bob Welch left the band, Fleetwood invited Buckingham to Fleetwood Mac, with Buckingham insisting Nicks join too. The band also included the late Christine McVie on keyboards and John McVie on bass.",
      "Generations of avid Fleetwood Mac fans have tattooed their lyrics or analyzed them at a forensic level, enshrining the tumultuous relationship between Buckingham and Nicks in pop culture. The upcoming reissue of \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d is a reminder of the couple's musical beginnings and the special status their only joint album has held among fans and record collectors.",
      "\u201cAs soon as we put it out, it goes that day,\u201d said Michael Bell, owner of Hunky Dory Records, which has locations in Raleigh, Durham and Cary, North Carolina.",
      "Nicks and Buckingham met during high school at a local church in Northern California where young musicians gathered on a school night, according to Stephen Davis' \u201cGold Dust Woman: The Biography of Stevie Nicks.\u201d",
      "Buckingham played the Mamas & the Papas' \u201cCalifornia Dreamin'\" on piano, prompting Nicks to chime in, singing Michelle Phillips\u2019 high harmony.",
      "\u201cThey glanced at each other; she noticed his eyes, cold blue like lake ice,\" Davis wrote. \"They sang the whole song while the room went quiet, everyone mesmerized.\u201d",
      "After high school, Nicks joined the band Buckingham was in, Fritz, which would open for Creedence Clearwater Revival, Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. They eventually split off as a duo, started dating and moved to Los Angeles.",
      "Nicks said she loved Buckingham before he was a millionaire, according to Davis' book, and \u201cwashed his jeans and embroidered stupid moons and stars on the bottom of them.\u201d",
      "The first track on \u201cBuckingham Nicks,\u201d \u201cCrying in the Night,\" has \u201ca sense of Joni Mitchell fronting the Eagles,\u201d Davis wrote. \u201cFrozen Love\u201d closed out side two, with \u201clayers of strings and synthesizers and a major Lindsey Buckingham rock guitar symphony.\"",
      "\u201cNo one seemed to like the record,\u201d Davis wrote. \u201cPolydor executives hadn\u2019t even wanted to release it.\"",
      "A review that ran in The Pittsburgh Press said Nicks and Buckingham produced \"a pleasant, albeit a whiny vocal blend on some pretty fair songs.\u201d",

      "\u201cRumours\u201d came two years later.",
      "Bob Fuchs, retail manager of record store Electric Fetus in Minneapolis, said the shop gets in about two to four of the original vinyl a year.

      "Fuchs never bought the album himself because, \u201cevery time I came in, it was $60 or $80. ... So I\u2019ll probably end up picking up a reissue.\u201d",
      "Across the river at the St. Paul, Minnesota, location of Cheapo Discs, though, worker Geoff Good said people rarely came in looking for the original. He does expect the reissue to juice sales. He has the original, which he bought in 1974 or 1975, in his own collection.",

      "He has no idea why \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d hasn't been reissued more considering the steady demand. For him, it's a good album but not one that reached the heights of what was to come.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not there yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything on this album that would have made a Fleetwood album.\u201d",
      "The romantic relationship between Buckingham and Nicks would end around the making of \u201cRumours.\u201d Nicks and Buckingham would shoot eye daggers at each other onstage in packed stadiums, while Buckingham would roll his eyes during Nicks' MusiCares speech in 2018, according to the Los Angeles Times. Buckingham would eventually be kicked off the band's tour in 2018 , prompting a lawsuit that was later settled.",
      "But this month, Buckingham and Nicks seemed to be operating in perfect symmetry \u2014 at least on Instagram. Each posted half a line from \u201cFrozen Love,\u201d \u2014 with Nicks writing \"And if you go forward\u2026\u201d and Buckingham responding, \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d On Wednesday, they shared the same video of a billboard being put up to advertise the reissue of \u201cBuckingham Nicks.\u201d",
      "They may have made the album more than 50 years ago, Buckingham said in announcing its reissue, \u201cbut it stands up in a way you hope it would, by these two kids who were pretty young to be doing that work.\u201d",

      "Brazilian coffee farmers are facing tough times after the U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports earlier this month",
      "PORCIUNCULA, Brazil -- Brazilian Jos\u00e9 Natal da Silva often tends to his modest coffee plantation in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state in the middle of the night, sacrificing sleep to fend off pests that could inflict harm on his precious crops.",
      "But anxiety has troubled his shut-eye even more in recent weeks, following President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement earlier this month of a 50% tariff on Brazilian imported goods, which experts expect to drive down the price of coffee in Brazil.",
      "Da Silva sighed as he recounted his fears, sitting on the dry earth surrounded by his glossy green arabica coffee shrubs, in the small municipality of Porciuncula.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sad because we struggle so much. We spend years battling to get somewhere. And suddenly, everything starts falling apart, and we\u2019re going to lose everything,\u201d da Silva said. \u201cHow are we going to survive?\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff on Brazil is overtly political. In his public letter detailing the reasons for the hike, the U.S. president called the trial of his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, a \u201c witch hunt.\u201d Bolsonaro is accused of masterminding a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss to left-leaning President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "The tariff has sparked ripples of fear in Brazil, particularly among sectors with deep ties to the American market such as beef, orange juice \u2014 and coffee. Minor coffee producers say the import tax will hit their margins and adds to the uncertainty already generated by an increasingly dry and unpredictable climate.",
      "Brazil, the world\u2019s largest coffee producer, exports around 85% of its production. The United States is the country\u2019s top coffee buyer and represents around 16% of exports, according to Brazil\u2019s coffee exporters council Cecafe.",
      "The president of Cecafe\u2019s deliberative council, M\u00e1rcio Ferreira, told journalists last week that he thinks the U.S. will continue to import Brazilian coffee, even with the hefty tariff. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that neither the United States nor any other source can give up on Brazil, even if it\u2019s tariffed,\u201d he said.",
      "But the tariff will likely decrease Brazilian coffee\u2019s competitiveness in the U.S. and naturally reduce demand, said Leandro Gilio, a professor of global agribusiness at Insper business school in Sao Paulo.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way we can quickly redirect our coffee production to other markets,\u201d Gilio said. \u201cThis principally affects small producers, who have less financial power to make investments or support themselves in a period like this.\u201d",
      "Family farmers produce more than two-thirds of Brazilian coffee. They are a majority in Rio state\u2019s northwestern region, where most of the state\u2019s coffee production lies.",
      "Coffee farming is the primary economic activity in these municipalities. In Porciuncula, which neighbors Brazil\u2019s largest coffee-producing state Minas Gerais, gentle mountains are layered with symmetrical lines of coffee shrubs.",

      "Last year, drought \u2014 made more likely by human-caused climate change \u2014 devastated large swathes of da Silva's production. The reduction in supply pushed coffee prices up, but only after many small-scale farmers had already sold all their crops.",
      "Since peaking in February, prices of arabica have fallen, dropping 33% by July, according to the University of Sao Paulo\u2019s Center for Advanced Studies in Applied Economics, which provides renowned commodity price reports.",
      "\u201cWhen you make an investment, counting on a certain price for coffee, and then when you go to sell it the price is 20-30% less than you calculated, it breaks the producers,\u201d said Paulo Vitor Menezes Freitas, 31, who also owns a modest plantation of around 35,000 coffee trees in the nearby municipality of Varre-Sai.",
      "Life out in the fields is tough, according to Menezes Freitas.",
      "During harvest season, he sometimes gets up at 3 a.m. to turn on a coffee drier, going to bed as late as midnight. The rest of the year is less intense, but still, there are few to no breaks because there\u2019s always work to do, he said.",

      "It is a federal and state crime to knowingly make false statements on mortgage documents. It's also against the law in Texas to collect a homestead tax break on two separate properties. Violating the terms of a mortgage could allow lenders recourse to seek full payment of a loan, according to legal experts.",
      "The mortgage revelations are likely to become fodder in the Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat in which Paxton is seeking to topple the incumbent, John Cornyn. The situation is further complicated by the Trump administration's criminal pursuit of Democrats over similar issues.",
      "President Donald Trump has accused two of his political foes \u2014 Sen. Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Letitia James \u2014 of committing mortgage fraud, though legal experts say the circumstances are less serious.",
      "The Democrats have long been objects of Trump\u2019s ire for having led various investigations into his conduct as president and as a business executive.",
      "Paxton, himself, has weighed in on the investigation of James, saying he hoped authorities would look into her conduct. \u201cI hope that if she\u2019s done something wrong, I hope that she\u2019s actually held accountable,\u201d he told supporters last month.",
      "The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation of James, FBI director Kash Patel told Fox News in May. The department received a criminal referral for Schiff last week from the Federal Housing Finance Agency, its director William Pulte confirmed in a social media post.",
      "Neither the Justice Department nor the FHFA responded to an inquiry about whether they may investigate Paxton, too.",
      "James\u2019 attorney, Abbe Lowell, urged the Trump administration to investigate Paxton instead.",
      "\u201cIf this administration was genuinely interested in rooting out fraud, it appears they should stop wasting their time on the baseless and discredited allegations against the New York Attorney General James and turn their attention to Texas,\u201d said Lowell, a prominent Washington attorney whose past clients include Hunter Biden, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.",
      "In a statement, Marisol Samayoa, a Schiff spokeswoman, blasted the criminal referral as \u201ca transparent attempt\u201d by Trump \u201cto punish a perceived political foe who is committed to holding him to account.\u201d She added that Schiff disclosed to his lenders that he owned another home that was a principal residence and sought guidance from an attorney.",
      "It is unlikely that Paxton, a staunch Trump ally, will face the same federal scrutiny as James and Schiff. It\u2019s equally doubtful that Paxton will face much legal trouble in Texas: His office is one of the primary agencies tasked with investigating allegations of mortgage fraud.",
      "Ken Paxton and his spokesman did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Angela Paxton, who is a state senator in Texas, did not respond to requests made through her office.",
      "Documents reviewed by the AP show the Paxtons hold mortgages on three homes \u2014 one in suburban Dallas, two in Austin \u2014 that are each listed as their primary residence. The designation comes with a considerable financial upside.",
      "Interest rates on primary homes are significantly lower than those for mortgages on secondary homes or investment properties, saving buyers tens of thousands of dollars \u2014 if not more \u2014 over the life of a loan.",
      "Making a case against Paxton would require \"establishing both that Paxton was aware of the contents of the mortgage document, and also that he was actively aware at the time that he signed it that this was not going to be a primary residence,\u201d said Jennifer E. Laurin, a professor at the University of Texas Law School in Austin.",
      "Legal experts say it is possible that the Paxtons\u2019 lenders prepared the documents and that the couple did not carefully review them before signing.",
      "Even if that were the case, some legal experts say that Paxton, as an attorney and Texas\u2019 top law enforcement officer, ought to have known better.",
      "\u201cIf he filled out lender documents knowing that they were false, then that is a false statement to obtain a mortgage on favorable terms. That would be actionable,\u201d said Arif Lawji, a veteran Texas real estate attorney. \u201cHe\u2019s the chief enforcement officer. You have to be accountable for stuff you do that\u2019s wrong.\u201d",

      "A homestead tax break is a property tax reduction that a homeowner is only eligible to collect on one property that is also their primary home.",

      "Lawji said the Paxtons\u2019 simultaneous collection of two homestead tax breaks appears to be a more clearcut violation. That is because one must obtain a form and submit it to taxing authorities to receive such a tax break, making it an \u201cintentional act,\u201d he said.",

That\u2019s a bigger question to me than the money, when you are AG and have to enforce this law.\u201d",
      "Separately, land records indicate the Paxtons may have violated the terms of at least two mortgages on other houses they own. The mortgage on a home in College Station, Texas, says the property is for the Paxtons\u2019 exclusive use and cannot be rented out. Doing so would be grounds for terminating the mortgage, the document states. The home has been listed for rent on real estate websites on-and-off since at least 2022.",

One form stated that James intended to occupy the home as her \u201cprincipal residence.\u201d But in other documents, the New York attorney general made clear she had no intention of living there. An email to the mortgage loan broker two weeks before she signed the documents stated the property \u201cWILL NOT be my primary residence.\u201d",

      "Before his election as attorney general, Paxton, then a state senator, admitted in 2014 to violating Texas securities law and paid a fine.",
      "He spent roughly 10 years under state indictment on securities charges while serving as attorney general. The charges were eventually dropped in 2024.

      "The ECB has already cut rates eight times since June of last year and President Christine Lagarde said after the last policy meeting June 5 that the central bank is \u201cgetting to the end of a monetary policy cycle.\" The monetary authority for the 20 countries that use the euro currency has been lowering rates to support growth after raising them in 2022-2023 to snuff out inflation caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the rebound after the pandemic.",
      "With the bench mark rate now at 2%, down from a record high of 4%, analyst think there could be one more rate cut coming, but only in September.",
      "The reason, say analysts: The ECB's policymakers simply don't know the outcome of talks between the EU's executive commission and the Trump administration. Trump first set a 20% tariff for EU goods, then threatened 50% after expressing displeasure at the pace of talks, then sent the EU a letter informing officials of a potential 30% tariff. EU officials earlier held out hope of winning at least the 10% baseline that applies to almost all trade partners, and analysts think that the actual rate may be lower than Trump's tariff threats. The talks are up against an Aug. 1 deadline, but earlier deadlines have slipped as the sides kept talking.",

      "The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister\u2019s birthday party.",
      "The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.",
      "\u201cEveryone uses AI for everything now. It\u2019s really taking over,\u201d said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. \u201cI think kids use AI to get out of thinking.\u201d",
      "For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \u201cdigital friends,\u201d like Character.AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",

      "All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an \u201cAI companion\u201d for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.",
      "\u201cThat felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,\u201d said Nair. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.\u201d",
      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \u201cas satisfying or more satisfying\u201d than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study\u2019s lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",

      "TOKYO -- Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Wednesday vowed to remain in power to oversee the implementation of a new Japan-U.S. tariff agreement, despite media speculation and growing calls for him to resign after a historic defeat of his governing party.",
      "Ishiba met with heavyweights from his Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, and former Prime Ministers Taro Aso, Fumio Kishida and Yoshihide Suga at party headquarters.",
      "He told reporters afterward that they didn't discuss his resignation or a new party leadership contest, but only the election results, voters\u2019 dissatisfaction and the urgent need to avoid party discord.",
      "Despite his business-as-usual demeanor, Ishiba is under increasing pressure to bow out after the LDP and junior coalition partner Komeito lost their majority in Sunday's election in the 248-member upper house, the smaller and less powerful of Japan's two-chamber parliament, shaking his grip on power.",
      "It came after a loss in the more powerful lower house in October, and so his coalition now lacks a majority in both houses of parliament, making it even more difficult for his government to pass policies and worsening Japan's political instability.",

      "\u201cWe all have a sense of crisis and think the election results were ultimatum from the voters,\u201d he said.",

      "Ishiba denied the report and said that he wants to focus on the U.S. trade deal, which covers more than 4,000 goods affecting many Japanese producers and industries. He welcomed the new agreement, which places tariffs at 15% on Japanese cars and other goods imported into the U.S. from Japan, down from the initial 25%.",

      "Nonprofits in the Bronx are facing severe challenges as federal grant cuts disrupt essential services",
      "NEW YORK -- On a sweltering summer day, children leap between rocks along the Bronx River while cyclists pedal on newly paved paths. Kayaks rest on what was once an industrial dumping ground, now transformed into a bustling promenade along the city\u2019s only freshwater river.",
      "The Bronx River Greenway, a series of stitched-together waterfront parks built atop once largely abandoned and polluted wasteland, is a hard-fought victory for the country\u2019s poorest congressional district \u2014 one that locals call a \u201cbeacon of environmental justice\u201d built by federal dollars and water-pollution settlements from the borough\u2019s wealthier neighbors.",
      "Now, like thousands of nonprofits around the country, this organization\u2019s future is in jeopardy. The Trump administration\u2019s sweeping federal grant cuts have left nonprofits nationwide and the communities they serve in precarious straits. But few places face as stark a reckoning as the Bronx, where federal funding has proved indispensable for revitalizing green spaces, protecting survivors of domestic violence, and preventing youth violence.",
      "Over 84% of the 342 nonprofits based in the Bronx rely on federal grants now at risk, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute. It\u2019s a significant increase from the 70% of groups vulnerable to government defunding statewide.",
      "In all but two of the country\u2019s 437 congressional districts, the typical nonprofit could not cover its expenses without government grants. Nonprofits have increasingly served as contractors for government services \u2014 like operating homeless shelters \u2014 since the 1960s.",
      "In the Bronx, if such grants were to disappear entirely, the borough\u2019s nonprofits could face a collective deficit of nearly 30% \u2014 cuts that have begun to force layoffs and austerity on dozens of groups connecting Bronxites to low-cost health care, food assistance, and preschool slots.",
      "\u201cWhen America sneezes, the Bronx gets the flu,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, the Democrat who represents the district. \u201cI think we in the Bronx feel we have been and will continue to be the hardest hit by the impact of a Trump presidency.\u201d",
      "Nestled in a corner of parkland atop the site of an abandoned amusement park, the headquarters of the Bronx River Alliance is among the borough\u2019s greenest buildings, boasting nature classrooms, samples of the river\u2019s flora and fauna, and a storage space teeming with kayaks and canoes.",
      "In March, the group received formal notice that it would lose $1.5 million in federal grants promised under the Inflation Reduction Act last year for improving water quality and climate-resilience projects. After years of rising momentum, cubicles now sit empty. Leaders held off on hiring in anticipation of cuts, and now they don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be able to fill those roles.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve met some of the folks who were pulling cars out of the river in the \u201970s and \u201980s,\u201d said Daniel Ranells, the group\u2019s deputy director of programs. Back then, the area was a \u201cdumping ground\u201d so inundated with industrial waste, tires, abandoned cars, ovens, and microwaves that \u201cfolks didn\u2019t really understand there was a river there.\u201d",
      "That has shifted dramatically in recent years thanks in part to decades of federal investment. Just south of its headquarters, the organization restored salt marshes along the riverbanks of a shuttered concrete plant.",
      "In 2007, the first beaver appeared on the Bronx River in over 200 years \u2014 named \u201cJos\u00e9 the Beaver\u201d in honor of former Congressman Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano, who helped direct millions in federal funds to groups dedicated to the river\u2019s restoration.",
      "\u201cThe Bronx River is a shining light of environmental justice,\u201d Ranells said, and millions in federal funding over the years has helped \u201cmake it a destination\u201d after years of neglect.",
      "Now staffers at the Bronx River Alliance describe a sense of \u201cwhiplash\u201d in seeing hard-fought funds dry up and grant language scrubbed of any allusions to racial or environmental justice.",
      "The Bronx River Alliance has joined other nonprofits in suing the Trump administration to unfreeze funds, but the uncertainty has already disrupted years of planning, a reality that has rippled across the neighborhood, leaving few organizations untouched.",
      "Up the street from the Alliance, the office of the Osborne Association, a group that has worked to prevent youth violence for nearly a century, has grown quieter. In April, an email from the Bureau of Justice Assistance stated the remaining $666,000 of a $2 million grant \u201cno longer effectuates department priorities.\u201d",

      "The cut thrust the nonprofit into \u201ctriage mode,\u201d said Osborne president Jonathan Monsalve, who was forced to lay off three staffers and reduce the number of participants in a diversion program offering young adults facing gun charges an alternative to jail time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lifeline for young people, and it\u2019s no longer there for 25 more of them,\u201d Monsalve said. \u201cWithout another alternative, it\u2019s 25 young people that will see prison or jail time, and that\u2019s incredibly frustrating.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice has canceled over $810 million in similar grants to nonprofits working in violence prevention. The Environmental Protection Agency attempted to cancel $2 billion in grants for environmental justice work.",
      "Nonprofit leaders say the cuts hit hardest in the places that can afford them the least. In the Bronx, almost 30 percent of residents live in poverty, the vast majority of whom are Black or Latino, and nearly one in six schoolchildren experience homelessness every year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had decades of disinvestment in these communities, and we had been starting to see some meaningful investment and community-based solutions that were actually working,\u201d said Monsalve. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden that support just gets yanked away.\u201d",
      "The federal government, he said, is essentially telling these communities: \u201cYou aren\u2019t a priority anymore. You don\u2019t fit the plan.\u201d",
      "For decades, a million-dollar federal grant allowed the victim-service organization Safe Horizon to operate a program that stationed domestic violence advocates in the borough\u2019s criminal court.",
      "When the grant came up for renewal this year, it came with new restrictions that CEO Liz Roberts described as \u201cso extreme, so broad, so radical\u201d that the organization chose to walk away rather than accept conditions which would have prohibited supporting transgender survivors or treating domestic violence as a systemic issue.",
      "It was an agonizing decision given the volume of domestic violence in the Bronx, Roberts said.",
      "It means that hundreds of survivors \u201cmay not have the opportunity to talk to an advocate about their options, about their rights, or about their safety,\u201d she said.",
      "Roberts said she\u2019s bracing for more cuts \u2014 federal funds make up about 24% of the group\u2019s budget \u2014 that could force the closure of shelters or reductions to a citywide hotline.",
      "As nonprofits nationwide grapple with similar losses, Roberts said private philanthropy and local governments will need to \u201cmake some smart and thoughtful and principled decisions about where they can help to fill those gaps.\u201d",
      "In places like the Bronx, finding alternative funding is especially challenging. \u201cThe not-for-profit sector is often fragile, and nowhere more so than the Bronx,\u201d Torres said of the district he represents, where organizations tend to be more dependent on government funding than wealthier enclaves.",
      "\u201cOrganizations spent hundreds of thousands of dollars simply to apply for a contract and hired staff and made all these plans only to see the written contract disappear,\u201d Torres said. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply destabilizing.\u201d",

      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Trump has consistently shown his hunger for a visit to China and that Beijing has used that to bolster leverage.",

      "While the ruling doesn\u2019t enter into the merits of the case, Greenpeace and Recommon highlighted the judges\u2019 determination that Italian courts can have jurisdiction over claims about emissions by ENI subsidiaries in foreign countries, since in this case, harm allegedly occurred in Italy and decisions were made by the Italy-based parent company.",

      "Like most cult comedies, \u201cHappy Gilmore\u201d didn\u2019t start out an obvious instant classic, though. \u201cA one-joke \u2018Caddyshack\u2019 for the blitzed and jaded,\u201d wrote EW. \u201cTo describe Happy\u2019s antics as boorish is putting it mildly,\u201d wrote The New York Times. \u201c\u2018Happy Gilmore\u2019 tells the story of a violent sociopath,\u201d wrote Roger Ebert. He called it \u201cthe latest in the dumber and dumbest sweepstakes.\u201d",
      "\u201cHappy Gilmore\u201d was a box-office success, grossing $39 million in the U.S. and Canada. And through worn-out DVDs and regular TV reruns, it became a favorite to generations of golfers and a staple of goofy \u201990s comedy.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you how many times I\u2019ve seen that movie,\u201d says the actor-filmmaker Benny Safdie, who co-directed Sandler in \u201cUncut Gems.\u201d \u201cIt was on an endless loop. I had the DVD and I just kept watching it. I can close my eyes and see the movie end to end. It\u2019s one of my favorite movies.\u201d",
      "Now, nearly three decades later, and after years of batting away pleas for a sequel, Sandler has finally put Happy\u2019s Bruins jersey back on. \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d which Netflix will debut Friday, is arguably the most anticipated streaming release of the summer.",
      "Sandler was well aware of the checkered history of comedy sequels. Movies like \u201cZoolander 2\u201d and \u201cAnchorman 2\u201d have struggled to recapture the freewheeling spirit of the originals. The movie Sandler counts as his favorite, \u201cCaddyshack\u201d \u2014 so much so that he was initially hesitant to make a golf comedy \u2014 spawned 1988's woebegone \u201cCaddyshack II.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf someone brought it up to us, we were like, \u2018Yeah, no, we\u2019re not going to do that,\u2019\u201d Sandler said in a recent interview alongside Herlihy. \u201cThere was no moment we went \u2018Aha.\u2019 It just kind of happened. The last couple years, we were talking about Happy and how it might be funny if he was down and out.\u201d",

Safdie co-stars as the founder of Maxi Golf, a new circus-like tour with long hitters.",
      "\u201cWe thought it could be fun to write something like that\u201d says Sandler. \u201cIt kind of connected to our lives and this age, and wanting to make a full-on comedy. There\u2019s nothing better than dropping a comedy and trying to make people laugh, to us. It feels like why we originally got into this business.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe were outlining the story together and then we were like, \u2018We should watch the first one again, man,\u2019\u201d Sandler says. \u201cWe\u2019re going off of our memory of so many things, hanging out with Carl Weathers and Bob Barker and all that stuff. Then we watched it and we were like, \u2018Oh, yeah.\u2019 It was a tone.\u201d",

Even the golf ball-stealing alligator, Morris, has passed on. \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d unusually elegiac for a proudly silly comedy, nods to all of them.",
      "For the sequel, many others, like Travis Kelce, Bad Bunny and Margaret Qualley, were lining up to be a part of it. So were pro golfers. Just about all the big names in golf, including several legends, appear. The day after winning Sunday\u2019s British Open, Scottie Scheffler flew to New York for the premiere.",
      "Over the years, Herlihy and Sandler have seen a lot of them try \u201cthe Happy Gilmore.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like when these golfers try to do it, these pros, they\u2019re 5% thinking, \u2018Maybe this will work,\u2019\u201d says Herlihy, laughing.",

      "\u201cWhen we were putting it together, I called my dad and asked him if it was legal. He was like, \u2018I don\u2019t see why not,\u2019\u201d Sandler remembers. \u201cThen there are some people who look at it and go: \u2018It does help you swing hard. It gives you more momentum.

Dart threw an interception his first throw of 11-on-11 team drills, Wilson told his younger teammate to focus on the next play and the rookie's subsequent throw went for a touchdown.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re working well together,\u201d veteran defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence said. \u201cRuss is a great leader, Jameis is a great leader and I see them talking to him a lot. Russ handles his business really well, so for (Dart) to learn from that and them to be unselfish to teach that to him, it\u2019s only on an up trajectory.\"",
      "There's little direction to go but up for the Giants, who tied for the worst record in the NFL last season at 3-14. That is one reason fourth-year general manager Joe Schoen turned over the quarterback part of the roster almost completely \u2014 with local cult hero Tommy DeVito the lone holdover.",
      "Wilson at age 36 got a contract for this season worth up to $21 million with $10.5 million guaranteed. And New York traded a second-round pick and two third-rounders to move up to take Dart 25th, several weeks after signing Winston.",
      "Scouting Dart from afar at Mississippi and watching him up close in offseason workouts, the Giants like what they're witnessing so far.",
      "\u201cYou saw leadership, you saw arm talent, you saw athleticism and he\u2019s a rookie,\u201d Schoen said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a long way to go, and he\u2019s got a really good supporting cast in there to help. We\u2019ve got a really good coaching staff as well, so he\u2019s in a good spot right now.\u201d",
      "That spot is in reserve, though Daboll would not say if the backup job is up for grabs between Dart and Winston. Only that when the season starts on Sept. 7 at NFC East rival Washington, Wilson will be under center if healthy.",
      "Asked about that certainty, Wilson said he's \u201calways just focused on being the best version of myself every day.\u201d",
      "A teammate two seasons ago in Denver, tight end Chris Manhertz believes Wilson is qualified to handle this situation thanks to \u201call the traits of a good quarterback.\u201d",

      "Of particular interest to archaeologists are objects found beside the remains that may have been used during ceremonies to honor the dead and could shed light on how our ancient ancestors thought about spirituality and the afterlife.",
      "\u201cThis is an amazing revolutionary innovation for our species,\" said Yossi Zaidner, one of the directors of the Tinshemet excavation and a professor of archaeology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \"It\u2019s actually the first time we are starting to use this behavior.\u201d",
      "Archaeologists working at Tinshemet since 2016 have discovered the remains of five early humans that date back to around 110,000 to 100,000 years ago, according to various technologies.",
      "The skeletons were discovered in pits and carefully arranged in a fetal position, which is known as a burial position, said Zaidner. Many were found with objects, such as basalt pebbles, animal remains or fragments of ochre, a reddish pigment made from iron-rich rocks.",
      "These objects, some sourced from hundreds of kilometers (miles) away, had no known practical use for daily life, so experts believe they were part of rituals meant to honor the dead.",
      "Tinshemet Cave is a dark slash in central Israel\u2019s rolling hills filled with squeaking fruit bats. Inside and around the cave is an unassuming stone mound which Zaidner calls \u201cone of the three or four most important sites for study of human evolution and behavior during the Paleolithic time.\u201d",
      "The Paleolithic era, also known as the Stone Age because of the onset of stone tools, lasted from as early as 3.3 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago. Tinshemet Cave is from the Middle Paleolithic era, roughly between 250,000 to 30,000 years ago.",
      "Some of the Tinshemet researchers' core findings were published in March in Nature Human Behavior. A key discovery were the remains of five early humans, including two full skeletons and three isolated skulls with other bones and teeth. Also of note were more than 500 differently sized fragments of red and orange ochre, a pigment created by heating iron-rich stones to a certain temperature \u2014 evidence that early humans had the means to create decorative objects.",
      "\u201cHere we see a really complex set of behaviors, not related to just food and surviving,\u201d Zaidner said.",
      "Using hand chisels and delicate, pen-sized pneumatic drills that resemble dental tools, archaeologists will need many more years to excavate the site. The field work, which started in 2016, is usually done over the summer months. This year, a dozen archaeology undergraduate and graduate students fanned out across the site, painstakingly documenting and removing each fragment of tool, object or bone.",
      "At the entrance to the cave, the skull of one of the early humans is slowly emerging from the rock sediment; it will be years before it is fully excavated.",

      "Tinshemet is exceptionally important to archaeologists because the local climate preserved the bones, tools, and ornaments in good condition, unlike many other parts of the world where these items were lost to time, said Christian Tryon, a professor at the University of Connecticut and a research associate at the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The skeletons and objects were so well preserved because of ash from frequent fires, likely for rituals. This large amount of ash mixed with rainfall and Israel's acidic limestone, creating optimal conditions for perseveration. One skeleton was in such good condition archaeologists could see how the fingers were interwoven, hands clasped beneath the head.",
      "Tryon said the Tinshemet findings are bolstering earlier discoveries from two similar burial sites dating back to the same period in northern Israel \u2014 Skhul Cave and Qafzeh Cave. Skhul Cave was excavated almost 100 years ago, and Qafzeh Cave mostly around 50 years ago, when archaeological practices were more haphazard.",
      "\u201cThere were so many uncertainties with those sites, but this is confirming it\u2019s a pattern we know, and they\u2019re really nailing down the dates,\u201d Tryon said.",
      "Tinshemet has helped archaeologists conclude that burial practices started to become more widespread during this time, representing a shift in how early humans treated their dead.",
      "Some archaeologists believe intentional burials started earlier. In South Africa, the Homo naledi species \u2013 an ancient cousin of Homo sapiens \u2013 may have been intentionally placing their dead in caves as early as 200,000 years ago. But many archaeologists said the findings are controversial and there is not enough evidence to support the claim of intentional burials.",
      "In ancient times, Israel was a bridge between Neanderthals from Europe and Homo sapiens from Africa. Archaeologists have identified other subgroups of early humans in the area, and believe the groups interacted and may have interbred.",
      "Experts have been studying the two full skeletons brought from Tinshemet for years, but it\u2019s still unclear if they were Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, a hybrid population or another group altogether.",
      "The mix of subgroups created opportunities for different groups of early humans to exchange knowledge or express identity, said Zaidner. It\u2019s around this time that archaeologists first see examples of early jewelry or body painting, which could be ways early humans started outwardly belonging to a certain group, drawing boundaries between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel Hershkovitz, a physical anthropologist at Tel Aviv University and the co-director of the Tinshemet site, said the concept of cemeteries in prehistoric life is important because it symbolizes \u201ca kind of a territory.\u201d",
      "He said that same kind of claim over land where ancestors are buried still echoes in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of claim you make to the neighbors, saying \u2019this is my territory, this part of the land belongs to my father and my forefather' and so on and so on.\u201d",

      "Teenagers are turning to AI for advice, guidance and conversation",
      "As artificial intelligence technology becomes part of daily life, adolescents are turning to chatbots for advice, guidance and conversation. The appeal is clear: Chatbots are patient, never judgmental, supportive and always available.",
      "That worries experts who say the booming AI industry is largely unregulated and that many parents have no idea about how their kids are using AI tools or the extent of personal information they are sharing with chatbots.",
      "New research shows more than 70% of American teenagers have used AI companions and more than half converse with them regularly. The study by Common Sense Media focused on \u201cAI companions,\u201d like Character. AI, Nomi and Replika, which it defines as \u201cdigital friends or characters you can text or talk with whenever you want,\u201d versus AI assistants or tools like ChatGPT, though it notes they can be used the same way.",
      "It\u2019s important that parents understand the technology. Experts suggest some things parents can do to help protect their kids:",
      "\u2014 Start a conversation, without judgment, says Michael Robb, head researcher at Common Sense Media. Approach your teen with curiosity and basic questions: \u201cHave you heard of AI companions?\u201d \u201cDo you use apps that talk to you like a friend?\u201d Listen and understand what appeals to your teen before being dismissive or saying you\u2019re worried about it.",
      "\u2014 Help teens recognize that AI companions are programmed to be agreeable and validating. Explain that\u2019s not how real relationships work and that real friends with their own points of view can help navigate difficult situations in ways that AI companions cannot.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that's really concerning is not only what's happening on screen but how much time it\u2019s taking kids away from relationships in real life,\u201d says Mitch Prinstein, chief of psychology at the American Psychological Association. \u201cWe need to teach kids that this is a form of entertainment. It's not real, and it's really important they distinguish it from reality and should not have it replace relationships in your actual life.\u201d",
      "The APA recently put out a health advisory on AI and adolescent well-being, and tips for parents.",
      "\u2014 Parents should watch for signs of unhealthy attachments.",
      "\u201cIf your teen is preferring AI interactions over real relationships or spending hours talking to AI companions, or showing that they are becoming emotionally distressed when separated from them \u2014 those are patterns that suggest AI companions might be replacing rather than complementing human connection,\u201d Robb says.",
      "\u2014 Parents can set rules about AI use, just like they do for screen time and social media. Have discussions about when and how AI tools can and cannot be used. Many AI companions are designed for adult use and can mimic romantic, intimate and role-playing scenarios.",

      "Trump on Wednesday is planning to reveal an \u201cAI Action Plan\u201d he ordered after returning to the White House in January. He gave his tech advisers six months to come up with new AI policies after revoking President Joe Biden's signature AI guardrails on his first day in office.",

      "The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that\u2019s seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance.",
      "The world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs \u2014 more than $123,000 on Monday \u2014 while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what\u2019s been called the \u201cgolden age\u201d for digital assets.",

      "As global temperatures rise under climate change, the bees responsible for pollinating many crops are under increasing stress and scientists are trying to understand how they are affected",
      "WILLIAMSPORT, Ohio -- Sweat covers Isaac Barnes\u2019s face under his beekeeper\u2019s veil as he hauls boxes of honeycomb from his hives to his truck. It's a workout in what feels like a sauna as the late-morning June temperatures rise.",
      "Though Barnes was hot, his bees were even hotter. Their body temperatures can be up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit (about 15 Celsius) higher than the air around them. As global temperatures rise under climate change, scientists are trying to better understand the effects on managed and wild bees as they pollinate crops, gather nectar, make honey and reproduce.",
      "They noticed flying bees gathering nectar avoided overheating on the hottest days by using fewer but harder wingbeats to keep their body temperature below dangerous levels, according to a study published last year. Scientists also say that bees \u2014 like people \u2014 may also cope by retreating to a cooler environment such as the shade or their nest.",
      "\u201cJust like we go into the shade, or we sweat or we might work less hard, bees actually do the exact same thing so they can avoid the heat,\u201d said Jon Harrison, an environmental physiologist at Arizona State University and one of the study\u2019s authors.",
      "But that means the bees aren't able to do what they normally do, said Kevin McCluney, a biology professor at Bowling Green State University.",

      "Generally, most bees are heat-tolerant, but as the climate warms, some experts think their ability to fend off disease and gather food might become harder. And habitat loss, increased use of pesticides, diseases and lack of forage for both managed and wild bees are all listed as potential contributors to the global decline of bees and other pollinators.",
      "\u201cIf you're not well-fed, and your body is intoxicated with pesticides and you have lots of diseases in your body, you're going to be less heat-tolerant than if you were healthy,\u201d said Margarita L\u00f3pez-Uribe, a pollinator health expert at Pennsylvania State University.",
      "Earlier this year, preliminary results from the annual U.S. Beekeeping Survey found that beekeepers lost almost 56% of their managed colonies, the highest loss since the survey started in 2010.",
      "Almost all of the managed honeybee colonies in the U.S. are used to pollinate agricultural crops such as almonds, apples, cherries and blueberries. Fewer pollinators can lead to less pollination and potentially lower yields.",
      "\u201cIt's a very fragile system if you think about it,\u201d L\u00f3pez-Uribe said. \u201cBecause if something goes wrong, you have these super high-value crops that won\u2019t get enough bees for pollination.\u201d",
      "Back at Barnes' hives in Ohio, thousands of honeybees fly around as he gathers boxes to take back to his farm for honey production. Nearby, a couple of his bees land on milkweed flowers, a rare bit of plant diversity in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields.",
      "For Barnes, who operates Honeyrun Farm with his wife, Jayne, one of the challenges heat can pose to his 500 honeybee hives is fending off parasitic mites that threaten the bees. If temperatures get too hot, he can\u2019t apply formic acid, an organic chemical that kills the mites. If it\u2019s applied when it\u2019s too hot, the bees could die.",
      "Last year they lost almost a third of the 400 hives they sent to California to help pollinate commercial almond groves. Barnes thinks those hives may have been in poor health ahead of pollination because they were unable to ward off mites when it was hot months earlier.",

      "Sometimes the heat helps. Here in Ohio, Barnes' hives last summer produced a bumper crop of honey as they feasted on nearby soybean nectar as the plants bloomed in the heat. Still, the lack of diverse plants for bees to forage in an area dominated by corn and soybean fields isn't ideal.",
      "And even the native blooms are appearing erratically, Barnes said. In autumn, his bees search for food on goldenrod, but those blooms are appearing later. And even then, he has supplemented his hive with additional food to keep them healthy into the winter.",
      "\u201cEvery single plant that blooms is something that the bee can use,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAnd every single plant is affected by climate change.\u201d",
      "It's only in the last decade that people have become aware of the magnitude of the pollinator decline globally, said Harrison, of Arizona State University. Data is limited on how much climate change and heat stress is contributing to pollinator decline.",

      "Harrison said his research on this topic would come to a halt if cuts are made to his federal funding, and it would be more difficult in general for scientists to study the disappearance of bees and other pollinators and improve how they prevent these losses.

      "Archaeologists have identified a 250-year-old shipwreck uncovered on a remote Scottish beach",
      "LONDON -- When a schoolboy going for a run found the ribs of a wooden ship poking through the dunes of a remote Scottish beach, it sparked a hunt by archaeologists, scientists and local historians to uncover its story.",
      "Through a mix of high-tech science and community research, they have an answer. Researchers announced Wednesday that the vessel is very likely the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century warship that saw action in the American War of Independence before a second life hunting whales in the Arctic \u2014 and then a stormy demise.",
      "\u201cI would regard it as a lucky ship, which is a strange thing to say about a ship that\u2019s wrecked,\u201d said Ben Saunders, senior marine archaeologist at Wessex Archaeology, a charity that helped community researchers conduct the investigation.",
      "\u201cI think if it had been found in many other places, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily have had that community drive, that desire to recover and study that material, and also the community spirit to do it,\u201d Saunders said.",
      "The wreck was discovered in February 2024 after a storm swept away sand covering it on Sanday, one of the rugged Orkney Islands that lie off Scotland\u2019s northern tip.",
      "It excited interest on the island of 500 people, whose history is bound up with the sea and its dangers. Around 270 shipwrecks have been recorded around the 20-square-mile (50-square-kilometer) island since the 15th century.",
      "Local farmers used their tractors and trailers to haul the 12 tons of oak timbers off the beach, before local researchers set to work trying to identify it.",
      "\u201cThat was really good fun, and it was such a good feeling about the community \u2013 everybody pulling together to get it back,\u201d said Sylvia Thorne, one of the island\u2019s community researchers. \u201cQuite a few people are really getting interested in it and becoming experts.\u201d",
      "Dendrochronology \u2014 the science of dating wood from tree rings \u2014 showed the timber came from southern England in the middle of the 18th century. That was one bit of luck, Saunders said, because it coincides with \u201cthe point where British bureaucracy\u2019s really starting to kick off\u201d and detailed records were being kept.",
      "\u201cAnd so we can then start to look at the archive evidence that we have for the wrecks in Orkney,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIt becomes a process of elimination.",
      "\u201cYou remove ones that are Northern European as opposed to British, you remove wrecks that are too small or operating out of the north of England and you really are down to two or three \u2026 and Earl of Chatham is the last one left.\u201d",

      "Further research found that before it was the Earl of Chatham, the ship was HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate built in Chichester on England\u2019s south coast in 1749.",
      "Its military career saw it play a part in the expansion \u2014 and contraction \u2014 of the British Empire. It helped Britain wrest control of Canada from France during the sieges of Louisbourg and Quebec in the 1750s, and in the 1770s served as a convoy escort during Britain\u2019s failed effort to hold onto its American colonies.",
      "Sold off by the navy in 1784 and renamed, the vessel became a whaling ship, hunting the huge mammals in the Arctic waters off Greenland.",
      "Whale oil was an essential fuel of the Industrial Revolution, used to lubricate machinery, soften fabric and light city streets. Saunders said that in 1787 there were 120 London-based whaling ships in the Greenland Sea, the Earl of Chatham among them.",
      "A year later, while heading out to the whaling ground, it was wrecked in bad weather off Sanday. All 56 crew members survived \u2014 more evidence, Saunders says, that this was a vessel blessed with luck.",
      "The ship\u2019s timbers are being preserved in a freshwater tank at the Sanday Heritage Centre while plans are discussed to put it on permanent display.",
      "Saunders said that the project is a model of community involvement in archaeology.",
      "\u201cThe community have been so keen, have been so desirous to be involved and to find out things to learn, and they\u2019re so proud of it. It\u2019s down to them it was discovered, it\u2019s down to them it was recovered and it\u2019s been stabilized and been protected,\u201d he said.",
      "For locals, it\u2019s a link to the island\u2019s maritime past \u2014 and future. Finding long-buried wrecks could become more common as climate change alters the wind patterns around Britain and reshapes the coastline.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest things I\u2019ve got out of this project is realizing how much the past in Sanday is just constantly with you \u2014 either visible or just under the surface,\u201d said Ruth Peace, another community researcher.",

      "MIAMI -- Elon Musk fought court cases on opposite coasts Monday, raising a question about the billionaire that could either speed his plan to put self-driving Teslas on U.S. roads or throw up a major roadblock: Can this wildly successful man who tends to exaggerate really be trusted?",
      "In Miami, a Tesla driver who has admitted he was wrong to reach for a dropped cell phone moments before a deadly accident, spoke of the danger of putting too much faith in Musk's technology \u2014 in this case his Autopilot program.",
      "\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said George McGee, who ran off the road and killed a woman out stargazing with her boyfriend. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d",
      "In unusual coincidence, regulators arguing an Oakland, California, case tried to pin exaggerated talk about the same Tesla technology at the center of a request to suspend the carmaker from being able to sell vehicles in the state.",
      "Musk's tendency to talk big \u2014 whether it's his cars, his rockets or his government costing-cutting efforts \u2014 have landed him in trouble with investors, regulators and courts before, but rarely at such a delicate moment.",
      "After his social media spat with President Donald Trump, Musk can no longer count on a light regulatory touch from Washington. Meanwhile, sales of his electric cars have plunged and so a hit to his safety reputation could threaten his next big project: rolling out driverless robotaxis \u2014 hundreds of thousands of them \u2014 in several U.S. cities by the end of next year.",
      "The Miami case holds other dangers, too. Lawyers for the family of the dead woman, Naibel Benavides Leon, recently convinced the judge overseeing the jury trial to allow them to argue for punitive damages. A car crash lawyer not involved in the case, but closely following it, said that could cost Tesla tens of millions of dollars, or possibly more.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen punitive damages go to the hundreds of millions, so that is the floor,\u201d said Miguel Custodio of Los Angeles-based Custodio & Dubey. \u201cIt is also a signal to other plaintiffs that they can also ask for punitive damages, and then the payments could start compounding.\u201d",
      "That Tesla has allowed the Miami case to proceed to trial is surprising. It has settled at least four deadly accidents involving Autopilot, including payments just last week to a Florida family of a Tesla driver. That said, Tesla was victorious in two other jury cases, both in California, that also sought to lay blame on its technology for crashes.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Miami case argue that Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature, called Autopilot, should have warned the driver and braked when his Model S sedan blew through flashing lights, a stop sign and a T-intersection at 62 miles-an-hour in an April 2019 crash. Tesla said that drivers are warned not to rely on Autopilot, or its more advanced Full Self-Driving system. It says the fault entirely lies with the \"distracted driver\" just like so many other \u201caccidents since cellphones were invented.\u201d",
      "Driver McGee settled a separate suit brought by the family of Benavides and her severely injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo.",
      "McGee was clearly shaken when shown a dashcam video Monday of his car jumping a Key West, Florida, road and hitting a parked Chevrolet Tahoe which then slammed into Benavides and sent her 75 feet through the air to her death. Asked if he had seen those images before, McGee pinched his lips, shook his head, then squeaked out a response, \u201cNo.\u201d",

      "Tesla's attorney sought to show that McGee was fully to blame, asking if he had ever contacted Tesla for additional instructions about how Autopilot or any other safety features worked. McGee said he had not, though he was heavy user of the features. He said he had driven the same road home from work 30 or 40 times. Under questioning, he also acknowledged he alone was responsible for watching the road and hitting the brakes.",
      "Summarizing the testimony, Tesla said in a statement after the court adjourned that McGee had \"stated the simple truth that we all know: If he had just paid attention to the road instead of searching for his dropped cell phone and pressing the accelerator \u2014which he was doing for over a minute before the crash \u2014 this tragic accident would never have happened.\u201d",
      "But lawyers for the Benavides family had a chance in the courtroom at parrying that line of argument, asking McGee if he would have taken his eyes off the road and reached for his phone had he been driving any car other than a Tesla on Autopilot.",
      "McGee responded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201d",
      "The case is expected to continue for two more weeks.",
      "In the California case, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing before an administrative judge that Tesla has misled drivers by exaggerating the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features. A court filing claims even those feature names are misleading because they offer just partial self-driving",
      "Musk has been warned by federal regulators to stop making public comments suggesting Full Self-Driving allows his cars to drive themselves because it could lead to overreliance on the system, resulting in possible crashes and deaths. He also has run into trouble with regulators for Autopilot. In 2023, the company had to recall 2.3 million vehicles for problems with the technology and is now under investigation for saying it fixed the issue though it\u2019s unclear it has, according to regulatory documents.",

      "The bill passed by the lower house, the State Duma, moves to its all-but-certain endorsement in the upper house and then goes to President Vladimir Putin to be signed into law.",
      "The legislation punishes what it describes as \u201cdeliberately searching for and accessing extremist materials\u201d online. First-time offenders face a fine of up to the equivalent of $64.",
      "The official definition of extremist activity is extremely broad and includes opposition groups like the Anti-Corruption Foundation, created by the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, and the \u201cinternational LGBT movement.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not clear how authorities will track down violators. Officials and lawmakers said ordinary internet users won't be affected and only those who methodically seek outlawed content will be targeted. They didn't explain how the authorities would differentiate between them.",
      "Some observers have suggested the information would likely come from internet providers or social media platforms, and police also could randomly check the search history of cellphones or computers.",
      "The new legislation also contained a ban on advertising of virtual private network services and fines for VPN resources that fail to comply with government regulations, but stopped short of banning their use.

      "When the KissCam at a Coldplay concert last week landed on a couple who suspiciously escaped their embrace and tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work",
      "NEW YORK -- When the \u201cKissCam\u201d at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work.",
      "In hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video \u2014 and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.",
      "The incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world \u2014 about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through \u201csocial media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.",
      "So in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see?",
      "It's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.",
      "From CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product \u2014 and the center of attention.",
      "And of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket \u2014 and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.",
      "Ellis Cashmore, author of the book \u201cCelebrity Culture,\u201d proposes that the rapid fame of last week\u2019s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: \u201cIs the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there\u2019s no such thing as the private life anymore,\u201d he notes. \u201cCertainly not in the traditional sense of the term.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,\u201d adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume privacy on the street anymore.\u201d",
      "Some version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events \u2014 from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It\u2019s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What\u2019s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.",
      "That isn\u2019t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online \u2014 where it can zip around the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the camera,\" Bock says. \u201cIt\u2019s the distribution system that is wild and new.\u201d",

      "Then there's the second ring of exposure \u2014 what happens after the video or photos spread.",
      "Experts point to growing instances of social media users rushing to publicly identify, or dox, the people captured on camera \u2014 much like how quickly the internet committed to finding those involved in the Coldplay moment, for example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer\u2019s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.",
      "But it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances \u2014 including AI \u2014 have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. \u201cWhen you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",
      "And of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved.",
      "At last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee \u2014 leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.",
      "For the now-viral moment, \u201cwe can talk about what\u2019s right and wrong, and whether they deserved it,\u201d says Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business. Still, it\u2019s a \u201cvery frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,\u201d Taylor notes. \u201cThere are real human beings behind this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away \u2014 and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to \u201cthink before you share\u201d and question whether something\u2019s really accurate.",
      "\u201cSocial media has changed so much,\u201d Bock says. \u201cBut we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has made a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room and targeted President Donald Trump\u2019s political enemies",
      "WASHINGTON -- As the national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard is responsible for guarding America's secrets and discovering threats from overseas. But when she made a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room Wednesday, her targets were President Donald Trump\u2019s political enemies.",
      "Escalating her attempts to undermine the long-settled conclusion that Russia tried to help Trump beat Hillary Clinton for the presidency nearly a decade ago, she unspooled what she called unshakable proof that then-President Barack Obama and his advisers plotted nothing short of a coup.",
      "\u201cThey conspired to subvert the will of the American people,\u201d she said, claiming they fabricated evidence to taint Trump\u2019s victory.",
      "Little of what she said was new, and much of it was baseless. Gabbard said her investigation into the former Democratic administration was designed to stop the weaponization of national security institutions, but it spurred more questions about her own independence atop a spying system intended to provide unvarnished intelligence.",
      "Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who ran for president herself before joining Trump\u2019s idiosyncratic political ecosystem, seemed prepared to use her presentation to burnish her own standing. She was trailed by her cinematographer husband, who held a video camera to capture the moment.",
      "And Trump, who had previously expressed public doubts about Gabbard\u2019s analysis of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, appeared satisfied. He posted a video of her remarks, pinning them at the top of his social media feed.",
      "It was a display that cemented Gabbard\u2019s role as one of Trump\u2019s chief agents of retribution, delivering official recognition of Trump\u2019s grievances about the Russia investigation that shadowed his first term. The focus on a years-old scandal also served Trump\u2019s attempts to shift attention from the Jeffrey Epstein case and questions about the president\u2019s own association with an abuser of underage girls.",
      "During her White House remarks, Gabbard said she has referred the documents to the Justice Department to consider for a possible criminal investigation. Hours later, the department announced the creation of a \u201cstrike force\u201d to investigate the findings.",
      "Obama\u2019s postpresidential office declined to comment Wednesday but issued a rare response a day earlier. \u201cThese bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,\u201d said Patrick Rodenbush, an Obama spokesman.",
      "The White House rejected questions about the timing of Gabbard\u2019s revelations and whether they were designed to curry favor with Trump or distract attention from the administration\u2019s handling of files relating to Epstein.",
      "Still, Trump was quick to reward Gabbard\u2019s loyalty this week, calling her \u201cthe hottest person in the room.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, she released a report by the Republican staff of the House Intelligence Committee produced during the first Trump administration. It did not dispute that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, but cites what it says were trade craft failings in the assessment reached by the intelligence community that Russian President Vladimir Putin influenced the election because he intended for Trump to win.",
      "Gabbard went beyond some conclusions of the report in describing its findings from the White House podium. She, along with the report, also seized on the fact that a dossier including uncorroborated tips and salacious gossip about Trump\u2019s ties to Russia was referenced in a classified version annex of an intelligence community assessment released in 2017 that detailed Russia\u2019s interference.",
      "The dossier was not the basis for the FBI\u2019s decision to open an investigation in July 2016 into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, but Trump supporters have seized on the unverified innuendo in the document to try to undercut the broader probe.",
      "Gabbard said she didn't know why the documents weren't released during Trump's first administration. Her office did not respond to questions about the timing of the release.",
      "Responding to a question from a reporter about Gabbard's motivations, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused journalists of looking for a story where there wasn't one.",

      "\u201cWe caught Hillary Clinton. We caught Barack Hussein Obama ... you ought take a look at that and stop talking about nonsense,\u201d Trump said Tuesday.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe served briefly as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term but did not release any of the information declassified by Gabbard. The CIA declined to comment on Gabbard's remarks Wednesday.",
      "Gabbard told Congress in April that Iran wasn\u2019t actively seeking a nuclear weapon, and Trump dismissed her assessment just before U.S. strikes on Iran.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care what she said,\u201d Trump said in June on Air Force One when asked about Gabbard\u2019s testimony.",
      "Gabbard recently shared her findings about the Russia investigation in an Oval Office meeting with Trump, according to two administration officials who requested anonymity to discuss a private conversation. Afterward, one of the officials said, Trump expressed satisfaction that Gabbard\u2019s findings aligned with his own beliefs.",
      "On Friday, Gabbard\u2019s office released a report that downplayed the extent of Russian interference in the 2016 election by highlighting Obama administration emails showing officials had concluded before and after the presidential race that Moscow had not hacked state election systems to manipulate votes in Trump\u2019s favor.",
      "But Obama\u2019s Democratic administration never suggested otherwise, even as it exposed other means by which Russia interfered in the election, including through a massive hack-and-leak operation of Democratic emails by intelligence operatives working with WikiLeaks, as well as a covert influence campaign aimed at swaying public opinion and sowing discord through fake social media posts.",
      "Earlier this month Ratcliffe released a report criticizing aspects of the intelligence community assessment and suggesting the process had been rushed. The report did not address multiple investigations since then, including a report from the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee in 2020 that reached the same conclusion about Russia\u2019s influence and motives.",
      "Lawmakers from both parties have long stressed the need for an independent intelligence service. Democrats said Gabbard\u2019s reports show she has placed partisanship and loyalty to Trump over her duty and some have called for her resignation.",
      "\u201cIt seems as though the Trump administration is willing to declassify anything and everything except the Epstein files,\u201d Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Warner predicted Gabbard's actions could prompt U.S. allies to share less information for fear it would be politicized or recklessly declassified.",
      "But Gabbard enjoys strong support among Republicans. Rep. Rick Crawford, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said she and Ratcliffe were working to put the intelligence community \u201con the path to regaining the trust of the American people.\u201d",
      "Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence panel, said Gabbard hasn't offered any reason to ignore the many earlier investigations into Russia's efforts.",
      "\u201cThe Director is free to disagree with the Intelligence Community Assessment\u2019s conclusion that Putin favored Donald Trump, but her view stands in stark contrast to the verdict rendered by multiple credible investigations,\u201d Himes said in a statement. \u201cIncluding the bipartisan report released by the Senate Intelligence Committee.\u201d",

Officials also presented evidence suggesting the attack was premeditated \u2014 a goodbye letter to his father they found in his truck and drawings in his home that appear to show a mountain parking lot with a shotgun being fired and a person aiming a rifle at his chin.",
      "\u201cTomorrow, I shall go to battle,\u201d Roley wrote to his father. \u201cIf I survive, it would be with upmost dishonor. I bid thee farewell.\" Next to his signature were two symbols that appear to be runes linked to Nazi ideology.",
      "Roley used gas, lighters and flint to start a series of fires at Canfield Mountain on June 29 to instigate a response, then shot at firefighters who asked him to move his vehicle, Norris said. He shot at others from a tree before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the sheriff said.",
      "\"This was a premeditated ambush, a pure act of evil against the people we look to for help,\" Norris said.",
      "Killed were Kootenai County Fire and Rescue Battalion Chief Frank Harwood, 42, and Coeur d\u2019Alene Fire Department Battalion Chief John Morrison, 52. Coeur d\u2019Alene Fire Engineer David Tysdal, 47, was hospitalized in critical condition.",
      "Investigators hope to learn more from Roley's social media accounts, but it's clear that his frustrations were growing over time, the sheriff said.",
      "Roley tried to become a soldier in Arizona in 2023 and again last year in Hayden, Idaho, \u201cbut failed to follow through on tasks and appointments, eventually being disqualified by the U.S. Army,\u201d Norris said.",
      "Then, one month before the shootings, Roley went to a Coeur d\u2019Alene fire station asking about becoming a firefighter, Norris said.",
      "\u201cHe had the state of mind that he would be able to start that day,\u201d Norris said. \u201cHe was told there\u2019s a process \u2014 you have a written exam, and a physical agility and a background investigation and an oral interview. The contact became agitated and frustrated. He left there in a very frustrated and agitated state.\u201d",
      "Beyond what the sheriff shared, little is known about Roley's motivation, but Associated Press interviews and court records reveal a troubled early home life and a disconnect from schoolmates, who saw him as an aggressive young man who liked to draw bombs and use firearms.",

      "ST. LOUIS -- A man whose body was found in the Mississippi River south of St. Louis in 1994 has finally been identified after authorities exhumed his remains to collect new DNA samples.",
      "In the latest cold case to be solved through advances in DNA technology, the sheriff\u2019s office in Jefferson County, Missouri, announced Tuesday that the former John Doe was Benny Leo Olson from Edwardsville, a suburb on the Illinois side of the river about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of St. Louis.",
      "Officials do not suspect any foul play in the case, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.",
      "After learning Olson had been dead more than three decades, his half-sister Catherine Heston told the newspaper, \u201cWe knew something must have happened, but you never really know.\u201d If alive today, he would be 76.",
      "She said Olson was a \u201cperpetual student,\u201d attending St. Louis Community College-Meramec, Western Illinois University in Macomb and at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.",
      "But mental illness also lurked in the background. In 1980, he was charged with trying to pay someone to burn down his stepmother\u2019s house. His fingerprints were taken as part of that criminal case, and those prints ultimately helped confirm his identity following a partial DNA match to a distant relative.",

      "FORT PIERCE, Fla. -- A man charged with attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump last year at his Florida golf course will return to court Thursday to once again explain why he wants to fire his court-appointed lawyers and represent himself.",
      "Ryan Routh previously made the request earlier this month during a hearing in Fort Pierce before U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon. She did not rule during the hearing but said she would issue a written order later. But now Routh, 59, is set to be back in front of Cannon, a day after his court-appointed federal public defenders asked to be taken off the case.",
      "Routh is scheduled to stand trial in September, a year after prosecutors say a U.S. Secret Service agent thwarted his attempt to shoot Trump as he played golf. Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations.",
      "The judge told Routh earlier this month that she doesn\u2019t intend to delay the Sept. 8 start date of his trial, even if she lets him represent himself. Routh, who has described the extent of his education as two years of college after earning his GED certificate, told Cannon that he understood and would be ready.",
      "In a June 29 letter to Cannon, Routh said that he and his attorneys were \"a million miles apart\" and that they were refusing to answer his questions. He also suggested in the same letter that he could be used in a prisoner exchange with Iran, China, North Korea or Russia.",
      "\u201cI could die being of some use and save all this court mess, but no one acts; perhaps you have the power to trade me away,\u201d Routh wrote.",
      "On Wednesday, the federal public defender's office filed a motion for termination of appointment of counsel, claiming that \u201cthe attorney-client relationship is irreconcilably broken.\u201d Attorneys said Routh refused to meet with them for a scheduled in-person meeting Tuesday morning at the federal detention center in Miami. They said Routh has refused six attempts to meet with their team.",

      "Prosecutors have said Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15 at his West Palm Beach country club. A Secret Service agent spotted Routh before Trump came into view. Routh allegedly aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot.",
      "Law enforcement obtained help from a witness who prosecutors said informed officers that he saw a person fleeing. The witness was then flown in a police helicopter to a nearby interstate where Routh was arrested, and the witnesses confirmed it was the person he had seen, prosecutors have said.",
      "Routh has another, unrelated hearing in Cannon\u2019s courtroom scheduled for Friday on the admissibility of certain evidence and testimony that can be used for the trial.",
      "In addition to the federal charges, Routh also has pleaded not guilty to state charges of terrorism and attempted murder.",

      "Teenagers are turning to AI for advice, guidance and conversation",
      "As artificial intelligence technology becomes part of daily life, adolescents are turning to chatbots for advice, guidance and conversation. The appeal is clear: Chatbots are patient, never judgmental, supportive and always available.",
      "That worries experts who say the booming AI industry is largely unregulated and that many parents have no idea about how their kids are using AI tools or the extent of personal information they are sharing with chatbots.",
      "New research shows more than 70% of American teenagers have used AI companions and more than half converse with them regularly. The study by Common Sense Media focused on \u201cAI companions,\u201d like Character. AI, Nomi and Replika, which it defines as \u201cdigital friends or characters you can text or talk with whenever you want,\u201d versus AI assistants or tools like ChatGPT, though it notes they can be used the same way.",
      "It\u2019s important that parents understand the technology. Experts suggest some things parents can do to help protect their kids:",
      "\u2014 Start a conversation, without judgment, says Michael Robb, head researcher at Common Sense Media. Approach your teen with curiosity and basic questions: \u201cHave you heard of AI companions?\u201d \u201cDo you use apps that talk to you like a friend?\u201d Listen and understand what appeals to your teen before being dismissive or saying you\u2019re worried about it.",
      "\u2014 Help teens recognize that AI companions are programmed to be agreeable and validating. Explain that\u2019s not how real relationships work and that real friends with their own points of view can help navigate difficult situations in ways that AI companions cannot.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that's really concerning is not only what's happening on screen but how much time it\u2019s taking kids away from relationships in real life,\u201d says Mitch Prinstein, chief of psychology at the American Psychological Association. \u201cWe need to teach kids that this is a form of entertainment. It's not real, and it's really important they distinguish it from reality and should not have it replace relationships in your actual life.\u201d",

      "\u2014 Parents can set rules about AI use, just like they do for screen time and social media. Have discussions about when and how AI tools can and cannot be used. Many AI companions are designed for adult use and can mimic romantic, intimate and role-playing scenarios.",

      "Ken Beckley never went to Harvard, but he has been wearing a crimson Harvard cap in a show of solidarity. As he sees it, the Trump administration's attacks on the school echo a case of government overreach at his own alma mater, Indiana University.",
      "Beckley, a former head of the school's alumni association, rallied fellow graduates this spring in an unsuccessful effort to stop Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, from removing three alumni-elected members from Indiana University\u2019s Board of Trustees and handpicking their replacements.",
      "No government effort to influence a university \u2014 private or public \u2014 has gotten more attention than the clash at Harvard, where the Trump administration has frozen billions of dollars in federal funding as it seeks a series of policy changes. But far beyond the Ivy League, Republican officials are targeting public universities in several states with efforts seeking similar ends.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s happened nationally is now affecting Indiana,\u201d said Beckley, who bought Harvard caps in bulk and passes them out to friends.",
      "Officials in conservative states took aim at higher education before President Donald Trump began his second term, driven in part by the belief that colleges are out of touch \u2014 too liberal and loading up students with too much debt. The first efforts focused on critical race theory, an academic framework centered on the idea that racism is embedded in the nation\u2019s institutions, and then on diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",

      "\u201cI hope that Butler will uphold the standards they were founded on,\u201d said Edyn Curry, president of Butler\u2019s Black Student Union.",
      "In Florida, the state university system board in June rejected longtime academic Santa Ono for the presidency at the University of Florida, despite a unanimous vote of approval by the school's own Board of Trustees. The unprecedented reversal followed criticism from conservatives about Ono's past support for DEI programs.",
      "That followed the conservative makeover of New College of Florida, a small liberal arts school once known as the state\u2019s most progressive. After Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed a group of conservatives to its governing board, many faculty left, including Amy Reid, who now manages a team focused on higher education at the free-expression group PEN America.",

      "The testimony of U.S. President Donald Trump's pick for ambassador to Buenos Aires has caused an uproar in Argentina",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s choice for ambassador to Buenos Aires sparked a storm Wednesday over his remarks that Argentina's powerful ex-president should face justice in cases in which she was never convicted and his pledges to use his posting as a bulwark against China.",
      "Opposition politicians in Argentina accused Peter Lamelas, Trump\u2019s nominee for ambassador to the second-biggest South American country, of violating diplomatic conventions, interfering in Argentine domestic affairs and meddling in judicial matters.",
      "Argentine media went into fifth gear with their coverage of Lamelas. Lawmakers introduced a bill in Congress rejecting his remarks as \u201can unacceptable interference in matters of national sovereignty.\u201d Trade unions planned a mass protest for Thursday outside the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires.",
      "The Cuban-born Lamelas, a physician, founder of a chain of urgent care clinics in Florida and longtime Trump donor, would otherwise be stepping into the role at a time when the relationship between Argentina and the United States is at its strongest in recent memory.",
      "Lamelas spoke on Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on his nomination.",
      "He said he would support Trump\u2019s ally, right-wing Argentine President Javier Milei, in ensuring that the country's former president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner \u2014 now serving a six-year sentence on corruption charges under house arrest \u2014 gets the \u201cthe justice that she well deserves\" in cases unrelated to her current sentence.",
      "He also claimed her house arrest was a result of \u201cpolitical favoritism,\u201d although it is common practice in Argentina for those convicted over the age of 70.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez, the most prominent figure in Argentina\u2019s left-leaning Peronist opposition movement, which holds a majority in Congress, did not mince words when she posted her reaction.",
      "\u201cThe only thing he didn\u2019t say was that he\u2019d appoint the courts himself,\u201d she said. Referencing scandals roiling the U.S., such including the investigation of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, she added: \u201cThey should clean their own house before commenting on ours.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate comment on the hearing from libertarian Milei, elected in 2023 on a wave of public outrage over the failed economic policies of Fern\u00e1ndez and other left-leaning populist predecessors.",
      "Milei has repeatedly praised Trump and replicated his policies \u2014 including by following the U.S. in pulling Argentina from The World Health Organization \u2014 and recently dined and posed for friendly photos with Lamelas at Trump\u2019s opulent Mar-a-Lago club.",
      "\u201cLAMELAS GO HOME,\u201d wrote Axel Kicillof, the governor of Buenos Aires, Argentina\u2019s most populous province, on X.",
      "\u201cLamelas\u2019 statements evoke the darkest times of United States interference in the democratic life of our region,\u201d he added.",

      "While several people, including a former federal judge and a former head of the intelligence services, have been convicted for helping to stymie the investigation into the attack, Fern\u00e1ndez has yet to stand trial on cover-up charges. She denies the allegations.",
      "In his testimony, Lamelas contended that Fern\u00e1ndez was \u201cdefinitely involved in the cover-up,\" without elaborating or saying why he believes this.",

      "Fern\u00e1ndez has not been formally accused or charged in connection with Nisman\u2019s death. An early investigation stated that Nisman committed suicide, but a later report showed that it was a homicide. The case has not been resolved.",
      "In another part of his testimony, Lamelas expressed concern over China\u2019s growing influence in Argentina, citing that the governors of Argentina\u2019s 23 provinces had the autonomy to negotiate \u201cwith external forces, with the Chinese or others, to come in and do projects in those particular provinces.\"",
      "\u201cThat may also lend toward corruption,\u201d he added. \u201cMy role is to get out into the countryside and make sure that we weed out corruption.\"",

      "The former Fleetwood Mac bandmates shared a pair of cryptic messages across their Instagram accounts last week which combined to read, \"And if you go forward\u2026 I'll meet you there\" \u2014 lyrics from \"Frozen Love,\" a song off the duo's fabled 1973 album. Social media lit up with discussion of a possible reunion, seven years after Buckingham was fired from Fleetwood Mac.",
      "On Wednesday, Nicks and Buckingham jointly posted a video of a billboard advertising the album's reissue going up in Los Angeles, announcing in the post's caption that the first single from the release, a newly remastered edition of \"Crying In The Night,\" was available now to stream.",
      "Nicks and Buckingham released \"Buckingham Nicks\" shortly before joining Fleetwood Mac in 1974. It was a commercial failure, resulting in their label, Polydor Records, dropping the pair from their contract. The album's last official release was a 1981 vinyl pressing from Polydor, according to Discogs, but the record has never been available on CD or digital, although bootlegs have surfaced over the years.",
      "Now, premium vinyl record producer Rhino High Fidelity is gearing up to release the full album on Sept. 19, alongside fresh liner notes from music journalist David Fricke, including interviews with both Buckingham and Nicks.",
      "\"[We] knew what we had as a duo, two songwriters that sang really well together. And it was a very natural thing, from the beginning.\" Nicks is quoted as saying in a Rhino press release. Buckingham said the album \"stands up in a way you hope it would, by these two kids who were pretty young to be doing that work.\"",
      "The remastered album is now available to pre-order in a standard edition and a deluxe edition, which includes two 7-inch singles, \"Crying In The Night\" and \"Don't Let Me Down Again.\" The standard edition is limited to 5,000 copies, while the singles are numbered to 2,000.",
      "Rumors of a possible \"Buckingham Nicks\" reissue have percolated for years. Back in 2011, Buckingham told Rolling Stone that the album has \"been a victim of inertia. It's funny, I spent a lot of time with Stevie this year when she was finishing her album and we were getting along great. We have every intention of putting that album back out and possibly even doing something along with it, but I can't put any specifics on that.\"",

A year earlier, the rock star postponed all of his 2019 performances after falling at his home in Los Angeles, which aggravated injuries from a 2003 all-terrain vehicle accident. He announced in 2023 that he would retire from touring.",
      "\"Ozzy was someone who lived hard, rocked hard and retired over and over again, starting, I think, first in the '90s,\" Joe Levy, a contributor for Rolling Stone magazine, told CBS News on Tuesday following news of Osbourne's death. \"He retired at least two times, kept coming back, and the fact that his Parkinson's diagnosis kept him from performing made it all the more amazing that just two weeks ago, he took the stage for what absolutely would be the final time.\"",
      "Either clad in black or bare-chested, the singer was often the target of parents' groups for his imagery and once caused an uproar for biting the head off a bat. Later, he would reveal himself to be a doddering and sweet father on the reality TV show \"The Osbournes.\"",
      "The Big Bang of heavy metal",
      "Black Sabbath's 1969 self-titled debut LP has been likened to the Big Bang of heavy metal. It came during the height of the Vietnam War and crashed the hippie party, dripping menace and foreboding. The cover of the record was of a spooky figure against a stark landscape. The music was loud, dense and angry, and marked a shift in rock 'n' roll.",
      "The band's second album, \"Paranoid,\" included such classic metal tunes as \"War Pigs,\" \"Iron Man\" and \"Fairies Wear Boots.\" The song \"Paranoid\" only reached No. 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 but became in many ways the band's signature song. Both albums were voted among the top 10 greatest heavy metal albums of all time by readers of Rolling Stone magazine.",
      "\"Black Sabbath are the Beatles of heavy metal. Anybody who's serious about metal will tell you it all comes down to Sabbath,\" Dave Navarro of the band Jane's Addiction wrote in a 2010 tribute in Rolling Stone. \"There's a direct line you can draw back from today's metal, through Eighties bands like Iron Maiden, back to Sabbath.\"",
      "Sabbath fired Osbourne in 1979 for his legendary excesses, like showing up late for rehearsals and missing gigs. \"We knew we didn't really have a choice but to sack him because he was just so out of control. But we were all very down about the situation,\" wrote bassist Terry \"Geezer\" Butler in his memoir, \"Into the Void.\"",
      "Osbourne reemerged the next year as a solo artist with \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and the following year's \"Diary of a Madman,\" both hard rock classics that went multi-platinum and spawned enduring favorites such as \"Crazy Train,\" \"Goodbye to Romance,\" \"Flying High Again\" and \"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll.\" Osbourne was twice inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 once with Sabbath in 2006 and again in 2024 as a solo artist.",

      "Metallica, Guns N Roses, Slayer, Tool, Pantera, Gojira, Alice in Chains, Lamb of God, Halestorm, Anthrax, Rival Sons and Mastodon did sets. Tom Morello, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, Billy Corgan, Ronnie Wood, Travis Barker, Sammy Hagar, Andrew Watt, Yungblud, Korn's Jonathan Davis, Nuno Bettencourt, Chad Smith and Vernon Reid made appearances. Actor Jason Momoa was the host for the festivities.",

      "Outlandish exploits and a classic look",
      "Osbourne embodied the excesses of metal. His outlandish exploits included relieving himself on the Alamo, snorting a line of ants off a sidewalk and, most memorably, biting the head off a live bat that a fan threw onstage during a 1981 concert. (He said he thought it was rubber.)",
      "In a statement posted to its Facebook page Tuesday, the Alamo said it was \"saddened to hear\" of Osbourne's death.",
      "\"His relationship with the Alamo was marked initially by a deeply disrespectful incident in 1982,\" the statement reads. \"This act profoundly and rightfully upset many who hold this site sacred. However, redemption and reconciliation eventually became part of his history as well. In 1992, Ozzy personally apologized to then-Mayor Nelson Wolff and expressed genuine remorse for his actions. Decades later, in 2015, he revisited the Alamo grounds to learn and appreciate the site's profound history, openly demonstrating humility and understanding.\"",
      "Osbourne was sued in 1987 by parents of a 19-year-old teen who died by suicide while listening to his song \"Suicide Solution.\" The lawsuit was dismissed. Osbourne said the song was really about the dangers of alcohol, which caused the death of his friend Bon Scott, lead singer of AC/DC.",
      "Then-Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York claimed in 1990 that Osbourne's songs led to demonic possession and even suicide. \"You are ignorant about the true meaning of my songs,\" the singer wrote back. \"You have also insulted the intelligence of rock fans all over the world.\"",
      "Audiences at Osbourne shows could be mooned or spit on by the singer. They would often be hectored to scream along with the song, but the Satan-invoking Osbourne would usually send the crowds home with their ears ringing and a hearty \"God bless!\"",
      "He started an annual tour \u2014 Ozzfest \u2014   in 1996 after he was rejected from the lineup of what was then the top touring music festival, Lollapalooza. Ozzfest has gone on to host such bands as Slipknot, Tool, Megadeth, Rob Zombie, System of a Down, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park.",
      "Osbourne's look changed little over his life. He wore his long hair flat, heavy black eye makeup and round glasses, often wearing a cross around his neck. In 2013, he reunited with Black Sabbath for the dour, raw \"13,\" which reached No. 1 on the U.K. Albums Chart and peaked at No. 86 on the U.S. Billboard 200. In 2019, he had a Top 10 hit when featured on Post Malone's \"Take What You Want,\" Osbourne's first song in the Top 10 since 1989.",
      "In 2020, he released the album \"Ordinary Man,\" which had as its title song a duet with Elton John. \"I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky/And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man,\" he sang. In 2022, he landed his first career back-to-back No. 1 rock radio singles from his album \"Patient Number 9,\" which featured collaborations with Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Mike McCready, Chad Smith, Robert Trujillo and Duff McKagan. It earned four Grammy nominations.",
      "At the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 2024, Jack Black called him \"greatest frontman in the history of rock and roll\" and \"the Jack Nicholson of rock.\" Osbourne thanked his fans, his guitarist Randy Rhoads and his longtime wife, Sharon.",
      "The beginnings of Black Sabbath",
      "John Michael Osbourne was raised in the gritty city of Birmingham, England. Kids in school nicknamed him Ozzy, short for his surname. As a boy, he loved the Four Seasons, Chuck Berry and Little Richard. The Beatles made a huge impression.",
      "\"They came from Liverpool, which was approximately 60 miles north of where I come from,\" he told Billboard. \"So all of a sudden it was in my grasp, but I never thought it would be as successful as it became.\"",
      "In the late 1960s, Osbourne had teamed up with Butler, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward as the Polka Tulk Blues Band. They decided to rename the band Earth, but found to their dismay there was another band with that name. So they changed the name to the American title of the classic Italian horror movie \"I Tre Volti Della Paura,\" starring Boris Karloff: Black Sabbath.",
      "Once they found their sludgy, ominous groove, the band was productive, putting out their self-titled debut and \"Paranoid\" in 1970, \"Master of Reality\" in 1971, \"Vol. 4\" in 1972 and \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" in 1973.",
      "The music was all about industrial guitar riffs and disorienting changes in time signatures, along with lyrics that spoke of alienation and doom. \"People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time,\" Osbourne sang in one song. \"All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy/Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify.\"",
      "The Guardian newspaper in 2009 said the band \"introduced working-class anger, stoner sludge grooves and witchy horror-rock to flower power. Black Sabbath confronted the empty platitudes of the 1960s and, along with Altamont and Charles Manson, almost certainly helped kill off the hippy counterculture.\"",
      "After Sabbath, Osbourne had an uncanny knack for calling some of the most creative young guitarists to his side. When he went solo, he hired the brilliant innovator Rhoads, who played on two of Osbourne's finest solo albums, \"Blizzard of Ozz\" and \"Diary of a Madman.\" Rhoads was killed in a freak plane accident in 1982; Osbourne released the live album \"Tribute\" in 1987 in his memory.",
      "Osbourne then signed Jake E. Lee, who lent his talents to the platinum albums \"Bark at the Moon\" and \"The Ultimate Sin.\" Hotshot Zakk Wylde joined Osbourne's band for \"No Rest for the Wicked\" and the multiplatinum \"No More Tears.\"",
      "\"They come along, they sprout wings, they blossom, and they fly off,\" Osbourne said of his players in 1995 to The Associated Press. \"But I have to move on. To get a new player now and again boosts me on.\"",
      "Music world reacts to Osbourne's death",
      "Several musicians and celebrities, including Osbourne's Black Sabbath bandmates, took to social media to respond Tuesday to the news of his death.",
      "\"I just can't believe it! My dear dear friend Ozzy has passed away only weeks after our show at Villa Park,\" Black Sabbath guitarist and band co-founder Tony Iommi\u00a0wrote on X, referring to the farewell show earlier this month. \"It's just such heartbreaking news that I can't really find the words, there won't ever be another like him. Geezer, Bill and myself have lost our brother. My thoughts go out to Sharon and all the Osbourne family. Rest in peace Oz.\"",
      "Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler wrote on X: \"Goodbye dear friend - thanks for all those years - we had some great fun. 4 kids from Aston- who'd have thought, eh? So glad we got to do it one last time, back in Aston. Love you.\"",
      "On Instagram, Elton John described Osbourne as a \"dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods \u2014 a true legend. He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met. I will miss him dearly. To Sharon and the family, I send my condolences and love.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, who took part in Osbourne's farewell concert, wrote on X that he was \"so very sad to hear of the death of Ozzy Osbourne. What a lovely goodbye concert he had at Back To The Beginning in Birmingham.\"",
      "Kiss co-founder Gene Simmons called Osbourne a \"giant\" who was \"Admired and loved by millions of fans worldwide. Prayers and condolences go out to the Osborne family.\"",
      "Actor Jason Momoa, who hosted the farewell show, wrote on Instagram, \"Love you @ozzyosbourne All my aloha @sharonosbourne and ohana. So grateful. RIP.\"",
      "Mike McCready, lead guitarist and founding member of Pearl Jam, wrote on X that he discovered Black Sabbath's music in high school.",
      "\"'War Pigs' was terrifying and mesmerizing at the same time,\" McCready wrote. \"It was Ozzy's voice that took me away to a dark universe. A great escape. Then when The 'Blizzard of Ozz' record came out I was instantly a fan. Randy Rhoads was an influence on me to play lead guitar. Luckily I got to play on the song 'Immortal' on the last record. Thanks for the music, Ozzy it makes our journey in life better.\"",
      "Courting controversy \u2014 and wholesomeness",
      "Whomever he was playing with, Osbourne wasn't likely to back down from controversy. He had the last laugh when the TV evangelist the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart in 1986 lambasted various rock groups and rock magazines as \"the new pornography,\" prompting some retailers to pull Osbourne's album.",
      "When Swaggart later was caught with a sex worker in 1988, Osbourne put out the song \"Miracle Man\" about his foe: \"Miracle man got busted/miracle man got busted,\" he sang. \"Today I saw a Miracle Man, on TV cryin'/Such a hypocritical man, born again, dying.\"",
      "Much later, a whole new Osbourne would be revealed when \"The Osbournes,\" which ran on MTV from 2002-2005, showed this one-time self-proclaimed madman drinking Diet Cokes as he struggled to find the History Channel on his new satellite television or warning his kids not to smoke or drink before they embarked on a night on the town.",
      "Later, he and his son Jack toured America on the travel show \"Ozzy & Jack's World Detour,\" where the pair visited such places as Mount Rushmore and the Space Center Houston. Osbourne was honored in 2014 with the naming of a bat frog found in the Amazon that makes high-pitched, batlike calls. It was dubbed Dendropsophus ozzyi.",
      "He also met Queen Elizabeth II during her Golden Jubilee weekend. He was standing next to singer-actor Cliff Richard. \"She took one look at the two of us, said 'Oh, so this is what they call variety, is it?' then cracked up laughing. I honestly thought that Sharon had slipped some acid into my cornflakes that morning,\" he wrote in \"I Am Ozzy.\"",
      "Thelma Riley and Osbourne married in 1971; Osbourne adopted her son Elliot Kingsley, and they had two more children, Jessica and Louis. Osbourne later met Sharon, who became her own celebrity persona, when she was running her father's Los Angeles office. Her father was Don Arden, a top concert promoter and artist manager. She went to Osbourne's hotel in Los Angeles to collect money, which Osbourne had spent on drugs.",
      "\"She says she'll come back in three days and I'd better have it. I'd always fancied her and I thought, 'Ah, she's coming back! Maybe I have a chance.' I had pizza hanging from my hair, cigarette ashes on my shirt,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2000. They married in 1982, had three children \u2014 Kelly, Aimee and Jack \u2014 and endured periodic separations and reconciliations.",
      "He is survived by Sharon, and his children.",

      "Warner drowned Sunday afternoon in Cocles de Lim\u00f3n, on Costa Rica's Caribbean coast, the country's Judicial Investigation Department said. He appeared to have been pulled out to sea by a current.",
      "Warner was assisted by people who were at the beach, but he was declared dead by the staff of the Costa Rican Red Cross, the department said. An autopsy determined his cause of death to be asphyxiation by submersion.",
      "In a statement Monday, the Costa Rican Red Cross said it was alerted to a water accident on Sunday at 2:10 p.m. local time, and it dispatched three ambulances.",
      "The Red Cross said two adult men were treated on-site and one was transferred to a local clinic in critical condition. They tried to resuscitate Warner, but he didn't show vital signs and was declared dead. Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Department said the other person involved in the incident had \"entered the sea to try to help Mr. Warner.\"",
      "Warner starred as Theo Huxtable on \"The Cosby Show\" from 1984 to 1992. His performance earned him an Emmy nomination for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series in 1986.",
      "In 2023, Warner told CBS Pittsburgh that being part of \"The Cosby Show\" was an \"awesome\" experience.",
      "\"That show had such an impact on the culture here in America but also a global impact on how Black people saw ourselves globally and how the rest of the world saw us,\" he said. \"So I'm proud to have been part of that legacy and it's been a great ride ever since.\"",
      "Warner said in a 2015 interview with The Associated Press that he was saddened that the show's legacy was \"tarnished\" by \"Cosby Show\" patriarch Bill Cosby, who was\u00a0accused of sexual assault by multiple women. Cosby's\u00a0conviction in a Pennsylvania case\u00a0was later overturned.",
      "Warner went on to star in other TV shows, including \"Malcolm & Eddie\" (1996-2000), \"Reed Between the Lines\" (2011-2015) and \"The Resident\" (2018-2023). He also voiced The Producer on \"The Magic School Bus\" (1994-1997). He made his feature film debut in \"Drop Zone\" in 1994.",
      "Warner also directed episodes of several TV shows, including \"The Cosby Show,\" \"All That,\" \"Keenan & Kel\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" according to his biography on his website.",
      "Most recently, he appeared in a few episodes of \"Alert: Missing Persons Unit\" and was hosting the podcast \"Not All Hood,\" looking at the different experiences of Black Americans.",
      "Warner was also a poet and a musician. He won a Grammy for best traditional R&B performance in 2015 for his part in a cover of Stevie Wonder's \"Jesus Children of America,\" and was nominated for another Grammy for best spoken word poetry.",
      "Fellow poet and author Kevin Powell, who was a friend of Warner's, described him as a devoted husband and father who was humble, kind and supportive of other people.",
      "\"You would have never known he was a major child star,\" Powell said in an interview Monday with CBS News. \"He was never someone who was into the celebrity of it. He knew what he was. He knew, you know, that he was America's son. He literally was America's son as the only male child on that historic show, 'The Cosby Show.'\"",
      "Powell said he was struck by the emotional reactions from fans on social media. \"It's someone you came of age with,\" he said of Warner.",
      "Powell recalled publishing a poem Warner wrote in a special issue of the magazine \"African Voices\" for the 50th anniversary of hip-hop in 2023.",
      "Warner was a lifelong hip-hop fan, Powell said, but he also was \"concerned about a lot of the images that were being put out there.\"",
      "\"So that became kind of his thing in the last few years, like how are we representing ourselves as a community, as a people, with the art that we're creating?\" he said. \"That sticks with me because he was someone who understood he had a huge platform. He had a famous name and people would pay attention if he said certain things. ... That's who Malcolm-Jamal was.\"",
      "The news of Warner's death was \"devastating,\" a spokesperson for Bill Cosby said. The spokesperson, Andrew Wyatt, said Cosby compared it to learning of the death of his son Ennis, who was shot and killed in a robbery in 1997. \"It felt the same way,\" Wyatt said.",

    "story": [
      "Restaurateur Keith McNally hates New Year's Eve \u2013 he doesn't like being told to have a good time. \"I don't like to be forced to enjoy myself,\" he said.",
      "The \"least hospitable man in hospitality,\" as he calls himself, is not a big smiler, either. \"Inside,\" he explained.",
      "It doesn't seem to have hurt. Over 40 years, he's opened some of New York City's most popular restaurants, among them The Odeon, Balthazar, and Pastis \u2013 institutions almost as well-known as some of the bold-face names that frequent them. But McNally himself has never been much of a publicity hound, even less so after suffering a stroke in 2016. \"Naturally I'm a bit embarrassed to be on TV talking like this\u2014who wouldn't be?\" he said. \"But it's good for me to do it, because it gets me free of my embarrassment. Actually, I'm embarrassed talking about embarrassment!\"",
      "But the British-born McNally has largely overcome his embarrassment in a new memoir, \"I Regret Almost Everything.\" \u00a0\"The drawback for me with most memoirs [is], if you're not embarrassed by what you write, you've probably not spoken the truth,\" he said. \"If you don't cringe over every word, it's not the truth.\"",
      "The hardest part to write, he said, was about his suicide attempt, \"because my kids. I didn't want to leave them at all.\"",
      "That suicide attempt was two years after his stroke. He was found by his younger son, George. \"He was supposed to not find me,\" McNally said. \"Like most teenagers he would sleep until noon. But that day he woke up early, at 8:00 o'clock.\"",
      "\"You expected him to be sleeping later, he woke up early, he saw you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, the bastard just woke up early and saved my life!\" he laughed.",
      "McNally might joke about it now, but the father of five was suffering with an immobile right arm (he was right-handed), back pain, and aphasia (which causes his slurred speech), and his second marriage was falling apart. But as he writes, some sobering words from a doctor made him reflect: \"He said that children who lose a parent to suicide were far more likely to kill themselves than the children of parents who don't. That stopped me in my tracks.\"",
      "Because he had such trouble communicating verbally after his stroke, McNally began using social media. \"I was so embarrassed by my speech and the way I looked, I didn't go to my restaurants for one year,\" he said. \"I was ashamed. But eventually I realized, nothing to be ashamed about. So, not only did I admit it wasn't a bad thing, but I went in on Instagram.\"",
      "McNally went viral in 2022 with a post criticizing former late-night host James Corden for allegedly being rude to the waitstaff at Balthazar. But now, McNally confesses in his book he isn't so sure calling out Corden was fair. He wrote: \"For someone who's hyperconscious of humiliation since suffering a stroke, it now seems monstrous that I didn't consider the humiliation I was subjecting Corden to. I felt like I'd hit the jackpot of a slot machine and thousands of gold coins were spilling out in front of me. That night I ended up with over 90,000 followers. I was intoxicated with self-righteousness.\"",
      "\"Uh-huh, it's true,\" McNally said. \"But afterwards, I felt really bad.\"",
      "Corden later apologized. But the 73-year-old McNally has continued creating a stir online. Take this recent post he wrote about his friend, ABC News' Diane Sawyer, describing a weeklong affair the two had in the 1970s. The story made news \u2026 except that it was completely made up.",
      "I said, \"Some people say, 'Listen, Keith, you know, it's really not cool for you to be sharing this.' And so, did you enjoy that back-and-forth with them?\"",
      "\"Yes. Yeah, I'm afraid, I did, yeah,\" he laughed.",
      "\"And I wonder, do you think that the stroke \u2013 I don't know, is that, does that \u2026\"",
      "\"Say what you think,\" said McNally.",
      "\"Well, is it that you feel a little trapped inside of yourself?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"I've always been a little like this inside. But since my stroke, and now on the outside.\"",
      "McNally grew up in the East End of London, one of four children born to Jack, a dockworker, and Joyce, a house and office cleaner. The family had little money. \"I got angry inside at my parents,\" he said, \"because we had no books in the house, no pictures on the walls. But they couldn't help it. They were working class who grew up with nothing.\"",
      "McNally says he didn't eat in a restaurant until he was 17. \"Most of the time, when we were on a holiday, we would go to the restaurant, they would look the prices outside, and then she'd go, 'Not for us.'\"",
      "And yet, when McNally moved to New York City in 1975 as an aspiring filmmaker, he made ends meet by working in restaurants. \"I didn't eat asparagus until I came here,\" he said. \"And the next day, I went to the doctor because the smell of my \u2026\"",
      "\"That was so pungent from eating the asparagus?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, I thought I was sick! So, I went to the doctor. He said, 'What'd you eat last night?'\" McNally laughed.",
      "\"You know what? You gotta put that in the paperback,\" I said.",
      "In 1980, McNally opened his own restaurant, The Odeon, in the neighborhood of Tribeca, in what had been a no-man's land.

      "PepsiCo is introducing a new prebiotic soda this fall geared toward health-conscious customers.",
      "The food and beverage company said Monday that the new product is designed to meet changing consumer needs and offer \"more functional ingredients.\" The new drink, which will come in cola and cherry vanilla flavors, will contain five grams of cane sugar, three grams of prebiotic fiber and no artificial sweeteners, while a single serving will have 30 calories, according to Pepsi.",
      "\"Pepsi Prebiotic Cola represents the next leap forward in giving consumers choice, optionality and functional ingredients in their cola experience, without sacrificing the iconic Pepsi taste we're known for delivering,\" Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Beverages U.S., said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The new cola will be available for purchase online this fall and in stores next year, Pepsi said.",
      "The product announcement comes only months after Pepsi\u00a0acquired Poppi, which is marketed as a healthier alternative for soda lovers, for nearly $2 billion. The low-calorie soda contains a mix of prebiotics, fruit juice and apple cider.",
      "The prebiotic and probiotic food and drink sector has grown quickly in recent years as consumers increasingly seek out gut-healthy alternatives to soda that contain less sugar.\u00a0According\u00a0to consulting firm Future Market Insights, the prebiotic soda market was valued at $262 million in 2024.

I don't like anything that's artificial, so could we straighten that out, please? We should change the name. I actually mean that. I don't like the name artificial anything. Because it's not artificial, it's genius. It's pure genius.\"",

      "\"The daunting power of AI is really, it's not going to be a reason for retreat from this new frontier,\" Mr. Trump said. \"On the contrary, it is the more reason we must ensure it is pioneered first and best.\"",
      "AI is like a \"beautiful baby that's born,\" he said of the technology's current state.",

      "Thousands of data centers are scattered around the U.S. Most are connected to the nation's power grid and rely on massive amounts of electricity to operate. The proliferation of AI data centers has been cited as one of the drivers of burgeoning energy costs.",
      "The number of data centers is only expected to grow as technology companies \u2014 including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI \u2014 ramp up construction to meet the nation's growing energy demand stemming from the emergence of AI.",
      "In addition to investments in data centers, the new White House plan also focuses on \"expediting and modernizing programs\" for semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs, and updating the nation's electric grid to support the enormous energy demands of AI supercomputing, Kratsios said.",
      "Another focus will be on reining in what White House officials have called an \"ideological bias\" in chatbots. This is something Sacks, a former PayPal executive, has highlighted after a 2024 incident in which Google's AI image generator created pictures of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show one of the countries Founding Fathers.",
      "\"We believe that AI systems should be free of ideological bias and not be designed to pursue socially engineered agendas,\" Sacks said on Wednesday. \"And so we have a number of proposals there on how to make sure that AI remains truth-seeking and trustworthy.\"",
      "To that end, Kratsios said the plan will update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with AI developers whose systems \"allow free speech expression to flourish.\"",
      "The plan also seeks to maintain the U.S.' edge in the global race for AI dominance as it competes with countries like China, which has moved quickly to expand its AI capabilities. A senior White House official said the report supports export controls to make sure \"that our most advanced technology doesn't get into the hands of [other] countries.\"",
      "As part of its efforts, the White House also seeks to remove what it refers to as \u00a0\"onerous regulation\" that the Trump administration says is hindering AI innovation. The official added that the plan calls for the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion and climate funding requirements from the Biden administration's CHIPS Act.",

    "summary": "The fallout from Elon Musk's dive into politics a year ago is still weighing on Tesla sales, analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "The fallout from Elon Musk's plunge into politics a year ago is still hammering electric vehicle-maker Tesla, as both sales and profits dropped sharply again in the latest quarter.",
      "Tesla revenue dropped 12%, and profits slumped 16% in the three months through June as buyers continued to steer clear, and in some cases, turn to more affordable competitors' offerings.",
      "\"The perception of Elon Musk, its chief executive, has rubbed the sheen right out of what once was a darling and soaring automotive brand,\" Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said in a research note, in which he called Tesla \"a toxic brand that is inseparable from its leader.\"",
      "Quarterly profits at the electric vehicle, battery and robotics company fell to $1.17 billion, or $0.33 a share, from $1.4 billion, or $0.40 a share, dropping for a third straight quarter. On an adjusted basis, the company said it earned $0.40, in line with Wall Street analysts' estimates.",
      "Revenue fell from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion in the April through June period, slightly beating Wall Street's forecast.",
      "Tesla shares were little changed in after-hours trading as investors awaited Musk's comments on the company's earnings call.",
      "Betting on robotaxis",
      "Musk, who helped elect President Donald Trump with a massive campaign donation and then headed his DOGE cost-cutting program, has pinned the future of the company squarely on its autonomous Robotaxi venture, which launched in Austin, Texas last month. It's expected to take years, though, before Musk's focus on robotaxis and humanoid robots turns a profit or the company.",
      "\"We are at a 'positive crossroads' in the Tesla story: Musk is laser focused as CEO, Robotaxi/autonomous expansion has begun, demand stabilization has begun especially in China, and Tesla is about to embark on an aggressive AI focused strategy that we believe will include owning a significant piece of xAI,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note. \"While near-term and this quarter the numbers are nothing to write home about, we believe investors are instead focused on the AI future at Tesla with a motivated Musk back driving Tesla's future.\"",
      "Foreign EV buyers have also turned away from Tesla toward competitors' vehicles, research shows. Musk alienated potential Tesla customers in Great Britain, France, Germany and elsewhere through his political activities. Rival electric vehicle makers such as China's BYD and German's Volkswagen, meanwhile, have gained market share.",
      "Tesla faces other headwinds, too. The new federal budget just passed by Congress eliminates a $7,500 credit for EV buyers. It also wipes out penalties for car makers that exceed carbon emission standards. That threatens Tesla's business of selling its \"carbon credits\" to traditional car companies that regularly fall short of emission standards.",
      "Tesla generated $439 million from credit sales, down sharply from $890 million a year ago.",

    "summary": "This week's U.S. trade agreement with Japan could provide a framework for a pact with the European Union, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and the European Union are racing to clinch a trade deal\u00a0by the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, with economists warning that a sharp hike in tariffs could raise costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "As the clock ticks down, a series of pacts with other U.S. trading partners in recent days have raised hopes of avoiding a potentially damaging trade war with Europe, with experts saying a\u00a0deal with Japan announced on Tuesday could serve as a template for a deal with the EU.",
      "The U.S. has also recently announced the outlines of trade deals with China, Indonesia, the Philippines and U.K., though with many details still remaining to be finalized.",
      "For consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, much is riding on the outcome of the trade talks. Absent a deal, President Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tax. In preparing possible countermeasures, the European Commission has said it would impose tariffs on more than $100 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Aug. 7, AFP reported on Wednesday.",
      "Negotiations are ongoing and a U.S.-EU trade war could yet be avoided. Citing EU diplomats, AFP also said officials with the trading block could be open to a 15% U.S. tariff rate, with potential carveouts for key sectors, according to the wire service.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the status of talks with the EU, including whether the Trump administration expects to reach a trade deal by the Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday struck a trade deal with Tokyo that calls for a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, the deal calls for Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including cars and certain farm products.",
      "The 15% tariff rate on Japanese goods is five percentage points higher than a baseline tariff the Trump administration imposed on all foreign imports on April 2. But it is lower than the 25% he threatened against Japan earlier this month and the 24% duties his administration\u00a0proposed\u00a0in early April.",
      "\"The Japan deal solidifies this pattern we've seen thus far, which is some market access relief, a commitment to purchase U.S. goods, and a slightly lower, but above the universal baseline, tariff level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a public policy research firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The Japan deal certainly provides a framework of what [Mr. Trump] looking for,\" Jacquez said. \"It's about accepting a baseline tariff at or above 10%, and then making purchase commitments.\"",
      "Key catalysts for trade deals",
      "A key element of Mr. Trump's trade deals has been a commitment by other nations to invest in the U.S. The president has defended tariffs as a way to revive the country's domestic manufacturing base and make American exports more competitive, as well as to generate additional federal revenue.",
      "\"We are learning that the promise of greater investment into the U.S. works well with the administration,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said. \"The promise to invest $550 billion was a big part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal. It was a key catalyst to securing a deal.\"",
      "The EU, whose member states have a combined gross domestic product of $20 trillion, could likely commit to a large investment in the U.S. because it could span a number of years and focus on key sectors, such as technology, energy or artificial intelligence, Daco added.",
      "Additional commitments by the EU to purchase American-made goods and to lower trade barriers to U.S. exports could also help close a deal, he said. \"Those don't cost much, and they're an easy bargaining chip to put forward.\"",
      "Risk of higher prices",
      "Although a 15% baseline U.S. tariff on EU imports would represent a retrenchment from Mr. Trump's earlier threats, it would still drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, according to Daco.",
      "\"While it may seem like a great deal, it's still much higher than the tariffs that the U.S. was imposing at the end of 2024,\" he noted. \"So there would still be a positive inflation shock because of higher tariffs. There would also be demand erosion coming from reduced business investment, hiring,and reduced consumer spending as a result of these higher tariffs.\"",
      "Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports is around 15%, according to his analysis. If Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs go into effect, that rate would rise to more than 20%. If the EU agrees to a 15% tariff rate, however, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports from around the world would drop to 19.5%.",
      "\"That's still a significant increase in the average rate,\" Daco said. \"It's a lot higher than the 2.5% where we started the year.\"",
      "Because most U.S. imports from the EU include industrial inputs like components, raw materials and machinery, any added costs would take tie to work their way through the supply chain, according to Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"It would \u00a0affect manufacturing exports faster than it would affect American consumers, but it would raise prices all around,\" Young said.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 14:48:17 -0400",
    "summary": "The Education Department has temporarily paused loan forgiveness for an income-based repayment plan. Here are the details.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who are enrolled in a popular repayment plan are now in limbo, with the Department of Education saying it has temporarily paused forgiveness for borrowers in its income-based repayment plan, or IBR.",
      "Such plans offer a double benefit for borrowers by lowering a person's monthly loan repayment to reflect their income, while also promising to provide forgiveness after a number of years. Specifically, the government can cancel the balance of student loan after people have made payments for at least 20 years.",
      "About 40% of the roughly 33 million people repaying student loans were enrolled in one of the Education Department's four such repayment plans at the end of 2024, according to data from the National Student Loan Data System and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "But three of those programs had previously been halted by a court ruling, while forgiveness for the roughly 2 million people enrolled in the fourth \u2014 IBR \u2014 is now also paused.",
      "On Tuesday, Education Department deputy press secretary Ellen Keast told CBS MoneyWatch that the agency \"has temporarily paused discharges for IBR borrowers in order to comply with ongoing court injunctions regarding the Biden Administration's illegal attempts at student loan forgiveness.\"",
      "The court injunctions stem from 2024\u00a0lawsuits related to the Biden administration's flagship student loan repayment plan, called the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. That initiative, created to fix long-standing issues with the Education Department's previous income-based plans, proved popular with borrowers, with almost 8 million enrollees at the end of 2024, National Student Loan Data System data shows.",
      "Because the SAVE plan could count toward loan discharges in the IBR program, the Education Department is now temporarily halting forgiveness for enrollees in that plan. The Education Department said the loan discharges will resume at some point, but didn't provide a timeframe for when that might occur.",
      "What income-driven repayment plans are legally blocked?",
      "Student loan forgiveness under three of the federal government's income-driven plans \u2014 SAVE; Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR); and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) \u2014 is currently paused after a court ruled last summer that Congress exceeded its authority in approving those plans.",
      "The legal action last year called into question whether student loan forgiveness was authorized under the federal statute that governs those plans. But the IBR plan was created under a different authority.",
      "When will the Education Department start forgiving loans again?",
      "The Education Department didn't specify a timeframe in its statement to CBS MoneyWatch. It noted that the SAVE plan allowed forbearances \u2014 when loan payments are temporarily halted or reduced \u2014 to be counted toward loan forgiveness, but that the rule was halted by the court ruling.",
      "Because of the injunction, the Education Department said it needs to recalculate how many payments made by borrowers should contribute toward repayment.",
      "\"Legal IBR discharges will resume as soon as the Department is able to establish the correct payment count,\" said Keast of the Education Department.",
      "Should a borrower continue making IBR payments for now?",
      "Yes. Borrowers in the federal IBR plan are eligible to have their student loans canceled after making payments for at least 20 years. However, some people eligible for such forgiveness have yet to see their loans canceled. They should continue making those payments, and the Education Department will eventually refund them, according to the agency.",
      "\"For any borrower that makes a payment after the date of borrower eligibility, the Department will refund overpayments when the discharges resume,\" Keast said.",
      "Borrowers can also request forbearance from their loan servicer. In that case, interest would continue to accrue on any remaining balance.",

      "The Hershey Company on Tuesday confirmed media reports it is raising candy prices as it battles rising cocoa costs.",
      "The price change will be a \"low double-digit increase\" and affect products across the company's confection portfolio, according to a Hershey spokesperson. Founded in 1894, the Pennsylvania-based company owns over 90\u00a0brands including Hershey Kisses, KitKat, Reese's and York.",
      "\"This change is not related to tariffs or trade policies,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"It reflects the reality of rising ingredient costs including the unprecedented cost of cocoa.\"",
      "Price increases typically take around 90 days to take effect, although the timeframe varies by retailer, the spokesperson added.",
      "Global cocoa shortage",
      "Cocoa prices have skyrocketed in recent years due to a global cocoa shortage. The cost for the commodity was $8,402 in June, a 73% increase from five years ago, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which tracks food prices.",
      "The majority of the world's cocoa supply comes from Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which have faced heatwaves and heavy rain linked to climate change. These unfavorable weather conditions have led to diseases like Black pod rot, which kills cocoa crops. Chronic underinvestment in cocoa farms is another reason behind the spike in cocoa prices,\u00a0according to an article from J.P. Morgan Global Research.",
      "\"Cocoa is a market where the grower produces a very high-value good but receives a very low share of the actual value chain. As a result, replanting rates of diseased trees are low and West African yields have been more subject to weather impacts,\" Tracey Allen, an agricultural commodities strategist at J.P. Morgan, said in the article.",
      "In a May earnings call, Michele Buck, president of The Hershey Company, said the candy company would lean into products that are \"less Cocoa intensive\" as it navigates the inflation of cocoa prices. This is part of the company's vision to become a \"snacking powerhouse\" Buck said.",
      "\"We love our chocolate business and we want to continue to grow that,\" Buck said. \"But we also know that if we get into white spaces like sweets, better-for-you and salty, it adds incremental consumers and occasions,\" she added.",

      "Mr. Trump sent letters this month to about two dozen countries \u2014 including Japan \u2014 telling them to expect higher tariffs starting Aug. 1 unless they strike deals before then to resolve what the president views as unfair trade practices. The threats came near the end of a 90-day pause on most of the sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs Mr. Trump unveiled against dozens of countries on \"Liberation Day\" in April.",
      "The Trump administration has hoped the letters will lead to a blitz of trade deals in the coming weeks, before the higher tariff rates kick in at the start of August. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted Sunday\u00a0that the next two weeks will be \"for the record books.\"",
      "The letters have \"gotten these countries to the table, and they are going to open their markets or they're going to pay the tariff,\" Lutnick said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "When the dust settles, Lutnick said, smaller countries can expect to face a roughly 10% tariff \u2014 which is the baseline rate imposed by Mr. Trump in April \u2014 while larger countries will likely face higher tariffs.",

      "President Trump on Tuesday floated the possibility of eliminating the federal capital gains tax on home sales, in a move that would change the way real estate profits are taxed for the first time in 30 years.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested he is weighing supporting\u00a0legislation\u00a0introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia that would nix the existing capital gains tax on home sales. Greene called the tax \"an outdated, unfair burden\u2014especially in today's housing market, where values have skyrocketed.\"",
      "\"We're thinking about that,\" Mr. Trump responded to a reporter, when asked how important it is that the capital gains tax be eliminated in order to \"unleash\" the housing market. \"It would also unleash it just by lowering the interest rates,\" the president said, adding, \"If the fed would lower the rates we wouldn't even have to do that. But we are thinking about no tax on capital gains on houses.\"",
      "Currently, single-tax filers can exclude up to $250,000 in capital gains from sales of their primary homes from their taxable incomes under what's called the Section 121\u00a0exclusion. That amount rises to $500,000 for joint filers. Both amounts have remained fixed since 1997.",

      "According to Research from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the current federal policy on the capital gains tax on home sales is \"quietly distorting the housing market\" by \"locking in older homeowners, and strangling inventory just when America needs it most.\"",
      "\"Stay-put penalty\"",
      "A NAR study found that 34% of homeowners, or 29 million Americans, would exceed the $250,000 threshold were they to sell their homes, while 10%, or eight million Americans, would surpass the $500,000 threshold for joint filers.",
      "As a result, older homeowners are disincentivized to sell their homes, in what NAR researchers refer to as a \"stay-put penalty.\" For example, seniors who might otherwise consider moving closer to family, or downsizing, are staying in place \u2014 and keeping housing inventory tied up.",
      "\"This stagnation in housing turnover is rippling through the entire market, driving up costs and limiting opportunity \u2014 exactly the opposite of what public policy should be encouraging,\" Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer,\u00a0 said in a statement. \"And it grows worse each month.\"",
      "Critics say eliminating the tax would only benefit wealthy Americans who can afford to pay tax on gains from home sales that exceed the limit.",
      "Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS MoneyWatch that a lot of home sellers already benefit from the $250,000 exclusion limit, and that eliminating the capital gains tax altogether would primarily benefit wealthier Americans who own residences that have appreciated by more than $250,000, or $500,000 in the case of joint filers.",
      "\"It wouldn't really move the needle for a regular family, unless you have a home that's appreciated a lot,\" Berner told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If your home has appreciated by more than $1 million, there would be a benefit to removing the capital gains tax.\"",
      "Inventory release",
      "He also suspects abolishing the capital gains tax on home sales would release inventory onto the housing market.",
      "\"It could be a good thing for the market. In particular where inventory is constrained, it could benefit regular folks,\" Berner said.",
      "By contrast, eliminating the federal tax would also erase revenue paid to the government, and could spark increased interest from investors and speculators, which could also drive up home values. That would contribute to the nation's housing affordability problem, according to Berner.",
      "Nearly 27% of all homes sold in the first three months of the year were bought by investors \u2014 the highest share in at least five years, according to a report by real estate data provider BatchData.",

      "The official start of fall is still months away, but the season is just around the corner for Starbucks fans.",
      "The coffee chain's popular Pumpkin Spice Latte is set to return on Aug. 26, Starbucks announced Monday. Although that's a later release date than last year, the 2025 return of the PSL is still on the earlier side for the company, which traditionally had waited until September to bring back the seasonal drink, closer to the actual start of autumn, which falls on Sept. 22 this year.",
      "The popular menu item consists of espresso, milk, Pumpkin Spice Syrup and whipped cream, with pumpkin pie spice sprinkled on top. The coffee chain started adding real pumpkin to the drink in 2015.",
      "The return of the Pumpkin Spice Latte as well as Starbucks' new fall menu comes at a critical juncture for Starbucks, which is pulling all of the levers it can to lure customers back into its stores. After enjoying years of strong growth, the company's progress has stalled, with U.S. same-store sales slipping 2% last year.",
      "The return of the Pumpkin Spice Latte as well as new menu items are \"cultural touchstones that spark connection, nostalgia and excitement,\" said Starbucks global chief brand officer Tressie Leiberman in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Little did they know it would become their most popular seasonal beverage of all time. Since debuting over 20 years ago, the Pumpkin Spice Latte, also known by its initials PSL, has skyrocketed in popularity, with hundreds of millions of beverages sold.",
      "\"Nobody knew at the beginning what it would grow to be,\" Dukes\u00a0said in a story posted on the Starbucks website for the beverage's 20-year anniversary. \"Twenty years later, it's taken on a life of its own.\"",
      "Starbucks initially considered naming the drink the fall harvest latte, but changed it to the Pumpkin Spice Latte \"because the spices play a really important role in bringing out the flavors of pumpkin,\" Dukes said in a Starbucks post.",
      "The Starbucks-induced pumpkin craze led Merriam-Webster to add the \"pumpkin spice\" to the dictionary in 2022. It also prompted other chains like Dunkin' and McDonald's to introduce their own pumpkin-inspired beverages in 2007 and 2013, respectively.",

When the advocacy group for older Americans asked the same question in 2005, about half of retirees indicated a heavy reliance on their monthly checks.",

      "Wealth inequality is also a growing issue among retirees, with some white-collar workers heading into their golden years with hefty retirement savings thanks to corporate 401(k) programs with company matches. But about half of all private-sector workers lack access to corporate retirement accounts, creating hurdles for saving for retirement, a recent Pew Charitable Trusts study found.",
      "Last year, a record 68 million retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers relied on Social Security, a 42% jump from two decades ago,\u00a0data shows. The number of Social Security beneficiaries is forecast to swell to 82 million by 2035, AARP said.",
      "Despite the retirement program's importance, many Americans lack a grasp of the basics of Social Security, the new AARP study also found. For instance, only 24% of those surveyed correctly identified 70 years old as the age at which individuals can maximize their Social Security benefits.",
      "And about one-third of respondents said the potential insolvency of the Social Security trust funds would lead to a complete cessation of benefits, which is false.

      "As it stands, China faces an August 12 deadline \u2014 imposed by President Trump \u2014 to strike a new trade deal with the U.S. to end an escalating tit-for-tat trade tariff war that the countries have engaged in since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "Mr. Trump imposed tariffs of up to 145% on imports from China, and Beijing responded with its own steep import duties, but the two sides agreed to a truce to allow for negotiations. In the meantime, the Trump administration has imposed 30% tariffs on imports from China, pending the August 12 deadline, when much higher rates will be imposed by both Washington and Beijing if no agreement is reached.",

      "Southwest Airline's open seating policy is coming in for its final approach.",
      "The Texas-based carrier said Monday that flights with assigned seats will begin on Jan. 27, 2026, marking the end of an era\u00a0in which the discount carrier for decades bucked industry norms by having passengers choose their seats during boarding.",
      "Southwest, which announced last year that it was abandoning open seating, said customers can start booking flights with assigned seats starting on July 29.",
      "\"Assigned seating unlocks new opportunities for our Customers \u2014 including the ability to select Extra Legroom seats \u2014 and removes the uncertainty of not knowing where they will sit in the cabin,\" Tony Roach, executive vice president of customer & brand at Southwest Airlines, said in a statement.",
      "The new policy will allow travelers to choose from\u00a0different fare bundles and seat options, including those offering more legroom. A Southwest spokesperson said the airline is unable for now to offer details on how its fares will change under the new reservation system.",
      "The airline also recently did away with its \"bags fly free\" policy, signaling a broader shift in its revenue strategy amid mounting financial pressure. People who book flights on or after May 28 must pay $35 for the first checked bag and $45 for the second.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Jul 2025 07:06:58 -0400",
    "summary": "The Labor Department is seeking to pull back on the regulation of workplaces by rewriting or repealing more than 60 \"obsolete\" regulations.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Labor is aiming to rewrite or repeal more than 60 \"obsolete\" workplace regulations, ranging from minimum wage requirements for home health care workers and people with disabilities to standards governing exposure to harmful substances.",
      "If approved, the wide-ranging changes unveiled this month also would affect working conditions at constructions sites and in mines, and limit the government's ability to penalize employers if workers are injured or killed while engaging in inherently risky activities such as movie stunts or animal training.",
      "The Labor Department says the goal is to reduce costly, burdensome rules imposed under previous administrations, and to deliver on President Trump's commitment to restore American prosperity through deregulation.",
      "\"The Department of Labor is proud to lead the way by eliminating unnecessary regulations that stifle growth and limit opportunity,\" Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement, which boasted the \"most ambitious proposal to slash red tape of any department across the federal government.\"",
      "Critics say the proposals would put workers at greater risk of harm, with women and members of minority groups bearing a disproportionate impact.",
      "\"People are at very great risk of dying on the job already,\" Rebecca Reindel, the AFL-CIO union's occupational safety and health director, said. \"This is something that is only going to make the problem worse.\"",
      "The proposed changes have several stages to get through before they can take effect, including a public comment period for each one.",
      "Some rollbacks under consideration",
      "Home health care workers help elderly or medically fragile people by preparing meals, administering medications, assisting with toilet use, accompanying clients to doctor appointments and performing other tasks. Under one of the Labor Department's proposals, an estimated 3.7 million workers employed by home care agencies could be paid below the federal minimum wage - currently $7.25 per hour - and made ineligible for overtime pay if they aren't covered by corresponding state laws.",
      "The proposed rule would reverse changes made in 2013 under former President Barack Obama and revert to a regulatory framework from 1975. The Labor Department says that by lowering labor and compliance costs, its revisions might expand the home care market and help keep frail individuals in their homes longer.",
      "Judy Conti, director of government affairs at the National Employment Law Project, said her organization plans to work hard to defeat the proposal. Home health workers are subject to injuries from lifting clients, and \"before those (2013) regulations, it was very common for home care workers to work 50, 60 and maybe even more hours a week without getting any overtime pay,\" Conti said.",
      "Others endorse the proposal, including the Independent Women's Forum, a conservative nonprofit based in Virginia. Women often bear the brunt of family caregiving responsibilities, so making home care more affordable would help women balance work and personal responsibilities, the group's president, Carrie Lukas, said.",
      "\"We're pleased to see the Trump administration moving forward on rolling back some of what we saw as counterproductive micromanaging of relationships that were making it hard for people to get the care they need,\" Lukas said.",
      "Samantha Sanders, director of government affairs and advocacy at the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, said the repeal wouldn't constitute a win for women.",
      "\"Saying we actually don't think they need those protections would be pretty devastating to a workforce that performs really essential work and is very heavily dominated by women, and women of color in particular,\" Sanders said.",
      "Migrant farmworkers",
      "Last year, the Labor Department finalized rules that provided protections to migrant farmworkers who held H-2A visas. The current administration says most of those rules placed unnecessary and costly requirements on employers.",
      "Under the new proposal, the Labor Department would rescind a requirement for most employer-provided transportation to have seat belts for those agriculture workers.",
      "The department is also proposing to reverse a 2024 rule that protected migrant farmworkers from retaliation for activities such as filing a complaint and testifying or participating in an investigation, hearing or proceeding.",
      "\"There's a long history of retaliation against workers who speak up against abuses in farm work. And with H-2A it's even worse because the employer can just not renew your visa,\" said Lori Johnson, senior attorney at Farmworker Justice.",
      "Michael Marsh, president and CEO of the National Council of Agricultural Employers, applauded the deregulation efforts, saying farmers have been hit with thousands of pages of regulations pertaining to migrant farmworkers in recent years.",
      "\"Can you imagine a farmer and his or her spouse trying to navigate 3,000 new pages of regulation in 18 months and then be liable for every one of them?\" he asked.",
      "Construction workers",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the Labor Department, wants to rescind a requirement for employers to provide adequate lighting at construction sites, saying the regulation doesn't substantially reduce a significant risk.",
      "OSHA said if employers fail to correct lighting deficiencies at construction worksites, the agency can issue citations under its \"general duty clause.\" The clause requires employers to provide a place of employment free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.",
      "Worker advocates think getting rid of a specific construction site requirement is a bad idea. \"There have been many fatalities where workers fall through a hole in the floor, where there's not adequate lighting,\" Reindel said. \"It's a very obvious thing that employers should address, but unfortunately it's one of those things where we need a standard, and it's violated all the time.\"",
      "Miners and more",
      "Several proposals could impact safety procedures for mines. For example, employers have to submit plans for ventilation and preventing roof collapses in coal mines for review by the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration. Currently, MSHA district managers can require mine operators to take additional steps to improve those plans.",
      "The Labor Department wants to end that authority, saying current regulations give the district manager the ability to draft and create laws without soliciting comments or action by Congress.",
      "Similarly, the department is proposing to strip district managers of their ability to require changes to mine health and safety training programs.",
      "The general duty clause allows OSHA to punish employers for unsafe working conditions when there's no specific standard in place to cover a situation.",
      "An OSHA proposal would exclude the agency from applying the clause to prohibit, restrict or penalize employers for \"inherently risky professional activities that are intrinsic to professional, athletic, or entertainment occupations.\"",
      "A preliminary analysis identified athletes, actors, dancers, musicians, other entertainers and journalists as among the types of workers the limitation would apply to.",
      "\"It is simply not plausible to assert that Congress, when passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act, silently intended to authorize the Department of Labor to eliminate familiar sports and entertainment practices, such as punt returns in the NFL, speeding in NASCAR, or the whale show at SeaWorld,\" the proposed rule reads.",
      "Debbie Berkowitz, who served as OSHA chief of staff during the Obama administration, said she thinks limiting the agency's enforcement authority would be a mistake.",
      "\"Once you start taking that threat away, you could return to where they'll throw safety to the wind, because there are other production pressures they have,\" Berkowitz said.",

      "The federal agency said in a recall\u00a0notice\u00a0that the pools, which were manufactured in China and sold by multiple U.S. vendors, have a compression strap along the outside that can allow children to gain access and drown. Children are able to enter the pool even when the ladder is removed, the CPSC said.",
      "The children who drowned were between 22 months and 3 years old, according to the agency. The deaths took place between 2007 and 2002 in California, Texas, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin and Missouri. The CPSC said it's also aware of three separate instances when children gained access to the recalled pools using the compression strap.",
      "The pools, which are 48 inches high and taller, have been sold by outdoor recreation companies Bestway, Intex and Polygroup since 2002 at retail stores across the U.S., including Amazon.com, Lowe's, Target and Walmart, among others. Over 250,000 were also sold in Canada. They range in price from $400 to over $1,000, according to the CPSC.",
      "In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, a spokesperson for Bestway, Intex and Polygroup said the three companies started working with the CPSC in 2023 to update the safety standard for above-ground pools. The updated standard, finalized in May 2025, \"aims to prevent unsupervised children from gaining a foothold on the products from compression straps that surround the outside of the pool legs,\" the companies' statement said.",

The $2 billion bitcoin purchase is part of the company's \"bitcoin treasury plan,\" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a news release on Monday.",

    "story": [
      "A former chief executive of two clothing technology companies was released on $1 million bail Friday after pleading not guilty to charges alleging she cheated investors out of over $300 million over the past six years.",
      "Christine Hunsicker, 48, of Lafayette, New Jersey, was charged with six counts, including fraud, aggravated identity theft and false statement charges in the indictment in Manhattan federal court.",
      "U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in a release that Hunsicker forged documents, fabricated audits and made material misrepresentations about her company's financial condition to defraud investors in CaaStle Inc. and P180.",
      "\"As alleged, Christine Hunsicker defrauded investors of hundreds of millions of dollars through document forgery, fabricated audits, and material misrepresentations about her company's financial condition,\" Clayton said in a statement on Friday. \"The promise of pre-IPO technology companies can be fertile ground for fraudsters who play on investor euphoria.\"",
      "The indictment\u00a0said Hunsicker, once portrayed as an on-the-rise fashion entrepreneur, portrayed CaaStle as a high-growth, private company with substantial cash on hand when she knew it faced significant financial distress.",
      "In a statement, defense lawyers Michael Levy and Anna Skotko said prosecutors \"have chosen to present to the public an incomplete and very distorted picture in today's indictment,\" despite Hunsicker's efforts to be \"fully cooperative and transparent\" with prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "\"There is much more to this story, and we look forward to telling it,\" they said.",
      "Hunsicker did not comment as she left the courthouse with Skotko after entering the not-guilty plea and agreeing to the rules of her $1 million bail, which included not having any contact with former or current investors or employees.",
      "According to the indictment, Hunsicker continued her fraudulent scheme even after the CaaStle board of directors removed her and prohibited her from soliciting investments or taking other actions on the company's behalf.",
      "She \"persisted in her scheme\" even after law enforcement agents confronted her over the fraud, the indictment said.",
      "Before the fraud allegations emerged, Hunsicker seemed to be a rising star in the fashion world after she was named to Crain's New York Business \"40 under 40\" lists, was selected as one of Inc.'s \"Most Impressive Women Entrepreneurs\" and was recognized by the National Retail Federation as someone shaping the future of retail, the indictment noted.",
      "At a time when the business was in financial distress with limited cash available and significant expenses, CaaStle was valued by Hunsicker at $1.4 billion, the indictment said.",
      "Hunsicker was lying to investors in February 2019 and continued to do so through this March, prosecutors alleged.",
      "They said she fed investors falsely inflated income statements, fake audited financial statements, fictitious bank account records and sham corporate records.",
      "She allegedly told one investor in August 2023 that CaaStle reported an operating profit of nearly $24 million in the second quarter of 2023 when its operating profit that quarter was actually less than $30,000.",
      "The indictment alleged that she carried out the majority of the fraud by bilking CaaStle investors of $275 million before forming P180 last year to infuse CaaStle with cash before its investors could discover her fraud.",
      "Through misrepresentations and omissions, she cheated P180 investors out of about $30 million, the indictment said.",
      "It said CaaStle filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy last month, leaving hundreds of investors holding now-worthless CaaStle shares. Hunsicker was forced to resign from CaaStle's board in December and formally resigned as chief executive in March.",
      "In a related civil filing, the SEC said Hunsicker's \"fake financials\" supported her narrative that CaaStle was nearing an initial public offering or sale in late 2022 as it enjoyed rapid and steady revenue growth after launching a new monetization model called \"Clothing-as-a-Service.\"",
      "\"In reality, CaaStle's revenues were shrinking, its losses were increasing, and the company was never profitable,\" the lawsuit said. \"Not a single existing or prospective CaaStle investor received accurate monthly, quarterly, or annual CaaStle financial statements from Hunsicker.\"",
      "Before CaaStle, Hunsicker launched Gwynnie Bee, a subscription service renting everyday clothes to women sizes 10 to 32.",
      "\"We want it to be a place where managing a rotating wardrobe is actually the way the majority of people interact with clothing,\" Hunsicker told CBS News in 2016 when discussing the company.",
      "Previously, Hunsicker was also the COO and president of Right Media, an online advertising startup that sold to Yahoo! for $850 million, and then became the COO of Drop.io, an online file sharing service that was purchased by Facebook.",

    "summary": "Microsoft issued an urgent fix after hackers used a \"zero-day\" exploit to infiltrate its SharePoint software.",
    "story": [
      "Microsoft issued an emergency fix to close off a vulnerability in its SharePoint software that hackers have exploited to carry out widespread attacks on businesses and at least some federal agencies.",
      "The software giant on Saturday said it was aware of \"active attacks\" that exploited vulnerabilities in the program, a product that allows companies and other businesses to create websites.",
      "The hackers breached U.S. federal and state agencies as well as universities and energy companies through the vulnerability, according to The Washington Post.",
      "On Sunday, Microsoft updated its guidance with instructions to fix the problem for SharePoint Server 2019 and SharePoint Server Subscription Edition. Engineers were still working on a fix for the older SharePoint Server 2016 software.",
      "The attack was a so-called \"zero-day\" exploit, or when hackers take advantage of a previously unknown vulnerability, often to steal sensitive data and passwords. The vulnerability also could allow hackers to access services connected to SharePoint, including OneDrive and Teams.",
      "\"Once inside, they can access all SharePoint content, system files, and configurations and move laterally across the Windows Domain,\" noted Netherlands-based research company Eye Security in a research note about the breach.",
      "It added, \"Because SharePoint often connects to core services like Outlook, Teams, and OneDrive, a breach can quickly lead to data theft, password harvesting, and lateral movement across the network.\"",
      "Microsoft said in its blog post that it discovered at least dozens of systems were compromised around the world. Security engineers stated the attacks occurred in waves on July 18 and 19.",
      "Although the scope of the attack is still being assessed, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned that the impact could be widespread and recommended that any servers impacted by the exploit should be disconnected from the internet until they are patched.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration instructed Customs and Border Protection officials this week to offer migrant teenagers the option of voluntarily returning to their home countries, instead of being sent to government-overseen shelters, upending longstanding U.S. immigration policy, two U.S. officials told CBS News Wednesday.",
      "For many years, U.S. immigration officials were required to transfer all unaccompanied migrant children \u2014 or those who entered the U.S. without permission and without their parents or legal guardians \u2014 to the Department of Health and Human Services, if they hailed from countries outside of Mexico and Canada. HHS oversees a network of shelters where these minors are housed until they turn 18 or can be placed with a sponsor, who historically has been a U.S.-based relative.",
      "But now, CBP officials have been directed to offer unaccompanied migrant children who are 14 or older the option to self-deport to their countries of origin, the officials said. If the teenagers take that option, U.S. immigration officials would facilitate their prompt return to their native countries. If not, the teens would still be transferred to HHS' Office of Refugee Resettlement.",
      "That voluntary departure policy was previously limited to unaccompanied children from Canada and Mexico. A 2008 anti-trafficking law, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, provided special legal protections for migrant children from \"noncontiguous\" countries, including barring officials from swiftly deporting these minors.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said new authorities in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act spending law allowed the Trump administration to make the policy change.",
      "\"This is a long-standing practice used to prioritize getting children back to the safety of a parent or legal guardian in their home country and is accredited in the Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act of 2022,\" DHS said in a statement.",
      "\"The only change pursuant to the Big Beautiful Bill is expanding this option to return home to UACs from additional countries beyond Mexico and Canada,\" the department added.",
      "The policy change was first reported by CNN.",
      "It's unclear how many migrant teenagers will be affected by the recent directive. The number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border illegally has plunged to levels not seen since the 1960s amid the Trump administration's crackdown. In June, for example, Border Patrol apprehended 6,000 migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, a record monthly low that included fewer than 700 unaccompanied children.",
      "The administration has moved aggressively to deport immigrants living in the U.S. illegally or whose legal status has been revoked, ramping up operations to arrest, detain and deport them.",
      "But it has also launched a massive push to encourage unauthorized immigrants to self-deport, offering them a $1,000 self-deportation bonus and threatening them with arrest, fines and prosecution if they remain in the U.S. illegally.",

    "summary": "Gabbard declassified a 2017 House report targeting Obama and intelligence officials over alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
    "story": [
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Wednesday declassified additional materials on the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's actions in the 2016 election, claiming in a social media\u00a0post and at a White House press briefing that they showed Obama administration officials \"manufactured\" information in order to undermine then-candidate Donald Trump.",
      "Her statement on X said the documents show Obama officials \"manufactured the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment that they knew was false, promoting the LIE that Vladimir Putin and the Russian government helped President Trump win the 2016 election.\"",
      "Democrats disputed her claims and accused Gabbard of misrepresenting the intelligence findings. Wednesday's report follows a separate set of declassified documents on the matter released by Gabbard Friday. In a memo accompanying those documents, she similarly accused Obama administration officials of plotting a \"years-long coup\" against Mr. Trump.",
      "Obama's spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in a statement regarding the first set of materials, \"These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,\" he said, a likely reference to turmoil in Congress over the release of files related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Rodenbush also said nothing in last week's documents \"undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes.\" Rodenbush has not responded to the most recent release of material.",
      "Gabbard also said in her X statement that it was President Trump who made the decision to declassify the House Republicans' report.",
      "The Wednesday release was a declassified report that was compiled in 2017 and finalized in 2020 by the House Intelligence Committee's Republican majority \u2014 where FBI Director Kash Patel was a lead staffer at the time, according to two sources familiar with the matter. It focuses at length on the intelligence community's judgment that Russian president Vladimir Putin aspired to help President Trump to win the 2016 election.",
      "It includes discussions of raw intelligence provided by a human source to the CIA, as well as Signal intercepts gathered by the National Security Agency, prompting concerns from current and former intelligence officials and condemnation from Democrats about the risks it could pose to sensitive intelligence sources and methods.",
      "But the report does not fundamentally change previous assessments by the U.S. intelligence community \u2014 or the multiple reviews that followed.",
      "\"The desperate and irresponsible release of the partisan House intelligence report puts at risk some of the most sensitive sources and methods our Intelligence Community uses to spy on Russia and keep Americans safe,\" Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner said in a statement. \"And in doing so, Director Gabbard is sending a chilling message to our allies and assets around the world: the United States can no longer be trusted to protect the intelligence you share with us.\"",
      "An Office of the Directorate of National Intelligence official said the president's ultimate declassification authority meant he was not obligated to consult with intelligence agencies about redacting sensitive content in the report.",
      "At the White House briefing Monday, Gabbard accused President Obama of \"leading the manufacturing of this intelligence assessment.\" She told reporters that the documents would be sent to the Justice Department and FBI for investigation of \"criminal implications.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News correspondent Ed O'Keefe whether she thinks Obama is guilty of treason, Gabbard responded that she would leave criminal charges to the Justice Department, but said what occurred \"can only be described as a years-long coup and a treasonous conspiracy against the American people.\"",
      "She declined to directly answer another question from O'Keefe about how the latest declassified documents change previous assessments, given that the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 which included then-Sen. Marco Rubio \u2014 dedicated an entire volume of its five-volume investigation to the intelligence community's analysis..",
      "\"[W]e are ensuring that the intelligence community is not being politicized, Gabbard said. \"Look at the evidence and you will know the truth.\"",
      "The House committee's Republican-authored report criticizes the review of the analysis underlying the assessment that went into the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment, or ICA, for several reasons, including that its production was rushed to be released before Mr. Trump took office. It also claimed analysts failed to consider plausible alternative explanations for Putin's intentions and questioned whether they sufficiently took into account the human source's motivations, proximity to Putin or bias towards Trump.",
      "The GOP House committee report zeroes in on a piece of intelligence contained in a report from a human source that it contends was subjected to \"questionable interpretation\" by analysts.",
      "\"The unclear fragment (shown in bold) is part of a sentence in a [redacted] that reads, 'Putin had made this decision [to leak DNC emails] after he had come to believe that the Democratic nominee had better odds of winning the U.S. presidential election, and that [candidate Trump] whose victory Putin was counting on, most likely would not be able to pull off a convincing victory,'\" a bullet says on page 4 of the report.",
      "It adds that a senior CIA operations officer said at the time, \"We don't know what was meant by that\" and \"five people read it five ways.\"",
      "The findings align in many areas with a separate tradecraft review released earlier this month by CIA Director John Ratcliffe, which determined that the confidence level in the assessment that Putin aspired to help Trump win should have been \"moderate\" instead of \"high,\" chiefly because it was derived from one source instead of multiple. The CIA's report, however, did not include any detailed discussion of the sensitive sources or methods involved.",
      "The CIA's own review of the intelligence that informed the finding on Putin's preference \"confirmed that the clause was accurately represented\u2026and that the ICA authors' interpretation of its meaning was most consistent with the raw intelligence.\" It more broadly found that much of the tradecraft underlying the 2017 assessment was \"robust and consistent\" with analytic standards.",
      "The CIA declined to comment on the report released by Gabbard.",
      "Democrats seized on the timing of the disclosures \u2014 which they pointed out could have been made at any time during the first Trump administration or since he took office for a second time.",
      "\"It's appropriate that this shoddy and partisan report was released by Director Gabbard on the day that House Republicans are quite literally fleeing Washington, D.C., for six weeks rather than releasing the Epstein files that Trump is so desperate to cover up,\" said House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes.",
      "\"Given the rushed and unusual 'declassification' process the DNI has implemented, I fear that the public release of this report could compromise sensitive sources and methods and endanger our national security,\" Himes said.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 22:06:15 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal appeals court said Wednesday that President Trump's executive order curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court said Wednesday that President Trump's executive order curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional.",
      "The policy, which has been the subject of a complicated monthslong legal back-and-forth, is currently on hold. But Wednesday's decision appears to mark the first time that an appellate court has weighed in on the merits of Mr. Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship for many children of undocumented immigrants by executive order.",
      "A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit wrote that Mr. Trump's order is \"invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment's grant of citizenship to 'all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'\"",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News: \"The Ninth Circuit misinterpreted the purpose and the text of the 14th Amendment. We look forward to being vindicated on appeal.\"",
      "On the first day of Mr. Trump's second term, he signed an executive order that said people born in the United States should not automatically get citizenship if one parent is undocumented and the other isn't a citizen or green-card holder, or if both parents are in the U.S. on temporary visas. The order directed federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents within 30 days to people who fall into those categories.",
      "The order drew a flurry of lawsuits, as most legal experts have said the 14th Amendment \u2014 which was ratified in 1868 \u2014 automatically offers citizenship to virtually everybody born within the U.S., regardless of their parents' immigration status, with extremely narrow exceptions.",
      "The Trump administration argues the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment does not apply to people whose parents are in the country illegally or temporarily \u2014 citing a clause that says citizenship is granted to those who are \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. Those parents do not necessarily have \"allegiance\" to the country, the government argues, so they therefore aren't \"subject to the jurisdiction.\"",
      "The 9th Circuit disagreed. It wrote Wednesday that a plain reading of the 14th Amendment suggests that citizenship was meant to be granted to anybody who is \"subject to the laws and authority of the United States.\"",
      "\"The Defendants' proposed interpretation of the Citizenship Clause relies on a network of inferences that are unmoored from the accepted legal principles of 1868,\" the judges wrote.",
      "\"Perhaps the Executive Branch, recognizing that it could not change the Constitution, phrased its Executive Order in terms of a strained and novel interpretation of the Constitution,\" the opinion said.",
      "The issue reached the 9th Circuit after a lower court in Washington state blocked the birthright citizenship executive order in February, responding to a lawsuit from several Democratic states. The Trump administration in March\u00a0appealed that ruling. It reasserted its arguments about who the 14th Amendment applies to, called the ruling \"vastly overbroad\" and argued the states did not have standing to sue over the order.",
      "On Wednesday, the 9th Circuit said the states did have the right to sue, pointing to the risk that states would be financially harmed by a federal policy that narrows who qualifies for citizenship. The appellate judges also upheld the district court's finding that the states are likely to succeed in showing the order violates the Constitution.",
      "The 9th Circuit's ruling was written by Clinton-appointed Judge Ronald Gould, and joined by Obama-appointed Judge Michael Daly Hawkins. A third member of the panel \u2014 Judge Patrick Bumatay, appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term \u2014 dissented in part, writing that the states don't have standing and adding \"it's premature to address the merits of the citizenship question or the scope of the injunction.\"",
      "Supreme Court hasn't weighed in on merits of birthright citizenship \u2014 yet",
      "The birthright citizenship issue reached the Supreme Court earlier this year, but not in a case involving the merits of the Trump administration's policy.",
      "Instead, the Supreme Court weighed in on whether the district courts that issued nationwide blocks against Mr. Trump's executive order were exceeding the scope of their power \u2014 a perennial topic of debate in legal circles that has frustrated presidents of both parties.",
      "The high court's ruling last month limited the use of nationwide injunctions. In a 6-3 decision, it granted a request by the administration to narrow the injunctions against the birthright citizenship order, but \"only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief.\"",
      "That doesn't mean the birthright citizenship order will take effect. Shortly after the ruling, a New Hampshire court paused the executive order\u00a0nationwide in a lawsuit that was brought as a class action, after the Supreme Court's decision left the door open to that option.",
      "The Supreme Court also did not directly address whether states can still sue over the order. In the case that the 9th Circuit ruled on Wednesday, the government has argued that courts can just block the birthright citizenship order for residents of the states that sued, rather than issuing a nationwide injunction. But the states argue that would provide them with incomplete relief because people move from state to state.",

    "story": [
      "Dewey Yopp, a retired U.S. Army Special Forces officer, was sent to Afghanistan in 2002 to train up a new Afghan army during the early days of the war in Afghanistan. He met Amir, his then-18-year-old Afghan translator, at the airport on his first day there, and says Amir went on to save his life four times.",
      "\"Amir dragged me, under fire, to a medevac point,\" Yopp told CBS News of one of those instances.",
      "After the U.S. withdrew from the country in 2021, Yopp scrambled to get Amir a special immigrant visa for Afghan allies. Amir asked CBS News to conceal his real name for safety reasons.",
      "\"If someone saves your life, your souls are bound together for eternity,\" Yopp said. \"He's like a son to me, really.\"",
      "Three years later, Amir's visa was approved, and he and his family were given green cards. They came to the U.S. and settled in Kentucky, reuniting with Yopp 22 years after they first met in Afghanistan.",
      "Yopp now spends most days with Amir's children, who call him \"grandfather.\"",
      "Thousands of Afghans living in the U.S. now fear deportation after a federal appeals court late Monday\u00a0refused to freeze\u00a0the Trump administration's efforts to end their legal status. Amir is a Special Immigrant Visa recipient, given to U.S. allies who helped during the war. Despite he and his family having green cards, he still fears being sent back, since the White House has threatened to deport green card holders, too.",
      "Amir risked Taliban retaliation to help American soldiers, because work in Afghanistan at the time was scarce and the prospect of safety abroad was enticing. He told CBS News the promise that was made to him in return for risking his life was, \"Your family will go to America. This was promised with all who work with U.S.\"",
      "Amir said he went into hiding for years after his service, feeling betrayed by the U.S., until Yopp stepped in to fulfill America's pledge and helped secure him his visa. Thousands of veterans of the Afghanistan war across the country have taken it upon themselves to help their translators and other Afghan allies come safely to the U.S. and settle here. But Amir says it is not the job of veterans to fulfill the vow of protection the government previously made to them.",
      "The Trump administration\u00a0has repeatedly targeted\u00a0Afghan refugees, stopping flights with Afghan allies from arriving, freezing resettlement services, putting Afghanistan on the travel ban list, and ending the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Afghan refugees. Yopp says it is a \"moral injury\" to veterans to see this happen to those who helped them during the war.",
      "As part of the administration's efforts to end the TPS program, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem\u00a0has claimed\u00a0that Afghanistan is now safe for Afghans to return to, a point Amir disputes.",
      "\"OK, if Afghanistan is safe, why are you saying to your citizens, 'Do not go to Afghanistan?'\" Amir said in reference to the State Department's \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for Afghanistan. \"For me, [it's] safe, but for you, [it's] not safe? I'm not sure.\"",
      "Amir fears that even as a green card holder, he and his family may be sent back, since the White House has threatened to deport green card holders, too.",
      "These days, he works two jobs, seven days a week, to support his family. He says he only got by in the past because of the $500 a month that Yopp, who is retired, would give him.",
      "\"It's been a slap in the face, really, to see the programs that were in effect, to be taken away,\" Yopp said.",
      "Amir added: \"Americans should not make a promise with Afghans, and now [you're] making a problem for them. Then why [did] you make [that] promise?\"",

    "story": [
      "Halfway into President Trump's first year back in office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency spearheading his crackdown on illegal immigration, is on track to record the most deportations since the Obama administration, according to internal government figures obtained by CBS News.",
      "During the first six months of Mr. Trump's second presidency, ICE recorded nearly 150,000 deportations \u2014 or an average of more than 800 per day \u2014 putting the agency on a trajectory to carry out more than 300,000 removals in the president's first year back in office if deportations continue at the same pace, the data indicates.",
      "That would be the highest annual tally since fiscal year 2014, when the Obama administration recorded 316,000 ICE deportations, historical agency figures show. The government's fiscal year begins in October and ends at the end of September.",
      "Created after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, ICE is charged with deporting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally or whose legal status is revoked, including because of criminal offenses or allegations of immigration fraud. The highest deportation level reported by ICE occurred in fiscal year 2012, when the agency recorded 410,000 removals.",
      "While it would be a significant increase, more than 300,000 ICE deportations in a year would still be far short of the target of 1 million annual deportations that Trump administration officials have outlined, highlighting the operational and legal constraints on immigration enforcement that Republican and Democratic presidents alike have confronted.",
      "At the same time, it's possible ICE's deportation efforts could expand significantly in the next six months, since the agency just received an unprecedented infusion of funding through Mr. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, including $45 billion to set up more detention facilities and $30 billion to fund every stage of the deportation process.",
      "In an exclusive interview with CBS News last week, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said the 1 million annual deportation goal could \"definitely\" be \"possible\" with the new funds, saying the agency plans to use the money to hire 10,000 agents and officers to locate and arrest those suspected of being in the country illegally.",
      "ICE is also not the only federal agency that carries out deportations.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first six months, U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded more than 112,000 deportations, according to the internal government data. Those include deportations of migrants who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally, though illegal crossings there have plummeted to levels not seen since the 1960s amid Mr. Trump's government-wide crackdown.",
      "Additionally, the statistics show the Department of Homeland Security has tracked over 13,000 self-deportations since the start of Mr. Trump's second term. His administration has aggressively pushed those in the country illegally to self-deport by setting up a government app to facilitate the process, offering them a $1,000 self-deportation bonus and warning them that they will be detained, fined or even criminally prosecuted if they refuse to leave voluntarily.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, the top DHS spokeswoman, confirmed ICE's deportation tally six months into the administration. She said the administration has recorded more than 280,000 repatriations and self-deportations across the board \u2014 not just those conducted by ICE \u2014 since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "Mr. Trump, who campaigned on launching the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history, has given ICE a sweeping mandate. His administration has reversed Biden-era limits on immigration arrests in the U.S. interior, enlisted other federal agencies and the military to help ICE with its deportation goals and dramatically expanded the categories of those eligible for deportation, including by revoking the humanitarian protections of hundreds of thousands of migrants.",
      "In recent weeks, ICE has held record levels of detainees in its sprawling detention system. As of earlier this week, there were more than 57,000 detainees facing deportation in ICE custody, according to internal agency data. ICE arrests have roughly doubled since Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office, though they remain far below the daily goal of 3,000 set by Stephen Miller, one of the president's top White House advisers.",
      "While ICE routinely highlights arrests of those in the U.S. illegally who have been convicted of violent crimes, its enforcement efforts have also led to the detention of asylum-seekers attending immigration court hearings, workers in a variety of industries and other non-criminals suspected of being in the country without permission. Those operations have been strongly denounced by Democratic lawmakers and have triggered protests in communities throughout the country, including in southern California.",
      "A recent CBS News poll showed that Mr. Trump's deportation effort has lost the majority support it once enjoyed among the public, with a growing share of Americans expressing concerns about immigration authorities not focusing on arresting and deporting dangerous criminals.",
      "Lyons, the acting ICE director, told CBS News that his agency continues to prioritize the \"worst of the worst,\" but he said anyone found by his agents to be in the country illegally will be taken into custody and processed for deportation.",
      "\"We have opened up the whole aperture of the immigration portfolio,\" Lyons said.",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis barred federal immigration authorities from immediately taking Kilmar Abrego Garcia into custody once he is released from criminal confinement in Tennessee.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday barred federal immigration authorities from immediately taking Kilmar Abrego Garcia into custody once he is released from criminal confinement in Tennessee and ordered the Trump administration to provide him 72 hours' notice if it plans to initiate proceedings to remove him to a country that is not his place of origin.",
      "The order\u00a0from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis was issued as a federal judge in Tennessee, who is presiding over Abrego Garcia's criminal case, ruled that the Salvadoran national should be released from the custody of federal law enforcement under conditions that will be set by a magistrate judge.",
      "The Tennessee judge, Waverly Crenshaw, denied the Justice Department's request to revoke an order allowing Abrego Garcia to be released while awaiting a criminal trial, writing that the government \"failed to carry its burden of showing that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure Abrego's appearance or the safety of others.\"",
      "But Abrego Garcia will not be released from criminal custody immediately.",
      "The magistrate judge overseeing his case granted a request from his lawyers, made last week, to hold off on issuing the order directing Abrego Garcia's release for 30 days. The judge said he will continue to remain in the custody of U.S. Marshals.",
      "\"These rulings are a powerful rebuke of the government's lawless conduct and a critical safeguard for Kilmar's due process rights,\" Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, said in a statement. \"A federal judge has now barred ICE from taking him back into custody and ordered that any future deportation attempt must come with advance notice. After the government unlawfully deported him once without warning, this legal protection is essential.\"",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, attacked Xinis for her decision.",
      "\"The fact this unhinged judge is trying to tell ICE they can't arrest an MS-13 gang member, indicted by a grand jury for human trafficking, and subject to immigration arrest under federal law is LAWLESS AND INSANE,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Abrego Garcia was charged with two criminal counts of human smuggling last month and has pleaded not guilty. While the magistrate judge said he should be released from the custody of U.S. Marshals ahead of a trial, set to begin in January, the order prompted concerns that Abrego Garcia would then be swiftly detained by federal immigration authorities and deported.",
      "But Xinis' order limits the Trump administration's ability to swiftly remove him from the U.S. In addition to blocking Trump administration officials from taking Abrego Garcia into custody upon his release in Tennessee, Xinis ordered the Department of Homeland Security to return him to supervised release under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Baltimore field office. She said Abrego Garcia should be returned to Maryland, where he lives with his family.",
      "Under that supervision order, issued in 2019, Abrego Garcia had permission to live in Maryland, as well as authorization to work. He was required to check in with an immigration officer at the ICE office in Baltimore. Court filings indicate Abrego Garcia was in compliance with the ICE supervision order when he was deported to El Salvador.",
      "Xinis said her relief allows the Trump administration to initiate immigration proceedings once Abrego Garcia returns to Maryland, but said those proceedings must begin in Baltimore, which was handling the earlier ICE supervision order.",
      "\"Once Abrego Garcia is restored under the ICE Supervision Order out of the Baltimore Field Office, defendants may take whatever action is available to them under the law,\" Xinis said.",
      "Xinis, who sits on the federal district court in Maryland, wrote that she \"must accord modest relief\" that ensures Abrego Garcia is not subject to \"re-deportation without due process\" and ensures the fulfillment of her order earlier this year that required the Trump administration to return him to the U.S. from El Salvador.",
      "Administration officials, she wrote, \"have done little to assure the court that absent intervention, Abrego Garcia's due process rights will be protected.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who visited Abrego Garcia when he was detained in El Salvador, cheered Xinis' decision.",
      "\"It's clear this administration would rather deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a third country, with no chance at due process, than argue their case in court. This order will prevent that, and ensure that Kilmar Abrego Garcia is returned to Maryland following the U.S. District Court in Tennessee's determination that he does not pose any threat to the public,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who entered the U.S. illegally in 2011, was detained by ICE in March and sent to a Salvadoran prison along with hundreds of other deportees despite a 2019 court order that barred him from being sent back to El Salvador due to a fear of persecution by gangs. The Trump administration acknowledged Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but he remained there for months \u2014 despite Xinis ordering the government to facilitate his return \u2014 until he was brought to Tennessee to face criminal charges.",
      "While the magistrate judge said he should be released pending trial, the prospect that Abrego Garcia would then swiftly be detained by the Department of Homeland Security for removal proceedings created a new tangle for the courts to unravel. He has remained in the custody of U.S. Marshals as the legal proceedings have continued.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked the Tennessee court last week to put off his release from custody for 30 days if Crenshaw denied the Justice Department's bid to keep him in confinement while awaiting trial \u2014 which the judge did Wednesday.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said in seeking the delay in his release last week that they had been advised by the government that \"if the court denies the government's motion for revocation, the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the Department of Homeland Security ('DHS'), and DHS would begin removal proceedings.\"",
      "But earlier this month, Xinis heard testimony about how Abrego Garcia's deportation proceedings could be handled by ICE. An immigration official told the judge that if Abrego Garcia were to be released from pretrial detention in Tennessee, the agency had not determined where he would be sent.",
      "\"There's been no decision made, as he is not in ICE custody,\" Thomas Giles, assistant director for ICE enforcement and removal operations, testified in federal court in Maryland.",
      "Giles was in court after Xinis ordered the government to produce someone with firsthand knowledge of any third country other than El Salvador where Abrego Garcia could be deported to if he were released from criminal custody.",
      "If Abrego Garcia were to receive a notice of removal, up until his deportation, he would be able to express fear about going to a third country, a period of time that could range from \"a day to a week,\" Giles said.",
      "In a hearing on June 26, Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn said that if the Salvadoran man were to be released, ICE would begin removal proceedings to a third country, which is one that is not the country of origin, instead of his native El Salvador.",
      "During the arguments earlier this month, Xinis said she was not willing to allow for an \"unfettered release\" of Abrego Garcia into ICE custody so he can be \"spirited away\" and removed from the U.S. before she rules.",
      "\"We're a court of laws and we don't operate on 'take my word for it,'\" Xinis said. \"From day one, you have taken the presumption of regularity and destroyed it in my view.\"",

      "Lawler had been considering a gubernatorial run, among the Republicans looking to challenge incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul in next year's statewide election. But he said in an interview Wednesday morning that he intends to stay in the House representing the 17th Congressional District.",
      "\"There's no question Kathy Hochul is the worst governor in America,\" Lawler told \"Fox and Friends.\" \"But after months of deliberating over this and really working through it, I've decided the right thing to do for me and my family and my district is to run for reelection. My seat was determinative of control of the House back in 2022 and again in 2024. I'm one of only three Republicans that won a seat that Kamala Harris also won. Keeping the House majority is critical if we are going to continue to move this economy in the right direction.\"",
      "Lawler's seat has been targeted by Democrats in past election cycles and is a key part of Republicans' current narrow House majority.",
      "Later, Lawler couldn't resist taking a shot at Hochul, telling CBS News New York's Marcia Kramer, \"New York leads the nation in out migration, not because of the weather but because of its policies. It has the most awful business climate, the highest taxes.\"",
      "Hochul responded on social media, saying, \"This is the same Mike Lawler who caved to Trump the minute he asked to rip away New Yorkers' health care. Of course he doesn't have the spine to face me.\"",
      "Hochul also posted a tweet of dog biscuits, calling it \"A treat for Donald Trump's Good Boy,\" and later at a press conference on public safety said, \"Lawler barely doesn't have the courage to stand up to me or to Donald Trump.

      "N.Y. governor's race draws attention of President Trump",
      "President Trump appeared to weigh in on the governor's race back in May, with what experts said was a not-so-subtle attempt to clear the field for upstate Rep. Elise Stefanik to get the GOP nomination. Mr. Trump had initially tapped Stefanik to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, but she\u00a0withdrew her name from consideration\u00a0two months later as Mr. Trump asked her to stay in Congress to protect Republicans' razor-thin majority.",
      "In a pair of social media posts on May 6, Mr. Trump\u00a0endorsed Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman\u00a0for reelection this November and\u00a0Lawler\u00a0for reelection in 2026.",
      "\"As I've said repeatedly, you know, when it comes to deciding about whether to run for governor or reelection, I'll be making that decision in June, and so we're still going through that process,\" Lawler responded at the time.",
      "\"Mike Lawler is a great, effective, and hardworking Representative for New York's 17th Congressional District and is committed to protecting the House Republican Majority. As I have previously stated, I am focused on supporting strong Republican local and county candidates on the ballot this November to lay the groundwork with a strong team for next year,\" Stefanik wrote in a statement Wednesday. \"I will make a final decision and announcement after this year's November election which we are all focused on.\"",
      "Hochul and Stefanik recently\u00a0sparred during a congressional hearing on sanctuary policies, and the governor has said\u00a0\"bring it on\" to whomever she faces\u00a0next fall. Meanwhile, her number two, Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, is\u00a0also running to replace her.",
      "\"Under Kathy Hochul's failed Far Left Democrat rule, a radical Communist Defund-the-Police Antisemite may be elected mayor of New York City, a CBP officer was just brutally shot in the face by an illegal in NY due to dangerous sanctuary state laws, and New Yorkers are fleeing the highest-taxed state in the nation,\" Stefanik wrote.",

I don't like anything that's artificial, so could we straighten that out, please? We should change the name. I actually mean that. I don't like the name artificial anything.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and the European Union are racing to clinch a trade deal\u00a0by the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, with economists warning that a sharp hike in tariffs could raise costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "As the clock ticks down, a series of pacts with other U.S. trading partners in recent days have raised hopes of avoiding a potentially damaging trade war with Europe, with experts saying a\u00a0deal with Japan announced on Tuesday could serve as a template for a deal with the EU.",
      "The U.S. has also recently announced the outlines of trade deals with China, Indonesia, the Philippines and U.K., though with many details still remaining to be finalized.",
      "For consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, much is riding on the outcome of the trade talks. Absent a deal, President Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tax. In preparing possible countermeasures, the European Commission has said it would impose tariffs on more than $100 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Aug. 7, AFP reported on Wednesday.",
      "Negotiations are ongoing and a U.S.-EU trade war could yet be avoided. Citing EU diplomats, AFP also said officials with the trading block could be open to a 15% U.S. tariff rate, with potential carveouts for key sectors, according to the wire service.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the status of talks with the EU, including whether the Trump administration expects to reach a trade deal by the Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday struck a trade deal with Tokyo that calls for a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, the deal calls for Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including cars and certain farm products.",
      "The 15% tariff rate on Japanese goods is five percentage points higher than a baseline tariff the Trump administration imposed on all foreign imports on April 2. But it is lower than the 25% he threatened against Japan earlier this month and the 24% duties his administration\u00a0proposed\u00a0in early April.",
      "\"The Japan deal solidifies this pattern we've seen thus far, which is some market access relief, a commitment to purchase U.S. goods, and a slightly lower, but above the universal baseline, tariff level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a public policy research firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The Japan deal certainly provides a framework of what [Mr. Trump] looking for,\" Jacquez said. \"It's about accepting a baseline tariff at or above 10%, and then making purchase commitments.\"",
      "Key catalysts for trade deals",
      "A key element of Mr. Trump's trade deals has been a commitment by other nations to invest in the U.S. The president has defended tariffs as a way to revive the country's domestic manufacturing base and make American exports more competitive, as well as to generate additional federal revenue.",
      "\"We are learning that the promise of greater investment into the U.S. works well with the administration,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said. \"The promise to invest $550 billion was a big part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal. It was a key catalyst to securing a deal.\"",
      "The EU, whose member states have a combined gross domestic product of $20 trillion, could likely commit to a large investment in the U.S. because it could span a number of years and focus on key sectors, such as technology, energy or artificial intelligence, Daco added.",
      "Additional commitments by the EU to purchase American-made goods and to lower trade barriers to U.S. exports could also help close a deal, he said. \"Those don't cost much, and they're an easy bargaining chip to put forward.\"",
      "Risk of higher prices",
      "Although a 15% baseline U.S. tariff on EU imports would represent a retrenchment from Mr. Trump's earlier threats, it would still drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, according to Daco.",
      "\"While it may seem like a great deal, it's still much higher than the tariffs that the U.S. was imposing at the end of 2024,\" he noted. \"So there would still be a positive inflation shock because of higher tariffs. There would also be demand erosion coming from reduced business investment, hiring,and reduced consumer spending as a result of these higher tariffs.\"",
      "Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports is around 15%, according to his analysis. If Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs go into effect, that rate would rise to more than 20%. If the EU agrees to a 15% tariff rate, however, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports from around the world would drop to 19.5%.",
      "\"That's still a significant increase in the average rate,\" Daco said. \"It's a lot higher than the 2.5% where we started the year.\"",
      "Because most U.S. imports from the EU include industrial inputs like components, raw materials and machinery, any added costs would take tie to work their way through the supply chain, according to Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"It would \u00a0affect manufacturing exports faster than it would affect American consumers, but it would raise prices all around,\" Young said.",

    "summary": "French President and first lady Brigitte Macron filed the 22-count lawsuit against Candace Owens in Delaware Superior Court.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte Macron filed a defamation lawsuit against right-wing podcast host Candace Owens on Wednesday in response to claims she peddled that France's first lady was born a man.",
      "The 22-count complaint was filed in Delaware Superior Court and seeks an unspecified amount of damages from Owens, who broadcast an eight-part series spreading a host of allegations about the Macrons, including that Brigitte Macron was born a man, stole another person's identity and transitioned to a woman.",
      "The Macrons said in the lawsuit that Owens rebuffed three separate demands for retractions, with the first coming in December and the final sent July 1, and continued to push \"outlandish, defamatory, and far-fetched fictions\" about the French president and first lady.",
      "\"These claims are demonstrably false, and Owens knew they were false when she published them,\" the lawsuit states. \"Yet, she published them anyway. And the reason is clear: it is not the pursuit of truth, but the pursuit of fame.\"",
      "Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron said in a statement that they decided to file their lawsuit after Owens doubled down on the falsehoods despite their lawyers' retraction requests.",
      "\"Ms. Owens' campaign of defamation was plainly designed to harass and cause pain to us and our families and to garner attention and notoriety,\" they said. \"We gave her every opportunity to back away from these claims, but she refused. It is our earnest hope that this lawsuit will set the record straight and end this campaign of defamation once and for all.\"",
      "In response to the lawsuit, a spokesperson for Owens said: \"Candace Owens is not shutting up. This is a foreign government attacking the First Amendment rights of an American independent journalist. Candace repeatedly requested an interview with Brigitte Macron. Instead of offering a comment, Brigitte is resorting to trying to bully a reporter into submission. In France, politicians can bully journalists, but this is not France. It's America.\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Owens went live on YouTube in response to the defamation lawsuit, calling it a public relations strategy, and she refused to back down from her claim against Brigitte Macron. She started her livestream with a clip from the movie \"Gladiator\" in which Russell Crowe's character exclaimed \"Are you not entertained?\"",
      "\"This is why you're here,\" Owens told her audience. \"This is how I feel right now. Me receiving my papers today.\"",
      "\"If read through this ... Brigitte actually and intentionally defames me throughout the filing. It says all these things are untrue, attributes quotations to me that I've never said,\" she said as she went through parts of the filing.",
      "The lawsuit takes aim at Owens for promoting unfounded theories and spreading misinformation and said she aims to \"inflame and attract attention through sensationalism and conspiracy theories.\" It alleges that the podcaster published the eight-part series about the Macrons, called \"Becoming Brigitte,\" and related posts on X with reckless disregard for the truth.",
      "\"These lies have caused tremendous damage to the Macrons,\" the suit states. Owens and her entities, it continues, have \"subjected the Macrons to a campaign of global humiliation, turning their lives into fodder for profit-driven lies. Owens has dissected their appearance, their marriage, their friends, their family, and their personal history\u2014twisting it all into a grotesque narrative designed to inflame and degrade. The result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale.\"",
      "Macron has been president of France since 2017. He and Brigitte Macron married in 2007.",
      "In addition to naming Owens as a defendant, the suit names her company, Candace Owens LLC, and the operator of her website, GeorgeTom, Inc.",
      "The baseless claims targeting Brigitte Macron began around March 2021 and were picked up by Owens in March 2024, while she was working for The Daily Wire, a conservative media outlet co-founded by Ben Shapiro, according to the lawsuit. She was fired from the outlet later that month.",
      "Following her termination, Owens launched her podcast, called \"Candace,\" in June 2024 and continued to push the allegations about Brigitte Macron.",
      "The Macrons sent their first retraction demand to Owens in December 2024, after which she published the multi-part podcast series that the couple said raised \"false and defamatory allegations\" about Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron. The third and final demand for a retraction was sent earlier this month.",
      "The Macrons allege in their suit that Owens published the defamatory statements knowing they were false, and said she acted with reckless disregard for the truth. The standard in defamation lawsuits brought by public figures is actual malice, which requires a plaintiff alleging defamation to show that the defendant knew the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for its falsity in order to prevail.",
      "France's president and first lady said Owens had a financial motivation to continue pushing the claims about Brigitte Macron, as her podcast series was monetized and used to solicit contributions, promote subscriptions and raise her brand.",
      "Tom Clare, who is representing the Macrons, said Owens' conduct is a\"clear-cut case of defamation.\"",

    "summary": "The Pentagon's internal watchdog has evidence that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used details from a classified email when he shared information about US strikes on Yemen on Signal earlier this year, according to two U.S. officials.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Pentagon's internal watchdog has obtained evidence that encrypted messages sent from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's Signal account included details from a classified email, according to two senior American officials with knowledge of the matter.",
      "The chat messages listed out information on a planned U.S. bombing operation in Yemen in March, and were sent to several Trump administration officials in a Signal group \u2014 which became public when a reporter was inadvertently added to the chat. At the time, administration officials denied that any classified information was shared in the chat.",
      "Key information in the messages was derived from a classified email marked \"SECRET//NOFORN,\" said the two officials, who both requested anonymity to speak about an ongoing investigation into top Trump administration officials.",
      "The \"SECRET\" designation means that the information was classified and the disclosure of this information could potentially cause serious damage to national security, potentially jeopardizing the safety of service members. The \"NOFORN\" label means the information can only be disseminated to U.S. agencies and individuals, excluding foreign nationals and even close U.S. allies.",
      "The Washington Post first reported about the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General receiving the evidence on Wednesday.",
      "Contacted by CBS News on Wednesday, the Inspector General's office said it would not comment about ongoing oversight projects. In April, the Defense Department IG announced it would evaluate the Defense Secretary's use of commercial messaging applications for official business and whether his office complied with classification and records retention requirements.",
      "The Pentagon's chief spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement, \"The Department stands behind its previous statements: no classified information was shared via Signal.\" He also called reporting on the secretary's use of the Signal app \"so old and worn out, it's starting to resemble Joe Biden's mental state.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have faced staunch scrutiny since the existence of the Signal chat messages was first reported by The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who was accidentally added to the Signal chat group by then-National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. Trump officials in the Signal chat group have repeatedly denied that classified information was shared in the group.",
      "But the two U.S. officials with knowledge of the evidence received by the Pentagon's watchdog office told CBS News on Wednesday that the information Hegseth posted in the encrypted Signal chat group was derived from a classified email sent out by Gen. Michael \"Erik\" Kurilla to dozens of defense officials. Kurilla oversees U.S. Central Command, which is the primary Defense Department organization responsible for conducting U.S. military operations in the Middle East.",
      "The Atlantic published screenshots that it said were from the Signal chat, which appeared to show Hegseth sharing a timeline of planned attacks on Houthi rebels in Yemen. It listed the timing of two sets of F-18 launches and strikes, a set of drone strikes and some Tomahawk missile strikes.",
      "\"Just CONFIRMED w/ CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch,\" one message read, according to the magazine.",
      "Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said in an April statement: \"There was no classified information in any Signal chat, no matter how many ways they try to write the story.\" He made that claim after reporting showed Hegseth also shared details in a separate Signal chat that included members of his family.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe \u2014 both of whom appeared to be members of the chat group \u2014 also told lawmakers in March that classified material wasn't shared.",
      "Ratcliffe said that Signal \"is a permissible use\" application that has been approved by the White House for use by senior officials, and the group chat was a \"mechanism for communicating between senior level officials but not a substitute for using high side or classified communications.\"",
      "The defense secretary, according to federal regulations, has the authority to declassify information, but after the messages surfaced, Hegseth didn't answer when asked by reporters whether he took that approach before sharing the information on Signal.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans,\" Hegseth told reporters in March.",
      "Signal is a free messaging app that's popular due to its high standard of encryption, which prevents people other than the senders or recipients from viewing messages.",
      "Human error remains a vulnerability for Signal and other encrypted apps, as the episode involving Hegseth demonstrated. And in February, the National Security Agency warned its staff that Russian hacking groups were using phishing messages to gain access to Signal users' accounts, allowing them to view victims' activity, according to documents obtained by CBS News earlier this year.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it will allow President Trump to fire three members of the independent Consumer Product Safety Commission, a victory for the president as he tests the bounds of his removal powers.",
      "The order from the court is the latest in which it has refused to reinstate independent regulators who were fired by the president without cause. It comes as Mr. Trump has moved to exert more control over the executive branch and has been overseeing a reorganization of federal agencies.",
      "The unsigned decision appeared to fall along ideological lines, and came over the dissent of the three liberal justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.",
      "The Supreme Court said the bid by the Trump administration to remove the trio of commissioners is controlled by its earlier ruling in a case known as Trump v. Wilcox that allowed the firings of members of two independent labor boards.",
      "\"Although our interim orders are not conclusive as to the merits, they inform how a court should exercise its equitable discretion in like cases. The stay we issued in Wilcox reflected 'our judgment that the government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty,'\" the court said. \"The same is true on the facts presented here, where the Consumer Product Safety Commission exercises executive power in a similar manner as the National Labor Relations Board, and the case does not otherwise differ from Wilcox in any pertinent respect.\"",
      "Kagan, in a dissent joined by Sotomayor and Jackson, accused the majority of using the court's emergency docket to \"destroy the independence of an independent agency, as established by Congress.\"",
      "The request for emergency relief from the high court by Solicitor General D. John Sauer arose from a federal judge's decision last month that found Mr. Trump's removal of the three commissioners \u2014 Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric and Richard Trumka Jr. \u2014 was unlawful and blocked their terminations.",
      "The officials had been named to the five-member Consumer Product Safety Commission by former President Joe Biden for seven-year terms. Boyle's term was set to end in October, Hoehn-Saric's time on the panel was due to end in October 2027 and Trumka's in October 2028.",
      "But in May, the three were told that their positions were terminated, effective immediately. Under federal law, a president cannot remove a commissioner at-will, but only for neglect of duty or malfeasance.",
      "The removed members sued over their terminations in May and asked a federal judge in Maryland, where the Consumer Product Safety Commission is headquartered, to restore them to their positions. They succeeded in their bid last month, when U.S. District Judge Matthew Maddox allowed the three commissioners to resume their roles on the panel.",
      "\"Depriving this five-member commission of three of its sitting members threatens severe impairment of its ability to fulfill its statutory mandates and advance the public's interest in safe consumer products,\" Maddox wrote in his decision. \"This hardship and threat to public safety significantly outweighs any hardship defendants might suffer from plaintiffs' participation on the CPSC.\"",
      "A unanimous panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit declined to block the district court's decision and allow Mr. Trump to fire the commissioners.",
      "The commissioners, Judge James Wynn wrote in a brief opinion, \"were appointed to serve fixed terms with statutory protections designed to preserve the commission's independence and partisan balance. Permitting their unlawful removal would thwart that purpose and deprive the public of the commission's full expertise and oversight. And because the attempted removals were unlawful, the Plaintiff-Commissioners never ceased to lawfully occupy their offices.\"",
      "The Supreme Court's order blocks the district judge's decision that reinstated the commissioners to their roles.",
      "Sauer's emergency appeal to the Supreme Court regarding the commissioners' firings was one of several involving the president's power to remove executive officers, which his administration has argued is largely unrestricted.",
      "The justices in May cleared the way for Mr. Trump to remove without cause two members of two different independent labor boards while legal fights over their terminations move forward. Over the dissent of the three liberal justices, the high court's unsigned decision said that the risk of harm to the government outweighs that of the removed officers, the line it cited in Wednesday's ruling.",
      "Sauer said that May decision from the high court regarding the removals of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board should have foreclosed the reinstatement of the Consumer Product Safety Commission members. The district court's order, he wrote, effectively transfers control of the panel from Mr. Trump to three members who were appointed by his predecessor.",
      "\"That plain-as-day affront to the President's fundamental Article II powers warrants intervention now,\" the solicitor general wrote.",
      "In her dissent, Kagan accused the conservative majority of effectively overturning the 1935 decision in the case\u00a0Humphrey's Executor v. United States, which said Congress could impose removal protections for the members of certain independent agencies.",
      "\"The majority has acted on the emergency docket \u2014 with 'little time, scant briefing, and no argument' \u2014 to override Congress's decisions about how to structure administrative agencies so that they can perform their prescribed duties,\" she wrote. \"By means of such actions, this Court may facilitate the permanent transfer of authority, piece by piece by piece, from one branch of Government to another.\"",

      "\"The facts and circumstances surrounding both your and Mr. Epstein's cases have received immense public interest and scrutiny,\" Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the chairman of the committee, wrote to Maxwell.",
      "Comer said the committee is seeking Maxwell's testimony \"to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",
      "The committee wants the deposition to take place on Aug. 11 at the Federal Correctional Institution Tallahassee, where Maxwell is imprisoned.",
      "Maxwell was\u00a0convicted in 2021\u00a0for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is\u00a0serving a 20-year prison sentence. Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges.",
      "A top Justice Department official is also planning to meet with Maxwell \"soon,\" and the government has asked federal courts overseeing the Epstein and Maxwell cases to release material from federal grand juries. The department said earlier this month that a review of evidence in Epstein case turned up no indication of a \"client list\" and said no more files would be released, citing victims' privacy. The decision sparked fierce backlash from President Trump's supporters who have called for more transparency into the case for years.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he had concerns about Maxwell providing testimony.",
      "\"If they see fit to bring in Ghislaine Maxwell for testimony, that's fine,\" the Louisiana Republican said. \"I will note the obvious concern ... Could she be counted on to tell the truth?

    "story": [
      "No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence.",
      "The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister's birthday party.",
      "The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.",
      "\"Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,\" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. \"I think kids use AI to get out of thinking.\"",
      "For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you.\"",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, with 34% reporting daily usage or multiple times a week, according to\u00a0a new study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \"digital friends,\" like Character. AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",
      "In an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" on Wednesday, Common Sense founder and CEO Jim Steyer said what struck him about the study is that AI companions are \"everywhere in teens' lives.\"",
      "Common Sense's study also found that 11% of teens use AI companions to build up their courage and stand up for themselves, which Steyer said can be a good thing. However, he cautioned that problems arise when the technology replaces human relationships.",
      "\"Younger kids really trust these AI companions to be like friends or parents or therapists,\" Steyer said. \"They're talking about serious relationships, and these are robots. They're not human beings.\"",
      "As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,\" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. \"When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.\"",
      "All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an \"AI companion\" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.",
      "\"That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,\" said Nair. \"It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.\"",
      "How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers",
      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \"as satisfying or more satisfying\" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",
      "\"It's eye-opening,\" said Robb. \"When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.\" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.",
      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",
      "\"If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both.",
      "\"It's a challenge with how kids live today because they spend so many hours in front of a screen, and when you substitute a machine or a robot for human interaction, you're fundamentally changing the nature of that relationship,\" Steyer told CBS News.",
      "The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a \"risk assessment,\" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions.",
      "\"In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,\" Steyer said.",
      "A concerning trend to teens and adults alike",
      "Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot.",
      "\"Parents really have no idea this is happening,\" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up.\" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data.",
      "Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.",
      "Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.",
      "\"One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,\" said Telzer. \"They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.\"",
      "Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.",
      "\"If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,\" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.",
      "Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.",
      "\"I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,\" Perry said. \"I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.\"",
      "Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media.",
      "\"Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,\" Nair said. \"I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper \u2014 our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.\"",
      "\"It's the new addiction,\" Nair added. \"That's how I see it.\"",

      "Can you teach an old dog new tricks? Atlantic staff writer Olga Khazan set out to change aspects of her personality she didn't like by forcing herself outside of her comfort zone, and documented the progress she made in her new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change\" (Simon & Schuster/Simon Element).",
      "Among the challenges that Khazan, a lifelong introvert, set for herself: Tackling her social anxiety by enrolling in an improv class. Yes, and \u2026 how did that go?",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Susan Spencer's interview with Olga Khazan on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" July 20!",
      "\"Me, But Better\" by Olga Khazan",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "My journey into extroversion began solitarily, with me watching the improv show Middleditch & Schwartz on Netflix one night. The episode opened with two well-known actors, Thomas Middleditch and Ben Schwartz, spending an uncomfortably long time pulling a premise for their sketch out of a random audience member\u2014a photography intern. Then, on a bare stage, Middleditch pretended to interview Schwartz for a photography job, making up absurd questions like \"embody a gazelle.\"",
      "The audience laughed along gamely, but mostly, the scene reminded me that I needed to file my expense report. I felt uneasy for the actors, like at any moment the crowd could turn on them, leaving them groping for laughs in ghostly silence. I wondered why they couldn't have just written out better scenes ahead of time. And even worse, I knew that soon, I would be in their exact same position, except without the advantage of being a famous comedian.",
      "For my personality-change project, I had decided to focus on each of the five traits intensively for a few months at a time, and I tackled extroversion first. In recent years my life had descended into a rut that I didn't particularly like, and extroversion seemed like the way out. Most days, I worked, made dinner, watched TV, and worked some more. Rich and I were planning to relocate, and it occurred to me that I would have both moved into and out of my house without having met any of my neighbors. A test in a self-help book reminded me that I have \"high loneliness.\"",
      "My \"very low\" extroversion score was probably not surprising to people who know me: My friend Anastasia once sentenced me to attending a party on pain of ending our friendship. But my hard-core introversion could turn pernicious, shading at times into loneliness and isolation. I have a career in which work can expand to fill every crevice of the day, and sometimes I thought that was a good thing, because I didn't have many hobbies or friends to otherwise occupy my time. (And say what you will about extroverts, but they have plenty of hobbies and friends.) I had always told myself I could focus on socializing after my life had stabilized, but the absence of social interaction was, itself, destabilizing.",
      "Of all five traits, extroversion offers the simplest path to personality change: You just have to go out and talk to people. You don't even have to be particularly good at it, or to proclaim yourself an \"extrovert\" while you do it. You just go, and extroversion will find you, like the entire wedding follows the first intrepid dancer.",
      "Coincidentally, this is also the ethos behind improv comedy: You just have to say something. Anything! For the uninitiated, \"improv\" is short for \"improvisational theater.\" The idea is that two or more actors get up on stage without knowing what they'll say or do. They get to the \"scene\" by accepting and building on a partner's improvisations\u2014a concept known as \"yes, and.\" When this is done well, improvisers say there is virtually no difference between improv and scripted theater\u2014a claim about which opinions surely differ.",
      "I knew I needed a commitment device for extroversion\u2014something to force me out of my house and into gregariousness. I decided to try improv, which seemed like the full-immersion extrovert experience.",
      "It also felt like full-immersion insanity. Rich saw me entering my credit-card information into the website of Dojo Comedy, a cozy-looking D.C. improv theater whose logo incorporates a pair of mustachioed Groucho Marx comedy glasses. \"You doing improv is like Larry David doing ice hockey,\" he said.",
      "It's true. My general vibe is less \"yes, and\" and more \"well, actually.\" I've never really liked improv as an art form. I don't find it particularly funny\u2014it's more like an extended inside joke you're never going to get. I thought Middleditch would warm me to improv, but it only turned me off more.",
      "Before the first class a few weeks later, I donned a Groundlings-ready black T-shirt and jeans, hoping to draw as little attention to myself as possible. I tried to shake memories of being so timid in middle-school drama class that I only qualified to be the understudy for the smallest role\u2014Bob Cratchit's daughter. When I typed the address of the improv studio into my phone, I was relieved when the red snake of \"heavier than usual traffic\" indicated that I would have at least an hour to mentally prepare.",
      "The improv class met in an old townhouse, in a room that was, for no discernible reason, filled with dozens of sculptures of elephants. Six of us novices sat in a circle on chairs that looked like they'd been salvaged from Victorian funerals.",
      "The instructor, a short brunette with a brisk, friendly manner, opened by asking us about our past improv experience\u2014none, in my case. One of the other women rattled off a long list of improv classes she had taken. What kind of crazy person does improv multiple times? I wondered. (Me, as it would turn out.)",
      "Right after the instructor said, \"Let's get started,\" I prayed for someone to grab an elephant and knock me unconscious. That didn't happen, so instead I stood up to play warm-up games with a software engineer, two lawyers, and a guy who worked on the Hill. The games were meant to loosen us up for what was to come, which was \"scene work,\" or acting out unscripted mini plays with one another.",
      "First, we learned the improv standard Zip Zap Zop, which involves whooshing beams of energy at one another and taking turns saying \"Zip,\" \"Zap,\" and\u2014you guessed it\u2014 \"Zop.\" The point of the game is to stay unflustered enough to keep up the Zip-Zap-Zop sequence while still whooshing on to someone else in the circle.",
      "I struggled for several reasons: Because of the pandemic, I hadn't been in a room with other people for more than a year. On top of that, I have poor reflexes, and, because we wore masks, you had to determine whether someone was about to Zop you solely by the angle of their eyes.",
      "If someone messed up the sequence\u2014said \"Zip\" to another's \"Zip,\" for instance\u2014we would all stop, clap, and say, \"yay!,\" reinforcing the idea that it's okay to screw up in improv. The spirit of all this was so different from my job, where you can get fired for screwing up, that it felt like some sort of rehab for perfectionists.",
      "Then we moved on to juggling various invisible items between one another, including an invisible ball, which, humiliatingly, we had to refer to as \"invisible ball!\" I sensed that the others were as nervous as I was, but this being D.C., an air of try-hard overachievement subsumed everyone's true emotions. People, myself included, will behave ridiculously if they feel they have no alternative. I imagined all my fellow ball-jugglers back at work the next day, writing emails in which they promised to circle back and touch base. I wondered whether they would think back to this moment of whimsy at their brown-bag lunches, as they gravely discussed the situation in Burkina Faso. Maybe it would make the situation in Burkina Faso seem less chaotic by comparison.",
      "Soon it was time to call an invisible hawk to my arm. I noted with gratitude that at least the blinds were closed, so no one could see us from the street.",

    "summary": "Writer Olga Khazan, a lifelong introvert obsessed with work, was unhappy with who she was, and so vowed to redesign her personality by living outside her comfort zone \u2013 a journey she documented in her new book, \"Me, But Better.\"",
    "story": [
      "For years, Olga Khazan, a Virginia-based staff writer at The Atlantic, knew she had a big problem: she hated much of her own personality. \"I was constantly worried about everything,\" she said. \"Just never living in the moment. And I didn't really like doing anything fun with other people. Just wasn't my thing.\"",
      "How might she function at a party? \"I would kind of stand off to myself, and honestly, sometimes just, like, read articles on my phone or just basically not engage,\" she laughed.",
      "Not surprisingly, a lot of folks didn't want to engage with Khazan, either. \"One person called me a pressure addict, that I was sort of obsessed with working, and just doing as much work as possible, and never taking a minute to appreciate life,\" she said. \"One person told me that she was kind of afraid of me when we worked together.\"",
      "Predictably, when she took a personality test four years ago, she was off the charts \u2013 way off \u2013 in neuroticism, or negative emotions \u2026 not that she hadn't tried to find help: \"This whole time I'd been in therapy,\" Khazan said. \"I had taken different medications. I did yoga. And I did all the self-care things. Nothing was truly working.\"",
      "Frustrated, Khazan set out to do something much more radical: She vowed to redesign her whole personality. \"I decided to spend a year trying to change my personality traits,\" she laughed.",
      "Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala described one's personality as \"your characteristic way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. It's how you think about your behavior and how you act.\"",
      "I asked, \"I always assumed that once you had reached a certain age, your personality was your personality?\"",
      "\"That really is, I think, the prevailing way to think about personality, but it doesn't line up with our science,\" Sauer-Zavala replied.",
      "Personality science is her specialty, and her research at the University of Kentucky could be a game-changer for how we approach mental health issues. She says data tells us it is possible to scientifically change your personality, and that, with the right intervention, introverts can become extroverts \u2026 sloppy people can get neater \u2026 slackers can gain ambition \u2026 and anxious people can learn to be calm. \"In my almost 20 years of treating people with anxiety disorders, I've seen dramatic changes in 12, 16, 20 weeks,\" Sauer-Zavala said.",
      "Step one is a baseline personality test, which asks questions such as: \"I sometimes manipulate people into doing what I want.\"",
      "The next step is forcing yourself to act the opposite of how you normally would. If you're shy, make conversations. If you're messy, make the bed.",
      "Sauer-Zavala said, \"When we make intentional changes to our thinking, our feeling, and our behaviors, and we maintain those changes over time, then we're essentially shifting our personality. We're changing the way we're gonna fill out those bubbles on the personality questionnaire.\"",
      "\"So, you consciously adopt the behavior of the personality that you think you want?\" I asked. \"You make it sound easy.\"",
      "\"It's not easy,\" Sauer-Zavala replied. \"The principles are simple, but the execution is difficult.\"",
      "It wasn't easy for Olga Khazan, the lifelong introvert. Among other strategies to tackle her social anxiety, she enrolled in an improv class with total strangers \u2026 something completely outside her comfort zone. \"I was very, very scared,\" she said. \"Probably for the first three or four months that I did it, my heart was really beating in my chest, and I was deeply uncomfortable.\"",
      "What about it scared her? \"I didn't like looking silly!\" she laughed.",
      "Murphy McHugh, who was Khazan's improv teacher, said, \"For me, doing improv was a life-changing thing. I opened up socially. I became a better listener, a better collaborator.\"",
      "He said as Khazan continued coming to class, he noticed changes in her: \"Relaxing, a little bit less of the cross-armed body language. You see someone relaxed, you see their shoulders drop. You see them laughing, and coming into scenes with an idea.\"",
      "Along with improv, Khazan meditated, went sailing, took conversation classes, and kept a journal, as she describes in a new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change.\"",
      "\"Journaling kind of helps you focus on some of the more positive elements of your life that, if you're very neurotic, you tend to kind of gloss over or forget,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Is this a case of fake it 'til you make it?\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is fake it 'til you make it,\" Khazan said. \"Because if you think about it, anything is gonna feel fake if it feels new, right? Anything that you're not accustomed to doing is gonna feel really unnatural. But the only way to make it natural is to do it over and over and over again\"",
      "\"And just incorporate it in who you are?\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "Today, Khazan is happily married, with a 14-month-old baby. As for that personality she once so disliked, she said, \"I feel like I am a different person today than I was three years ago. I think I genuinely have a different way of living my life, and approaching problems, than I did before.\"",
      "So, what advice does Shannon Sauer-Zavala have for everyone watching with completely unsatisfactory personalities? \"Not to get stuck in a personality-type box,\" she said. \"Think about the life that you want to have, and then know that you can intentionally develop the traits that will facilitate that journey for you.\"",

      "Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later.",
      "TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind \"couples\" with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,\" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa.",

      "That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays, \"but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that.\"",
      "\"So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,\" Miles said.",

      "Mr. Trump spoke about the new plan during a keynote address at an AI summit in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, after which he signed executive orders to help fast-track AI development.",
      "\"Around the globe, everyone is talking about artificial intelligence,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday. \"I find that too, 'artificial' \u2014 I can't stand it. I don't even like the name. I don't like anything that's artificial, so could we straighten that out, please? We should change the name. I actually mean that. I don't like the name artificial anything. Because it's not artificial, it's genius. It's pure genius.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said AI has the potential to \"transform every type of endeavor and domain of human knowledge, from medicine to manufacturing to warfare and national defense.\"",

      "Mr. Trump said \"a lot of very brilliant people\" tell him AI will dominate virtually every industry, although he said he doesn't know if that's true. The president said AI brings the possibility of peril, as well as progress.",
      "\"The daunting power of AI is really, it's not going to be a reason for retreat from this new frontier,\" Mr. Trump said. \"On the contrary, it is the more reason we must ensure it is pioneered first and best.\"",
      "AI is like a \"beautiful baby that's born,\" he said of the technology's current state.",
      "\"We have to grow that baby and let that baby thrive,\" the president said. That means allowing some regulation, but also cutting red tape, he said.",
      "The president thanked companies present at the summit for investing in data centers and other projects, saying they'll create thousands of jobs.",

      "Thousands of data centers are scattered around the U.S. Most are connected to the nation's power grid and rely on massive amounts of electricity to operate. The proliferation of AI data centers has been cited as one of the drivers of burgeoning energy costs.",
      "The number of data centers is only expected to grow as technology companies \u2014 including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI \u2014 ramp up construction to meet the nation's growing energy demand stemming from the emergence of AI.",
      "In addition to investments in data centers, the new White House plan also focuses on \"expediting and modernizing programs\" for semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs, and updating the nation's electric grid to support the enormous energy demands of AI supercomputing, Kratsios said.",
      "Another focus will be on reining in what White House officials have called an \"ideological bias\" in chatbots. This is something Sacks, a former PayPal executive, has highlighted after a 2024 incident in which Google's AI image generator created pictures of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show one of the countries Founding Fathers.",
      "\"We believe that AI systems should be free of ideological bias and not be designed to pursue socially engineered agendas,\" Sacks said on Wednesday. \"And so we have a number of proposals there on how to make sure that AI remains truth-seeking and trustworthy.\"",
      "To that end, Kratsios said the plan will update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with AI developers whose systems \"allow free speech expression to flourish.\"",
      "The plan also seeks to maintain the U.S.' edge in the global race for AI dominance as it competes with countries like China, which has moved quickly to expand its AI capabilities. A senior White House official said the report supports export controls to make sure \"that our most advanced technology doesn't get into the hands of [other] countries.\"",
      "As part of its efforts, the White House also seeks to remove what it refers to as \u00a0\"onerous regulation\" that the Trump administration says is hindering AI innovation. The official added that the plan calls for the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion and climate funding requirements from the Biden administration's CHIPS Act.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday is signing the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies.",
      "The law establishes federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House on Thursday by a 308-122 vote after being approved\u00a0in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The measure is part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",

      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 22:10:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Gabbard declassified a 2017 House report targeting Obama and intelligence officials over alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
    "story": [
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Wednesday declassified additional materials on the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's actions in the 2016 election, claiming in a social media\u00a0post and at a White House press briefing that they showed Obama administration officials \"manufactured\" information in order to undermine then-candidate Donald Trump.",
      "Her statement on X said the documents show Obama officials \"manufactured the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment that they knew was false, promoting the LIE that Vladimir Putin and the Russian government helped President Trump win the 2016 election.\"",
      "Democrats disputed her claims and accused Gabbard of misrepresenting the intelligence findings. Wednesday's report follows a separate set of declassified documents on the matter released by Gabbard Friday. In a memo accompanying those documents, she similarly accused Obama administration officials of plotting a \"years-long coup\" against Mr. Trump.",
      "Obama's spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said in a statement regarding the first set of materials, \"These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,\" he said, a likely reference to turmoil in Congress over the release of files related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Rodenbush also said nothing in last week's documents \"undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes.\" Rodenbush has not responded to the most recent release of material.",
      "Gabbard also said in her X statement that it was President Trump who made the decision to declassify the House Republicans' report.",
      "The Wednesday release was a declassified report that was compiled in 2017 and finalized in 2020 by the House Intelligence Committee's Republican majority \u2014 where FBI Director Kash Patel was a lead staffer at the time, according to two sources familiar with the matter. It focuses at length on the intelligence community's judgment that Russian president Vladimir Putin aspired to help President Trump to win the 2016 election.",
      "It includes discussions of raw intelligence provided by a human source to the CIA, as well as Signal intercepts gathered by the National Security Agency, prompting concerns from current and former intelligence officials and condemnation from Democrats about the risks it could pose to sensitive intelligence sources and methods.",
      "But the report does not fundamentally change previous assessments by the U.S. intelligence community \u2014 or the multiple reviews that followed.",
      "\"The desperate and irresponsible release of the partisan House intelligence report puts at risk some of the most sensitive sources and methods our Intelligence Community uses to spy on Russia and keep Americans safe,\" Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner said in a statement. \"And in doing so, Director Gabbard is sending a chilling message to our allies and assets around the world: the United States can no longer be trusted to protect the intelligence you share with us.\"",
      "An Office of the Directorate of National Intelligence official said the president's ultimate declassification authority meant he was not obligated to consult with intelligence agencies about redacting sensitive content in the report.",
      "At the White House briefing Monday, Gabbard accused President Obama of \"leading the manufacturing of this intelligence assessment.\" She told reporters that the documents would be sent to the Justice Department and FBI for investigation of \"criminal implications.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News correspondent Ed O'Keefe whether she thinks Obama is guilty of treason, Gabbard responded that she would leave criminal charges to the Justice Department, but said what occurred \"can only be described as a years-long coup and a treasonous conspiracy against the American people.\"",
      "She declined to directly answer another question from O'Keefe about how the latest declassified documents change previous assessments, given that the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 which included then-Sen. Marco Rubio \u2014 dedicated an entire volume of its five-volume investigation to the intelligence community's analysis..",
      "\"[W]e are ensuring that the intelligence community is not being politicized, Gabbard said. \"Look at the evidence and you will know the truth.\"",
      "The House committee's Republican-authored report criticizes the review of the analysis underlying the assessment that went into the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment, or ICA, for several reasons, including that its production was rushed to be released before Mr. Trump took office. It also claimed analysts failed to consider plausible alternative explanations for Putin's intentions and questioned whether they sufficiently took into account the human source's motivations, proximity to Putin or bias towards Trump.",
      "The GOP House committee report zeroes in on a piece of intelligence contained in a report from a human source that it contends was subjected to \"questionable interpretation\" by analysts.",
      "\"The unclear fragment (shown in bold) is part of a sentence in a [redacted] that reads, 'Putin had made this decision [to leak DNC emails] after he had come to believe that the Democratic nominee had better odds of winning the U.S. presidential election, and that [candidate Trump] whose victory Putin was counting on, most likely would not be able to pull off a convincing victory,'\" a bullet says on page 4 of the report.",
      "It adds that a senior CIA operations officer said at the time, \"We don't know what was meant by that\" and \"five people read it five ways.\"",
      "The findings align in many areas with a separate tradecraft review released earlier this month by CIA Director John Ratcliffe, which determined that the confidence level in the assessment that Putin aspired to help Trump win should have been \"moderate\" instead of \"high,\" chiefly because it was derived from one source instead of multiple. The CIA's report, however, did not include any detailed discussion of the sensitive sources or methods involved.",
      "The CIA's own review of the intelligence that informed the finding on Putin's preference \"confirmed that the clause was accurately represented\u2026and that the ICA authors' interpretation of its meaning was most consistent with the raw intelligence.\" It more broadly found that much of the tradecraft underlying the 2017 assessment was \"robust and consistent\" with analytic standards.",
      "The CIA declined to comment on the report released by Gabbard.",
      "Democrats seized on the timing of the disclosures \u2014 which they pointed out could have been made at any time during the first Trump administration or since he took office for a second time.",
      "\"It's appropriate that this shoddy and partisan report was released by Director Gabbard on the day that House Republicans are quite literally fleeing Washington, D.C., for six weeks rather than releasing the Epstein files that Trump is so desperate to cover up,\" said House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes.",
      "\"Given the rushed and unusual 'declassification' process the DNI has implemented, I fear that the public release of this report could compromise sensitive sources and methods and endanger our national security,\" Himes said.",
      "Ed  O'Keefe\n                  \n        contributed to this report."

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 22:06:15 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal appeals court said Wednesday that President Trump's executive order curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court said Wednesday that President Trump's executive order curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional.",
      "The policy, which has been the subject of a complicated monthslong legal back-and-forth, is currently on hold. But Wednesday's decision appears to mark the first time that an appellate court has weighed in on the merits of Mr. Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship for many children of undocumented immigrants by executive order.",
      "A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit wrote that Mr. Trump's order is \"invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment's grant of citizenship to 'all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'\"",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News: \"The Ninth Circuit misinterpreted the purpose and the text of the 14th Amendment. We look forward to being vindicated on appeal.\"",
      "On the first day of Mr. Trump's second term, he signed an executive order that said people born in the United States should not automatically get citizenship if one parent is undocumented and the other isn't a citizen or green-card holder, or if both parents are in the U.S. on temporary visas. The order directed federal agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents within 30 days to people who fall into those categories.",
      "The order drew a flurry of lawsuits, as most legal experts have said the 14th Amendment \u2014 which was ratified in 1868 \u2014 automatically offers citizenship to virtually everybody born within the U.S., regardless of their parents' immigration status, with extremely narrow exceptions.",
      "The Trump administration argues the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment does not apply to people whose parents are in the country illegally or temporarily \u2014 citing a clause that says citizenship is granted to those who are \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. Those parents do not necessarily have \"allegiance\" to the country, the government argues, so they therefore aren't \"subject to the jurisdiction.\"",
      "The 9th Circuit disagreed. It wrote Wednesday that a plain reading of the 14th Amendment suggests that citizenship was meant to be granted to anybody who is \"subject to the laws and authority of the United States.\"",
      "\"The Defendants' proposed interpretation of the Citizenship Clause relies on a network of inferences that are unmoored from the accepted legal principles of 1868,\" the judges wrote.",
      "\"Perhaps the Executive Branch, recognizing that it could not change the Constitution, phrased its Executive Order in terms of a strained and novel interpretation of the Constitution,\" the opinion said.",
      "The issue reached the 9th Circuit after a lower court in Washington state blocked the birthright citizenship executive order in February, responding to a lawsuit from several Democratic states. The Trump administration in March\u00a0appealed that ruling. It reasserted its arguments about who the 14th Amendment applies to, called the ruling \"vastly overbroad\" and argued the states did not have standing to sue over the order.",
      "On Wednesday, the 9th Circuit said the states did have the right to sue, pointing to the risk that states would be financially harmed by a federal policy that narrows who qualifies for citizenship. The appellate judges also upheld the district court's finding that the states are likely to succeed in showing the order violates the Constitution.",
      "The 9th Circuit's ruling was written by Clinton-appointed Judge Ronald Gould, and joined by Obama-appointed Judge Michael Daly Hawkins. A third member of the panel \u2014 Judge Patrick Bumatay, appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term \u2014 dissented in part, writing that the states don't have standing and adding \"it's premature to address the merits of the citizenship question or the scope of the injunction.\"",
      "Supreme Court hasn't weighed in on merits of birthright citizenship \u2014 yet",
      "The birthright citizenship issue reached the Supreme Court earlier this year, but not in a case involving the merits of the Trump administration's policy.",
      "Instead, the Supreme Court weighed in on whether the district courts that issued nationwide blocks against Mr. Trump's executive order were exceeding the scope of their power \u2014 a perennial topic of debate in legal circles that has frustrated presidents of both parties.",
      "The high court's ruling last month limited the use of nationwide injunctions. In a 6-3 decision, it granted a request by the administration to narrow the injunctions against the birthright citizenship order, but \"only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief.\"",
      "That doesn't mean the birthright citizenship order will take effect. Shortly after the ruling, a New Hampshire court paused the executive order\u00a0nationwide in a lawsuit that was brought as a class action, after the Supreme Court's decision left the door open to that option.",
      "The Supreme Court also did not directly address whether states can still sue over the order. In the case that the 9th Circuit ruled on Wednesday, the government has argued that courts can just block the birthright citizenship order for residents of the states that sued, rather than issuing a nationwide injunction. But the states argue that would provide them with incomplete relief because people move from state to state.",

    "summary": "In a new survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \"as satisfying or more satisfying\" than talking with real friends.",
    "story": [
      "No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence.",
      "The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister's birthday party.",
      "The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.",
      "\"Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,\" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. \"I think kids use AI to get out of thinking.\"",
      "For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you.\"",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, with 34% reporting daily usage or multiple times a week, according to\u00a0a new study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \"digital friends,\" like Character. AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",
      "In an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" on Wednesday, Common Sense founder and CEO Jim Steyer said what struck him about the study is that AI companions are \"everywhere in teens' lives.\"",
      "Common Sense's study also found that 11% of teens use AI companions to build up their courage and stand up for themselves, which Steyer said can be a good thing. However, he cautioned that problems arise when the technology replaces human relationships.",
      "\"Younger kids really trust these AI companions to be like friends or parents or therapists,\" Steyer said. \"They're talking about serious relationships, and these are robots. They're not human beings.\"",
      "As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,\" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. \"When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.\"",
      "All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an \"AI companion\" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.",
      "\"That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,\" said Nair. \"It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.\"",
      "How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers",
      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \"as satisfying or more satisfying\" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",
      "\"It's eye-opening,\" said Robb. \"When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.\" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.",
      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",
      "\"If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both.",
      "\"It's a challenge with how kids live today because they spend so many hours in front of a screen, and when you substitute a machine or a robot for human interaction, you're fundamentally changing the nature of that relationship,\" Steyer told CBS News.",
      "The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a \"risk assessment,\" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions.",
      "\"In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,\" Steyer said.",
      "A concerning trend to teens and adults alike",
      "Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot.",
      "\"Parents really have no idea this is happening,\" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up.\" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data.",
      "Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.",
      "Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.",
      "\"One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,\" said Telzer. \"They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.\"",
      "Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.",
      "\"If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,\" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.",
      "Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.",
      "\"I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,\" Perry said. \"I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.\"",
      "Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media.",
      "\"Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,\" Nair said. \"I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper \u2014 our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.\"",
      "\"It's the new addiction,\" Nair added. \"That's how I see it.\"",

    "summary": "ICE is on pace to record its most deportations since the Obama administration, internal government figures show.",
    "story": [
      "Halfway into President Trump's first year back in office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency spearheading his crackdown on illegal immigration, is on track to record the most deportations since the Obama administration, according to internal government figures obtained by CBS News.",
      "During the first six months of Mr. Trump's second presidency, ICE recorded nearly 150,000 deportations \u2014 or an average of more than 800 per day \u2014 putting the agency on a trajectory to carry out more than 300,000 removals in the president's first year back in office if deportations continue at the same pace, the data indicates.",
      "That would be the highest annual tally since fiscal year 2014, when the Obama administration recorded 316,000 ICE deportations, historical agency figures show. The government's fiscal year begins in October and ends at the end of September.",
      "Created after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, ICE is charged with deporting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally or whose legal status is revoked, including because of criminal offenses or allegations of immigration fraud. The highest deportation level reported by ICE occurred in fiscal year 2012, when the agency recorded 410,000 removals.",
      "While it would be a significant increase, more than 300,000 ICE deportations in a year would still be far short of the target of 1 million annual deportations that Trump administration officials have outlined, highlighting the operational and legal constraints on immigration enforcement that Republican and Democratic presidents alike have confronted.",
      "At the same time, it's possible ICE's deportation efforts could expand significantly in the next six months, since the agency just received an unprecedented infusion of funding through Mr. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, including $45 billion to set up more detention facilities and $30 billion to fund every stage of the deportation process.",
      "In an exclusive interview with CBS News last week, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said the 1 million annual deportation goal could \"definitely\" be \"possible\" with the new funds, saying the agency plans to use the money to hire 10,000 agents and officers to locate and arrest those suspected of being in the country illegally.",
      "ICE is also not the only federal agency that carries out deportations.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first six months, U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded more than 112,000 deportations, according to the internal government data. Those include deportations of migrants who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally, though illegal crossings there have plummeted to levels not seen since the 1960s amid Mr. Trump's government-wide crackdown.",
      "Additionally, the statistics show the Department of Homeland Security has tracked over 13,000 self-deportations since the start of Mr. Trump's second term. His administration has aggressively pushed those in the country illegally to self-deport by setting up a government app to facilitate the process, offering them a $1,000 self-deportation bonus and warning them that they will be detained, fined or even criminally prosecuted if they refuse to leave voluntarily.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, the top DHS spokeswoman, confirmed ICE's deportation tally six months into the administration. She said the administration has recorded more than 280,000 repatriations and self-deportations across the board \u2014 not just those conducted by ICE \u2014 since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "Mr. Trump, who campaigned on launching the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history, has given ICE a sweeping mandate. His administration has reversed Biden-era limits on immigration arrests in the U.S. interior, enlisted other federal agencies and the military to help ICE with its deportation goals and dramatically expanded the categories of those eligible for deportation, including by revoking the humanitarian protections of hundreds of thousands of migrants.",
      "In recent weeks, ICE has held record levels of detainees in its sprawling detention system. As of earlier this week, there were more than 57,000 detainees facing deportation in ICE custody, according to internal agency data. ICE arrests have roughly doubled since Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office, though they remain far below the daily goal of 3,000 set by Stephen Miller, one of the president's top White House advisers.",
      "While ICE routinely highlights arrests of those in the U.S. illegally who have been convicted of violent crimes, its enforcement efforts have also led to the detention of asylum-seekers attending immigration court hearings, workers in a variety of industries and other non-criminals suspected of being in the country without permission. Those operations have been strongly denounced by Democratic lawmakers and have triggered protests in communities throughout the country, including in southern California.",
      "A recent CBS News poll showed that Mr. Trump's deportation effort has lost the majority support it once enjoyed among the public, with a growing share of Americans expressing concerns about immigration authorities not focusing on arresting and deporting dangerous criminals.",
      "Lyons, the acting ICE director, told CBS News that his agency continues to prioritize the \"worst of the worst,\" but he said anyone found by his agents to be in the country illegally will be taken into custody and processed for deportation.",
      "\"We have opened up the whole aperture of the immigration portfolio,\" Lyons said.",

      "\"Maybe a house was taking one week to sell, and now we're kind of hovering at three weeks,\" Esser told CBS News.",
      "Part of the shift, Esser says, will be driven by more houses coming on the market. In May, there were 34% more sellers than buyers nationally, according to the real estate company Redfin. That is the highest rate since Redfin started gathering data in 2013.",
      "But this is still considered a seller's market because even though inventory is rising, so are prices, Esser says. That is partly driven by homeowners who locked in lower interest rates have little incentive to sell.",

      "Location plays a major role. Austin, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona, and most markets in Florida are better for buyers because there's more inventory, Redfin's data found, while Newark, New Jersey; Long Island, New York, and suburban Philadelphia favor sellers because there's less inventory.",

    "story": [
      "Bryan Kohberger\u00a0was sentenced to four life sentences without the possibility of parole on Wednesday after he pleaded guilty to the murders of four University of Idaho students in 2022.",
      "The surviving roommates and families of the victims delivered emotional statements at the sentencing hearing, held in a courtroom in Boise. When given the opportunity to speak, Kohberger declined to do so.",
      "Kohberger\u00a0pleaded guilty earlier this month to the murders\u00a0of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves as part of a plea deal that spared him\u00a0from the death penalty. He was in the courtroom Wednesday wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and listened as the families of the victims confronted him with powerful statements.",
      "The hearing lasted about three hours, with more than a dozen family impact statements read aloud.",
      "Chapin, Kernodle, Mogen and Goncalves were killed at a home in Moscow, Idaho, during the\u00a0early morning hours of Nov. 13, 2022. Kohberger was arrested at his\u00a0parents' home in Pennsylvania\u00a0six weeks later. Prosecutors said that if the case had gone to trial they would have used\u00a0DNA evidence\u00a0that linked Kohberger to the crime scene, his\u00a0online purchase history, surveillance video of Kohberger's car, and cellphone data that showed him in the vicinity of the killings. His motive is still unknown.",
      "Kohberger sentenced to life in prison",
      "Judge Steven Hippler spoke emotionally for several minutes before sentencing Kohberger. He called Kohberger a \"faceless coward\" and said he was in \"great awe\" of the family members who had given statements. He also criticized Kohberger for failing to show remorse or regret about the slayings. He said he could not legally force Kohberger to explain why he had committed the slayings, and said he did not believe Kohberger would answer the question truthfully either way.",
      "\"There is no reason for these crimes that could approach anything resembling rationality,\" Hippler said. \"No conceivable reason could make any sense, and in the end, the more we struggle to seek explanation for the unexplainable, the more we try to extract a reason, the more power and control we give to him. In my view, the time has now come to end Mr. Kohberger's 15 minutes of fame.\"",
      "After speaking, Hippler sentenced Kohberger to four consecutive sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole. He was also sentenced to 10 years in prison on the burglary charge. Kohberger did not react after the sentence was read out.",
      "For each charge, Kohberger was also charged $50,000. He also owes a civil penalty of $5,000, payable to the family of the victim, for each murder charge.",
      "Kohberger will be required to submit DNA as part of the plea deal, Hippler said. Kohberger has waived his right to an appeal, but can file a notice of appeal, Hippler said, though that notice might violate the plea agreement.",
      "Victim impact statements",
      "About two hours of the hearing were dedicated to statements read by the loved ones of the victims. The first victim impact statement was read on behalf of Bethany Funke, who had lived with the murdered students and called 911 after finding their bodies.",
      "\"That was the worst day of my life, and I know it always will be,\" Funke said in the statement, which was read by friend Emily Alant. Funke added that she checks her room every night to ensure there is no one hiding in the space, and said she has struggled to sleep since the slayings. Alant cried as she read the statement, while Kohberger showed no emotion.",
      "Dylan Mortensen, the other surviving roommate, was the next to speak. She was visibly distraught and took several moments to collect herself before beginning to read her statement through tears. She said she has struggled with panic attacks since the killings.",
      "\"I was barely 19 when he did this,\" Mortensen said. \"We had just celebrated my birthday at the end of September. I should have been figuring out who I was. I should have been having the college experience and starting to establish my future. Instead, I was forced to learn how to survive the unimaginable.\"",
      "Scott Laramie, Madison Mogen's stepfather, then read a victim impact statement on behalf of himself and Mogen's mother, Karen Laramie. He remembered Mogen as someone who \"always brought us joy\" and who prioritized spending time with her family before she was \"taken senselessly and brutally in a sudden act of evil.\"",
      "\"This world was a better place with her in it,\" Laramie said.",
      "Karen Laramie had a second statement read on her behalf by her lawyer, Leander James. Mogen's paternal grandmother Kim Cheeley also spoke, thanking prosecutors and law enforcement officials for \"bringing this case to closure.\"",
      "Mogen's father, Ben Mogen, said that his daughter had already earned all of the credits necessary for her degree at the time of the slayings, and wiped his eyes as he spoke.",
      "\"Maddie was my only child that I ever had. She's the only great thing I ever did and the only thing I was ever proud of,\" Ben Mogen said. He recounted taking her to concerts with friends, and shared a Father's Day card that he said was the last thing his daughter ever wrote to him, where she'd written \"I can't wait till we can hang out again soon.\"",
      "Steve Goncalves, the father of Kaylee Goncalves, turned the podium to address Kohberger directly. Kohberger continued to not react, though he made eye contact with Steve Goncalves as he spoke.",
      "\"Today, we're here to finish what you started,\" Steve Goncalves said. He called Kohberger a \"complete joke\" and said the families of the victims \"took this disaster\" and kept it focused on their loved ones.",
      "\"All anyone talked about when they talked about this case was Kaylee Jade, Maddie May, Xana and Ethan,\" Steve Goncalves said.",
      "He was followed by Alivea Goncalves, Kaylee Goncalves' older sister, who had also been close to Mogen. She again directly spoke to Kohberger, and he maintained eye contact with her, as she called him a sociopath.",
      "\"No one is scared of you today. No one is impressed by you. No one thinks you're important,\" Alivea Goncalves said. There was applause in the courtroom after she finished speaking. She was followed by her and Kaylee Goncalves' mother, Kristi, who again directly addressed Kohberger. Goncalves family attorney Shannon Grey read statements from Kaylee Goncalves' aunt and grandmothers.",
      "Jazzmin Kernodle, the older sister of Xana Kernodle, was the first member of her family to speak. She remembered her younger sister as a \"kind, funny\" woman who \"was everyone's best friend.\" Her father Jeff Kernodle spoke next. He said that the night of the murders, he had been just seven miles from the house and wanted to drive over \u2014 but decided against it because he had been drinking.",
      "\"I wish I would have drunk and drove. They would have had a chance, all four of them,\" Jeff Kernodle said.",
      "Next to speak was Kim Kernodle, Xana's aunt. She told Kohberger that she had \"forgiven\" him for the slayings.",
      "\"I no longer could live with that hate in my heart, and for me to become a better person, I have forgiven you. Any time you want to talk and tell me what happened, find my number. I'm here. \u2026 I'll be that one that will listen to you.\"",
      "Kernodle's uncle Stratton Kernodle and stepfather Randy Davis also spoke briefly, with Davis receiving applause after telling Kohberger to \"Go to hell.\" Karen Worthington, Xana Kernodle's mother, then addressed Kohberger directly, facing in his direction as she read a prepared statement. She also said she had forgiven Kohberger.",
      "\"I do not fear you or even let you rent space in my head anymore. This forgiveness has released me from any and all evil you have released on me and my family,\" she said.",
      "Prosecutor details process behind plea deal",
      "After the families finished speaking, prosecutor Bill Thompson took the podium. He walked through the past few weeks of the case, and said the families of the victims had only been interested in a plea agreement that saw Kohberger plead guilty on all counts and waive appeal on all of his motions, which would have \"consumed years or decades in the future.\"",
      "The families of the victims were\u00a0divided over the plea deal. Mogen's father told CBS News he was relieved to learn of the deal, saying it will allow his family to \"actually put this behind us.\" The Goncalves family has bitterly criticized the agreement, and\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0after a\u00a0gag order was lifted\u00a0that they believe the plea deal gives Kohberger a chance to live a \"better and more rewarding life inside\" prison.",
      "Thompson said the deal was kept confidential until the last minute because officials did not want to taint a prospective jury pool if the case did proceed to trial.",
      "\"Now, it is time for the judicial system to impose final judgement and close the door on this chapter of these tragedies,\" Thompson said.",
      "He asked that the judge sentence Kohberger to four consecutive life sentences in prison, one for each murder, and 10 years in prison on the burglary charge. As Thompson named each victim, their photo was shown in the courtroom. He also shared a group photo of the foursome. Crying could be heard in the courtroom as Thompson spoke.",
      "Kohberger declines to speak",
      "After Thompson spoke, Hippler asked the defense if they had evidence or an argument to present. The team said no.",
      "Hippler asked Kohberger if he would like to make a statement.",
      "\"I respectfully decline,\" Kohberger said. It was the first time he spoke all day.",
      "Family members could be heard murmuring, \"Surprise, surprise,\" and, \"Coward.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis barred federal immigration authorities from immediately taking Kilmar Abrego Garcia into custody once he is released from criminal confinement in Tennessee.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday barred federal immigration authorities from immediately taking Kilmar Abrego Garcia into custody once he is released from criminal confinement in Tennessee and ordered the Trump administration to provide him 72 hours' notice if it plans to initiate proceedings to remove him to a country that is not his place of origin.",
      "The order\u00a0from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis was issued as a federal judge in Tennessee, who is presiding over Abrego Garcia's criminal case, ruled that the Salvadoran national should be released from the custody of federal law enforcement under conditions that will be set by a magistrate judge.",
      "The Tennessee judge, Waverly Crenshaw, denied the Justice Department's request to revoke an order allowing Abrego Garcia to be released while awaiting a criminal trial, writing that the government \"failed to carry its burden of showing that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure Abrego's appearance or the safety of others.\"",
      "But Abrego Garcia will not be released from criminal custody immediately.",
      "The magistrate judge overseeing his case granted a request from his lawyers, made last week, to hold off on issuing the order directing Abrego Garcia's release for 30 days. The judge said he will continue to remain in the custody of U.S. Marshals.",
      "\"These rulings are a powerful rebuke of the government's lawless conduct and a critical safeguard for Kilmar's due process rights,\" Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, said in a statement. \"A federal judge has now barred ICE from taking him back into custody and ordered that any future deportation attempt must come with advance notice. After the government unlawfully deported him once without warning, this legal protection is essential.\"",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, attacked Xinis for her decision.",
      "\"The fact this unhinged judge is trying to tell ICE they can't arrest an MS-13 gang member, indicted by a grand jury for human trafficking, and subject to immigration arrest under federal law is LAWLESS AND INSANE,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Abrego Garcia was charged with two criminal counts of human smuggling last month and has pleaded not guilty. While the magistrate judge said he should be released from the custody of U.S. Marshals ahead of a trial, set to begin in January, the order prompted concerns that Abrego Garcia would then be swiftly detained by federal immigration authorities and deported.",
      "But Xinis' order limits the Trump administration's ability to swiftly remove him from the U.S. In addition to blocking Trump administration officials from taking Abrego Garcia into custody upon his release in Tennessee, Xinis ordered the Department of Homeland Security to return him to supervised release under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Baltimore field office. She said Abrego Garcia should be returned to Maryland, where he lives with his family.",
      "Under that supervision order, issued in 2019, Abrego Garcia had permission to live in Maryland, as well as authorization to work. He was required to check in with an immigration officer at the ICE office in Baltimore. Court filings indicate Abrego Garcia was in compliance with the ICE supervision order when he was deported to El Salvador.",
      "Xinis said her relief allows the Trump administration to initiate immigration proceedings once Abrego Garcia returns to Maryland, but said those proceedings must begin in Baltimore, which was handling the earlier ICE supervision order.",
      "\"Once Abrego Garcia is restored under the ICE Supervision Order out of the Baltimore Field Office, defendants may take whatever action is available to them under the law,\" Xinis said.",
      "Xinis, who sits on the federal district court in Maryland, wrote that she \"must accord modest relief\" that ensures Abrego Garcia is not subject to \"re-deportation without due process\" and ensures the fulfillment of her order earlier this year that required the Trump administration to return him to the U.S. from El Salvador.",
      "Administration officials, she wrote, \"have done little to assure the court that absent intervention, Abrego Garcia's due process rights will be protected.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who visited Abrego Garcia when he was detained in El Salvador, cheered Xinis' decision.",
      "\"It's clear this administration would rather deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a third country, with no chance at due process, than argue their case in court. This order will prevent that, and ensure that Kilmar Abrego Garcia is returned to Maryland following the U.S. District Court in Tennessee's determination that he does not pose any threat to the public,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Abrego Garcia, who entered the U.S. illegally in 2011, was detained by ICE in March and sent to a Salvadoran prison along with hundreds of other deportees despite a 2019 court order that barred him from being sent back to El Salvador due to a fear of persecution by gangs. The Trump administration acknowledged Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but he remained there for months \u2014 despite Xinis ordering the government to facilitate his return \u2014 until he was brought to Tennessee to face criminal charges.",
      "While the magistrate judge said he should be released pending trial, the prospect that Abrego Garcia would then swiftly be detained by the Department of Homeland Security for removal proceedings created a new tangle for the courts to unravel. He has remained in the custody of U.S. Marshals as the legal proceedings have continued.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked the Tennessee court last week to put off his release from custody for 30 days if Crenshaw denied the Justice Department's bid to keep him in confinement while awaiting trial \u2014 which the judge did Wednesday.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said in seeking the delay in his release last week that they had been advised by the government that \"if the court denies the government's motion for revocation, the defendant would be transferred to the custody of the Department of Homeland Security ('DHS'), and DHS would begin removal proceedings.\"",
      "But earlier this month, Xinis heard testimony about how Abrego Garcia's deportation proceedings could be handled by ICE. An immigration official told the judge that if Abrego Garcia were to be released from pretrial detention in Tennessee, the agency had not determined where he would be sent.",
      "\"There's been no decision made, as he is not in ICE custody,\" Thomas Giles, assistant director for ICE enforcement and removal operations, testified in federal court in Maryland.",
      "Giles was in court after Xinis ordered the government to produce someone with firsthand knowledge of any third country other than El Salvador where Abrego Garcia could be deported to if he were released from criminal custody.",
      "If Abrego Garcia were to receive a notice of removal, up until his deportation, he would be able to express fear about going to a third country, a period of time that could range from \"a day to a week,\" Giles said.",
      "In a hearing on June 26, Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn said that if the Salvadoran man were to be released, ICE would begin removal proceedings to a third country, which is one that is not the country of origin, instead of his native El Salvador.",
      "During the arguments earlier this month, Xinis said she was not willing to allow for an \"unfettered release\" of Abrego Garcia into ICE custody so he can be \"spirited away\" and removed from the U.S. before she rules.",
      "\"We're a court of laws and we don't operate on 'take my word for it,'\" Xinis said. \"From day one, you have taken the presumption of regularity and destroyed it in my view.\"",

      "\"Across the U.S., women riders and drivers have told us they want the option to be matched with other women on trips,\" Uber said in its statement.",
      "However, longer wait times could be an issue for women who want to get picked up by a female driver, given that Uber\u00a0has said\u00a0about 1 in 5 of its drivers are women. Customers can also pre-book rides with women drivers, the company said Wednesday.",
      "\"That is what we expect to learn more about during this pilot. Riders may experience longer wait times if women drivers are unavailable or further away. If so, they can choose to wait, reserve a ride with a woman driver for a later time, or choose a ride with any available driver that may not match their preference,\" an Uber spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Riders can also set a preference for women drivers in their Uber settings, which will boost the chances of being paired with a female driver, although such a match isn't guaranteed, the company said.",

      "AI is like a \"beautiful baby that's born,\" he said of the technology's current state.",
      "\"We have to grow that baby and let that baby thrive,\" the president said. That means allowing some regulation, but also cutting red tape, he said.",
      "The president thanked companies present at the summit for investing in data centers and other projects, saying they'll create thousands of jobs.",
      "The Wednesday announcement is co-hosted by the bipartisan Hill and Valley Forum and the All-In Podcast, a business and technology show hosted by four technology investors and entrepreneurs who include Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar David Sacks.",
      "\"The goal here is for the United States to win the AI race,\" Sacks said during a press call with reporters Wednesday morning.",
      "The plan is backed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and will be carried out over the next six months to a year, according to Michael Kratsios, policy director of the OSTP.",
      "\"This is a watershed day for Trump to lay out the AI vision and make sure the U.S. stays ahead of China despite all the trade deal turmoil,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What is the AI Action Plan?",
      "The AI Action Plan focuses on accelerating AI innovation and building out AI infrastructure to ensure the U.S. leads in international \"AI diplomacy,\" according to Sacks, who laid out the plan's major pillars during Wednesday's call.",
      "That includes expediting the construction of large-scale data centers, which house servers, networking gear and other technology used to power artificial intelligence.",
      "Thousands of data centers are scattered around the U.S. Most are connected to the nation's power grid and rely on massive amounts of electricity to operate. The proliferation of AI data centers has been cited as one of the drivers of burgeoning energy costs.",
      "The number of data centers is only expected to grow as technology companies \u2014 including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI \u2014 ramp up construction to meet the nation's growing energy demand stemming from the emergence of AI.",
      "In addition to investments in data centers, the new White House plan also focuses on \"expediting and modernizing programs\" for semiconductor fabrication plants, or fabs, and updating the nation's electric grid to support the enormous energy demands of AI supercomputing, Kratsios said.",
      "Another focus will be on reining in what White House officials have called an \"ideological bias\" in chatbots. This is something Sacks, a former PayPal executive, has highlighted after a 2024 incident in which Google's AI image generator created pictures of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show one of the countries Founding Fathers.",
      "\"We believe that AI systems should be free of ideological bias and not be designed to pursue socially engineered agendas,\" Sacks said on Wednesday. \"And so we have a number of proposals there on how to make sure that AI remains truth-seeking and trustworthy.\"",
      "To that end, Kratsios said the plan will update federal procurement guidelines to ensure the government only contracts with AI developers whose systems \"allow free speech expression to flourish.\"",
      "The plan also seeks to maintain the U.S.' edge in the global race for AI dominance as it competes with countries like China, which has moved quickly to expand its AI capabilities. A senior White House official said the report supports export controls to make sure \"that our most advanced technology doesn't get into the hands of [other] countries.\"",
      "As part of its efforts, the White House also seeks to remove what it refers to as \u00a0\"onerous regulation\" that the Trump administration says is hindering AI innovation. The official added that the plan calls for the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion and climate funding requirements from the Biden administration's CHIPS Act.",
      "DEI regulations within the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act \"burden the industry\" and \"slow down the delivery of critical projects,\" they said.",

    "story": [
      "The fallout from Elon Musk's plunge into politics a year ago is still hammering electric vehicle-maker Tesla, as both sales and profits dropped sharply again in the latest quarter.",
      "Tesla revenue dropped 12%, and profits slumped 16% in the three months through June as buyers continued to steer clear, and in some cases, turn to more affordable competitors' offerings.",
      "\"The perception of Elon Musk, its chief executive, has rubbed the sheen right out of what once was a darling and soaring automotive brand,\" Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said in a research note, in which he called Tesla \"a toxic brand that is inseparable from its leader.\"",
      "Quarterly profits at the electric vehicle, battery and robotics company fell to $1.17 billion, or $0.33 a share, from $1.4 billion, or $0.40 a share, dropping for a third straight quarter. On an adjusted basis, the company said it earned $0.40, in line with Wall Street analysts' estimates.",
      "Revenue fell from $25.5 billion to $22.5 billion in the April through June period, slightly beating Wall Street's forecast.",
      "Tesla shares were little changed in after-hours trading as investors awaited Musk's comments on the company's earnings call.",
      "Betting on robotaxis",
      "Musk, who helped elect President Donald Trump with a massive campaign donation and then headed his DOGE cost-cutting program, has pinned the future of the company squarely on its autonomous Robotaxi venture, which launched in Austin, Texas last month. It's expected to take years, though, before Musk's focus on robotaxis and humanoid robots turns a profit or the company.",
      "\"We are at a 'positive crossroads' in the Tesla story: Musk is laser focused as CEO, Robotaxi/autonomous expansion has begun, demand stabilization has begun especially in China, and Tesla is about to embark on an aggressive AI focused strategy that we believe will include owning a significant piece of xAI,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note. \"While near-term and this quarter the numbers are nothing to write home about, we believe investors are instead focused on the AI future at Tesla with a motivated Musk back driving Tesla's future.\"",
      "Foreign EV buyers have also turned away from Tesla toward competitors' vehicles, research shows. Musk alienated potential Tesla customers in Great Britain, France, Germany and elsewhere through his political activities. Rival electric vehicle makers such as China's BYD and German's Volkswagen, meanwhile, have gained market share.",
      "Tesla faces other headwinds, too. The new federal budget just passed by Congress eliminates a $7,500 credit for EV buyers. It also wipes out penalties for car makers that exceed carbon emission standards. That threatens Tesla's business of selling its \"carbon credits\" to traditional car companies that regularly fall short of emission standards.",
      "Tesla generated $439 million from credit sales, down sharply from $890 million a year ago.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 17:59:50 -0400",
    "summary": "This week's U.S. trade agreement with Japan could provide a framework for a pact with the European Union, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and the European Union are racing to clinch a trade deal\u00a0by the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, with economists warning that a sharp hike in tariffs could raise costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "As the clock ticks down, a series of pacts with other U.S. trading partners in recent days have raised hopes of avoiding a potentially damaging trade war with Europe, with experts saying a\u00a0deal with Japan announced on Tuesday could serve as a template for a deal with the EU.",
      "The U.S. has also recently announced the outlines of trade deals with China, Indonesia, the Philippines and U.K., though with many details still remaining to be finalized.",
      "For consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, much is riding on the outcome of the trade talks. Absent a deal, President Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tax. In preparing possible countermeasures, the European Commission has said it would impose tariffs on more than $100 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Aug. 7, AFP reported on Wednesday.",
      "Negotiations are ongoing and a U.S.-EU trade war could yet be avoided. Citing EU diplomats, AFP also said officials with the trading block could be open to a 15% U.S. tariff rate, with potential carveouts for key sectors, according to the wire service.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the status of talks with the EU, including whether the Trump administration expects to reach a trade deal by the Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday struck a trade deal with Tokyo that calls for a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, the deal calls for Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including cars and certain farm products.",
      "The 15% tariff rate on Japanese goods is five percentage points higher than a baseline tariff the Trump administration imposed on all foreign imports on April 2. But it is lower than the 25% he threatened against Japan earlier this month and the 24% duties his administration\u00a0proposed\u00a0in early April.",
      "\"The Japan deal solidifies this pattern we've seen thus far, which is some market access relief, a commitment to purchase U.S. goods, and a slightly lower, but above the universal baseline, tariff level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a public policy research firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The Japan deal certainly provides a framework of what [Mr. Trump] looking for,\" Jacquez said. \"It's about accepting a baseline tariff at or above 10%, and then making purchase commitments.\"",
      "Key catalysts for trade deals",
      "A key element of Mr. Trump's trade deals has been a commitment by other nations to invest in the U.S. The president has defended tariffs as a way to revive the country's domestic manufacturing base and make American exports more competitive, as well as to generate additional federal revenue.",
      "\"We are learning that the promise of greater investment into the U.S. works well with the administration,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said. \"The promise to invest $550 billion was a big part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal. It was a key catalyst to securing a deal.\"",
      "The EU, whose member states have a combined gross domestic product of $20 trillion, could likely commit to a large investment in the U.S. because it could span a number of years and focus on key sectors, such as technology, energy or artificial intelligence, Daco added.",
      "Additional commitments by the EU to purchase American-made goods and to lower trade barriers to U.S. exports could also help close a deal, he said. \"Those don't cost much, and they're an easy bargaining chip to put forward.\"",
      "Risk of higher prices",
      "Although a 15% baseline U.S. tariff on EU imports would represent a retrenchment from Mr. Trump's earlier threats, it would still drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, according to Daco.",
      "\"While it may seem like a great deal, it's still much higher than the tariffs that the U.S. was imposing at the end of 2024,\" he noted. \"So there would still be a positive inflation shock because of higher tariffs. There would also be demand erosion coming from reduced business investment, hiring,and reduced consumer spending as a result of these higher tariffs.\"",
      "Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports is around 15%, according to his analysis. If Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs go into effect, that rate would rise to more than 20%. If the EU agrees to a 15% tariff rate, however, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports from around the world would drop to 19.5%.",
      "\"That's still a significant increase in the average rate,\" Daco said. \"It's a lot higher than the 2.5% where we started the year.\"",
      "Because most U.S. imports from the EU include industrial inputs like components, raw materials and machinery, any added costs would take tie to work their way through the supply chain, according to Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"It would \u00a0affect manufacturing exports faster than it would affect American consumers, but it would raise prices all around,\" Young said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte Macron filed a defamation lawsuit against right-wing podcast host Candace Owens on Wednesday in response to claims she peddled that France's first lady was born a man.",
      "The 22-count complaint was filed in Delaware Superior Court and seeks an unspecified amount of damages from Owens, who broadcast an eight-part series spreading a host of allegations about the Macrons, including that Brigitte Macron was born a man, stole another person's identity and transitioned to a woman.",
      "The Macrons said in the lawsuit that Owens rebuffed three separate demands for retractions, with the first coming in December and the final sent July 1, and continued to push \"outlandish, defamatory, and far-fetched fictions\" about the French president and first lady.",
      "\"These claims are demonstrably false, and Owens knew they were false when she published them,\" the lawsuit states. \"Yet, she published them anyway. And the reason is clear: it is not the pursuit of truth, but the pursuit of fame.\"",
      "Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron said in a statement that they decided to file their lawsuit after Owens doubled down on the falsehoods despite their lawyers' retraction requests.",
      "\"Ms. Owens' campaign of defamation was plainly designed to harass and cause pain to us and our families and to garner attention and notoriety,\" they said. \"We gave her every opportunity to back away from these claims, but she refused. It is our earnest hope that this lawsuit will set the record straight and end this campaign of defamation once and for all.\"",
      "In response to the lawsuit, a spokesperson for Owens said: \"Candace Owens is not shutting up. This is a foreign government attacking the First Amendment rights of an American independent journalist. Candace repeatedly requested an interview with Brigitte Macron. Instead of offering a comment, Brigitte is resorting to trying to bully a reporter into submission. In France, politicians can bully journalists, but this is not France. It's America.\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Owens went live on YouTube in response to the defamation lawsuit, calling it a public relations strategy, and she refused to back down from her claim against Brigitte Macron. She started her livestream with a clip from the movie \"Gladiator\" in which Russell Crowe's character exclaimed \"Are you not entertained?\"",
      "\"This is why you're here,\" Owens told her audience. \"This is how I feel right now. Me receiving my papers today.\"",
      "\"If read through this ... Brigitte actually and intentionally defames me throughout the filing. It says all these things are untrue, attributes quotations to me that I've never said,\" she said as she went through parts of the filing.",
      "The lawsuit takes aim at Owens for promoting unfounded theories and spreading misinformation and said she aims to \"inflame and attract attention through sensationalism and conspiracy theories.\" It alleges that the podcaster published the eight-part series about the Macrons, called \"Becoming Brigitte,\" and related posts on X with reckless disregard for the truth.",
      "\"These lies have caused tremendous damage to the Macrons,\" the suit states. Owens and her entities, it continues, have \"subjected the Macrons to a campaign of global humiliation, turning their lives into fodder for profit-driven lies. Owens has dissected their appearance, their marriage, their friends, their family, and their personal history\u2014twisting it all into a grotesque narrative designed to inflame and degrade. The result is relentless bullying on a worldwide scale.\"",
      "Macron has been president of France since 2017. He and Brigitte Macron married in 2007.",
      "In addition to naming Owens as a defendant, the suit names her company, Candace Owens LLC, and the operator of her website, GeorgeTom, Inc.",
      "The baseless claims targeting Brigitte Macron began around March 2021 and were picked up by Owens in March 2024, while she was working for The Daily Wire, a conservative media outlet co-founded by Ben Shapiro, according to the lawsuit. She was fired from the outlet later that month.",
      "Following her termination, Owens launched her podcast, called \"Candace,\" in June 2024 and continued to push the allegations about Brigitte Macron.",
      "The Macrons sent their first retraction demand to Owens in December 2024, after which she published the multi-part podcast series that the couple said raised \"false and defamatory allegations\" about Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron. The third and final demand for a retraction was sent earlier this month.",
      "The Macrons allege in their suit that Owens published the defamatory statements knowing they were false, and said she acted with reckless disregard for the truth. The standard in defamation lawsuits brought by public figures is actual malice, which requires a plaintiff alleging defamation to show that the defendant knew the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for its falsity in order to prevail.",
      "France's president and first lady said Owens had a financial motivation to continue pushing the claims about Brigitte Macron, as her podcast series was monetized and used to solicit contributions, promote subscriptions and raise her brand.",
      "Tom Clare, who is representing the Macrons, said Owens' conduct is a\"clear-cut case of defamation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it will allow President Trump to fire three members of the independent Consumer Product Safety Commission, a victory for the president as he tests the bounds of his removal powers.",
      "The order from the court is the latest in which it has refused to reinstate independent regulators who were fired by the president without cause. It comes as Mr. Trump has moved to exert more control over the executive branch and has been overseeing a reorganization of federal agencies.",
      "The unsigned decision appeared to fall along ideological lines, and came over the dissent of the three liberal justices, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.",
      "The Supreme Court said the bid by the Trump administration to remove the trio of commissioners is controlled by its earlier ruling in a case known as Trump v. Wilcox that allowed the firings of members of two independent labor boards.",
      "\"Although our interim orders are not conclusive as to the merits, they inform how a court should exercise its equitable discretion in like cases. The stay we issued in Wilcox reflected 'our judgment that the government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty,'\" the court said. \"The same is true on the facts presented here, where the Consumer Product Safety Commission exercises executive power in a similar manner as the National Labor Relations Board, and the case does not otherwise differ from Wilcox in any pertinent respect.\"",
      "Kagan, in a dissent joined by Sotomayor and Jackson, accused the majority of using the court's emergency docket to \"destroy the independence of an independent agency, as established by Congress.\"",
      "The request for emergency relief from the high court by Solicitor General D. John Sauer arose from a federal judge's decision last month that found Mr. Trump's removal of the three commissioners \u2014 Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric and Richard Trumka Jr. \u2014 was unlawful and blocked their terminations.",
      "The officials had been named to the five-member Consumer Product Safety Commission by former President Joe Biden for seven-year terms. Boyle's term was set to end in October, Hoehn-Saric's time on the panel was due to end in October 2027 and Trumka's in October 2028.",
      "But in May, the three were told that their positions were terminated, effective immediately. Under federal law, a president cannot remove a commissioner at-will, but only for neglect of duty or malfeasance.",
      "The removed members sued over their terminations in May and asked a federal judge in Maryland, where the Consumer Product Safety Commission is headquartered, to restore them to their positions. They succeeded in their bid last month, when U.S. District Judge Matthew Maddox allowed the three commissioners to resume their roles on the panel.",
      "\"Depriving this five-member commission of three of its sitting members threatens severe impairment of its ability to fulfill its statutory mandates and advance the public's interest in safe consumer products,\" Maddox wrote in his decision. \"This hardship and threat to public safety significantly outweighs any hardship defendants might suffer from plaintiffs' participation on the CPSC.\"",
      "A unanimous panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit declined to block the district court's decision and allow Mr. Trump to fire the commissioners.",
      "The commissioners, Judge James Wynn wrote in a brief opinion, \"were appointed to serve fixed terms with statutory protections designed to preserve the commission's independence and partisan balance. Permitting their unlawful removal would thwart that purpose and deprive the public of the commission's full expertise and oversight. And because the attempted removals were unlawful, the Plaintiff-Commissioners never ceased to lawfully occupy their offices.\"",
      "The Supreme Court's order blocks the district judge's decision that reinstated the commissioners to their roles.",
      "Sauer's emergency appeal to the Supreme Court regarding the commissioners' firings was one of several involving the president's power to remove executive officers, which his administration has argued is largely unrestricted.",
      "The justices in May cleared the way for Mr. Trump to remove without cause two members of two different independent labor boards while legal fights over their terminations move forward. Over the dissent of the three liberal justices, the high court's unsigned decision said that the risk of harm to the government outweighs that of the removed officers, the line it cited in Wednesday's ruling.",
      "Sauer said that May decision from the high court regarding the removals of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board should have foreclosed the reinstatement of the Consumer Product Safety Commission members. The district court's order, he wrote, effectively transfers control of the panel from Mr. Trump to three members who were appointed by his predecessor.",
      "\"That plain-as-day affront to the President's fundamental Article II powers warrants intervention now,\" the solicitor general wrote.",
      "In her dissent, Kagan accused the conservative majority of effectively overturning the 1935 decision in the case\u00a0Humphrey's Executor v. United States, which said Congress could impose removal protections for the members of certain independent agencies.",
      "\"The majority has acted on the emergency docket \u2014 with 'little time, scant briefing, and no argument' \u2014 to override Congress's decisions about how to structure administrative agencies so that they can perform their prescribed duties,\" she wrote. \"By means of such actions, this Court may facilitate the permanent transfer of authority, piece by piece by piece, from one branch of Government to another.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 14:48:17 -0400",
    "summary": "The Education Department has temporarily paused loan forgiveness for an income-based repayment plan. Here are the details.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who are enrolled in a popular repayment plan are now in limbo, with the Department of Education saying it has temporarily paused forgiveness for borrowers in its income-based repayment plan, or IBR.",
      "Such plans offer a double benefit for borrowers by lowering a person's monthly loan repayment to reflect their income, while also promising to provide forgiveness after a number of years. Specifically, the government can cancel the balance of student loan after people have made payments for at least 20 years.",
      "About 40% of the roughly 33 million people repaying student loans were enrolled in one of the Education Department's four such repayment plans at the end of 2024, according to data from the National Student Loan Data System and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "But three of those programs had previously been halted by a court ruling, while forgiveness for the roughly 2 million people enrolled in the fourth \u2014 IBR \u2014 is now also paused.",
      "On Tuesday, Education Department deputy press secretary Ellen Keast told CBS MoneyWatch that the agency \"has temporarily paused discharges for IBR borrowers in order to comply with ongoing court injunctions regarding the Biden Administration's illegal attempts at student loan forgiveness.\"",
      "The court injunctions stem from 2024\u00a0lawsuits related to the Biden administration's flagship student loan repayment plan, called the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. That initiative, created to fix long-standing issues with the Education Department's previous income-based plans, proved popular with borrowers, with almost 8 million enrollees at the end of 2024, National Student Loan Data System data shows.",
      "Because the SAVE plan could count toward loan discharges in the IBR program, the Education Department is now temporarily halting forgiveness for enrollees in that plan. The Education Department said the loan discharges will resume at some point, but didn't provide a timeframe for when that might occur.",
      "What income-driven repayment plans are legally blocked?",
      "Student loan forgiveness under three of the federal government's income-driven plans \u2014 SAVE; Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR); and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) \u2014 is currently paused after a court ruled last summer that Congress exceeded its authority in approving those plans.",
      "The legal action last year called into question whether student loan forgiveness was authorized under the federal statute that governs those plans. But the IBR plan was created under a different authority.",
      "When will the Education Department start forgiving loans again?",
      "The Education Department didn't specify a timeframe in its statement to CBS MoneyWatch. It noted that the SAVE plan allowed forbearances \u2014 when loan payments are temporarily halted or reduced \u2014 to be counted toward loan forgiveness, but that the rule was halted by the court ruling.",
      "Because of the injunction, the Education Department said it needs to recalculate how many payments made by borrowers should contribute toward repayment.",
      "\"Legal IBR discharges will resume as soon as the Department is able to establish the correct payment count,\" said Keast of the Education Department.",
      "Should a borrower continue making IBR payments for now?",
      "Yes. Borrowers in the federal IBR plan are eligible to have their student loans canceled after making payments for at least 20 years. However, some people eligible for such forgiveness have yet to see their loans canceled. They should continue making those payments, and the Education Department will eventually refund them, according to the agency.",
      "\"For any borrower that makes a payment after the date of borrower eligibility, the Department will refund overpayments when the discharges resume,\" Keast said.",
      "Borrowers can also request forbearance from their loan servicer. In that case, interest would continue to accrue on any remaining balance.",

    "story": [
      "Dewey Yopp, a retired U.S. Army Special Forces officer, was sent to Afghanistan in 2002 to train up a new Afghan army during the early days of the war in Afghanistan. He met Amir, his then-18-year-old Afghan translator, at the airport on his first day there, and says Amir went on to save his life four times.",
      "\"Amir dragged me, under fire, to a medevac point,\" Yopp told CBS News of one of those instances.",
      "After the U.S. withdrew from the country in 2021, Yopp scrambled to get Amir a special immigrant visa for Afghan allies. Amir asked CBS News to conceal his real name for safety reasons.",
      "\"If someone saves your life, your souls are bound together for eternity,\" Yopp said. \"He's like a son to me, really.\"",
      "Three years later, Amir's visa was approved, and he and his family were given green cards. They came to the U.S. and settled in Kentucky, reuniting with Yopp 22 years after they first met in Afghanistan.",
      "Yopp now spends most days with Amir's children, who call him \"grandfather.\"",
      "Thousands of Afghans living in the U.S. now fear deportation after a federal appeals court late Monday\u00a0refused to freeze\u00a0the Trump administration's efforts to end their legal status. Amir is a Special Immigrant Visa recipient, given to U.S. allies who helped during the war. Despite he and his family having green cards, he still fears being sent back, since the White House has threatened to deport green card holders, too.",
      "Amir risked Taliban retaliation to help American soldiers, because work in Afghanistan at the time was scarce and the prospect of safety abroad was enticing. He told CBS News the promise that was made to him in return for risking his life was, \"Your family will go to America. This was promised with all who work with U.S.\"",
      "Amir said he went into hiding for years after his service, feeling betrayed by the U.S., until Yopp stepped in to fulfill America's pledge and helped secure him his visa. Thousands of veterans of the Afghanistan war across the country have taken it upon themselves to help their translators and other Afghan allies come safely to the U.S. and settle here. But Amir says it is not the job of veterans to fulfill the vow of protection the government previously made to them.",
      "The Trump administration\u00a0has repeatedly targeted\u00a0Afghan refugees, stopping flights with Afghan allies from arriving, freezing resettlement services, putting Afghanistan on the travel ban list, and ending the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Afghan refugees. Yopp says it is a \"moral injury\" to veterans to see this happen to those who helped them during the war.",
      "As part of the administration's efforts to end the TPS program, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem\u00a0has claimed\u00a0that Afghanistan is now safe for Afghans to return to, a point Amir disputes.",
      "\"OK, if Afghanistan is safe, why are you saying to your citizens, 'Do not go to Afghanistan?'\" Amir said in reference to the State Department's \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for Afghanistan. \"For me, [it's] safe, but for you, [it's] not safe? I'm not sure.\"",
      "Amir fears that even as a green card holder, he and his family may be sent back, since the White House has threatened to deport green card holders, too.",
      "These days, he works two jobs, seven days a week, to support his family. He says he only got by in the past because of the $500 a month that Yopp, who is retired, would give him.",
      "\"It's been a slap in the face, really, to see the programs that were in effect, to be taken away,\" Yopp said.",
      "Amir added: \"Americans should not make a promise with Afghans, and now [you're] making a problem for them. Then why [did] you make [that] promise?\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-court-polluters-greenhouse-gas-emissions/",
    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 19:49:52 -0400",
    "summary": "The island nation of Vanuatu prevailed in its landmark request to legally compel countries to cut emissions and compensate places facing impacts from climate change.",
    "story": [
      "The Republic of Vanuatu, a South Pacific island nation of 320,000 people, has led a growing effort since 2021 to compel the United Nations to answer one of the most crucial legal questions related to climate change: Can polluters be held legally accountable for the harm they've caused as a result of releasing large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere?",
      "The short answer is: yes. Fifteen judges who make up the International Court of Justice, located at The Hague in the Netherlands, issued a unanimous advisory opinion saying countries \"have a duty to prevent significant harm to the environment by acting with due diligence and to use all means at their disposal to prevent activities carried out within their jurisdiction or control from causing significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment.\"",
      "The court further stated that existing environmental treaties, international human rights law, and participation in the United Nations further compels countries to do everything possible to protect the climate. Any wrongful act that violates these agreements must be immediately stopped, followed by \"full reparations\" and compensation made to the injured parties.",
      "\"Vanuatu looks forward to collaborating with other States on implementing the Court's decision,\" Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's minister of climate change and environment, said in a statement. \"A victory in the world's highest court is just the beginning. Success will depend on what happens next through coordinated efforts across diplomacy, politics, litigation, and advocacy to turn this moment into a true turning point.\"",
      "For Vanuatu, a country that comprises 83 islands with a combined size roughly the same as Connecticut, the decision is monumental. Officials said the country was responsible for less than 0.0004% of global cumulative greenhouse gas emissions between 1962 and 2022, but experiences disproportionate impacts of climate change.",
      "In addition to its average temperature rising, Vanuatu is seeing more severe and intense tropical cyclones. In 2023, it was hit by three cyclones that were Category 4 or higher, impacting nearly 200,000 residents and costing the country more than $400 million in economic damages. The western tropical Pacific Ocean has risen 4-6 inches between 1992-2020, which is particularly dangerous for the country as much of it is low-lying and vulnerable to erosion. All of this, along with increased precipitation and periods of drought, has caused entire communities to be relocated by the government, and the impacts are anticipated to grow more severe.",
      "\"Today, the world's smallest countries have made history,\" Vishal Prasad, director of Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change, said in a statement. \"The ICJ's decision brings us closer to a world where governments can no longer turn a blind eye to their legal responsibilities. It affirms a simple truth of climate justice: those who did the least to fuel this crisis deserve protection, reparations, and a future. This ruling is a lifeline for Pacific communities on the frontline.\"",
      "While the advisory opinion is not legally binding, environmental organizations and law experts are hopeful that the ruling can set a legal precedent for the thousands of climate change cases around the world that are attempting to hold larger governments and companies accountable for climate pollution.",
      "\"This opinion can serve as a compass for countries who are thinking about how to prioritize justice and prioritize the safety of their citizens while also being in compliance with international law,\" said Carly Phillips, a research scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists who worked with the legal teams of seven countries that submitted supporting statements to the court asking for the opinion.",
      "The United States does not accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, but it did submit a written statement in March 2024 and participated in oral arguments, arguing that members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 2015 Paris Agreement already compel signatories to address climate change impacts and protects them from accountability for harming the climate.",
      "But Vanuatu's Prime Minister Jotham Napat has been skeptical of the power of the U.N. convention and the Paris Agreement, saying in a statement that neither are \"generating the actions the world urgently needs fast enough.\" He believes a favorable opinion from the court could \"support vulnerable nations in securing climate finance, technology, and loss and damage support.\"",
      "The court addressed this concern in its opinion and dismissed the legal argument that environmental treaties, like the Paris Agreement, protect polluters from accountability. In fact, the court emphasized that the Paris Agreement imposes strong mitigation and adaptation obligations on all parties and requires them to respond to loss and damages from climate change.",
      "Given that the United States is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world, according to international data, the decision to hold large emitters responsible might be concerning, but President Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement for a second time earlier this year.",
      "The court called out countries like the United States, saying that nations that are not party to climate treaties but are members of the United Nations must meet \"equivalent obligations under customary international law.\"",
      "The impact of the opinion remains to be seen. \"It's likely not going to have a lot of influence in the United States,\" said Maria Antonia Tigre, director of global climate litigation at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.",
      "Tigre said that while the decision may not influence domestic court cases in the U.S. and the country can't be sued under the decision, the real impact could be seen internationally. A court in Brazil, for example, could cite the opinion in one of the 135 current climate change cases making its way through its domestic court system.",
      "The U.N. court also pointed out that corporate polluters are open to the advisory opinion, especially if they are based abroad in a country that is party to the U.N. and climate treaties. \"Countries have an obligation to put an end to wrongful acts,\" said Tigre. \"If a country is found to be in breach by giving permits to an oil company, they may need to revoke those permits.\"",
      "Representatives for Vanuatu said the next step is to take the decision back to the U.N. General Assembly to pursue a full resolution to support the implementation of the decision. The opinion will be a primary focus when U.N. countries meet in November for the next climate change conference, known as COP30, in Brazil.",

    "summary": "This week's U.S. trade agreement with Japan could provide a framework for a pact with the European Union, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration and the European Union are racing to clinch a trade deal\u00a0by the White House's self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline, with economists warning that a sharp hike in tariffs could raise costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "As the clock ticks down, a series of pacts with other U.S. trading partners in recent days have raised hopes of avoiding a potentially damaging trade war with Europe, with experts saying a\u00a0deal with Japan announced on Tuesday could serve as a template for a deal with the EU.",
      "The U.S. has also recently announced the outlines of trade deals with China, Indonesia, the Philippines and U.K., though with many details still remaining to be finalized.",
      "For consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, much is riding on the outcome of the trade talks. Absent a deal, President Trump has threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tax. In preparing possible countermeasures, the European Commission has said it would impose tariffs on more than $100 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Aug. 7, AFP reported on Wednesday.",
      "Negotiations are ongoing and a U.S.-EU trade war could yet be avoided. Citing EU diplomats, AFP also said officials with the trading block could be open to a 15% U.S. tariff rate, with potential carveouts for key sectors, according to the wire service.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the status of talks with the EU, including whether the Trump administration expects to reach a trade deal by the Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday struck a trade deal with Tokyo that calls for a 15% tariff on Japanese imports. In return, the deal calls for Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and further open its domestic market to U.S. exports, including cars and certain farm products.",
      "The 15% tariff rate on Japanese goods is five percentage points higher than a baseline tariff the Trump administration imposed on all foreign imports on April 2. But it is lower than the 25% he threatened against Japan earlier this month and the 24% duties his administration\u00a0proposed\u00a0in early April.",
      "\"The Japan deal solidifies this pattern we've seen thus far, which is some market access relief, a commitment to purchase U.S. goods, and a slightly lower, but above the universal baseline, tariff level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a public policy research firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The Japan deal certainly provides a framework of what [Mr. Trump] looking for,\" Jacquez said. \"It's about accepting a baseline tariff at or above 10%, and then making purchase commitments.\"",
      "Key catalysts for trade deals",
      "A key element of Mr. Trump's trade deals has been a commitment by other nations to invest in the U.S. The president has defended tariffs as a way to revive the country's domestic manufacturing base and make American exports more competitive, as well as to generate additional federal revenue.",
      "\"We are learning that the promise of greater investment into the U.S. works well with the administration,\" EY Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said. \"The promise to invest $550 billion was a big part of the Japan-U.S. trade deal. It was a key catalyst to securing a deal.\"",
      "The EU, whose member states have a combined gross domestic product of $20 trillion, could likely commit to a large investment in the U.S. because it could span a number of years and focus on key sectors, such as technology, energy or artificial intelligence, Daco added.",
      "Additional commitments by the EU to purchase American-made goods and to lower trade barriers to U.S. exports could also help close a deal, he said. \"Those don't cost much, and they're an easy bargaining chip to put forward.\"",
      "Risk of higher prices",
      "Although a 15% baseline U.S. tariff on EU imports would represent a retrenchment from Mr. Trump's earlier threats, it would still drive up prices for U.S. businesses and consumers, according to Daco.",
      "\"While it may seem like a great deal, it's still much higher than the tariffs that the U.S. was imposing at the end of 2024,\" he noted. \"So there would still be a positive inflation shock because of higher tariffs. There would also be demand erosion coming from reduced business investment, hiring,and reduced consumer spending as a result of these higher tariffs.\"",
      "Currently, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports is around 15%, according to his analysis. If Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs go into effect, that rate would rise to more than 20%. If the EU agrees to a 15% tariff rate, however, the average U.S. tariff rate on imports from around the world would drop to 19.5%.",
      "\"That's still a significant increase in the average rate,\" Daco said. \"It's a lot higher than the 2.5% where we started the year.\"",
      "Because most U.S. imports from the EU include industrial inputs like components, raw materials and machinery, any added costs would take tie to work their way through the supply chain, according to Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"It would \u00a0affect manufacturing exports faster than it would affect American consumers, but it would raise prices all around,\" Young said.",

    "summary": "Some scientists worried that maybe the Barbados threadsnake had become extinct before it was rediscovered in March.",
    "story": [
      "For nearly two decades, no one had spotted the world's smallest-known snake.",
      "Some scientists worried that maybe the Barbados threadsnake had become extinct, but one sunny morning, Connor Blades lifted a rock in a tiny forest in the eastern Caribbean island and held his breath.",
      "\"After a year of searching, you begin to get a little pessimistic,\" said Blades, project officer with the Ministry of Environment in Barbados.",
      "The snake can fit comfortably on a coin, so it was able to elude scientists for almost 20 years.",
      "Scientifically named Tetracheilostoma carlae, the petite creature is listed as Critically Endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species when it was last assessed in 2015.",
      "Too tiny to identify with the naked eye, Blades placed it in a small glass jar and added soil, substrate and leaf litter.",
      "Several hours later, in front of a microscope at the University of the West Indies, Blades looked at the specimen. It wriggled in the petri dish, making it nearly impossible to identify.",
      "\"It was a struggle,\" Blades recalled, adding that he shot a video of the snake and finally identified it thanks to a still image.",
      "It had pale yellow dorsal lines running through its body, and its eyes were located on the side of its head.",
      "\"I tried to keep a level head,\" Blades recalled, knowing that the Barbados threadsnake looks very much like a Brahminy blind snake, best known as the flower pot snake, which is a bit longer and has no dorsal lines.",
      "On Wednesday, the Re:wild conservation group, which is collaborating with the local environment ministry, announced the rediscovery of the Barbados threadsnake.",
      "\"Rediscovering one of our endemics on many levels is significant,\" said Justin Springer, Caribbean program officer for Re:wild who helped rediscover the snake along with Blades. \"It reminds us that we still have something important left that plays an important role in our ecosystem.\"",
      "The Barbados threadsnake has only been seen a handful of times since 1889. It was on a list of 4,800 plant, animal and fungi species that Re:wild described as \"lost to science.\"",
      "There's no information on its population and the most recent record of the snake was a 2005 photograph from near Hillaby town in St. Thomas Parish, according to the IUCN. One of the oldest known records of the species dates back to 1918, and it has only been rarely spotted since then, with a few documentations from 1966, 1997 and 2008, the Switzerland-based conservation organization said.",
      "\"Given the dense human population on Barbados, if the species was simply underrecorded it seems likely that local people would be aware of additional records,\" the IUCN said on its website. \"The lack of records suggests that this species is genuinely rare and restricted.\"",
      "The snake is blind, burrows in the ground, eats termites and ants and lays one single, slender egg. Fully grown, it measures up to four inches.",
      "\"They're very cryptic,\" Blades said. \"You can do a survey for a number of hours, and even if they are there, you may actually not see them.\"",
      "But on March 20 at around 10:30 a.m., Blades and Springer surrounded a jack-in-the-box tree in central Barbados and started looking under rocks while the rest of the team began measuring the tree, whose distribution is very limited in Barbados.",
      "\"That's why the story is so exciting,\" Springer said. \"It all happened around the same time.\"",
      "S. Blair Hedges, a professor at Temple University and director of its center for biology, was the first to identify the Barbados threadsnake. Previously, it was mistakenly lumped in with another species.",
      "In 2008, Hedges' discovery was published in a scientific journal, with the snake baptized Tetracheilostoma carlae, in honor of his wife.",
      "\"I spent days searching for them,\" Hedges recalled. \"Based on my observations and the hundreds of rocks, objects that I turned over looking for this thing without success, I do think it is a rare species.\"",
      "That was June 2006, and there were only three other such specimens known at the time: two at a London museum and a third at a museum collection in California that was wrongly identified as being from Antigua instead of Barbados, Hedges said.",
      "Hedges said that he didn't realize he had collected a new species until he did a genetic analysis.",
      "\"The aha moment was in the laboratory,\" he said, noting that the discovery established the Barbados threadsnake as the world's smallest-known snake.",
      "Hedges then became inundated for years with letters, photographs and emails from people thinking they had found more Barbados threadsnakes. Some of the pictures were of earthworms, he recalled.",
      "\"It was literally years of distraction,\" he said.",
      "Scientists hope the rediscovery means that the Barbados threadsnake could become a champion for the protection of wildlife habitat.",
      "A lot of endemic species on the tiny island have gone extinct, including the Barbados racer, the Barbados skink and a particular species of cave shrimp.",
      "\"I hope they can get some interest in protecting it,\" Hedges said. \"Barbados is kind of unique in the Caribbean for a bad reason: it has the least amount of original forest, outside of Haiti.\""

    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is facing protests and EU criticism for the first time since Russia invaded, over changes to national anti-corruption agencies.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0In a first since Russia launched its full-scale invasion more than three years ago, widespread protests have taken place across Ukraine \u2014 not against Russia or its President Vladimir Putin, but against Ukraine's own President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the country's parliament, the Rada.",
      "Late Tuesday night, Zelenskyy signed a bill into law, after it was fast-tracked through the Rada, that gives Ukraine's prosecutor general (roughly equivalent to the U.S. attorney general), more power over two anti-corruption agencies long known for their fierce independence. The prosecutor general is a political appointee, not an elected official.",
      "In the hours before Zelenskyy signed the measure, thousands of people in the capital Kyiv, the western city of Lviv, Dnipro in the east and Odessa in the south made their frustration and fear known, defying martial law bans on mass gatherings to come out and protest. Their concern is rooted in the continued autonomy of Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), which for years have sought to combat graft by public officials, regardless of their political affiliation.",
      "Some critics argue the new law is political retribution. In April, Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau charged a former deputy head of Zelenskyy's administration, Andrii Smyrnov, with money laundering and accepting a bribe. Others fear a potential backslide back into some degree of authoritarianism in the country that was previously led by pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was known for his close ties to oligarchs.",
      "The 27-nation European Union, which has been a staunch supporter of Zelenskyy and Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion, also voiced concern over the changes to the management of the anti-corruption agencies. Demonstrably fighting corruption is crucial to Ukraine's bid to join the EU.",
      "EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos called the vote by Ukraine's parliament \"a serious step back\" in a post on social media, adding that \"independent bodies like NABU & SAPO are essential for Ukraine's EU path. Rule of Law remains in the very center of EU accession negotiations.\"",
      "Zelenskyy appeared to acknowledge the anger in his country over the new legislation, saying in a statement posted on social media after the Rada's vote: \"We all hear what society is saying.\"",
      "\"We see what people expect from state institutions \u2014 ensured justice and the effective functioning of each institution. We discussed the necessary administrative and legislative decisions that would strengthen the work of each institution, resolve existing contradictions, and eliminate threats,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Everyone will work together. At the political level, we will provide support.\"",
      "Earlier he had stressed that the two anti-corruption agencies would still \"work,\" but he said they needed to be clear of what he claimed was \"Russian influence.\" He said some major corruption cases had been \"lying dormant\" with the agencies for years without any rational explanation, but offered no explanation of the alleged Russian influence.",
      "New round of Russia-Ukraine peace talks",
      "The Kremlin, meanwhile, confirmed that a third round of direct Russia-Ukraine peace talks would begin in Turkey on Wednesday evening.",
      "\"Our delegation is flying to Istanbul, and indeed negotiations are scheduled to take place there tonight,\" said spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. \"The main topic of discussion will be peace memorandums that were shared during the second round of talks.\"",
      "He said the two sides would discuss further prisoner swaps. Over the past two months, Russia and Ukraine have exchanged more than 1,000 prisoners of war, but the negotiations have thus far yielded little hope of a ceasefire in the war.",
      "On Tuesday, Peskov said Moscow did not expect any \"miraculous breakthrough\" in Turkey, calling the two sides \"diametrically opposed.\"",
      "Moscow has demanded a litany of concessions from Ukraine, including that it give up territory Russian troops have seized during the war. Russia currently occupies about a fifth of Ukraine's territory. Putin's government has also demanded that Ukraine abandon its ambitions of joining the EU and the U.S.-led NATO alliance, and even insisted that it should significantly downsize its military and make Russian the official language of Ukraine.",

      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 A classical music concert in Italy has been canceled suddenly following a public backlash over the Russian conductor's support for President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Russian maestro Valery Gergiev had been scheduled to lead an ensemble of Italian musicians and soloists from St. Petersburg's Mariinsky Theatre \u2014 where he's the artistic director \u2014 on July 27 at the Reggia di Caserta, an opulent 18th-century palace near Naples.",
      "Italy's national news agency ANSA said the venue had canceled the concert, offering no explanation. A representative at the Reggia di Caserta confirmed the cancellation to CBS News over the phone.",
      "The move came after criticism from Italian lawmakers, human rights advocates and Russian political dissidents.",
      "Among the most vocal opponents to Italy welcoming Gergiev was Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. She condemned Gergiev's public support for the Kremlin and accused the conductor of using his platform to legitimize Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.",
      "In a message posted on social media, Navalnaya called news of the cancellation, \"not joyful, but good.\"",
      "\"No artist who supports the current dictatorship in Russia should be welcomed in Europe. It is precisely thanks to regime loyalists like Gergiev that Putin tries to promote his image as a 'respectable person' in the West,\" she said. \"It's a small step, but great victories are built from such small steps.\"",
      "Gergiev, once lauded in the West as the \"Wild Man of Music,\" has become a contentious figure in recent years, particularly in Europe, where a range of institutions have sought to distance themselves from artists aligned with the Russian government.",

      "Choi Mal-ja was 19 when she was attacked by a 21-year-old man in the southern town of Gimhae in 1964. He pinned her to the ground and forced his tongue into her mouth, court records showed. Choi managed to break free by biting off about half an inch of his tongue.",

    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 The families of some British victims of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad have discovered that remains repatriated to the U.K. were wrongly identified as being their loved ones, a lawyer who says his firm is representing over 20 victims' families told CBS News. Of the 242 people on board the Air India flight from Ahmedabad to London's Gatwick airport that crashed on June 12 just minutes after takeoff, 52 were British citizens.",
      "The cause of the crash has not been confirmed, but a preliminary report released earlier this month by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau found that cockpit cutoff switches for fuel supply to both of the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner's engines had been switched, one after another, within one second, leading to both engines losing thrust.",
      "James Healy-Pratt, an aviation lawyer who said he was representing a number of U.K. families, told CBS News the remains of at least 12 British victims of the crash had been repatriated to the U.K., but that two of them had been misidentified.",
      "\"There was one family who believed they had accompanied their loved one back from India, having gone out there to give DNA for the identification, and then (when they returned to the U.K.) were informed that the remains in the casket were nothing to do with them,\" Healy-Pratt told CBS News.",
      "Healy-Pratt said the mistakes were discovered when the Inner West London coroner, Dr. Fiona Wilcox, sought to verify the victims' identities by matching their DNA to samples provided by the families.",
      "\"The first two caskets that arrived into the country \u2014 Dr. Wilcox and her team, assiduous as always, decided to check the verification and identity, and they discovered that DNA had been commingled in one of the caskets, which wasn't related to the person in the casket or the other person,\" Healy-Pratt said.",
      "Healy-Pratt said the family of one of the victims had to cancel funeral plans after being told the remains they thought belonged to their loved one were actually those of an unknown individual.",
      "\"It's a double psychological trauma. It's one thing to lose a loved one, but then you go to India, you sit in a hotel, you give your DNA, you pray to God that there'll be a DNA match. You're then told there is. You're assured everything's fine and certified. You come back, and then you're told either there's more remains in the casket than just your loved one, or there are no remains, in spite of having been certified, and we don't know who this is,\" Healy-Pratt told CBS News.",
      "Indian officials cited by local media soon after the crash said that, given the level of the destruction at the site and the extent to which the wreckage was burned, DNA testing would be required to confirm the final death toll from both the plane and from the buildings at the site in Ahmedabad.",
      "\"We have seen the report and have been working closely with the U.K. side from the moment these concerns and issues were brought to our attention,\" Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Shri Randhir Jaiswal said in a statement Wednesday. \"In the wake of the tragic crash, the concerned authorities had carried out identification of victims as per established protocols and technical requirements. All mortal remains were handled with utmost professionalism and with due regard for the dignity of the deceased. We are continuing to work with the U.K. authorities on addressing any concerns related to this issue.\"",
      "Healy-Pratt said the statement from the Indian Foreign Ministry statement was \"simply not good enough.\"",
      "\"It lacks specifics. It lacks any detailed explanation of the chain of custody of the remains from the time of identification to DNA matching to placing in caskets. It lacks any assurances that there may be remains, whether mislabeled, unidentified or identified, still in India,\" he said.",
      "\"The families want to draw a line under their emotional distress that's come out from this and so that requires detailed hard work by the Indian authorities to provide assurances that there are no further remains of British nationals either unidentified, identified or mislabeled, misidentified in India. And the line will not be drawn until that cast iron assurance is provided. And at the moment, it's not forthcoming,\" he said.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are set to meet in London this week, and Healy-Pratt said he hoped this issue would make it onto their agenda.",
      "Healy-Pratt also said that, in addition to seeking the remains of their loved ones, the British families want to know the cause of the Air India crash, so their lawyers are independently investigating. The families, Healy-Pratt said, want to make sure any safety recommendations that come from formal probes are implemented internationally.",
      "\"And then finally, they want financial justice,\" Healy-Pratt said.",
      "He said the families' legal team had \"already made an approach to the lawyers for Air India in London, and we're progressing claims there in the High Court. And we'll also be filing an action against Boeing in the U.S. courts to get more information about these fuel control cutoff switches, because they do have a checkered history.\"",

      "\"When it comes to the specific location of the envoy, I do not have that,\" Bruce said.",

      "So far, there have been no breakthroughs as they attempt to broker a 60-day ceasefire, initially proposed by the U.S., in the 21-month war. Doha, Qatar, hosted indirect talks between the two parties earlier this month.",
      "Witkoff, according to two diplomatic sources, was expected to travel to the Middle East if negotiations progressed and a deal could potentially be closed. He met last week with Qatari officials at the White House just before President Trump hosted the Qatari prime minister for a dinner that stretched late into the night. It took place as diplomatic efforts were reaching a critical moment in the pursuit of a deal to release the 20 living Israeli hostages, free some Palestinian detainees, allow the entry of much needed food and aid to civilians in Gaza, and bring about a cessation of violence and repositioning of Israeli Defense Forces.",
      "A U.S. official and a regional source familiar with the diplomacy told CBS News that Israel last week proposed a new map with new locations where the IDF would potentially withdraw within Gaza. The demarcation of these proposed withdrawal zones has been a sticking point in the ongoing diplomatic efforts to broker a deal acceptable to both Hamas and the Netanyahu government. The international mediators \u2014 Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. \u2014 planned to transit the Israeli proposal to Hamas for consideration.",
      "The two sources indicated that the Trump administration is cautiously optimistic about the possibility of an impending break in the Gaza negotiations that could lead to a 60-day ceasefire and hostage release.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington in early July to discuss the deal with the Trump administration but a sticking point emerged over the deployment of Israeli troops during the truce. Israel wants to keep forces in what it says is an important land corridor in southern Gaza, but Hamas views the presence of Israeli troops on that strip of land as an indication that Israel intends to continue the war once a temporary ceasefire expires.",
      "The Knesset goes into a three-month summer recess next week, on July 27, which would give Netanyahu more political flexibility in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "In the meantime, Israel has continued to carry out military operations in Gaza, and on Sunday, it issued new evacuation orders to include an area that has been somewhat less hard hit than others, indicating a new battleground may be opening up and squeezing Palestinians further south.",
      "In a social media post published Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces warned Palestinians that it was operating \"with great force to destroy the enemy's capabilities and terrorist infrastructure\" in the central city of Deir al-Balah, \"as it expands its activities in this region to operate in an area it has not operated in before.\"",

      "\"And so we can then start to look at the archive evidence that we have for the wrecks in Orkney,\" Saunders said. \"It becomes a process of elimination.",
      "\"You remove ones that are Northern European as opposed to British, you remove wrecks that are too small or operating out of the north of England and you really are down to two or three \u2026 and Earl of Chatham is the last one left.\"",

      "Further research found that before it was the Earl of Chatham, the ship was HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate built in Chichester on England's south coast in 1749.",
      "Its military career saw it play a part in the expansion \u2014 and contraction \u2014 of the British Empire. It helped Britain wrest control of Canada from France during the sieges of Louisbourg and Quebec in the 1750s, and in the 1770s served as a convoy escort during Britain's failed effort to hold onto its American colonies.",
      "Sold off by the navy in 1784 and renamed, the vessel became a whaling ship, hunting the huge mammals in the Arctic waters off Greenland.",
      "Whale oil was an essential fuel of the Industrial Revolution, used to lubricate machinery, soften fabric and light city streets. Saunders said that in 1787 there were 120 London-based whaling ships in the Greenland Sea, the Earl of Chatham among them.",
      "A year later, while heading out to the whaling ground, it was wrecked in bad weather off Sanday. All 56 crew members survived \u2014 more evidence, Saunders says, that this was a vessel blessed with luck.",

      "For locals, it's a link to the island's maritime past \u2014 and future. Finding long-buried wrecks could become more common as climate change alters the wind patterns around Britain and reshapes the coastline.",

    "story": [
      "Gaza City\u00a0\u2014 The head of Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City said on Tuesday that 21 children had died across the Palestinian territory in the past three days \"due to malnutrition and starvation.\"",
      "\"These deaths were recorded at hospitals in Gaza, including Al-Shifa in Gaza City, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir el-Balah and Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis ... over the past 72 hours,\" Mohammed Abu Salmiya told reporters.",
      "United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned Monday evening that \"the last lifelines keeping people alive are collapsing\" in Gaza, and that there were growing reports of children and adults exhibiting symptoms of malnutrition.",
      "Abu Salmiya told reporters that new cases of malnutrition and starvation were arriving at Gaza's remaining functioning hospitals \"every moment,\" adding: \"We are heading towards alarming numbers of deaths due to the starvation inflicted on the people of Gaza.\"",
      "In a statement issued Tuesday, the U.N. human rights office said many people were arriving at Gaza's hospitals \"in a state of severe exhaustion caused by a lack of food. Others are collapsing in the streets. Many more may be dying unreported ... These deaths and the horrendous physical and psychological suffering caused by hunger are the result of Israel's interference with and militarization of humanitarian assistance.\"",
      "Photos emerging from Gaza in recent days have shown children and infants with severe malnutrition, including some said by hospital workers to have died of the condition. According to the National Institutes of Health, severe malnutrition typically causes symptoms including dramatic wasting, or fat and muscle loss, poor circulation and extreme fatigue.",
      "\"Hospitals are already overwhelmed by the number of casualties from gunfire. They can't provide much more help for hunger-related symptoms because of food and medicine shortages,\" Khalil al-Deqran, a spokesperson for the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, told the Reuters news agency. Deqran said there were 600,000 people suffering from malnutrition symptoms such as dehydration and anemia, including 60,000 pregnant women.",
      "After talks to extend a six-week ceasefire broke down, Israel imposed a full blockade on Gaza on March 2 this year, allowing no aid in until trucks were again permitted to cross the border in late May. The U.N. and aid organizations say the quantity of food and other emergency supplies being allowed into Gaza since then has been vastly insufficient, however.",
      "Food stocks accumulated inside the Palestinian territory during the ceasefire have depleted, leaving the territory's more than two million inhabitants experiencing the worst shortages since the start of the war sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Some 1,200 Israelis were killed and 251 others taken hostage during that siege more than 650 days ago, and 20 of the captives are still thought to be alive in Gaza.",
      "World Food Program director Carl Skau, who visited Gaza City in early July, called the situation \"the worst\" he had ever seen.",
      "Last Sunday, the civil defense agency in Hamas-run Gaza reported that at least three infants had died from \"severe hunger and malnutrition\" over the previous week.",
      "On Monday, the governments of 25 countries, including Israeli and U.S. allies Britain, France, Australia and Canada, urged an immediate end to the war, the unconditional release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, and the free flow of aid.",
      "In their joint statement, they accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's U.S.-backed government of the \"drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children\" in Gaza.",
      "The nations also condemned a new system for aid distribution backed by Israel's military that was launched in late May with the support of the Trump administration, but no support from other nations or humanitarian organizations.",
      "The U.N.'s human rights office said Tuesday that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation started operations on May 26.",
      "Officially a private effort, the GHF began working in Gaza \u2014 with virtually no information provided about its funding or management \u2014 after Israel imposed the more than two-month blockade on all supplies entering Gaza.",
      "The group's operations, focused around four \"humanitarian hubs\" for food distribution, have been marred by chaotic scenes and near-daily reports of Israeli forces firing on people waiting to collect rations in the Palestinian territory, where the Israeli military is seeking to destroy Hamas.",
      "\"As of July 21, we have recorded 1,054 people killed in Gaza while trying to get food; 766 of them were killed in the vicinity of GHF sites and 288 near U.N. and other humanitarian organizations' aid convoys,\" U.N. human rights office spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan told the AFP news agency. He said the agency's data was \"based on information from multiple reliable sources on the ground, including medical teams, humanitarian and human rights organizations.\"",
      "GHF says it has distributed more than 1.4 million boxes of foodstuffs to date and that it adjusts its \"operations in real time to keep people safe and informed, and we stand ready to partner with other organizations to scale up and deliver more meals to the people of Gaza.\"",
      "The U.N. and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the GHF over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives and violates basic humanitarian principles. The group has never commented, despite numerous questions from CBS News, on any links it has with the U.S. or Israeli governments.",
      "The Trump administration announced its first public support for the GHF \u2014 $30 million in funding \u2014 earlier this month, and called on other organizations and countries to cooperate with the group, saying that, in its view, it provides the only  means of delivering aid in Gaza without the risk of Hamas stealing it.",

      "\"It is very exciting to see progress in the mathematical capabilities of AI models,\" said IMO president Dolinar.",
      "Contest organizers could not verify how much computing power had been used by the AI models or whether there had been human involvement, he noted.",
      "In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes earlier this year, one of Google's leading AI researchers predicted that within just five to 10 years, computers would be made that have human-level cognitive abilities \u2014 a landmark known as \"artificial general intelligence.\"",
      "Google DeepMind CEO\u00a0Demis Hassabis predicted\u00a0that AI technology was on track to understand the world in nuanced ways, and to not only solve important problems, but even to develop a sense of imagination, within a decade, thanks to an increase in investment.",
      "\"It's moving incredibly fast,\" Hassabis said. \"I think we are on some kind of exponential curve of improvement. Of course, the success of the field in the last few years has attracted even more attention, more resources, more talent. So that's adding to the, to this exponential progress.\"",

      "SCIENTISTS MAY HAVE DISCOVERED WHY THE POUNDS COME BACK AFTER LOSING WEIGHT",
      "People in more economically developed areas burned more calories, the researchers noted \u2014 but that\u2019s primarily because they tend to weigh more, and heavier bodies naturally burn more energy.",

      "Ultraprocessed foods tend to be easier to overeat due to their flavor and texture, and they also don't keep people feeling full, the study found.",
      "They are also more calorie-dense, meaning they pack more energy into smaller volumes, and are more easily absorbed, making it harder for the body to eliminate excess energy.",

      "People should consider the benefits of exercise beyond just weight loss, a researcher advised. (iStock)",

      "What is the coffee ring effect, and why does it matter in science?",
      "Ever wondered why spilled coffee, wine or tea dries in a ring rather than evenly? This common pattern is known as the \"coffee ring effect.\" The phenomenon occurs because of the liquid's surface tension. As the drop begins to dry, water at the edges evaporates more quickly since that area is thinner. To keep up, liquid from the center flows outward, carrying tiny particles with it. Once the drop is completely dry, these particles settle along the edge, creating the signature ring stain you see on tables and countertops every day.",

      "The idea began with Kamyar Behrouzi, a former Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. While developing a COVID-19 biosensor in 2020, he noticed that virus particles, much like coffee particles, tend to gather at the edge of a droplet. By using this natural effect, the researchers designed a test that captures and concentrates disease markers, making detection much easier.

      "How this coffee-inspired test detects COVID-19, sepsis, and more",
      "So, how does this innovative test actually work? First, you place a small sample from your nose or cheek onto a special membrane. As the sample dries, disease proteins concentrate at the edges to form a visible ring. Next, you add a second droplet containing light-reactive particles. If certain disease biomarkers are present, these nanoparticles light up when exposed to light. You can see positive results with the naked eye in some cases, or verify them more accurately using a special AI-powered smartphone app.",

      "The tech is called e-OPRA (Enhanced Osseointegrated Prostheses for the Rehabilitation of Amputees). It involves surgically implanting a titanium rod into the femur, which connects directly to a robotic prosthetic limb. This rod becomes the foundation of a new kind of interface between the body and machine. But it doesn't stop there.",

      "Traditional socket-based prosthetics can be uncomfortable, unstable, and prone to infections. They often feel foreign, like a tool strapped to the body rather than a part of it. The bionic knee bypasses the socket altogether. By connecting directly to bone and muscle, it improves load-bearing, reduces skin problems, and most importantly, restores a sense of control. And control isn't just physical, it's emotional and psychological.

After losing both legs below the knee to frostbite in his teens, he returned to mountain climbing and dedicated his career to advancing prosthetic technology.

      "This portable air scanner, created at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is being brought to market by California-based instrument maker BaySpec. The device works by pulling in air and identifying molecules in real time using a miniature mass spectrometer.",
      "Unlike traditional swab tests that take five to thirty minutes, VaporID detects fentanyl in seconds, even at levels as low as six parts per trillion. That's like spotting a single pine needle in an entire forest.",
      "Why drug dogs may soon be outmatched by VaporID",
      "For decades, trained canines have been the gold standard at ports of entry. But dogs have limits; they tire, need handlers, and can't be reprogrammed with software updates. VaporID, on the other hand, never needs a nap. It can detect not only known drugs but also fentanyl analogs, lab-made variants designed to skirt detection.",

      "VaporID weighs about 40 pounds and draws in ambient air like a miniature vacuum. Suspicious molecules are filtered, tagged with electrically charged ions, and passed into a tiny mass spectrometer. Only the relevant particles make it through. This process filters out background interfering vapors from things like perfumes or cleaning agents, giving border agents a clear, accurate, and immediate read on potentially dangerous substances.",
      "What VaporID means for border security",
      "If deployed widely, VaporID could revolutionize how U.S. Customs and Border Protection detects narcotics and explosives. Its fast, hands-free scanning would help agents screen vehicles, cargo, luggage, and even people, without relying solely on canine units or invasive sampling.",
      "The device's sensitivity also opens doors for use beyond borders. The Department of Homeland Security is already working with PNNL and BaySpec to adapt the technology for mail screening, airport baggage checks, and large-scale cargo inspections.",
      "For materials like TNT (trinitrotoluene) and PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate), both powerful explosives that release very few molecules into the air, VaporID's ultra-sensitive detection provides a level of protection that's long been out of reach with current methods.",
      "Chemist Elizabeth Denis uses the PNNL system to check a substance in the laboratory. (Andrea Starr/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",
      "VaporID\u2019s role in combating drug and explosive smuggling",
      "The U.S. is facing a deadly influx of synthetic opioids. According to the CDC, over 80,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2024, including approximately 48,400 deaths linked to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Fast, contactless detection at ports of entry could help choke off the supply chain before these deadly substances ever hit the streets. And in an era of rising geopolitical tensions, having a portable scanner that can also detect explosives could be a critical layer in national defense.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Technology doesn\u2019t just assist border agents anymore; it\u2019s starting to outperform their most trusted tools. VaporID brings speed, precision, and reliability to a job where seconds count. While drug-sniffing dogs have served well, this portable air scanner may soon lead the front line in detecting threats. As agencies prepare to roll out the system, one thing is clear. The future of border security doesn\u2019t bark. It beeps.",

      "KR1 doesn't just move intelligently, it learns. Kinisi equipped the robot with built-in AI that allows it to adapt in real time to its surroundings. It recognizes obstacles, modifies its arm movement and executes precise trajectories even as the warehouse layout changes. This means workers don't need to reprogram the system each time workflows shift. One of KR1's most impressive features is its ability to learn from demonstration. Warehouse staff can guide the robot through a task once, and KR1 can replicate it accurately without complex coding. This speeds up onboarding and makes it easy to scale up operations. In a recent demo video, KR1 moved across a warehouse floor on its own. It approached various shelving units, selected a range of items, and placed them into totes with deliberate and smooth movements. It then transported the loaded containers to the correct location, all while avoiding obstacles and adjusting to its environment in real time.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "This robot works offline without relying on cloud computing",
      "While many robots rely on cloud computing, Kinisi took a different approach. KR1 processes data locally, which means it can function reliably even in environments with weak or unstable internet connections. Local processing also improves response times and enhances data privacy. This design ensures KR1 continues working even during network disruptions. It also allows the robot to make split-second decisions, which is essential in fast-paced warehouses.",

      "KR1 is already proving useful in logistics, but its design makes it suitable for a wide range of industries. In addition to streamlining warehouse fulfillment, KR1 is built to assist with tasks in retail stocking, light manufacturing, and maintenance work. Kinisi developed the robot to blend into existing workflows, which eliminates the need for expensive infrastructure upgrades. Because the robot combines physical strength with the ability to learn, it can handle repetitive tasks that require both accuracy and endurance. As a result, companies can reduce labor costs, improve workplace safety and increase operational flexibility.",
      "The Kinisi 01, also known as KR1, is a powerful autonomous humanoid robot. (Kinisi Robotics)",
      "How much does KR1 cost? Here's what we know",
      "During a recent presentation at Automate 2025, Kinisi CEO Brennand Pierce revealed that the robot currently costs around $4,000 per month. That rate appears to be part of a subscription-based model, which may include the robot, its onboard AI and ongoing support. Instead of selling KR1 outright, Kinisi is targeting small to mid-size warehouses with a flexible, monthly pricing strategy.",
      "This approach allows businesses to adopt automation without making large upfront investments or overhauling their infrastructure. Although the company hasn't confirmed what the monthly fee includes, the model positions KR1 as a scalable, low-risk solution for logistics teams looking to boost productivity fast.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",

    "summary": "TapTrap Android attack works by launching transparent system prompts over regular app interfaces. The result is a near-invisible layer that silently captures your taps and interactions.",
    "story": [
      "Google Maps Location Sharing is now built into Android settings; no need for Maps settings. Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses the welcome improvement for Android users.",
      "A team of academic researchers has uncovered a new Android security exploit that raises a lot of questions about the platform\u2019s permission system. The technique, named TapTrap, uses user interface animations to visually deceive you into granting sensitive permissions or performing harmful actions. Unlike earlier tapjacking attacks, TapTrap Android attack works by launching transparent system prompts over regular app interfaces. The result is a near-invisible layer that silently captures your taps and interactions.",

      "NEW GOOGLE AI MAKES ROBOTS SMARTER WITHOUT THE CLOUD",
      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the TapTrap Android exploit tricks you into granting permissions",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, TapTrap takes advantage of how Android handles activity transitions between apps. A malicious app can launch a system-level screen using the standard start Activity function but modify how the screen appears using a custom animation. By setting both the start and end opacity to a very low value, such as 0.01, the activity becomes nearly invisible to the user.",
      "Touch input is still fully registered by the transparent screen, even though users only see the visible app underneath. Attackers can also apply a scaling animation that enlarges a specific user interface element, such as a permission button, so that it fills the screen. This increases the chance that a user will unknowingly tap the button.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The researchers released a video showing how this technique could be used in a gaming app to quietly launch a Chrome browser permission prompt. The prompt asks for camera access, and the user taps \"Allow\" without realizing what they have done. Because the malicious screen is transparent, there are no visual cues to suggest anything suspicious is happening.",
      "Image of an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why 76% of Android apps are vulnerable to TapTrap",
      "To assess how widespread the vulnerability might be, the researchers tested nearly 100,000 apps from the Play Store. About 76% were found to be potentially vulnerable, not because they are malicious, but because they lack key safeguards. These apps had at least one screen that could be launched by another app, shared the same task stack, failed to override the default transition animation, and did not block user input during the transition.",
      "Android enables these animations by default. Users can only disable them through settings that are typically hidden, such as Developer Options or Accessibility menus. Even the latest Android version, tested on a Google Pixel 8a, remains unprotected against this exploit.",
      "GrapheneOS, a security-focused operating system based on Android, confirmed that its current version is also affected. However, it plans to release a fix in its next update.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Google has acknowledged the issue and said a future Android update will contain a mitigation. While no exact timeline has been announced, Google is expected to change how input and animations are handled to prevent invisible tap interception.",
      "The company added that developers must follow strict Play Store policies and that any app found abusing this vulnerability will face enforcement actions.",
      "A person holding an Android phone\u00a0(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4 ways you can stay safe from TapTrap attack",
      "1) Consider a mobile security app:\u00a0Use a trusted antivirus or mobile security app that can detect suspicious behavior or alert you to apps using overlays or accessibility features improperly.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "2) Be selective about the apps you install:\u00a0Avoid installing apps just because they\u2019re trending or have flashy ads. Check developer credibility, recent reviews and app permissions before downloading.",
      "3) Stick to the Google Play Store:\u00a0While not perfect, the Play Store has better safeguards than random APK sources. Avoid installing apps from third-party stores or unknown websites.",
      "4) Pause before granting permissions:\u00a0If an app suddenly asks for access to your camera, microphone, or other sensitive features, take a moment. Always ask yourself if this app really needs this permission right now.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "TapTrap shows that security threats do not always come from complex code or aggressive malware. Sometimes, small oversights in visual behavior can open paths for serious abuse. In this case, the danger lies in what users do not see. People trust what they can see on their screens. This attack breaks that link by creating a visual mismatch between intent and outcome.",

      "Bring in the experts of 3D printing construction",
      "To tackle a project of this scale, UCC Holding brought in the experts. The company partnered with Danish firm COBOD, a global leader in 3D construction printing. As a result, COBOD supplied two massive, custom-built BOD2 printers. Each machine measures approximately 164 feet long, 90 feet wide, and 49 feet high, about the size of a Boeing 737 hangar.",
      "These industrial printers can build structures up to five stories tall. They enable fast, accurate and cost-effective construction that traditional methods can't match.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Before launching the project, UCC's team of architects, engineers and technicians carried out extensive tests. At a trial site in Doha, they completed more than 100 full-scale component prints using a BOD2 printer. To further prepare for Qatar's desert climate, the team engineered a custom concrete mix designed to cure properly in high heat. Additionally, they developed a special extrusion nozzle to ensure smooth, precise printing.",

When compared to the biggest 3D-printed building we know of, these schools are 40 times bigger. They will be built on 328-by-328-foot plots. Therefore, making this project one of unprecedented scale for the region.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Qatar's desert formations were the inspiration behind the architectural design of the schools. They have wavy walls that look like dunes, something that can only be made possible through 3D printing. Building these unique curved shapes would be too expensive and difficult with traditional construction methods.",
      "UCC Holdings and COBOD construction team's launch Qatar\u2019s 3D Printed Schools Project. (UCC Holding)",
      "How 3D printing enhances sustainability and innovation",
      "Qatar's 3D-printed school project goes beyond architectural innovation; it also marks a major step toward sustainable construction. 3D printing technology reduces material waste by up to 60% compared to traditional building methods. It also minimizes labor requirements and shortens construction timelines, leading to lower overall emissions and energy use.",
      "Moreover, the ability to print complex, curved designs, like the dune-inspired walls of these schools, proves how digital construction methods can unlock new levels of creativity while staying cost-efficient. This approach not only supports Qatar's environmental goals but also sets a new global standard for eco-friendly building design.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Qatar's 3D-printed schools will be complete by the end of 2025 and demonstrate just how far construction technology has come. By combining both imaginative design and cutting-edge engineering, this project sets the standard for sustainable, scalable, and future-ready educational infrastructure.

      "What is Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI project?",
      "Starfish is a multi-year initiative built around generative AI. According to an internal Amazon document obtained by Business Insider, the system gathers product data from across the web, including external websites and images. It then uses large language models (LLMs) to create \"complete, correct and consistent\" product listings. This isn't a small update. Amazon expects Starfish to boost sales by $7.5 billion in 2025 alone by improving conversion rates and expanding product variety.",

      "Now, with Starfish, Amazon wants to scale that effort across millions of listings. The AI will also collect data from 200,000 external brand websites by crawling, scraping and mapping their content to Amazon's catalog. It's not yet clear whether Amazon's own web crawler, Amazonbot, is powering Starfish. But the company confirmed to Business Insider that Starfish is already supporting its new \"Buy for Me\" feature. This feature recommends products from external websites and lets shoppers buy them directly within Amazon's app.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Amazon built the Starfish AI for marketplace listings",
      "Manually creating product listings is slow and often inconsistent. That's a problem when Amazon wants to offer a massive selection with reliable information. If shoppers can't find what they're looking for, or if the listings are vague, they may head elsewhere. Starfish addresses this by automating the tedious parts of listing creation. That helps sellers spend less time writing and more time selling. For Amazon, better listings mean higher conversion rates and happier customers. Plus, this move positions Amazon to compete more directly with Google Shopping, which also aims to be a central hub for product information.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI is expanding globally",
      "Amazon is testing Starfish's effectiveness with A/B comparisons, measuring sales performance of AI-enriched listings versus standard ones. It's also rolling out bulk listing tools and preparing to expand the system globally. This isn't just about improving Amazon's website. It's about changing the way product information is gathered, created and shared at scale.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does this mean for you as an Amazon shopper or seller",
      "If you're a shopper on Amazon, this could mean faster access to clearer, more accurate product listings, especially for obscure or hard-to-find items. As Amazon's AI fills in missing details and improves titles and descriptions, the results should help you make better decisions with less research.",
      "For sellers, this streamlines the work of creating listings. If you've struggled to write compelling descriptions or keep up with Amazon's catalog standards, the Starfish project may do much of the heavy lifting. That could save time, reduce errors and improve sales performance.",
      "However, there are some trade-offs. As Amazon scrapes more data from across the web to power its listings, brands and smaller websites may worry about how their product information is being used. And if AI-generated content becomes widespread, quality and trust in listings may vary depending on how well the system works.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Amazon's Starfish project signals a major shift in how e-commerce works. By combining web scraping, AI models and deep integration into its Marketplace, Amazon hopes to automate one of the most time-consuming parts of online selling. For buyers and sellers, this could mean more convenience and better results.

      "The Bluetooth flaws in question are built into Airoha chips commonly used in true wireless audio devices, as reported by BleepingComputer. Three flaws were disclosed, each allowing an attacker to gain some level of unauthorized access. The most serious flaw lets an attacker read or manipulate data by exploiting a custom protocol used by the chip. All three flaws have been assigned official CVE numbers and scored between medium and high severity.",

      "To be clear, these are not casual attacks. They require close proximity and technical expertise. But when successful, the results are concerning. Researchers showed that they could extract call logs, contact lists and media being played. They could even force a phone to place a call without the user\u2019s knowledge. Once connected, they could listen in on any sound the phone picked up.",
      "In one proof-of-concept, the researchers retrieved Bluetooth link keys from a headphone\u2019s memory. This allowed them to impersonate the device and hijack the connection to the phone. With that access, they could issue commands using the Bluetooth Hands-Free Profile, a feature available across most modern phones.",

Furthermore, not every device faces all the same risks. For instance, at least one manufacturer seems to have already addressed CVE-2025-20700 and CVE-2025-20701. However, we do not know if this fix was intentional or accidental.",
      "Because of these factors, getting a complete and accurate picture of which devices are truly secure remains a challenge. As a consumer, you should stay alert for updates and check with your device's manufacturer for the latest information.",

These manufacturers are now responsible for building and distributing firmware updates to affected products. If you haven't seen an update yet, it should be arriving soon, though some may already be available.",
      "However, there's a catch. According to a report by German outlet Heise, many of the most recent firmware updates for affected devices were released before Airoha provided its official fix. This means some products may still be running vulnerable code, despite appearing up to date.",
      "To make matters more complicated, consumers typically aren't notified directly about these updates. Firmware patches for headphones and similar devices often install silently, or in some cases, may not be delivered at all. As a result, most users have no way of knowing whether their devices are secure or still exposed to risk.",

      "1. Regularly check for firmware updates:\u00a0Visit the manufacturer's app or website to manually check for firmware updates, even if you haven\u2019t received a notification. Automatic updates aren\u2019t always reliable, especially for headphones and earbuds.",
      "2. Turn off Bluetooth when not in use:\u00a0Disabling Bluetooth when you're not actively using it reduces your exposure window and makes it harder for attackers to target your device.",
      "3. Use devices in low-risk areas:\u00a0Since these attacks require close proximity, avoid using Bluetooth audio devices in crowded or unfamiliar public places where someone nearby could exploit vulnerabilities.",
      "4. Pair devices with trusted sources only:\u00a0Avoid pairing your Bluetooth headphones with unfamiliar phones, computers or public terminals. Once paired, those devices can sometimes maintain a connection or reestablish one without your knowledge, increasing the risk of abuse if they're compromised.",
      "5. Remove unused paired devices: Go into your Bluetooth settings and delete old or unfamiliar pairings. This helps prevent unauthorized reconnections from previously trusted devices that may now be compromised.",

Vulnerabilities like this aren\u2019t unusual, but the way they are handled often leaves users in the dark. As long as consumers can\u2019t see or control the software running inside their own headphones, problems like this will keep happening.",

      "\"Unfortunately, a lot of credentials are harvested and sold on the dark web between different threat actor groups despite strong passwords or MFA barriers. Maybe someone lost their password or an administrator had theirs saved on a laptop that was part of another breach. Once those passwords are collected, they get traded or sold,\" Daniel explained.",
      "While brute-force attacks still happen, most criminals don't waste time hammering away at complex passwords. Instead, they exploit simpler routes: snatching passwords from old breaches, targeting users directly or hijacking password vaults, especially those managed by social media admins.",

      "Tobok points out, \"There really isn't public-facing software that notifies you. Sometimes, you might get an email saying, 'We noticed unusual activity. Was this you?' That typically comes through MFA channels. But most executives don't manage their own social media accounts. It's usually someone on their team or a designated admin.

      "The most dangerous parts of any flight are takeoff and landing. To reduce risk, airports use Runway End Safety Areas (RESAs). These zones are meant to stop planes that overshoot the runway. In the past, airports used sand, soil, grass, or water pools for this purpose. But each of these materials has serious drawbacks.",

The research team compared the process to blowing bubbles into a concrete mix. These bubbles create the soft, crushable texture that helps stop a plane during an emergency.",
      "To make the bubbles strong enough to last until impact, the team used a special air-entraining agent. This forms a tough coating around each bubble. As a result, the material stays intact until an aircraft overruns the runway, then it collapses at the right moment to maximize safety.",

      "Marshmallow concrete airport safety: The future standard?",
      "With its unique combination of low cost, environmental resilience, and life-saving performance, marshmallow concrete is poised to become the new global standard for runway safety. The material has already been installed at 14 Chinese airports, where it has demonstrated consistent and reliable performance even in extreme conditions. As more airports seek affordable ways to enhance safety, marshmallow concrete offers a promising solution that can save lives and reduce costs worldwide.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you fly in the U.S., whether for business, vacation, or visiting family, marshmallow concrete could soon make your journeys safer. While this breakthrough is currently being used at airports in China, its performance is turning heads worldwide, including among U.S. aviation experts looking for better runway safety solutions.",
      "Runway overruns don\u2019t happen often in the United States, but when they do, the consequences can be deadly. Think of high-traffic airports like LAX, JFK, or Atlanta, where a single overrun can disrupt thousands of flights and put lives at risk. Marshmallow concrete offers a low-cost, highly effective safety upgrade that could prevent these incidents or dramatically reduce their severity.",
      "The best part? This isn't some billion-dollar overhaul. Because it uses standard cement and is designed to work in all kinds of weather, including harsh winters and extreme heat, it\u2019s a practical option for airports from Maine to Arizona. That means even smaller regional airports across the U.S. could benefit.",
      "You may never see this material, but it could be quietly protecting your flight behind the scenes, ready to absorb impact and bring a plane to a safe stop if something goes wrong. As U.S. airport authorities and the FAA explore more innovative, more cost-effective ways to modernize infrastructure, marshmallow concrete could be one of the safest bets in American aviation's future.",

    "summary": "PillTrek, a tiny wireless smart capsule created by Caltech, provides real-time gut health data by detecting electrolytes, metabolites, glucose, hormones, pH levels and temperature.",
    "story": [
      "Celebrity nutritionist Daryl Gioffre, from Naples, Florida, tells Fox News Digital about the potential side effects of an ice cream emulsifier called Polysorbate 80, which alters the balance of gut bacteria.",
      "The future of gut health monitoring has arrived, thanks to researchers at the California Institute of Technology.",
      "Caltech's new invention, PillTrek, is a wireless smart capsule for gut health monitoring that delivers real-time insights from inside your gastrointestinal tract.",
      "This swallowable device promises to make invasive procedures a thing of the past, offering convenience and continuous data that traditional methods simply cannot match.",
      "NEW CAPSULE DEVICE LETS YOU CONTROL ROBOTS WITH YOUR ENTIRE BODY",
      "Illustration of a woman holding a PillTrek near her mouth, about to swallow it. (Caltech)",
      "How this high-tech pill changes gut health monitoring",
      "PillTrek stands out because it combines miniature size with advanced technology. The capsule measures only 7 millimeters in diameter and 25 millimeters in length, making it smaller than most capsule endoscopes. Despite its tiny size, PillTrek contains a suite of sensors that can detect electrolytes, metabolites, glucose, hormones such as serotonin and dopamine, pH, ionic strength and temperature. The design allows doctors to swap out sensors based on the specific biomarkers they need to monitor, making PillTrek a flexible and powerful diagnostic tool.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The capsule transmits data wirelessly as it moves through the digestive system, providing real-time updates on a patient's gut health. Unlike endoscopy or CT scans, PillTrek does not require hospital visits or recovery time. Its low-power electronics enable it to operate for extended periods, delivering continuous monitoring that traditional methods cannot provide.",
      "Illustration showing how the PillTrek is about the same size as a quarter. (Caltech)",
      "Why real-time gut health monitoring is essential for overall wellness",
      "Scientists now understand that the gastrointestinal tract influences far more than just digestion. The gut plays a critical role in hormone production, immune function and even mental health. Monitoring gut biomarkers helps identify conditions such as metabolic syndrome, which increases the risk of heart disease and diabetes, as well as inflammation and hormonal imbalances. Traditional diagnostic methods like biopsies and fecal analysis are invasive, costly, and do not offer real-time results. PillTrek's wireless smart capsule for gut health monitoring changes this landscape by providing immediate, actionable data from inside the body.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Inside the science of the ingestible diagnostic capsule",
      "Caltech's team developed PillTrek by leveraging breakthroughs in sensor materials and electrochemical measurement techniques. The capsule's reconfigurable design means that doctors can adapt it to monitor new biomarkers as medical science advances. Researchers tested PillTrek in animal models, successfully measuring pH, temperature, glucose and serotonin levels in real time. The capsule's sensors are inexpensive and mass-producible, making this technology accessible for widespread clinical use.",
      "Illustration of the various PillTrek components. (Caltech)",
      "The future of ingestible diagnostics: What\u2019s next",
      "The Caltech team continues to refine PillTrek, aiming to make it even smaller and more energy efficient. Future versions may use wireless power transfer and next-generation electronics, extending the capsule's lifespan and expanding its medical applications. As technology advances, PillTrek could become a standard tool for diagnosing and managing chronic GI conditions.",
      "Concerns and considerations for swallowing a\u00a0smart capsule",
      "While PillTrek offers exciting possibilities for non-invasive, real-time gut health monitoring, it also raises important questions. Some patients and healthcare professionals may have concerns about the safety of ingesting electronic devices, even if they are small and designed for medical use. Potential issues include the risk of the capsule getting stuck, allergic reactions to materials, or unforeseen interactions with other medical conditions.",
      "Data privacy is another consideration. As PillTrek transmits sensitive health information wirelessly, robust security measures are essential to protect patient data from unauthorized access.",
      "Additionally, long-term studies are needed to fully understand any potential side effects or complications. As with any new medical technology, regulatory approval and thorough clinical testing will play a crucial role in ensuring PillTrek's safety and effectiveness for widespread use.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Breakthroughs like PillTrek signal a new era in non-invasive, real-time gut health monitoring. This wireless smart capsule for gut health monitoring offers doctors and patients an unprecedented look inside the digestive system, making diagnosis and treatment more precise and less invasive than ever before. The future of personalized medicine could soon be as simple as swallowing a pill.",

      "Airfields face a constant battle with wildlife. Birds, rabbits and even deer can wander onto runways, creating dangerous situations for aircraft and crews. Birds are the biggest threat. When sucked into engines or hitting windscreens, they can cause catastrophic damage. In fact, the threat is so serious that the U.S. Civil Air Administration once built a \"chicken gun\" to fire bird carcasses at planes to test their resilience.",

      "Enter the robot coyote. The ERDC, in partnership with wildlife biologists Stephen Hammond and Jacob Jung and the USDA National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC), has spent five years developing these unique machines. The idea is simple. Most animals instinctively avoid coyotes, so why not use that fear to keep them away from airfields?",
      "The first prototypes, Coyote Rovers, started as Boston Dynamics Spot robots. However, these proved too slow to scare off wildlife. The team switched to four-wheeled Traxxas X-Maxx motorized cars, which can reach speeds of 20 mph. Each vehicle carries a plastic coyote dummy, blending just the right amount of realism and intimidation, all for about $3,000 each.",

These early trials showed promise. The robot coyotes successfully deterred birds and other animals, helping to keep runways clear and safe.",
      "But the ERDC isn't stopping there. The goal is to make these robot coyotes even smarter.

    "summary": "President Trump\u2019s top intelligence official leveled allegations on Wednesday that no U.S. spy chief has made against a former president or administration.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s top intelligence official appeared in the White House briefing room Wednesday to level allegations no U.S. spy chief has ever made against a former president or administration.",
      "National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard accused former President Barack Obama and his deputies of manufacturing a \u201cfalse\u201d intelligence analysis to show Russia tried to help Donald Trump win the 2016 election.",
      "Obama and former officials in his administration have dismissed the allegations as baseless. \u201cThese bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,\u201d Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said.",
      "Democrats have accused the administration of trying to change the subject as many of Trump\u2019s supporters have demanded the government release more documents and information related to the case of the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Leaders of the country\u2019s intelligence agencies have tended to keep a low public profile and to steer clear of explicitly partisan broadsides, much less insinuate that a former president may have engaged in a criminal conspiracy.",
      "But Gabbard, serving a commander in chief who has relished conspiracy theories and insisted he was the victim of a partisan plot, ventured into uncharted territory in her White House appearance.",
      "\u201cThere is irrefutable evidence that details how President Obama and his national security team directed the creation of an intelligence community assessment that they knew was false,\u201d said Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman.",
      "Gabbard announced she had declassified a five-year-old report by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee about the 2016 election. The Republican report was emphatically rejected at the time by Democratic lawmakers on the panel who played no role in its creation.",
      "The Republican report sought to cast doubt on an assessment by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election in a bid to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy. The Republican report found that the bulk of the 2017 intelligence assessment \u2014 which assessed that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy \u2014 was \u201csound.\u201d",
      "But it took issue with the assessment\u2019s finding that Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201caspired\u201d to help Trump win the 2016 election. The House report argued that the intelligence agencies\u2019 judgment was based on one piece of human intelligence that was open to different interpretations. The report added that some CIA officers objected to including the judgment about Putin\u2019s intentions, arguing that the intelligence behind it was insufficient.",
      "The House committee report also accused the director of the CIA at the time, John Brennan, of pushing to keep the finding about Putin in the assessment.",
      "Bipartisan Senate report",
      "Gabbard focused on the Republican House report, but a bipartisan Senate probe released the same year reached a different conclusion.",
      "The 2020 Senate investigation, which spanned three years, involved more than 200 witnesses and reviewed more than a million documents, endorsed the intelligence agencies\u2019 assessment that Russia had spread disinformation online and leaked stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee to undermine Clinton\u2019s candidacy and bolster Trump\u2019s prospects.",
      "Trump\u2019s current secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was the acting chair of the Intelligence Committee at the time. He and every other member of the committee, both Republicans and Democrats, endorsed the report\u2019s findings.",
      "Gabbard\u2019s decision to declassify an old Republican congressional report is the latest in a series of actions by the administration designed to reopen a politically polarized debate about what happened in the 2016 election and whether Trump benefited from Moscow\u2019s information warfare.",
      "Satisfying neither side",
      "The intelligence community\u2019s analysis of the 2016 election and subsequent government investigations have never satisfied either side of the American political divide.",
      "Intelligence agencies never delivered a verdict about the possible impact of Russia\u2019s influence operations on the electoral outcome, and a probe by special counsel Robert Mueller found that Russia intervened in 2016 to undercut Clinton. But it did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump team and the Kremlin, as some voices on the left had suggested.",
      "At the same time, a special counsel Trump appointed in his first term, John Durham, disappointed activists on the political right with his three-year investigation. Durham reported finding no criminal conspiracy among Obama administration officials to fabricate intelligence about Russia\u2019s operations and filed no charges against the CIA officers who oversaw the 2017 assessment.",
      "Democrats said Gabbard\u2019s decision to declassify the Republican House report could put sensitive sources on Russia at risk.",
      "\u201cIt seems as though the Trump administration is willing to declassify anything and everything except the Epstein files,\u201d Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the Democratic vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. \u201cThe desperate and irresponsible release of the partisan House intelligence report puts at risk some of the most sensitive sources and methods our Intelligence Community uses to spy on Russia.\u201d",
      "In her presentation at the White House, Gabbard publicly described detailed Russian intelligence reporting on Clinton, including allegations about her behavior and health that had not been verified.",
      "Gabbard then blasted Obama administration officials for including an unverified dossier about Trump by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, in the 2017 intelligence assessment. The dossier was included in the assessment's annex with a disclaimer that said its claims had not been verified.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, called Gabbard's claims \"a transparent effort to distract from bipartisan criticism of the Trump Administration\u2019s refusal to release the Jeffrey Epstein files.\"",
      "Himes added, though, that Gabbard had crossed a dangerous new rhetorical line. \u201cAs part of her effort to rewrite history,\" he said in a statement, \"she has accused President Obama and other former officials of engaging in a conspiracy to commit treason\u2014a claim as dangerous as it is baseless.\u201d"

      "The Justice Department said in a memo this month that a review of the case files had not turned up a client list and that there was \u201cno credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions.\"",
      "Many of Trump\u2019s supporters have disregarded Trump's calls to move on from the records, prompting the president to direct Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of the files last week. The Justice Department has a pending request to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Southern District of New York, where Epstein was indicted."

It\u2019s the second straight negative earnings report from the company, which has suffered damage to its brand and become a lightning rod for street demonstrations.",
      "While Tesla is still the No. 1 seller of electric vehicles in the United States by a wide margin, the earnings report shows a deteriorating situation with no obvious quick fix for Musk, the world\u2019s wealthiest person.",
      "On a conference call with analysts, Musk laid out aggressive plans to try to expand Tesla\u2019s nascent robotaxi service beyond its limited service area in Austin, Texas. He said he wants to make self-driving Tesla taxis available to half the U.S. population by the end of the year \u2014 an extremely ambitious goal that he acknowledged depends on both regulatory approvals and the service\u2019s safety record.",
      "Tesla\u2019s Austin robotaxi service is small and still uses human safety observers in the vehicles, putting Tesla far behind Google spinoff Waymo, the market leader in robotaxis.",

      "Revenue was $22.5 billion for the three months ending June 30, down 12% from a year ago, while earnings were 40 cents per share, down 23% from a year ago.",
      "Tesla said in a note to investors that the quarter was a \u201cseminal point in Tesla\u2019s history: the beginning of our transition from leading the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services.\u201d",
      "Musk has angered people across the political spectrum this year, first with his embrace of far-right politics and his chain saw-wielding tenure as an adviser to President Donald Trump and then when he and Trump had a high-profile falling-out. Musk has vowed to start a political party but so far has not followed through in any visible way.",
      "The earnings report covers Tesla\u2019s finances for April, May and June \u2014 a period that overlapped with Musk\u2019s tenure in the White House. Musk left his government job May 30.",
      "Tesla had already warned this month that vehicle deliveries were sagging, down 14% in the second quarter from a year ago. It was the second straight quarter of falling deliveries as Tesla faces not only damage to its brand but also increasing competition, including from Chinese electric vehicle makers.",
      "Musk has tried to keep shareholders happy with developments on other fronts, including by trying to launch a robotaxi service in Austin. Musk has also hyped humanoid assistants as a future potential Tesla product, but none have shipped. On Monday, Tesla opened a diner and drive-in in West Hollywood, California.",

      "Musk and Vaibhav Taneja, who is Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, declined on the conference call to provide many details about how the Austin robotaxi service is going. Taneja said in response to an analyst\u2019s question that the service has a \u201chandful of vehicles right now\u201d and that it had 7,000 miles of operating experience. That comes out to about 226 miles per days since the June 22 service launch.",
      "Musk\u2019s companies are increasingly intertwined. He merged his social media app, X, with his AI startup, xAI, in March, and his rocket company, SpaceX, is an investor in xAI. This month, Tesla began integrating xAI\u2019s chatbot, Grok, into Tesla vehicles, days after Grok went on neo-Nazi tirades. Musk has said that while he does not support merging Tesla and xAI, he will put a potential Tesla investment into the company up for a shareholder vote.",
      "Wall Street analysts had expected Tesla revenue of $22.74 billion and earnings per share of 43 cents, according to an average of estimates compiled by LSEG.",
      "Musk is deeply unpopular with the American public, with 58% having unfavorable views of him and 33% having favorable views, according to a polling average run by statistics writer Nate Silver.",
      "And more protests are on the horizon. \u201cTesla Takedown\u201d demonstrations continue to happen weekly, and more than 30 such protests are planned for this weekend, according to a public schedule of the events. A demonstration is scheduled for Saturday at the newly opened Tesla Diner.",
      "Tesla Takedown, an organization behind many of the protests, took note of the poor financial results Wednesday and said the company is overvalued.",

    "summary": "Ozzy Osbourne, the heavy metal legend and Black Sabbath frontman, became a pioneer in the reality television landscape with \"The Osbournes.\"",
    "story": [
      "In 2001, Rod Aissa was one of a handful of MTV executives having lunch with Sharon Osbourne at a restaurant in Santa Monica, California, to discuss a potential collaboration with her family. Osbourne apologized for arriving late, blamed it on her husband\u2019s antics and immediately launched into a dizzying play-by-play of her home\u2019s hijinks that had everyone laughing \u2014 hard.",
      "\u201cWe are over-the-top and crazy, and there\u2019s a lot of cursing and fighting and dogs everywhere,\u201d Aissa recalled her saying then, \u201cbut there\u2019s so much love in our family.\u201d",
      "That family, of course, also includes Ozzy Osbourne, the heavy metal legend and Black Sabbath front man who accidentally became a pioneer in reality television, thanks to the early aughts phenomenon \u201cThe Osbournes.\u201d With the news that Ozzy died Tuesday at 76, fans flooded social media with footage of the Prince of Darkness\u2019 theatrical performances, as well as clips of him chasing his elusive cat through his backyard and unapologetically marveling at the assembly of a Chipotle burrito.",
      "Before \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d premiered in 2002, Ozzy Osbourne was known for pioneering heavy metal and popularizing \u201cmany of its over-the-top stereotypes: overindulgence, a disregard for obeying rules, a kind of cartoonish, perpetual adolescence,\u201d said Craig Marks, music journalist and executive editor of HITS magazine. \u201cTo other hard-rock musicians especially, he was a force of nature, someone whose appetite for drugs was practically heroic.\u201d",
      "But it was the family around the rocker that piqued the interest of MTV executives, including Aissa, and led to the creation of a series that launched an entire television subgenre, while introducing him to a new generation who were too young to experience Black Sabbath\u2019s heyday. A standout 2000 episode of \u201cMTV Cribs\u201d \u2014 in which teens Jack and Kelly Osbourne give MTV a tour of their home \u2014 had offered a glimpse into the chaotic but charming dynamics. It also presented Ozzy\u2019s various paradoxes: originally from working-class Birmingham, England, and now moving into a brand-new Beverly Hills mansion; singing about death and the occult onstage and just trying to watch the History Channel at home.",
      "\u201cWe knew we had lightning in a bottle because this family, with their love and dysfunction, represented so many of us in the world,\u201d Aissa continued. \u201cAnd it was going to be something special because of Ozzy \u2014 his sense of humor and his lack of inhibition to say anything or behave a certain way. You could never script him or ask him to do anything twice, because that wasn\u2019t who he was. You couldn\u2019t even ask Ozzy to walk through a door twice because the camera wasn\u2019t ready. He\u2019d just say, \u2018F--- off!\u2019\u201d",
      "Countless hours of footage over three years captured the family\u2019s everyday rhythms \u2014 tending to their many pets, meeting with famous friends and butting heads with neighbors \u2014 as well as their more major moments, like Sharon\u2019s cancer diagnosis, Ozzy\u2019s near-fatal quad bike accident, and the kids\u2019 struggles with substances and newfound fame. It was all edited together like an American sitcom, complete with nostalgic graphics, upbeat needle drops and a crooner cover of Ozzy\u2019s hit \u201cCrazy Train\u201d as its theme song.",
      "\u201cI had to watch the first episode with Ozzy, and it was the longest 22 minutes of my life,\u201d Aissa said with a laugh. Afterward, \u201cOzzy didn\u2019t say a word or laugh or anything; I thought he hated it. He stood up and said to me, \u2018I love them so much. Do not f--- this up.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t love it, but he loved being at home with the family, and [the show] gave them all a reason to be together and really connect,\u201d he added. \u201cAt that point in his career \u2014 platinum records everywhere, sold-out worldwide tours, a recording studio in his house \u2014 Ozzy didn\u2019t need this show, and he had no real interest in it. But as the episodes aired, and as people started talking to him about what a real family they are, he started really appreciating what it was they were doing.\u201d",
      "The show\u2019s March 2002 premiere was an instant hit. It became both MTV\u2019s highest-rated series to date and the most-watched show on any cable channel; its first season went on to win the Emmy Award for best reality program. And its cultural impact was global, given the network\u2019s indisputable cultural standing.",
      "\u201cMTV was still the be-all end-all for youth culture when \u2018The Osbournes\u2019 debuted,\u201d said Marks, who also co-wrote the book \u201cI Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution.\u201d \u201cSocial media didn\u2019t really exist yet \u2014 Myspace would launch in 2003 \u2014 and \u2018MTV Cribs,\u2019 arguably the network\u2019s first \u2018celebrity\u2019 reality show, started in 2000 and was a hit. But nothing compared to the cataclysm of \u2018The Osbournes.\u2019\u201d",
      "In those days, unscripted shows were just emerging, especially those featuring the rich and famous. But the early 2000s were also the height of magazine tabloids and celebrity obsession, said Colette Shade, author of the book \u201cY2K: How the 2000s Became Everything (Essays on the Future That Never Was).\u201d The Osbournes and their bumbling patriarch simply arrived at the right moment.",
      "\u201cPeople enjoyed the fact that it was this behind-the-curtain look, and that he came off in the show as just shuffling around befuddled by various aspects of modern life, in an endearing and silly way that\u2019s very different from his public persona,\u201d Shade said. \u201cOzzy was known in a certain way by boomers, but as the old guy from \u2018The Osbournes,\u2019 he was able to connect with a new audience of millennials without even trying.\u201d",
      "After the show\u2019s run, each family member became a standalone TV personality: Sharon as an author, reality competition judge and talk show host; Kelly as a commentator on E!\u2019s \u201cFashion Police\u201d; and Jack as a travel reporter and docuseries producer (including shows with Ozzy and Sharon).",
      "Though \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d only ran for four seasons over three years, its impact continues. The series cemented MTV as a hub for zeitgeisty unscripted programming, with \u201cPunk\u2019d,\u201d \u201cNewlyweds: Nick & Jessica\u201d and \u201cLaguna Beach\u201d premiering in the years that followed. Networks tried to capitalize on unexpected juxtaposition of the ordinary and the ostentatious, like Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie\u2019s labor-centric \u201cThe Simple Life\u201d and the Playboy Mansion-set \u201cThe Girls Next Door.\u201d",
      "Numerous copycat projects \u2014 starring Hulk Hogan, Gene Simmons, Terry Bradshaw, Joseph \u201cRev Run\u201d Simmons, Snoop Dogg, Sylvester Stallone, Alec Baldwin, the Kardashians and more \u2014 have since attempted to replicate Ozzy\u2019s singular \u201ccelebrity at home\u201d charisma.",
      "\u201cIt was an extremely successful show that was brand-new and relatively cheap to produce,\u201d Shade said. \u201cThey created this whole new publicity tool for celebrities to burnish their image and revive their careers, and it\u2019s become its own category of reality show that\u2019s kind of played out. People now see it as more of a construction than maybe they did at the time.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s because, back then, it really wasn\u2019t. Unlike today\u2019s unscripted titles \u2014 oftentimes with prespecified storylines, setup scenes, talking-head interviews and personal branding plans \u2014 \u201cThe Osbournes\u201d was built with little strategy and no real expectations. \u201cTo be honest, we didn\u2019t really know what we were doing yet, because no one had done it before,\u201d Aissa admitted with a laugh.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to make reality television; we just set out to make television,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey weren\u2019t trying to be reality stars. They were just being their authentic selves, interacting with each other as if they didn\u2019t see the cameras. It was as if they didn\u2019t care, and I think that was a big part of the magic.\u201d"

      "BEIJING \u2014 Chinese President Xi Jinping urged top European Union officials on Thursday to \u201cproperly handle differences and frictions\u201d as he criticized Brussels\u2019s recent trade actions against Beijing at a tense summit dominated by concerns on trade and the Ukraine war.",
      "Expectations were low for the summit in the Chinese capital marking 50 years of diplomatic ties after weeks of escalating tension and wrangling over its format, with the duration abruptly halved to a single day at Beijing\u2019s request.",
      "\u201cThe current challenges facing Europe do not come from China,\u201d Xi told visiting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa, state news agency Xinhua said.",
      "He urged the E.U. to \u201cadhere to open cooperation and properly handle differences and frictions,\u201d after von der Leyen earlier called for a rebalancing of trade ties with the world\u2019s second-largest economy, saying relations were at an \u201cinflection point.\u201d",
      "\u201cImproving competitiveness cannot rely on \u2018building walls and fortresses,\u2019\u201d Xi added, according to Xinhua. \u201c\u2018Decoupling and breaking chains\u2019 will only result in isolation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is hoped that the European side will keep the trade and investment market open and refrain from using restrictive economic and trade tools,\u201d Xi said.",
      "During the meeting in Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People, von der Leyen told Xi, \u201cAs our cooperation has deepened, so have imbalances,\u201d according to a pool report.",
      "\u201cWe have reached an inflection point,\u201d she added, urging China to \u201ccome forward with real solutions.\u201d",
      "She was referring to the E.U.\u2019s trade deficit with China, which ballooned to a historic 305.8 billion euros ($360 billion) last year.",
      "E.U. trade actions in the past year have targeted Chinese exports of EVs among other goods, and its officials have repeatedly complained about Chinese industrial overcapacity.",
      "In a further veiled criticism of Brussels\u2019s recent hawkish stance on China, Xi also warned E.U. leaders to \u201cmake correct strategic choices.\u201d",
      "The two E.U. officials were set to meet Chinese Premier Li Qiang later. Both sides hope to reach a modest joint statement on climate, now one of the rare bright spots in their cooperation.",
      "At the start of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, both sides had more of a consensus in working together to tackle trade challenges from the United States, said Cui Hongjian, a foreign policy professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University.",
      "\u201cRecently the situation has changed,\u201d Cui said. \u201cThe E.U. has continued to compromise with the United States, which means that there is currently a lack of impetus for E.U.-China ties to become closer.\u201d",
      "The run-up to the summit saw tit-for-tat trade disputes and hawkish European rhetoric, such as a July 8 accusation by von der Leyen that China was flooding global markets as a result of its overcapacity and \u201cenabling Russia\u2019s war economy.\u201d",
      "In a post on X on Thursday, however, von der Leyen struck a more conciliatory tone, describing the summit as an opportunity to \u201cboth advance and rebalance our relationship.\u201d",
      "Topics the Europeans are expected to raise in the talks are electric vehicles and China\u2019s rare earth export controls that disrupted supply chains worldwide, causing temporary stoppages in European automotive production lines in May.",
      "But China\u2019s exports of rare earth magnets to the E.U. surged in June by 245% from May, to stand at 1,364 metric tons (1,503 short tons), though that was still 35% lower than the year-earlier figure, customs data showed.",
      "The E.U. is likely to seal a trade deal with the United States for a broad tariff of 15% on its exports after intense negotiations, avoiding a harsher 30% figure threatened by Trump."

      "\"Punk Rock and Donald Trump just don't belong together. So Upon finding out that Brew Ha Ha promotions donated to the Trump campaign we will not be playing any more Punk in the Park shows,\" the band said in the caption of an Instagram video.",
      "In the video, frontman Ken Casey told an audience: \"The far right ain't the new punk.\"",
      "The band had just recently performed in Denver but said it will not continue for any other Punk in the Park shows.",
      "Cameron Collins, owner of Brew Ha Ha, the group that organized the festival, posted his own statement in response.",
      "\"We live in a two-party system, and unfortunately, you must choose based on a few important issues that resonate with you. For me, those issues were the promise to end wars and refrain from entering new international conflicts, lower taxes, and stopping government overreach,\" Collins said.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s top intelligence official appeared in the White House briefing room Wednesday to level allegations no U.S. spy chief has ever made against a former president or administration.",
      "National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard accused former President Barack Obama and his deputies of manufacturing a \u201cfalse\u201d intelligence analysis to show Russia tried to help Donald Trump win the 2016 election.",
      "Obama and former officials in his administration have dismissed the allegations as baseless. \u201cThese bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,\u201d Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush said.",
      "Democrats have accused the administration of trying to change the subject as many of Trump\u2019s supporters have demanded the government release more documents and information related to the case of the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Leaders of the country\u2019s intelligence agencies have tended to keep a low public profile and to steer clear of explicitly partisan broadsides, much less insinuate that a former president may have engaged in a criminal conspiracy.",
      "But Gabbard, serving a commander in chief who has relished conspiracy theories and insisted he was the victim of a partisan plot, ventured into uncharted territory in her White House appearance.",
      "\u201cThere is irrefutable evidence that details how President Obama and his national security team directed the creation of an intelligence community assessment that they knew was false,\u201d said Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman.",
      "Gabbard announced she had declassified a five-year-old report by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee about the 2016 election. The Republican report was emphatically rejected at the time by Democratic lawmakers on the panel who played no role in its creation.",
      "The Republican report sought to cast doubt on an assessment by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election in a bid to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy. The Republican report found that the bulk of the 2017 intelligence assessment \u2014 which assessed that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy \u2014 was \u201csound.\u201d",
      "But it took issue with the assessment\u2019s finding that Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201caspired\u201d to help Trump win the 2016 election. The House report argued that the intelligence agencies\u2019 judgment was based on one piece of human intelligence that was open to different interpretations. The report added that some CIA officers objected to including the judgment about Putin\u2019s intentions, arguing that the intelligence behind it was insufficient.",
      "The House committee report also accused the director of the CIA at the time, John Brennan, of pushing to keep the finding about Putin in the assessment.",
      "Bipartisan Senate report",
      "Gabbard focused on the Republican House report, but a bipartisan Senate probe released the same year reached a different conclusion.",
      "The 2020 Senate investigation, which spanned three years, involved more than 200 witnesses and reviewed more than a million documents, endorsed the intelligence agencies\u2019 assessment that Russia had spread disinformation online and leaked stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee to undermine Clinton\u2019s candidacy and bolster Trump\u2019s prospects.",
      "Trump\u2019s current secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was the acting chair of the Intelligence Committee at the time. He and every other member of the committee, both Republicans and Democrats, endorsed the report\u2019s findings.",
      "Gabbard\u2019s decision to declassify an old Republican congressional report is the latest in a series of actions by the administration designed to reopen a politically polarized debate about what happened in the 2016 election and whether Trump benefited from Moscow\u2019s information warfare.",
      "Satisfying neither side",
      "The intelligence community\u2019s analysis of the 2016 election and subsequent government investigations have never satisfied either side of the American political divide.",
      "Intelligence agencies never delivered a verdict about the possible impact of Russia\u2019s influence operations on the electoral outcome, and a probe by special counsel Robert Mueller found that Russia intervened in 2016 to undercut Clinton. But it did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump team and the Kremlin, as some voices on the left had suggested.",
      "At the same time, a special counsel Trump appointed in his first term, John Durham, disappointed activists on the political right with his three-year investigation. Durham reported finding no criminal conspiracy among Obama administration officials to fabricate intelligence about Russia\u2019s operations and filed no charges against the CIA officers who oversaw the 2017 assessment.",
      "Democrats said Gabbard\u2019s decision to declassify the Republican House report could put sensitive sources on Russia at risk.",
      "\u201cIt seems as though the Trump administration is willing to declassify anything and everything except the Epstein files,\u201d Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the Democratic vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. \u201cThe desperate and irresponsible release of the partisan House intelligence report puts at risk some of the most sensitive sources and methods our Intelligence Community uses to spy on Russia.\u201d",
      "In her presentation at the White House, Gabbard publicly described detailed Russian intelligence reporting on Clinton, including allegations about her behavior and health that had not been verified.",
      "Gabbard then blasted Obama administration officials for including an unverified dossier about Trump by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, in the 2017 intelligence assessment. The dossier was included in the assessment's annex with a disclaimer that said its claims had not been verified.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, called Gabbard's claims \"a transparent effort to distract from bipartisan criticism of the Trump Administration\u2019s refusal to release the Jeffrey Epstein files.\"",
      "Himes added, though, that Gabbard had crossed a dangerous new rhetorical line. \u201cAs part of her effort to rewrite history,\" he said in a statement, \"she has accused President Obama and other former officials of engaging in a conspiracy to commit treason\u2014a claim as dangerous as it is baseless.\u201d"

      "The man, Michael Gann, transported the bombs from Long Island to New York City and stored five of them and four shotgun shells on an apartment building rooftop in the SoHo neighborhood, officials said. He intended to combine the shotgun shells with one or more of the improvised explosive devices, they said.",
      "On March 27, Gann posted a message to President Donald Trump's official X account, the indictment said.",

      "Gann has not yet entered a plea, and his attorney declined to comment.",
      "Ordering online",
      "Gann told law enforcement officials that he used two household compounds that he ordered online to make the improvised explosives, according to court documents. He also purchased over 200 cardboard tubes and more than 50 feet of fuses. One of the devices he built had roughly 30 grams of explosive powder \u2014 about 600 times the legal limit for consumer fireworks.",
      "Officials said he appeared to have acted alone and was not acting as part of a group.",
      "\"Gann allegedly produced multiple improvised explosive devices intended for use in Manhattan,\u201d said Christopher Raia, the head of the FBI's New York field office. \u201cDue to the successful partnership of law enforcement agencies in New York, Gann was swiftly brought to justice before he could harm innocent civilians.\"",
      "One of the witnesses, a U.S. military veteran, told the FBI that as Gann was mixing the explosives in Inwood, a town on Long Island, he said, \u201cWhat kind of veteran are you? You see a problem going on in the neighborhood and you do nothing about it.\u201d",
      "\u201cGann then pointed to a Jewish school,\u201d according to a criminal complaint that was filed at the time of his arrest.",
      "A second witness agreed to make phone calls to Gann while the FBI listened in, according to the criminal complaint. Gann told the witness in one call that \u201che had lit one of the devices near the East River on the FDR Drive; that the device had exploded, scaring Gann,\u201d it says.",
      "Gann then said, according to the witness, that he was considering disposing of the remaining five devices by throwing them into the river or turning them in to the New York City Fire Department.",
      "On June 5, the day of the alleged call, law enforcement agents saw Gann walking down the street carrying a shoulder bag, according to the complaint. When the agents identified themselves to Gann, he told them he was on his way to the fire department to drop the devices off, it says.",
      "After being read his rights, Gann told law enforcement officials that he \u201cwished to make pyrotechnics and used artificial intelligence to learn which chemicals to purchase and mix,\u201d the complaint says.",
      "It says Gann created four devices initially and threw three from the Manhattan side of the Williamsburg Bridge. Two devices fell into the water, and one fell on the train tracks and was recovered near there.",
      "\"Gann built explosive devices, stored them on a rooftop in SoHo,\" interim U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said, \u201cand threw one onto the subway tracks \u2014 putting countless lives at risk.\u201d"

      "The House Oversight Committee will subpoena the Justice Department to release files tied to the case of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, according to a committee spokesperson, after three Republicans on a subcommittee joined Democrats to vote on the matter Wednesday.",
      "The subpoena \u201cwill be issued in the future,\u201d the spokesperson said, without providing additional details on the timing.",
      "Three Republicans on the Federal Law Enforcement Subcommittee joined Democrats in an 8-2 vote to approve a motion by Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., to compel the Justice Department to release files tied to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in prison in 2019.",
      "The subpoena would request the redaction of names of victims and any personally identifying information. The materials would be reviewed internally by the committee and would not be for public release.",
      "Subcommittee Chairman Clay Higgins, R-La., and Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., were the only no votes. Republican Reps. Nancy Mace, of South Carolina; Scott Perry, of Pennsylvania; and Brian Jack, of Georgia, voted with Democrats to approve the motion.",
      "Subpoenas will also be issued to former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former FBI directors James Comey and Robert Mueller, and former attorneys general Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder, Merrick Garland, William Barr, Jeff Sessions and Alberto Gonzales as part of an investigation into Epstein\u2019s co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, following a motion from Perry.",
      "Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence following her conviction on federal sex trafficking charges in 2021.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., subpoenaed Maxwell for a deposition at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee, Florida, on Aug. 11, citing \"immense public interest and scrutiny.\"",
      "President Donald Trump and his Republican allies have sought to blame Democrats and distract from the firestorm surrounding Epstein, even though Trump's supporters promoted conspiracy theories tied to Epstein\u2019s death in prison for many years. On the campaign trail, Trump said he would have \u201cno problem\u201d looking into a list of Epstein\u2019s clients if he were elected. But recently he has downplayed the issue, saying he doesn\u2019t want the support of those pushing the Epstein \u201cbulls---.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department said in a memo this month that a review of the case files had not turned up a client list and that there was \u201cno credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions.\"",
      "Many of Trump\u2019s supporters have disregarded Trump's calls to move on from the records, prompting the president to direct Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of the files last week. The Justice Department has a pending request to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Southern District of New York, where Epstein was indicted."

    "story": [
      "A meeting Wednesday at the Food and Drug Administration about fluoride supplements became, at one point, a contentious back-and-forth over whether the ingestible tablets harm children\u2019s microbiomes or play a vital role in helping protect them from tooth decay.",
      "Pediatric dentists consider the chewable tablets, available only by prescription, as particularly important for families who live in areas without fluoride in drinking water, who don\u2019t have dental insurance or who can\u2019t afford regular visits to dentists.",
      "Under Commissioner Marty Makary, however, the FDA has been taking steps to remove fluoride supplements from the market. A final decision isn\u2019t expected until October, although advocates and critics at the meeting didn\u2019t agree on basic scientific methods or even responsible dental practices.",
      "During the public meeting held in Silver Spring, Maryland, dental experts outlined the careful balance of getting the right amount of fluoride to their patients. Too little can result in weakened tooth enamel, said Dr. James Bekker, a member of the Utah Dental Association. Too much can lead to fluorosis, a condition that leaves white or brown spots on the teeth.",
      "\u201cThere are areas where we have community water fluoridation. We don\u2019t need supplements in those areas,\u201d said Bekker, who was invited to speak at Wednesday\u2019s meeting. \u201cBut there are many areas of our country where we either don\u2019t have community water fluoridation or we don\u2019t have naturally occurring fluoride. In those places, supplements are the key to achieving that balance.\u201d",
      "A panelist, Dr. Bill Osmunson, a retired dentist who now works for the Fluoride Action Network, an anti-fluoride group, peppered Bekker about how he determines whether a child needs fluoride supplements.",
      "\u201cYou ask where they live?\u201d Osmunson asked. \u201cYou ask where they go to school?\u201d",
      "Bekker explained how he does comprehensive assessments of his young patients, including reviewing dietary issues and whether they use other supplements, before he prescribes the fluoride tablets or drops.",
      "\u201cReally, you ask all those questions?\u201d Osmunson said.",
      "\u201cYou bet,\u201d Bekker said.",
      "Osmunson\u2019s \u201cinquisition of Dr. Bekker was a tactic to attempt to make him look incompetent,\u201d said Dr. Johnny Johnson, president of the American Fluoridation Society. \u201cThat type of exchange is meant as a popularity contest.\u201d Johnson spoke in favor of the supplement during a public comment session.",
      "Osmunson and other critics relied on data that didn\u2019t necessarily prove their criticism of the products.",
      "For example, Makary, the FDA commissioner, has said ingested fluoride alters the gut microbiome. His assertion appears to hinge on a 2023 review of research by scientists in Ireland.",
      "That analysis noted that animal studies suggested that ingesting fluoride affected the microbiome but that none of the studies examined fluoride and the human microbiome. The researchers concluded that any possible effect of fluoride on the microbiome is \u201cstill in its early days, and studies investigating the impact of fluoride on the human microbiome have only begun to appear in the literature.\u201d",
      "One of the authors of that study also spoke at Wednesday\u2019s meeting. \u201cFluoride consumption at levels which we consider good for maintaining good oral health probably have limited impact on the oral and gut microbiomes,\u201d said Gary Moran of Trinity College Dublin in Ireland. But, he added, \u201cwe certainly need more studies.\u201d",
      "There was no vote for or against fluoride supplements.",
      "Dr. David Krol, a representative of the American Academy of Pediatrics, spoke in favor of fluoride supplements as one of many tools physicians need to ensure their patients\u2019 teeth are as strong as possible.",
      "\u201cFluoride supplementation, as well as conversations about diet and conversations about hygiene, are the kinds of things that take place between pediatricians and patients,\u201d Krol said. \u201cWe have to have that opportunity to continue those conversations and have those multifactorial tools to address this disease.\u201d",
      "Even though Medicaid covers oral health for children, fewer than half went to the dentist at least once a year.",
      "Cavities that erupt in those kids\u2019 mouths get worse if they\u2019re left untreated, and they can cause widespread damage. The decay \u201ceats away at the bone\u201d around the tooth and sometimes gets into the bloodstream, said Dr. Steven Levy, a professor of preventive and community dentistry at the University of Iowa.",
      "\u201cThis is more than just a garden-variety, middle-class person\u2019s experience with a cavity,\u201d he said.",
      "Major public health groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, recommend prescribing supplements for children starting at 6 months if the water supply isn\u2019t fluoridated.",
      "Fluoride supplements are often given to kids from age 5 until they have their permanent teeth, around age 13 or 14, Bekker said in an interview before the meeting. Babies get drops until they\u2019re old enough to chew tablets. They\u2019re generally inexpensive.",
      "Over-the-counter vitamins and supplements don\u2019t contain fluoride. Fluoride is available over the counter only in toothpaste and mouthwashes.",
      "Makary also objects to the fluoride supplements because they aren\u2019t approved by the FDA. Because the supplements had been in use for decades before Congress mandated that drug manufacturers show that their products were not only safe but also effective, they were never required to go through the approval process. For almost as long as the supplements have been prescribed, critics have been concerned about the lack of rigorous data showing their potential health effects and how they protect kids\u2019 teeth.",
      "\u201cI think we really need to understand the benefits,\u201d said Linda Birnbaum, a toxicologist and former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Toxicology Program. Birnbaum also spoke during the FDA meeting.",
      "Dr. Brett Kessler of the American Dental Association acknowledged that prescription fluoride supplements should be administered only after a \u201cthoughtful decision\u201d based on conversations between physicians and families.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping we can all take a breath, filter out all the noise and not give in to the anti-fluoride hysteria,\u201d he said during the meeting."

      "It will also pay $21 million to settle investigations by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the university said.",
      "Columbia Board of Trustees co-chairs David Greenwald and Jeh Johnson said in Wednesday\u2019s statement that the agreement \u201cconfirms the changes already underway at Columbia to meaningfully address antisemitism on our campus and allows the University to continue to undertake its transformative research and scholarship.\u201d",
      "Student protests over the war in Gaza, which Israel launched after the surprise terrorist attack by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, took place on college campuses across the U.S., including at Columbia.",
      "Trump campaigned on attacking those protests, and since taking office his administration has sought to deport some students who took part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations by accusing them of sympathizing with Hamas.",
      "U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon called the Columbia settlement \u201ca seismic shift in our nation\u2019s fight to hold institutions that accept American taxpayer dollars accountable for antisemitic discrimination and harassment.\u201d",

      "The gunman, who police said was fatally shot at the scene, had an \u201carsenal\u201d of weapons and was \u201clying in wait\u201d when he opened fire on the pair of parked patrol vehicles around 1:05 p.m., acting Police Chief Michael Failing said.",

      "One of those officers was shot in the hand, and the second was shot multiple times, Failing said. A third officer who heard the call for help and was driving to assist was also shot multiple times, he said.",
      "The two officers who were shot multiple times were flown to a hospital in Cleveland. They were in critical condition, Bradley said.",

      "And in all three cases, President Donald Trump played a key role.",
      "New York: After toying with a gubernatorial bid for months, GOP Rep. Mike Lawler announced today he would not challenge New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and instead run for re-election.",
      "The decision comes as a relief to Republicans, who feared Lawler\u2019s Hudson Valley district \u2014 one of three they represent that Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election \u2014 would be even more at risk without an incumbent on the ballot. Trump and GOP leaders had been trying to steer Lawler away from the governor\u2019s race, with the president even endorsing him for re-election in May before he made up his mind.",
      "Lawler said on \u201cMeet the Press NOW\u201c that he met with Trump, who \u201coffered his perspective that he believes the right thing to do is to run for re-election.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut ultimately it was my decision,\u201d Lawler added.",

      "Still, the announcement is welcome news for Rogers and the Senate GOP leaders who are supporting him as he seeks the seat Democratic Sen. Gary Peters is vacating. Trump has not yet endorsed a candidate in the race, although he is expected to back Rogers soon, two Republican sources told NBC News.",
      "Iowa: Earlier this month, GOP Rep. Zach Nunn passed on a bid for Iowa governor after speaking with Trump.

      "Gov. Kim Reynolds\u2019 decision to not seek re-election could lead to a crowded Republican field. One of Nunn\u2019s colleagues, Rep. Randy Feenstra, who represents a safer district, is exploring a bid.",
      "Looking ahead: Plenty of challenges still await Republican leaders and Trump, who has been steadily rolling out endorsements throughout the year, as the midterm map takes shape. Heading into the summer congressional recess, they will work to ensure that incumbents in key states and districts run for re-election. And they are still searching for candidates in critical Senate races in Georgia and North Carolina.",

      "The latest chapter in Trump\u2019s distraction strategy",
      "President Donald Trump and his Cabinet have been busy this week declassifying reports and levying a flurry of controversial accusations.",
      "The timing has aroused suspicions of a larger strategy. Case in point: Today\u2019s appearance by the head of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, in the White House briefing room to amplify Trump\u2019s unfounded accusation that former President Obama committed \u201ctreason\u201d to rig the elections in 2016 and 2020.",
      "Treason is defined as attempting to overthrow the government by waging war against the state, or materially aiding its enemies. Trump is basing his charge on a widely discredited 2020 Republican House intelligence report that excluded Democratic committee members, differing from an earlier, bipartisan and unanimous Senate report led by then-Intelligence Committee Chairman Marco Rubio \u2014 now, of course, Trump\u2019s secretary of state and national security adviser.",
      "Still, Gabbard has referred Obama for possible criminal prosecution, creating headlines despite no indication of an error in the intelligence assessments or wrongdoing. Even if there were, Obama would likely have immunity based on last year\u2019s Supreme Court\u2019s decision that presidents cannot be prosecuted for offenses while in office. Plus, Trump\u2019s own special prosecutor found no reason to file charges after a three-year investigation.",
      "Also striking was the sudden release of secret files on Martin Luther King Jr. The files had been under a court-ordered seal since 1977, but Trump signed an order in January to take steps to make them public. On Monday, thousands of pages were released with no advance notice \u2014 while King\u2019s family was still reading them, hoping to redact unsubstantiated claims about MLK\u2019s personal life. Critics said the White House was resurrecting old conspiracy theories to distract from the furor over Trump\u2019s failure to release the Epstein files.",
      "Adding to the cacophony was the president\u2019s social media exhumation of a settled dispute over the name of Washington\u2019s NFL team. Known for almost a century as the \u201cRedskins,\u201d in 2022 the team was renamed the \u201cCommanders\u201d to satisfy many Native American tribes.",
      "But now Trump is threatening to block the team\u2019s return to Washington from the suburbs if it doesn\u2019t reclaim its old name. That would be a nonstarter with local officials who have to approve the team\u2019s move \u2014 and hardly a distraction to diehard D.C. football fans.",

    "summary": "Rep. Thomas Massie is gaining more Republican friends and allies as he pushes for releasing the Epstein files after having a falling with Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Once fighting a lonely battle against President Donald Trump, GOP Rep. Thomas Massie has found an issue that is winning him more Republican friends and political allies than he has had all year: his push to release the Jeffrey Epstein files.",
      "Many of Trump\u2019s MAGA allies on and off Capitol Hill are frustrated with Trump and top officials in his administration for dragging their feet in releasing the government\u2019s remaining documents and records related to Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender.",
      "But they\u2019re rooting for Massie, who has leaned into the fight in recent weeks and made it his sole mission to get the files released. It is a rare issue on which Massie aligns more closely with many of Trump\u2019s own supporters than Trump himself. That's a big shift for Massie, a Kentucky conservative who was swimming against the current in his opposition to Trump's megabill by raising debt concerns that fell on deaf ears with other Republicans.",
      "Nearly a dozen House conservatives have signed on to Massie\u2019s resolution to defy Trump and force Attorney General Pam Bondi to publish \u201call unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\u201d that the Justice Department and FBI possess. Thirteen Democrats, including Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi of California and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have joined the effort, as well.",
      "\u201cI have the people on my side,\u201d Massie told reporters, pointing to a CBS News/YouGov poll that found that 89% of U.S. adults want all of the Epstein files released.",
      "Republicans split evenly in the CBS poll when they were asked whether they\u2019re \u201csatisfied\u201d or \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with Trump\u2019s handling of the Epstein case. That\u2019s very unusual for Trump, who tends to win lopsidedly high marks from self-identified Republicans on his handling of issues. A recent Quinnipiac University poll also found the GOP split about evenly when it comes to Trump\u2019s handling of the Epstein matter.",
      "The CBS poll found that Trump\u2019s overall approval rating has fallen to 42% but that 89% of Republicans approve of the job he has done in his first six months back in office.",
      "Massie leans into confrontation with Trump",
      "Massie is boldly going where no other Republican in Congress dares go: running for re-election while leaning into a confrontation with Trump, who has threatened to support a primary challenger to oust him in the GOP contest.",
      "Massie told NBC News that Trump and his allies are wasting their time, vowing that their efforts to unseat him will not only fail but also backfire.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve spent $1.8 million against me so far in my congressional district. I think it\u2019s had very little effect, but they\u2019re trying to beat up on me to keep everybody else in line here. and I think it\u2019s not working,\u201d Massie said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to backfire tremendously.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re wasting millions of dollars against me, and they\u2019re going to lose the majority because of that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it will embolden Republicans who are right now, quietly, agreeing with me but saying: \u2018I\u2019m afraid of winning my primary. Let\u2019s see if you can win yours, Massie.\u2019\u201d",
      "Massie\u2019s confidence drew a clapback from Calvin Moore, a former House GOP campaign operative, who said on X, \u201cHow\u2019d that work out for [Bob Good?],\u201d referring to the former Virginia congressman who lost his 2024 primary to a Trump-backed challenger.",
      "Massie\u2019s foray into the Epstein saga has also sparked a personal, very public row between him and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. Johnson, a Trump loyalist, said Wednesday that \u201cRepublicans stand for maximum transparency and truth\u201d and are \u201cpushing for the release of all credible information\u201d about the Epstein matter, but he added that Massie\u2019s Epstein resolution with Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., would provide no protection for victims\u2019 identities.",
      "\u201cWe have ... a moral obligation to protect people who have been the victims of these unspeakable crimes so that their names are not drug through the mud,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "A day earlier, Johnson invoked Massie at his weekly news conference, showing unusual frustration and saying that he was baffled by Massie\u2019s motivation in the Epstein matter and that \u201csome people seem to enjoy trying to inflict political pain on their own teammates.\u201d",
      "Massie later told reporters that introducing his Epstein resolution now would give his effort momentum over the House\u2019s five-week summer recess, which begins Thursday. He and Khanna, Massie said, plan to file a so-called discharge petition to force a vote on their resolution when the House returns in September if they can win support from 218 members.",
      "Then, in a midnight post on X, Massie shot back at Johnson: \u201c@SpeakerJohnson, why are you running cover for an underage sex trafficking ring and pretending this is a partisan issue? MAGA voted for this.\u201d",
      "Johnson\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about Massie\u2019s post. Johnson has repeatedly said anyone who has committed sex crimes should be prosecuted.",
      "And Massie\u2019s effort has been elevated by some podcasters credited with boosting Trump in the 2024 election, including Theo Von, who recently said on X, \u201cWhy cant we put the @RoKhanna @RepThomasMassie bill for a vote this week @SpeakerJohnson @JDVance??\u201d",
      "Von also publicly questioned why Vance isn\u2019t standing by his earlier comment on Von\u2019s own show that \u201cwe need to release the Epstein list; that is an important thing.\u201d",
      "Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Cory Mills of Florida and Nancy Mace of South Carolina are among the Republicans who have signed on to the Massie-Khanna resolution. Massie also has an ally in Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a fellow self-described libertarian who describes Massie as a good friend.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a big supporter of his, and vice versa. I\u2019m planning a 10-city tour with him in September to support him, and we will do what it takes. We both represent sort of the liberty wing of the Republican Party,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe want to make sure that we don\u2019t allow anybody to come in and try to defeat him.\u201d",
      "Paul is the only GOP senator who voted against Trump\u2019s megabill because of debt concerns, but, unlike Massie, he doesn\u2019t face re-election until 2028. Paul said he\u2019s \u201cvery confident\u201d Massie will beat a Trump-backed challenge.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the most fiscally conservative member of the House. He\u2019s the most pro-gun member of the House, most pro-Bill of Rights person in the House,\u201d Paul said. \u201cGood sense of humor, travels the district and is somebody who pays attention to his constituents. I think he\u2019ll do well.\u201d"

      "What attracts flies in the home?",
      "There are a few common causes for flies around the home, according to our experts. While there are a few different types of flies, in addition to other flying insects that are often confused for one another, like mosquitoes and gnats, many of them are typically caused by the following factors:",
      "Fruit and sugar: Both fruit flies and house flies, which are categorized as \u201cfilth flies,\u201d are extremely attracted to the smell of fruit, according to Bloom.  \u201cIn the home, they are typically introduced as eggs on fruit and produce which then emerge once fermentation starts,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see this relationship if you look at fruit stands.\u201d This problem arises when the fruit is left out, unwashed, overripe and/or rotting in a trash, fridge or cabinet or on a countertop. Additionally, fruit flies gravitate toward sugar substances like soda, fruit juice and candy.",
      "Fermentation: Similarly, fruit flies are often attracted to the smell of fermented foods and drinks, such as beer, wine, kombucha, yogurt, cheese and bread. While you keep these items in the fridge, things like small spills or crumbs left on the counter can attract flies. Plus, when you throw these items out, they can still attract flies due to residual matter. This is why Bloom recommends regularly rinsing out containers, cans and bottles before throwing them out to prevent flies.",
      "Decaying matter and filth: Other types of filth flies, such as the house fly, may gravitate towards fruit, but they\u2019re also attracted to dirtier materials, according to Bloom.

      "Windows and weather: Lastly, leaving windows and doors open, even for a few seconds, gives flies the easiest entry into your home. That said, you may also notice an increase in flying insects like flies, fruit flies, mosquitoes and fungus gnats during late spring and throughout summer, according to Williams. \u201cFlies and fruit flies have more access to food sources in the warmer months, as they\u2019re attracted to rotting produce that is more abundant this time of year,\u201d he says. In other words, a more humid environment makes it easier for flies to survive and reproduce.",

      "To mark the first six months of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term in office, the White House shared a social media post promising three things will continue as his term proceeds: the \u201cwinning,\u201d the deportations and the memes.",
      "\u201cATTENTION: TRUMP DIDN\u2019T COME TO PLAY,\u201d reads the caption of the post, which was uploaded to Instagram and X on Sunday. It\u2019s coupled with an illustration of Trump in front of an American flag, a bald eagle, fireworks and dollar bills.",
      "The post is a window into how the White House has approached its overall social media strategy during Trump\u2019s second term. Previously, official White House social media accounts were used largely to promote presidents\u2019 policies.",
      "Since January, however, the Trump administration has shifted its tone on social media to cater to its MAGA base. Many posts \u2014 several of which play off of trending memes \u2014 appear to showcase aggression toward some longtime political targets for Trump, such as immigrants and Democrats.",
      "The memes have included: a cartoon depiction of a person who appears to be a migrant crying while being arrested, a fake dating app profile matching a \u201crecently arrested\u201d woman with ICE and a Valentine\u2019s Day card that read: \u201cRoses are red, violets are blue. Come here illegally and we\u2019ll deport you.\u201d",
      "Such posts have generated some shock online, which the White House itself appears to have referred to this month. In a post on X, the official account wrote: \u201cNowhere in the Constitution does it say we can\u2019t post banger memes.\u201d The image in the post is of a sign on the White House lawn that reads, \u201coMg, diD tHe wHiTE hOuSE reALLy PosT tHis?\u201d",
      "The official White House social media accounts, and those for government agencies, are different from Trump\u2019s or other officials\u2019 personal accounts. The official accounts are passed along to each new administration for their officials to use, and since the Obama administration, each account\u2019s content has been archived by the National Archives, in compliance with the Presidential Records Act.",
      "But several official White House posts highlight or pull language from Trump\u2019s personal account on his platform, Truth Social, where he frequently blasts his political opponents or shares images that appear to have been made with artificial intelligence tools. White House accounts have also shared AI-generated images of Trump as the pope, a \u201cStar Wars\u201d character and Superman.",
      "Joshua Tucker, a co-director of New York University's Center for Social Media and Politics, said such posts are designed to \u201cget people\u2019s attention.\u201d",
      "Social media has drastically changed since Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 when users would mainly see posts from accounts they followed. Now, many social media platforms use an individualized algorithm for each account that Tucker said \u201cprivileges things that pop and that go viral.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not quite in the world where it\u2019s just like, \u2018If I just tweet, all my followers are going to see what I tweet,\u2019\u201d Tucker said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018I need to come up with something that\u2019s going to be catchy.\u2019\u201d",
      "Among the potential cons of the strategy, Tucker said, is the White House\u2019s \u201cpushing back against norms of what is proprietary in terms of official statements.\u201d",
      "Asked about the administration\u2019s use of social media during Trump\u2019s second term, White House spokesperson Liz Huston said, \u201cEvery day, the White House digital accounts highlight President Trump\u2019s widely popular America First agenda and the tangible quality-of-life improvements he has delivered for Americans nationwide.\u201d",
      "Other official government accounts for various agencies have taken on similar tones.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s official account has promoted self-deportation through the CBP One app by posting a video set to the song \u201cTake Me Home, Country Roads.\u201d The song \u201cIce, Ice Baby\u201d is the soundtrack for another video pointing viewers to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement tip line.",
      "In June, DHS also posted what appeared to be an AI-made image of alligators with caps that read \u201cICE\u201d on them, writing in the post, \u201cComing soon!\u201d It came amid the opening of a controversial immigrant detention center in Florida, which state Republicans have informally dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz.\u201d",
      "Asked whether she is concerned about the content\u2019s being divisive or making light of issues the administration wants people to take seriously, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said: \u201cNot at all.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin said she sees the role of the DHS social media accounts as giving people \u201cthe truth\u201d and circumventing media outlets she deems hostile.",
      "\u201cEight years ago, under the first Trump administration, we didn\u2019t have the social media environment that we have today, and so I think that we were more beholden to what the media was saying, and we couldn\u2019t necessarily straighten out the facts,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cAnd now, you know, we have a presence that we\u2019re able to do that.\u201d",
      "Parker Butler, who ran the @KamalaHQ accounts as the director of digital rapid response for the Biden-turned-Harris 2024 presidential campaign, described what the White House is doing online as \u201ctrolling for the sake of trolling.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are just basically throwing toxic sludge out there and trying to gin up people\u2019s reactions,\u201d Butler said. \u201cAnd they call that a digital strategy.\u201d",
      "They are just basically throwing toxic sludge out there and trying to gin up people\u2019s reactions.",
      "Parker Butler, who ran the @KamalaHQ accounts for the Biden-turned-Harris 2024 presidential campaign",
      "It\u2019s a perspective that has been echoed by others who follow politics and have also noticed the shift.",
      "\u201cLike a runaway train, the Republican Party is barreling toward a future in which posting is politics \u2014 or, the purest function of politics,\u201d writer Nathan Taylor Pemberton argued in a recent op-ed for The New York Times titled \u201cTrolling Democracy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a grim, ugly and barren place.\u201d",
      "But the White House points to growth on multiple digital platforms as evidence its strategy is effective. A White House official said the administration\u2019s official social media accounts, including on Truth Social, have added over 16 million new followers across platforms since Inauguration Day.",
      "The administration also has engaged social media stars to try to generate a broader audience. In May, Trump gave comedian Theo Von \u2014 one of YouTube\u2019s most popular creators, particularly among young male conservatives \u2014 the role of warmup act at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, where Trump addressed U.S. service members.",
      "The White House\u2019s Instagram and X accounts have also taken a page out of the typical influencer\u2019s engagement playbook, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt uploading a weekly video segment called \u201cMAGA Minute.\u201d The videos post recaps \u2014 in 60 seconds \u2014 of things the president and the administration did that week that the White House wants to highlight.",
      "In May, Leavitt also held several separate \u201cinfluencer briefings.\u201d Of the 25 influencers identified by NBC News who attended the initial three briefings, all but one had histories of explicit support for Trump\u2019s administration, and some had direct connections to Trump.",
      "\u201cWe will ALWAYS find ways to meet people where they are,\u201d Kaelan Dorr, the White House deputy communications director, said in a statement at the time."

      "The secretary of state noted that all sponsors of the program \"must comply with all regulations, including conducting their programs in a manner that does not undermine the foreign policy objectives or compromise the national security interests of the United States.\"",
      "\"The American people have the right to expect their universities to uphold national security, comply with the law, and provide safe environments for all students,\" Rubio said. \"The investigation will ensure that State Department programs do not run contrary to our nation\u2019s interests.\"",

      "\"This investigation is yet another retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard\u2019s First Amendment right,\" the spokesperson said. \"Harvard continues to enroll and sponsor international scholars, researchers, and students, and will protect its international community and support them as they apply for U.S. visas and travel to campus this fall.\"",
      "The New York Times first reported the existence of the State Department\u2019s investigation.",
      "The investigation marks the Trump administration's latest attempt to block the nation's oldest \u2014 and arguably most elite \u2014 university from enrolling international students.",
      "In May, the Trump administration abruptly terminated Harvard\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification. The move was swiftly blocked by a federal judge.",
      "Days later, Trump issued a proclamation, titled \"Enhancing National Security by Addressing Risks at Harvard University,\" seeking to restrict foreign students from enrolling in the Ivy League school.",
      "The proclamation said that Trump would \"restrict the entry of foreign nationals who seek to enter the United States solely or principally to participate in a course of study at Harvard University or in an exchange visitor program hosted by Harvard University.\"",
      "It also noted that the secretary of state \"shall consider, in the Secretary\u2019s discretion, whether foreign nationals who currently attend Harvard University and are in the United States\" on F, M or J visas should have their visas revoked, as Rubio's announcement appears to suggest.",
      "\"This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard\u2019s First Amendment rights,\" the university said in a statement at the time.",
      "The ongoing battle over Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students comes amid larger tensions between the university and the Trump administration.",
      "In April, Harvard rejected a list of demands from the administration\u2019s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, which would change Harvard's admissions and hiring processes and subject the university's faculty to a government audit.",
      "Shortly afterward, the Trump administration said it was freezing more than $2 billion in federal research grants to the university, prompting Harvard to sue."

      "\"The Buccaneers\" \u2014 a historical fiction drama following a rambunctious group of American girls taking on London's high society in the 1870s \u2014 just introduced a dark twist.",
      "So far, Season 2 has stayed true to form in chronicling the dramatics of the core group, made up of Nan (Kristine Froseth), Jinny (Imogen Waterhouse), Conchita (Alisha Boe), Mabel (Josie Totah) and Lizzy (Aubri Ibrag).",
      "Mabel has been living with Conchita and her husband, Lord Richard Marable (Josh Dylan). Nan has been struggling to enjoy her marriage with Theo, the Duke of Tintagel (Guy Remmers), due to her lingering feelings for Guy Thwarte (Matthew Broome). And Lizzy has been conducting a secret affair with Theo amid her own engagement to Hector Robinson (Jacob Ifan).",
      "Meanwhile, Jinny, after escaping from her abusive husband, Lord James Seadown (Barney Fishwick), at the end of Season 1, has been hiding in Italy with her newborn son under Guy's protection.",
      "\"I think she feels really lonely and isolated,\" Waterhouse tells TODAY.com about her character's storyline this season. \"And even though she's with Guy, who's amazing, they kind of don't really know each other. They're, like, thrown into the situation, and suddenly there's a baby, and they're living in quite intense circumstances.\"",
      "Things only get more intense in Episode 6 after James tracks down his estranged wife and newborn son, Freddy, in Italy. He kidnaps the baby, forcing Jinny to go back to London where she's wanted for kidnapping Freddy after leaving James while pregnant. As the group plots to get Freddy back, James orchestrates a public confrontation with Jinny at an opera, where she appears violent and hysterical to onlookers, resulting in her being committed to an asylum.",
      "After a significant stay, she agrees to go back to James' estate in order to be reunited with Freddy, but she never gives up in her fight against James.",
      "\"I think she kind of allowed a lot of James' behavior when it was just her, because she was fighting for their marriage and all these other expectations that she had on her,\" Waterhouse says. \"But now she has a baby. I think that pushes her to realize that it's bigger than just her now, and she's got to protect her baby from him as well.\"",
      "In the end, James' siblings, Richard and Honoria (Mia Threapleton) come to Jinny's aid. They hatch a plan to distract their brother and smuggle Jinny and Freddy out of the home.",
      "While James and Richard talk downstairs, Honoria finds Freddy and escapes in a carriage with the infant. But once James realizes Freddy is gone, a fight ensues. Richard briefly knocks out James and runs upstairs to free Jinny from a locked room. But as they try to escape, they encounter James holding a gun.",
      "Richard, again, distracts James so Jinny can run away. After she flees, James points the gun at his head while Richard tries to talk him down, telling his younger brother they can fix things together.",
      "The scene then cuts to Jinny hiding behind a tree on the property as a gunshot goes off. As she rushes back to the home, she finds James catatonic over Richard's lifeless body.",
      "Why Does Lord Seadown Kill His Brother, Richard?",
      "In the lead up to Richard's shocking death, his family's dynamic is explored more in depth after his mother, Lady Brightlingsea (Fenella Woolgar), helps James pull off framing Jinny at the opera. But once Jinny is removed from the asylum and back at his estate, Lady Brightlingsea admits that her middle child may have taken the situation with Jinny too far. Speaking to Richard, the matriarch recalls how James was always a \"funny fish,\" struggling to socialize with other children but desperate to please his older brother. She suggests that James wanted to marry an American woman, Jinny, because Richard did.",
      "Richard uses this knowledge to distract James in his rescue of Jinny and Freddy.",
      "Fishwick says in an interview with TODAY.com that the murder was a \"vindictive\" act on James' part and compares his character's dynamic with Richard to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel.",
      "\"You don't necessarily see a lot of it in Season 1 or 2, but it's kind of interesting looking back and thinking that there's probably some kind of status dynamic going on between Richard, who's the charming, easygoing, firstborn son, and James, who doesn't inherit a title. I think he finds people a lot more difficult. There's this kind of brotherly tension,\" Fishwick explains.",
      "Dylan tells TODAY.com that while the death may come as a surprise to audiences, he understands it. \"I think it makes a lot of sense,\" he says.",
      "He says his character's death made his scenes with Boe's Conchita, whom he married at the very start of the show\u00a0\u2014 Season 1, Episode 1\u00a0\u2014\u00a0all the more special.",
      "\"We just tried to be really present with each other and have a lot of fun,\" Dylan says. \"Our relationship is in a really lovely place when that happens.\"",
      "Boe chimes in and adds, \"It makes it more heartbreaking and gut-wrenching.\"",
      "While Conchita was introduced in the series premiere as a free spirit, wild child American who clashes with her new husband's strict family, Boe says her character's grief will put her in survival mode.",
      "\"Now she\u2019s a single mother, and on top of that, she has to worry about taking care of her household because they are in financial distress,\" Boe says. \"I think the grief of losing her Dickie, it made her have to realign her priorities and ... she just had to really hunker down and be like, 'You know what? This is what I have to do to survive.'\""

    "summary": "25 years ago, writer Liz Calvario's family attended the Backstreet Boys Millennium concert. In a full circle moment, they went to the anniversary show and celebrated the loss of her mother.",
    "story": [
      "25 YEARS AGO, my family created a lifelong connection with the Backstreet Boys. It might sound...unique for not just two fangirls, but also their parents, to be devoted to a boyband. But for our foursome, BSB has been the soundtrack to a shared life of love...and unexpected loss.",
      "The connection reached a full-circle moment this year when the group announced on TODAY their \u201cInto the Millennium\u201d Sphere residency in Las Vegas. It was a celebration of the 25-year anniversary of their hit album \u2014 but for my family, it was a reminder of a time that changed everything for us.",
      "It all began when I was about eight years old and my sister Leslie and I walked into Lucky\u2019s grocery store. She ran straight to the magazine section; four years older than me, she had recently discovered the Backstreet Boys and wanted to show me her favorite member, Nick Carter.",
      "Grabbing one of the bright teen magazines, my eyes went instead to dark-haired, green-eyed Kevin Richardson. From there, while my mom grocery shopped, our ritual became standing in that aisle, flipping the pages to every Backstreet Boys photo we could find.",
      "Our infatuation only grew as the years went by. We consumed every bit of information about all five \u201cboys,\u201d belted their songs on the radio and religiously watched \u201cTotal Request Live\u201d with Carson Daly on MTV. (My cheeks turned hot as I watched the rain scene in \u201cQuit Playing Games With My Heart.\u201d)",
      "Knowing how much we loved them, my mom often gave in to purchasing the BSB merch we saw at the mall and stores. When we begged to call \u201cTRL\u201d countless times, she always indulged us. And when we were in the car yelling every single lyric to every single song? She was right there singing along with us.",
      "By 1999, BSB was embarking on their \u201cInto the Millennium Tour,\u201d to accompany their sophomore album, \u201cMillennium.\u201d Desperate to see them in concert, Leslie and I begged our parents to let us go. By this time, our bedroom was covered in floor-to-ceiling posters; while my dad huffed about our decor choices, my mom never seemed to mind, often buying us more magazines to help us add to our collection.",
      "Finally, my dad gave in after endless pestering: \u201cIf you can save up the money to buy your own ticket, you can go.\u201d",
      "For months, my sister and I put aside the money we got from our birthdays and report cards, and we did chores around the house. I pocketed any spare change we found, including the coins by my dad's wallet. (To me, it was fair game!) When it was time to purchase tickets, we proudly stood in front of my dad with our savings: A grand total of around $100.",
      "Back in those days, we had to go to a JCPenney Ticketmaster concierge to purchase tickets. So we headed to the mall, plopped down our money and asked for two tickets to the Backstreet Boys show in Anaheim, California, the closest venue to our San Diego county town of Ramona.",
      "But then our dad chimed in saying he wanted four tickets. Perplexed, my sister and I looked at each other and told him we didn\u2019t have enough for two more.",
      "He looked at us. \u201cYou proved that you can save money for something you really want, and you did,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a treat, I will pay for your tickets, and your mom and I will also go.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 15, 1999, I attended my first Backstreet Boys concert (and first-ever concert) at the then-Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim (now the Honda Center). Our seats were high up, but I remember my dad borrowing a friend's camcorder to record the entire show. Sitting next to us, he zoomed in on the stage as my sister and I fangirled. The moment the band opened the show and flew in on futuristic surfboards, we couldn't contain our screams.",
      "My mom, dad, sister and I belted out the songs we all knew from repeatedly playing their albums. And when \u201cThe Perfect Fan\u201d \u2014 the group's ode to a mother's love \u2014 came on, we dedicated it to my mom.",
      "I saved my ticket from that show, which I still have to this day. My sister and I would rewatch the recording of the concert with my mom on the VCR until it stopped working. As a Mexican household, we also loved the group's songs in Spanish, like \u201cNunca Te Hare Llorar,\u201d as well as \u201cAnywhere For You,\u201d or \u201cDonde Quieras Yo Ir\u00e9.\u201d And it was known that my dad\u2019s favorite song was \u201cI\u2019ll Never Break Your Heart.\u201d But every single birthday and Mother's Day, for my mom, we'd always play \u201cThe Perfect Fan.\u201d",
      "And then, on May 14, 2015, she died unexpectedly in a car crash.",
      "The last day my sister and I saw our mom was on Mother\u2019s Day. We had played \u201cThe Perfect Fan\u201d for her that morning. Yet somehow, inexplicably, four days later we were grieving her.",
      "The Backstreet Boys' song \u201cShow Me the Meaning of Being Lonely,\u201d suddenly took on a new significance for me and my sister. The song is about losing someone close to you; at the time it was released, Kevin Richardson was mourning the death of his father, while Howie Dorough had a sister who had also passed. Additionally, the music video was dedicated to their late producer, Denniz Pop.",
      "Still, I never imagined I'd one day listen to the song while mourning myself.",
      "Fast forward to this summer, which marked 25 years since that first \u201cMillennium\u201d concert \u2014 and 10 years after my mom died. My sister, Dad and I decided we had to attend the anniversary show in Las Vegas; it would be a way to relive an important memory while also commemorating my mom. Plus, one thing my sister and I have learned is that time is sacred \u2014 and we won't always have our dad around to make memories with.",
      "A day before the July 11 opening night concert in Las Vegas, an ache settled in my chest as I thought about my mom not being able to experience this moment with us. I know she would have been so excited to dress up, and to sing every song while spending time with us. I can even picture her once again wearing the Backstreet Boys scarf we bought at the first concert around her ponytail like she once did, much to my delight.",
      "Ahead of their anniversary shows this summer, the Backstreet Boys asked their attendees to wear white. I didn't know if my dad would abide by the suggested dress code \u2014 but to my surprise, when we met up for the show, there he was in a white button-up and steel blue pants.",
      "The group opened the show with their hit \u201cLarger Than Life,\u201d a song my dad instantly knew. We laughed as he jammed out while recording the entire thing on his phone.",
      "As the show continued, we were all hyped up and tuned in to the graphics and visuals. But when photos appeared on the screen of the Backstreet Boys with their mothers, wives and kids, we knew what song was coming: \u201cThe Perfect Fan.\u201d",
      "As the piano played, Kevin took the mic for the first verse. But then, eyes closed, he lifted the mic to his mouth \u2014 then shook his head, unable to sing. We assumed he was overcome with grief and sadness as he remembered his own late mother Ann, who died in 2022.",
      "Tears rolled down my face. I looked over at my sister, and she was also crying. My dad's face was somber; even though my parents weren't in the best place when my mom died, I knew he must have been hurting, too. I even swore I could see him mouthing some of the lyrics.",
      "After that track, all I wanted was to embrace the three of us being together, feeling the power of this shared experience. I captured video of my dad recording \u201cEverybody\u201d and \u201cI Want It That Way\u201d as he proudly sang along to the chorus.",
      "Being the mega BSB fans that we are, my sister and I attended the show for a second time the following weekend.",
      "Once again, when \u201cThe Perfect Fan\u201d came on, my sister became emotional. This time, I put my arm around her. And just like Kevin now found himself able to sing the intro of the song without tearing up, I also managed to keep it together. I thought about how happy my mom would be that we still think of her \u2014 and the memories we shared at our first concert \u2014 whenever that song plays.",
      "And when we sent a selfie to my dad from the concert, he replied in Spanish, \u201cWhat are you doing there without me?\u201d",
      "Looks like we might have to make this a new family tradition."

    "summary": "The Trisha Paytas Baby Curse theory is the idea that celebrities who die are reincarnated as the YouTuber's babies. Ozzy Osbourne is the latest in the theory.",
    "story": [
      "The death of rock icon Ozzy Osbourne and the birth of YouTuber Trisha Paytas\u2019s baby is combining to ressucitate an old and deeply weird conspiracy theory: the Trisha Paytas Baby Curse.",
      "According to legend, a celebrity death accompanies the birth of each of Paytas\u2019s three babies. Even though it doesn\u2019t add up \u2014 in a lot of ways \u2014 the theory persists, and memes abound suggesting that the recently departed musician will be reincarnated as the child of the podcaster who gained fame through viral YouTube videos.",
      "(For the record, TODAY.com does not endorse this theory, which is clearly meant to be tongue-in-cheek.)",
      "What? How? Why?",
      "The theory is part of an internet meme known as the \u201cTrisha Paytas Baby Curse,\u201d which links her pregnancies to the deaths, or illness, of public figures. While entirely speculative, the joke popped up when Pope Francis died while she was pregnant with her third child, who she named Aquaman.",
      "(You read that right, Aquaman. Her two older children are Malibu Barbie and Elvis.)",
      "During the April 22 episode of her podcast, \u201cJust Trish,\u201c Paytas addressed the speculation.",
      "\u201cIs it just like any influential person that dies gets to come reincarnate as my baby?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why my womb is carrying all these souls.\u201d",
      "Paytas birthed baby Aquaman on July 12, and announced his name on July 22, the same day Osbourne died.",
      "Fans were quick to note the coincidence.",
      "The internet\u2019s tongue-in-cheek conspiracy is part of a longer-running meme tied to the YouTuber\u2019s pregnancies.",
      "Who Is Trisha Paytas, and Why Is She Famous?",
      "Paytas is a YouTuber, podcaster, and media personality. She has been married to photographer Moses Hacmon since 2021.",
      "She had a cameo on Saturday Night Live in December 2024, and made her Broadway debut in February of 2025 \u2014 and event that started out as a joke, but then became reality.",
      "The Trisha Paytas Baby Curse, Explained",
      "The Trisha Paytas baby curse theory first took hold on Sept. 7, 2022. At the time, Paytas was pregnant with her first child and announced on X that she was 1 centimeter dilated. The update coincided with news of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s declining health and the monarch\u2019s death one day later on Sept. 8, 2022.",
      "\u201cAnd Trisha Paytas is 1 cm dilated\u2026 the prophecy is being fulfilled,\u201d one person wrote of the timing.",
      "When Malibu Barbie was born one week later, fans latched onto the coincidence and sparked theories that Paytas\u2019s newborn daughter was the reincarnation of the British queen.",
      "Not long after Paytas announced that she was expecting her second child, King Charles III publicly revealed his cancer diagnosis. Fans quickly began to suggest that the monarch\u2019s fate might be entangled with Paytas\u2019 pregnancy.",
      "Since his announcement in 2024, Charles has continued to undergo medical treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer. While the king is very much alive, and not reincarnated in the form of Paytas\u2019 child, the conspiracy theory continued to grow.",
      "The beloved pope died on April 21, 2025, and fans quickly connected his fate to Paytas\u2019 pregnancy. While addressing the conspiracy theory that her third child will be Pope Francis reincarnated during her April 22 podcast, Paytas leaned into the meme and joked about the possibility of naming her baby Pope or Francis.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s a boy, I guess we\u2019re naming it Pope. It\u2019s not a bad name,\u201d she commented. \u201cTechnically, there (are) girls named Frances too. So we could have a girl Frances; yeah, my dad is, my dad\u2019s name is Francis.\u201d",
      "When the revered heavy metal musician died at age 76, fans were quick to connect the dots.",
      "The meme may be coming to a natural end, however, as Paytas has publicly declared she does not intend to have more children.",
      "\u201cI feel so good about the decision,\u201d Paytas said on her podcast."

      "A cause of death for actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner has been determined.",
      "The former \"Cosby Show\" star died July 20 at age 54 as a result of drowning off the coast of Costa Rica, according to a July 21 statement released by Costa Rica\u2019s Judicial Investigation Agency (OIJ) that was translated from Spanish to English.",
      "The report stated that OIJ agents \"carried out the removal of the body of a male who died as a result of asphyxia by submersion.\"",
      "According to the report, Warner went swimming between 2 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. local time at Playa Cocles in Costa Rica's Limon province when he was reportedly \"dragged by a current offshore.\"",
      "Other beachgoers were able to rescue Warner and bring him back to shore. However, when members of the Costa Rican Red Cross arrived, they found the actor  \"without vital signs.\"",
      "Warner's body was sent to the Judicial Morgue in San Joaquin de Flores for an autopsy.",
      "A representative for the OIJ confirmed Warner\u2019s death to NBC News on July 21.",
      "The Costa Rican Red Cross also put out a statement regarding Warner's cause of death, which NBC News has translated from Spanish to English.",

      "Drowning is one of the most common causes of asphyxiation, according to Cleveland Clinic. Most of the time, water enters the lungs, leading to death. In other cases, the vocal cords stop working when the person first breathes in water.",
      "Other common causes of asphyxia include allergic reactions, asthma, opioids, strangulation and a foreign object blocking the airway.",

      "SREBRENICA, Bosnia \u2014 Nedzad Avdic stood on a gravel plateau with four men and boys with their hands tied behind their backs, preparing for death. Just 17, Avdic had been captured by Bosnian Serb forces days earlier. Now, he stood yards from an execution squad.",
      "Avdic said he heard shots, felt sharp pain in his right side and right arm and blacked out. When he woke up, more prisoners were being lined up for execution. When the small truck that brought him to the site drove away, Avdic and another wounded man escaped in the darkness. After walking through the woods for days, they crossed into Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "Last week, Avdic recounted his experience to members of the German parliament at an event in Berlin marking the 30th anniversary of the fall of the United Nations-protected \u201csafe area\u201d of Srebrenica. Two international courts have ruled that Bosnian Serbs\u2019 systematic killing of male Bosnian Muslim prisoners \u2014 at least 7,000 in total \u2014 was the first genocide in Europe since World War II.",
      "The following day, members of the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD party, argued in parliament that the mass killings did not constitute genocide. \u201cThe Serbs shot men there, but generally spared women and children,\u201d Alexander Wolf said in a speech.",
      "A second AfD member, Martin Sichert, invoked a conspiracy theory, warning that Muslims were waging a \u201cbirth jihad\u201d in Germany, a reference to Muslim immigrants someday outnumbering Germans. \u201cSrebrenica reminds us to end multiculturalism before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Sichert warned.",
      "As disinformation spreads online, denialism about war crimes \u2014 both past and ongoing \u2014 is growing increasingly common worldwide, experts warn. From current conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and Gaza to past atrocities in Syria, Bosnia and Rwanda, as well as the Holocaust, basic facts are now disputed or dismissed.",
      "Denialism is proving politically profitable, as well. In February, the AfD won the second-most seats in Germany\u2019s parliament, the best showing by a far-right party since World War II. In Bosnia, a local Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, has gained support by spreading conspiracy theories about Srebrenica, calling it \u201can arranged tragedy.\u201d He dismisses the identification of 6,981 victims \u2014 part of the largest DNA identification project in history\u2014 as a hoax.",
      "Dodik's office did not respond to a request for comment. After this article was published, Sichert said in an email that he believes it's critical to investigate the causes of massacres \"because this way the death of the people at least has a little meaning.\"",
      "He went on to ask why is Srebenica recognized as a genocide but not Hiroshima. \"Because victors write history,\" Sichert said. \"Every civilian casualty should be considered equally no matter who won the war.\"",
      "Wolf, in a separate email, said that \"commemoration should not be one-sided\" and cited the killings of Serbs in the village of Kravica by Bosnian Muslim forces from Srebrenica during the war.",
      "But war crimes prosecutors and journalists found that of forty-five Serbs who died in Kravica, thirty-five were soldiers, including five who were killed after being taken prisoner. The number of Bosnian Muslims killed by Serb forces after being taken prisoner is in the thousands.",
      "Growing Denialism",
      "At a conference in Srebrenica marking the 30th anniversary of the mass killings here, the heads of the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda and the Auschwitz-Birkenau and Stutthof concentration camp museums in Poland warned that spreading lies online about war crimes has also become financially profitable.",
      "War crimes denialism generates so much traffic online that making money \u2014 not political or ideological gain \u2014 appears to motivate some of its purveyors.",
      "At one point, the directors discussed whether better influencers might help, and several of them agreed that they could.",
      "Avdic is determined to be one of them. As denialism spreads, he is more determined than ever to use what is left of his life to speak for the men and boys who died beside him on that gravel 30 years ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more aggressive day by day,\u201d he said, referring to denialism. \u201cYou have to know that we are all foreign bodies on this Earth, and we will all evaporate naturally sooner or later.\u201d",
      "A U.N.-protected \u2018safe area\u2019",
      "I first met Avdic 30 years ago covering the war in Bosnia as a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor. After the fall of Srebrenica, rumors spread that Bosnian Muslim men were describing mass executions. Avdic, then a shell-shocked teenager whose father was later found in a mass grave, was one of nine men who told me they had survived mass executions. When I later visited the gravel plateau beside an earthen dam in the village of Petkovci, I found two human femurs.",
      "Avdic and his father were among the roughly 10,000 Bosnian Muslim men who fled Srebrenica on foot when Bosnian Serb forces attacked in July 1995. The surrounded town had been declared an internationally protected \u201csafe area,\u201d but the United States, Europe and 600 Dutch U.N. peacekeepers did little to protect it",
      "Women, children and elderly men took refuge at a large battery factory that Dutch peacekeepers had turned into their main base. And men, most of them unarmed, set off through the woods on a 60-mile trek to Muslim-controlled central Bosnia.",
      "When Serb forces attacked the column, Avdic and his father were separated in the chaos. \u201cI lost him,\u201d Avdic recalled. \u201cI lost him immediately.\u201d He continued walking with strangers but was eventually captured. Two days later, he and other men were taken to the gravel plateau, and the executions began.",
      "Needing to speak",
      "For the next 12 years, Avdic testified at war crimes trials about the executions under a pseudonym and lived far from Srebrenica, fearing for his safety. In 2007, he returned to Srebrenica, his hometown. He and other Bosnian Muslims felt a duty to return to the area and preserve its Muslim community. Avdic, who had grown up in a village outside the town and also lost four uncles and three cousins in the killings, found being in Srebrenica comforting.",
      "\u201cI have less nightmares,\u201d he said, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cI cannot explain it.\u201d",
      "In 2014, when he visited the execution site during an event with mothers of the victims, he was filled with a desire to speak publicly about the mass killing he survived.",
      "\u201cWhen I came to the place, something forced me to say something; I felt a strong need to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cWords started to flow, something stronger than me.\u201d",
      "He met his wife, Elvisa, a Bosnian Muslim survivor whose uncle and cousin also died in the executions, in Srebrenica in 2008. The following year, they married. Now, Nedzad works as a manager at a company in Srebrenica that produces parts for luxury car interiors. Elvisa works at a local meteorological station. They have three daughters who attend local school alongside Serb children. Serbs and Muslims coexist but generally don\u2019t discuss the war.",
      "\u201cHatred destroys, first of all, those who hate,\u201d Avdic said.",
      "In recent years, Avdic has given dozens of speeches about the massacres in multiple countries and called for the protection of civilians in Ukraine and Syria. Speaking about Srebrenica is difficult but cathartic. \u201cIt was my choice to go to Berlin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not something that I wish. It is emotional, and it is difficult for me.\u201d",
      "Local Bosnian Muslims have transformed the cavernous former car battery factory that Dutch U.N. peacekeepers used as a base into a museum documenting the genocide. Across the street, the headstones of the thousands of Muslim men and boys killed in the massacres cover a lush green field and hillside.",
      "In recent years, though, Muslims have slowly left Srebrenica, many of them citing economic and safety concerns. Once a majority-Muslim town, Srebrenica is now roughly half-Serb, half-Muslim.",
      "Elvisa, Avdic\u2019s wife, said she worries about her children\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cI was 13 years old then in 1995. My daughter is now 13 years old,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m more emotional about that time. When we are older, we care more and we feel more.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur grandmother was killed,\u201d she added. \u201cThey cut her throat.\u201d",
      "Defiance and threats",
      "Avdic said provocations still happen, including when a local priest once played Serb nationalist songs to taunt Muslim residents.",
      "\u201cHe will die with his evil,\u201d Avdic said of the priest.",
      "As denialism spreads, Serb nationalists have grown more defiant. In nearby towns, Avdic is sometimes recognized and mocked by them.",

      "Avdic and his wife are torn. Leaving Srebrenica might be better for their children, but Avdic believes it is his duty to raise his family here and speak for the men and boys who died beside him.",
      "\u201cI will die proud,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I believe my children will be proud they were born here.\u201d"

    "summary": "A judgment by the U.K.\u2019s Supreme Court that said the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is based on biological sex came a blow to campaigners for trans rights.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Soccer fans know it as \u201challowed ground,\u201d so when Billie Sky Walker walked onto the field at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium two years ago, she achieved a dream held by players around the world.",
      "Before a Community Shield men\u2019s match between Manchester City and Arsenal in August 2023, she proudly donned an official shirt as a representative of the Football Association, the regulatory body for soccer in England, that read, \u201cThe FA is for all.\u201d",
      "Today, the 28-year-old is barred from playing in FA-organized tournaments following a landmark judgment by Britain\u2019s Supreme Court in April that said the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is based on biological sex \u2014 a huge blow to campaigners for transgender rights that could have far-reaching implications for a wide range of life in the U.K., be it admission to changing rooms or decisions on hospital beds, equal pay claims and domestic violence shelters.",
      "After the judgment, a number of sporting governing bodies, including the FA, changed their rules so that only those born biologically female are allowed to play, excluding Walker and 28 other transgender players across England from the association. The Scottish Football Association followed suit, and Northern Ireland\u2019s Irish Football Association appears likely to do the same.",
      "Describing the ruling as \u201cconfusing and upsetting,\u201d Walker said she had been welcomed \u201cinto this space\u201d by her cisgender peers, or women whose gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth.",
      "Calling the decision to bar Walker \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d her former teammate Lucy Leiter, 24, said it was not the case that \u201conly trans women think they should play,\u201d adding, \u201cThe support has been unequivocal from everyone I\u2019ve ever played with.\u201d",
      "Walker, who said she felt that she was a girl from the age of 5 and transitioned at the age of 24, said that playing soccer on a women\u2019s team \u201creally established a huge essence of who I am, because it gave me the safety and comfort and knowledge that I\u2019m enough.\u201d",
      "Intense debate",
      "The Supreme Court ruling came amid intense and sometimes toxic public debate in the U.K. over the intersection of transgender and women\u2019s rights. The debate has also simmered in the U.S., where President Donald Trump has made it one of his signature issues by signing an executive order in February banning trans women from women\u2019s sports at the national level.",
      "In December 2022, Scottish lawmakers approved a bill that allowed anyone over the age of 16 to change their gender identity using gender certificates, removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the medical term for the distress that results from the conflict between someone\u2019s gender identity and sex assigned at birth.",
      "The campaign group For Women Scotland later brought a legal case against the semiautonomous government, arguing that sex-based protections should apply only to people who were born female.",
      "And Britain\u2019s central government blocked the law the following year, invoking for the first time a section of the 25-year-old act that gave the Scottish Parliament control over most of its own affairs.",
      "The For Women Scotland case nonetheless worked its way through the court system, reaching the Supreme Court this spring.",
      "After the court\u2019s 12 justices ruled unanimously in the group\u2019s favor, the presiding judge, Lord Hodge, said the decision should not be seen as \u201ca triumph of one side over the other,\u201d and emphasized that transgender people remain protected under the law.",
      "For Women Scotland campaigners celebrated the verdict with hugs, tears of happiness and Champagne as they left the courtroom.",
      "\u201cThere was elation and disbelief and, yes, I was absolutely thrilled,\u201d Susan Smith, one of the group\u2019s co-founders, told NBC News in a telephone interview last month. \u201cIf people were entitled to say that their sex in law had changed, you can\u2019t control who applies for that.\u201d",
      "For Smith and her group, the issue of legal gender recognition touches on who gets to make decisions about women\u2019s lives and bodies, including their access to spaces from hospital wards to rape crisis centers and prisons."

      "Expectations were low for the summit in the Chinese capital marking 50 years of diplomatic ties after weeks of escalating tension and wrangling over its format, with the duration abruptly halved to a single day at Beijing\u2019s request.",
      "\u201cThe current challenges facing Europe do not come from China,\u201d Xi told visiting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa, state news agency Xinhua said.",
      "He urged the E.U. to \u201cadhere to open cooperation and properly handle differences and frictions,\u201d after von der Leyen earlier called for a rebalancing of trade ties with the world\u2019s second-largest economy, saying relations were at an \u201cinflection point.\u201d",
      "\u201cImproving competitiveness cannot rely on \u2018building walls and fortresses,\u2019\u201d Xi added, according to Xinhua. \u201c\u2018Decoupling and breaking chains\u2019 will only result in isolation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is hoped that the European side will keep the trade and investment market open and refrain from using restrictive economic and trade tools,\u201d Xi said.",

      "\u201cWe have reached an inflection point,\u201d she added, urging China to \u201ccome forward with real solutions.\u201d",
      "She was referring to the E.U.\u2019s trade deficit with China, which ballooned to a historic 305.8 billion euros ($360 billion) last year.",
      "E.U. trade actions in the past year have targeted Chinese exports of EVs among other goods, and its officials have repeatedly complained about Chinese industrial overcapacity.",
      "In a further veiled criticism of Brussels\u2019s recent hawkish stance on China, Xi also warned E.U. leaders to \u201cmake correct strategic choices.\u201d",
      "The two E.U. officials were set to meet Chinese Premier Li Qiang later. Both sides hope to reach a modest joint statement on climate, now one of the rare bright spots in their cooperation.",
      "At the start of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, both sides had more of a consensus in working together to tackle trade challenges from the United States, said Cui Hongjian, a foreign policy professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University.",
      "\u201cRecently the situation has changed,\u201d Cui said. \u201cThe E.U. has continued to compromise with the United States, which means that there is currently a lack of impetus for E.U.-China ties to become closer.\u201d",
      "The run-up to the summit saw tit-for-tat trade disputes and hawkish European rhetoric, such as a July 8 accusation by von der Leyen that China was flooding global markets as a result of its overcapacity and \u201cenabling Russia\u2019s war economy.\u201d",
      "In a post on X on Thursday, however, von der Leyen struck a more conciliatory tone, describing the summit as an opportunity to \u201cboth advance and rebalance our relationship.\u201d",
      "Topics the Europeans are expected to raise in the talks are electric vehicles and China\u2019s rare earth export controls that disrupted supply chains worldwide, causing temporary stoppages in European automotive production lines in May.",
      "But China\u2019s exports of rare earth magnets to the E.U. surged in June by 245% from May, to stand at 1,364 metric tons (1,503 short tons), though that was still 35% lower than the year-earlier figure, customs data showed.",
      "The E.U. is likely to seal a trade deal with the United States for a broad tariff of 15% on its exports after intense negotiations, avoiding a harsher 30% figure threatened by Trump."

      "The deadly strike July 17 drew international condemnation, including from the Vatican, with Pope Leo XIV calling for an end to the \u201cbarbarity of war.\"",
      "President Donald Trump also spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the wake of the mortar strike, with his administration calling for an investigation.",
      "\"Everyone is appalled,\" White House spokesperson Tammy Bruce said at the time.",
      "Netanyahu's office subsequently expressed regret over the strike, while the Israeli military said it would conduct an investigation.",
      "On Wednesday, it announced that the southern command had completed its inquiry the day before, determining that troops had struck the church \"due to an unintentional deviation of munitions,\" in line with its preliminary statement that the strike was accidental.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces acknowledged that the impact of the strike \"caused damage to the structure\" of the church and \"injured several Gazan civilians.\" It did not acknowledge that three people were killed in the incident, according to church officials. Asked to comment on why the fatalities were not mentioned, the IDF acknowledged it was aware of the deaths.",

      "The IDF said adjustments had been made to \u201cimprove the accuracy of fire\u201d during the operation in which the church was struck \u2014 and that following the incident, \u201cguidelines for opening fire near religious buildings, shelters, and other sensitive sites were further clarified.\u201d Asked for further information on what adjustments had been made and how guidelines were further clarified, an IDF spokesperson would not elaborate beyond the initial statement.",
      "Throughout the war in Gaza, civilians have frequently been killed in strikes impacting civilian buildings and shelters, including religious sites.",
      "Last week's incident was also not the first time Holy Family Church has come under attack. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem accused Israeli forces of fatally shooting a woman and her daughter as they walked inside its grounds in December 2023.",
      "Francis condemned the attack at the time. Israeli officials denied responsibility.",
      "The IDF sought to emphasize Wednesday that it had facilitated the transfer of aid to Holy Family Church, in addition to coordinating the visit of a delegation on behalf of the Greek and Latin patriarchs, who were accompanied by a group of Christian clergy. Pizzaballa was among those to make the rare and dangerous trip, with Israel having sealed off the enclave to visits from foreign officials.",
      "The IDF's completion of its probe and the release of its findings were markedly swift, with the military still to release the results of a growing number of investigations since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Israel launched its assault following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 59,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in the enclave, while much of the territory has been destroyed."

Picked 20th overall in the 2023 draft, Nimmala is the first first-generation Indian American to be selected in the first round.",
      "Nimmala, who grew up outside Tampa, Florida, said his father introduced him to cricket at a young age but also taught him baseball. He fell in love with the sport and played competitively all the way through high school until the Blue Jays selected him at just 17 years old.",

      "Asked how big baseball can be in India, a country with 1.46 billion people, Marinak said MLB has high goals.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a billion fans that are watching cricket, it creates a real opportunity to grow the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can get baseball to the scale of cricket, it would be a huge penetration into that market. It would look a lot like what you see in Japan [and the] United States. It can be done.\u201d",
      "Nimmala says the goal remains to make the major leagues, though that could take multiple years because of his age and experience. His 17 home runs last year led all players ages 18 or younger, and after some early-season struggles, he turned up his production in the second half.",
      "From June 27 on, Nimmala hit .265/.331/.564 with 13 homers over his final 53 games.",
      "Known as a solid fielder, he has elite arm strength, according to MLB.com.",

The move already fueled the first major demonstrations since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, and it drew alarm from European officials and experts.",

      "It prompted howls of outrage and dismay, from not just Ukrainians themselves, but also Western officials and experts alarmed that the country could be backsliding on its endemic graft problem. It came a week after the arrest of a prominent anti-corruption campaigner who had embarrassed senior officials with investigations into their affairs.",
      "All of it overshadowed a third round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine that began Wednesday in Istanbul.",
      "Though both sides remain pessimistic about serious progress, they are the first discussions since President Donald Trump gave Russian President Vladimir Putin a 50-day ultimatum to agree to a truce or face new tariffs. Most observers expect another prisoner exchange but little else.",
      "Many Ukrainians are also worried that the country\u2019s opponents will weaponize Zelenskyy\u2019s move as evidence of the corruption that they say makes supporting Kyiv untenable.",

      "That rate is lower than the 24% that Trump threatened Japan with on April 2 and the 25% he said he would hit Japanese imports with in a letter on July 7. Before Trump\u2019s current term, the effective U.S. tariff rate on Japanese imports was less than 2%, according to World Bank data.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the agreement, saying the 15% rate was the lowest so far among countries that sell more goods to the United States than they buy from it.",
      "\u201cWe have exerted all our efforts to protect our national interests,\u201d he told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday. \u201cAmong the countries that have a trade surplus with the United States, we have achieved the greatest results.\u201d",

      "As part of the agreement, Trump said Japan would \u201cinvest, at my direction, $550 Billion Dollars into the United States, which will receive 90% of the Profits.\u201d It was unclear how such an investment would work.",

      "A podcast popular among young men shocked the internet this week with an unexpected interview guest: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "But Netanyahu\u2019s bid to appeal to young people appeared to backfire online, where the interview drew widespread criticism from viewers across the political spectrum.",
      "His interviewers, Kyle Forgeard and Aaron \u201cSteiny\u201d Steinberg, are members of the Nelk Boys, a group of social media influencers known for their vlogs and prank videos. The group, which has amassed more than 8.5 million subscribers on YouTube, attracted even more fans after its content began to highlight more conservative political figures, including President Donald Trump, whom the podcast interviewed in 2022, 2023 and 2024.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s hourlong interview, which dropped on the Nelk Boys\u2019 \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d on Monday, was met with overwhelmingly critical reception online, with viewers accusing the podcasters of asking softball questions and neglecting to push back against Netanyahu\u2019s claims.",
      "Netanyahu and his government continue to face worldwide outrage over the war in Gaza that followed the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The podcast\u2019s YouTube channel lost more than 10,000 subscribers within a day, according to the social media tracking platform Social Blade. On YouTube, top comments on the episode were critical of the hosts\u2019 apparent lack of preparedness.",
      "\u201cI see so much stuff about what\u2019s going on in Israel and Iran and Palestine, and to be honest, I just really don\u2019t know what is going on there,\u201d Forgeard said in the episode. Steinberg said he was similarly hoping to \u201cget educated\u201d by interviewing Netanyahu.",
      "At one point, the topic of discussion turned to Netanyahu\u2019s and Trump\u2019s shared affection for hamburgers. Asked about his go-to McDonald\u2019s order, Netanyahu revealed that he prefers Burger King, leading Steinberg to respond, appalled: \u201cThat\u2019s your worst take, I think.\u201d",
      "Throughout the rest of the interview, Netanyahu condemned anti-Israel protesters as \u201cun-American\u201d and contrasted life in Israel with life under the oppressive regime in Iran. He also railed against New York\u2019s Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, calling his proposals for the city \u201cnonsense.\u201d (Mamdani has called Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza \u201cgenocide\u201d and has said he would arrest Netanyahu, who is the subject of a warrant for his arrest from the International Criminal Court, if he visited New York City.)",
      "Asked why he\u2019s \u201cso hated worldwide,\u201d Netanyahu answered: \u201cWell, a lot of propaganda. First of all, I\u2019m not hated worldwide.\u201d He said Israel has received a lot of goodwill from many in Europe, claiming that Israel\u2019s attack on Iran also \u201cliberated them, because those Iranian missiles were geared at Europe, too, and ultimately at America.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe propaganda is there, I don\u2019t deny it,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cBut people also have, you know, sometimes the truth beckons. And what Israel did with President Trump is safeguard free societies from a menace. I mean, this Iranian regime hangs gays from cranes.\u201d",
      "On Monday, 25 countries, including Britain, Japan and many European nations, called on Israel to end the war in Gaza \u2014 a sign of Israel\u2019s traditional allies\u2019 dismay over the conflict\u2019s humanitarian toll. Close to 60,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities, with much of the enclave\u2019s population driven from their homes and pushed to the edge of starvation.",
      "The Israeli military and government officials have repeatedly accused Hamas of exploiting civilian sites, including hospitals and schools, as cover for its operations, an accusation that health officials and Hamas have denied.",
      "Israel has also faced mounting accusations of war crimes and genocide, including in a case brought by South Africa before the International Court of Justice, the United Nations\u2019 top court. The court last year ordered Israel to do everything it could to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza. Both Israel and the United States have rejected accusations of genocide.",
      "Online, clips of Netanyahu\u2019s interview drew viral backlash from viewers, many of whom accused the Nelk Boys of platforming \u201cgenocide propaganda\u201d and compared interviewing Netanyahu to interviewing Adolf Hitler.",
      "Far-left political streamer Hasan Piker and far-right white supremacist Nick Fuentes were among those who criticized the latest \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d episode Monday during separate livestreams on their platforms.",
      "\u201cYou just basically presented someone who is a war criminal, someone who is doing a genocide, in a somewhat neutral light,\u201d Piker told Forgeard and Steinberg in his stream. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t be neutral when you have someone like Benjamin Netanyahu directly in an opportunity to talk to him. But that\u2019s what happened, so there is moral culpability here for you guys individually.\u201d",
      "He added that while he would agree to interview Netanyahu if he were given the opportunity, he would be \u201cwell-equipped\u201d to fact-check his statements and push back against potentially dubious claims.",
      "Forgeard, in response, countered that their style of interviewing could \"give us the opportunity to get the biggest people in the world.\"",
      "\"And I think you\u2019ll know by the 'Full Send Podcast' when you watch it, it\u2019s like, 'Hey, these guys are going to get big guests. We might not necessarily get these guys grilling these people,'\" Forgeard said. \"And that\u2019s just what you\u2019re going to come to expect.\"",
      "Fuentes, in his own stream with Forgeard and Steinberg, also questioned the moral equivalency between himself, who has faced condemnation online for his views and beliefs, and \u201ca foreign head of state who is killing women and children.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is somebody who\u2019s in the process of committing what is effectively an ethnic cleansing and a genocide,\u201d Fuentes said.",
      "The interview struggled to land positively even among some supporters of Netanyahu\u2019s military agenda. In The Times of Israel on Tuesday, contributor Elkana Bar Eitan expressed his disappointment that Netanyahu \u201cblew it\u201d on the podcast, despite the lack of pushback he got from the hosts.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to witness how Netanyahu, once a master communicator, missed this opportunity and showed that he\u2019s lost his touch, even in English,\u201d he wrote in an opinion piece. \u201cDespite the friendly atmosphere and softball questions, Netanyahu came across as completely detached from reality.\u201d",
      "A representative for the \u201cFull Send Podcast\u201d declined to comment.",
      "In a video responding to the backlash, Steinberg and Forgeard said they plan to \u201cgive the other side the opportunity\u201d to speak on their next episode, though it\u2019s unclear what guest they\u2019re referring to.",
      "\u201cSomeone has to do it,\u201d Forgeard said. \u201cAnd if we have to take the fall and be the bad guys for having the controversial people on, I think we\u2019re willing to do it.\u201d"

      "Despite all his years of experience and technical training, the doctor\u2019s voice trembled when he recalled how organized crime groups have taken control of emergency rooms and medical facilities in some parts of Mexico.",
      "\u201cThey force us to come in through threatening phone calls, in the early hours of the morning, and they tell us: \u2018We\u2019re just a few meters from where you live, and you\u2019re with your family. If you don\u2019t treat this person, we\u2019re going to pick you up right here,\u2019\u201d said the doctor, who works at a health center in Guanajuato, in central Mexico, and who requested complete anonymity for fear of reprisal.",
      "In many regions of Mexico, organized crime attacks have affected hospitals, even taking over operating rooms and emergency rooms, where hitmen kidnap medical personnel to force them to treat the wounded in the frequent clashes they wage with other cartels.",
      "The doctor interviewed by Noticias Telemundo in Guanajuato claimed that, on one occasion, he was contacted in the early hours by a high-ranking local drug operative, who made an unusual request.",
      "\u201cI received a call requesting treatment for a person who had been shot by a firearm. And they arrived at the main entrances of the hospitals with long guns, demanding treatment for their patient,\u201d the doctor said. On several occasions, the doctor said, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel forced him to use his equipment to treat hitmen.",
      "Noticias Telemundo confirmed that both the local boss and the hitman whose life was saved later died in a confrontation with the Mexican army. For the safety of the doctor interviewed in Guanajuato, their names are being withheld.",
      "According to the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board, cartels and criminal groups continue to contribute to the high levels of violence in Mexico.",
      "\u201cOrganized crime continues to be a key player in the lives of Mexicans. This is evident because some criminal groups have managed to force the Mexican state to lose control of certain territories, and because of the corruption and impunity that allow them to continue to reign and expand their capabilities,\u201d Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, co-director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University, said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo.",
      "So far, official data shows that from September 2024 to April 2025, there was a 32.9% decrease in the daily average of intentional homicide victims, falling from 86.9 victims per day to 58.3.",
      "However, disappearances increased significantly: In the first 100 days of Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s administration, 4,010 disappearances were recorded, an average of 40 per day, compared with the figure of 25 recorded during the previous six-year term.",
      "\u201cThere are many missing people who, in reality, have already been kidnapped by drug traffickers and buried in so-called narco-graves,\u201d said David Saucedo, a security analyst based in Mexico City. \u201cThe cartels are hiding the bodies, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing a reduction in homicides in several states across the country. But it\u2019s not that there are fewer deaths; there are fewer bodies. They\u2019re hiding the bodies,\u201d Saucedo asserted.",
      "'This shouldn't be normal'",
      "According to the latest report from the Mexican government, Guanajuato is the state with the most (980 from January to April 2025). In February 2025, the daily average reached 12.5. Last year, the National Survey of Victimization and Perception of Public Safety revealed that 87.5% of the population considered public safety to be the state\u2019s most serious problem.",
      "\u201cIn Guanajuato, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel is fighting over drug trafficking with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, and that\u2019s generating a lot of violence,\u201d Correa-Cabrera explained. \u201cThese organized crime groups are fighting for control of spaces because they need more street space, there are more feuds, and that\u2019s leading to more injuries and deaths, so they\u2019re taking control of medical centers.\u201d",
      "Noticias Telemundo visited Guanajuato to document the case of a health center in the city of Celaya, where wounded drug traffickers were treated. According to a state intelligence report, until three years ago, the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel used the San Ferm\u00edn Clinic to treat its wounded hitmen. However, in November 2022, gunmen from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel killed two men there and set fire to the now-abandoned facility.",
      "\u201cThe hospital where I work in Guanajuato isn\u2019t the only one that\u2019s suffered this, nor am I the only doctor who\u2019s experienced this. We see in the news that these people are arriving at certain public hospitals,\u201d the Guanajuato doctor said, adding that \u201cI can say that more colleagues have experienced this. One lives with anxiety, and this shouldn\u2019t be normal for us.\u201d",
      "Due to the strong presence of criminal groups, the Guanajuato state police have implemented operations in clinics and hospitals in several municipalities of the state, to prevent drug cartels from continuing to infiltrate those places.",
      "\u201cWhen people injured with a firearm arrive, the prosecutor\u2019s office sends us a custody request. When these people arrive, we coordinate to provide security at the hospitals,\u201d said Bernardo Cajero, director of the Celaya police and in charge of these security operations.",
      "However, the Guanajuato doctor explained that although the Silver Code has been established in Mexico \u2014 a protocol that requires authorities to be notified when there are episodes of violence or when a person with a gunshot wound arrives at a health center \u2014\u00a0this is not always followed.",
      "\u201cThey come and take our cellphones, cut us off from communication, and start threatening us, saying that if they see anything strange, they could hurt us themselves,\u201d the doctor said, with fear in his voice. \u201cOne of the things they\u2019re asking is that we not activate Code Silver and that we not notify the authorities.\u201d",
      "'It affects us all'",
      "Although there are no official figures on armed takeovers of health centers, the Guanajuato case is not unique in Mexico. In April 2024, a 10-person armed group entered a private medical center in Cuernavaca and shot and killed a patient in intensive care. In September, gunmen threatened staff at the Mexican Social Security Institute in Mazatl\u00e1n with the phrase \u201cIf they die, you die,\u201d forcing them to care for their wounded. Two months later, two attacks were reported at the Culiac\u00e1n General Hospital.",
      "\u201cWhat the drug cartels do is take over hospitals, kidnap nurses, doctors, specialists, blood banks, operating rooms, and whatever else they need. They are hospital centers where the wounded are seen and treated, so they can return to their criminal activities,\u201d Saucedo said.",
      "In 2022, a report by Insecurity Insight for the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition \u2014 a group of nongovernmental organizations focused on protecting health care \u2014 warned that Mexico had documented the most violent incidents against health care workers in Latin America: at that time, 14 recorded incidents, including three deaths, five kidnappings, two destroyed or damaged medical facilities and a damaged or looted  medical unit.",
      "\u201cBefore, they would leave their wounded in clinics, but then they would be finished off by rival groups,\u201d Saucedo said, \u201cnow, for added security, many drug trafficking groups are setting up private hospitals for themselves.\u201d",
      "Saucedo and other experts cited as examples of this trend the complaints about the hospital built by the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as   \u201cEl Mencho,\u201d and the mobile clinic set up by the Sinaloa Cartel\u2019s Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada.",
      "Researchers like Correa-Cabrera warn that these incidents also occur in other countries experiencing major security crises, such as Haiti, Ecuador and the Argentine city of Rosario, or in contexts of conventional warfare, such as the conflicts in Syria, Lebanon, Somalia and Libya, among others.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t something new; this is part of any armed conflict, low-intensity conflict, or war,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said, \u201cbecause health care for members of these warring groups is very important.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Guanajuato doctor says the tension generated by these incidents, in which armed groups enter hospitals, is sometimes so great that medical staff request vacation time and psychological support.",
      "\u201cThe first thing is to save that person\u2019s life, regardless of the situation or the accusations, because they are human beings,\u201d the doctor said, \u201cbut it affects us all; it can cause trauma. In fact, there were colleagues who asked for their leave, and anyone would do that. It\u2019s normal when you live with that every day.\u201d",

    "summary": "Ukranian activists warn about corruption and authoritarianism after police raids against several high-profile anti-corruption campaigners and opposition figures.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine risks backsliding on its endemic corruption problem \u2014 and even creeping toward authoritarianism \u2014 activists warn, following police raids against a high-profile anti-corruption campaigner and opposition figures.",
      "On July 11, armed police raided the home of Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center. He has accused President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of \u201ctaking the first, but confident steps toward corrupt authoritarianism,\u201d including backing laws offering amnesty to those accused of corruption in the defense industry, and passing over an independently selected candidate for a key anti-graft role.",
      "The move has perturbed even some of Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters \u2014 people who are simultaneously worried about the heavy-handed and potentially spurious crackdown on dissent, and that such criticisms against the Ukrainian leader might be used in bad faith by opponents in Moscow or Washington.",
      "\u201cThis is the red line which President Zelensky has crossed \u2014 and the red line is in a very wrong direction in terms of the development of Ukraine,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, the Kyiv-based watchdog that Shabunin co-founded. She said the State Bureau of Investigations did not have the necessary court documents for the search.",
      "Shabunin has been charged with evading military service and fraud, with prosecutors alleging that while on secondment from the front lines to continue his activism back in Kyiv, he conducted activities unrelated to his military service. His defense team and supporters say the secondment was all aboveboard and ordered by his superiors, and that the allegations are trumped up and political.",
      "The case has caused grave alarm for many inside Ukraine and abroad, with even some of those who praise Zelenskyy for making progress on corruption flagging it as cause for concern that he may be engaging in some of the same questionable practices they\u2019d hoped he was rooting out.",
      "Zelenskyy pledged to reduce corruption when he was elected in 2019, and many expert observers say he has been effective at doing so, but the tide of criticism around Shabunin\u2019s arrest comes when the president is under intense pressure to fight off Russia and keep alive support from the United States and the West that has been at risk of faltering.",
      "It\u2019s not just Shabunin\u2019s own organization that\u2019s concerned. A group of 59 nongovernmental and civil society organizations, both inside Ukraine and abroad, have signed an open letter to Zelenskyy saying the arrest \u201cbears signs of political motivation, abuse of rights\u201d and either \u201cgross incompetence\u201d or \u201ca deliberate attack to pressure\u201d Shabunin.",
      "NBC News has contacted Zelenskyy\u2019s office and the State Bureau of Investigations for comment but has not received a response.",
      "The president has been a longtime vocal advocate on the issue of fighting corruption, particularly when it comes to suggestions from the U.S. and elsewhere that the billions of dollars in military aid his country is receiving might be being misappropriated.",
      "\u201cWhere we saw risks that something could be happening with weapons, we cracked down hard,\u201d he told the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d in January.",
      "Last year Shabunin himself dismissed the idea that foreign arms could be embezzled, telling the BBC that \u201call weapons supplied by Western allies end up in the hands of Ukrainian troops who use them effectively. It is impossible to steal Western weapons.\u201d",
      "Shabunin appeared in court Tuesday and was released on \u201crecognizance\u201d \u2014 essentially released without having to post bail \u2014 until the next hearing Aug. 20.",
      "The German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank and one of the international signatories of the letter to Zelenskyy, said Ukraine had made \u201cmonumental strides\u201d on corruption in the past 11 years.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s always concerning when a government targets its vocal critics with flimsy charges in politically motivated investigations,\u201d said Josh Rudolph, managing director and senior fellow of Strategic Democracy Initiatives at the fund. \u201cAlthough this is not a sign of corruption per se, it displays an alarming disregard for the fundamental values of freedom and the rule of law at a time when the international community has been rallying around Ukraine because it is defending those very values from Russia\u2019s brutal assault.\u201d",
      "Shabunin is not the only recent arrest to cause alarm. The opposition UDAR party, headed by former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, says that a raid in April on the home of Kyiv City Council deputy Dmytro Bilotserkivets \u2014 again, they said, without the necessary documents \u2014 was a clear attempt to put pressure on political dissent.",
      "Corruption in Ukraine is a fraught and delicate topic, ripe for weaponization often in bad faith.",
      "Russia uses it as an example to support its otherwise untrue criticisms \u2014 such as Ukraine being run by neo-Nazis \u2014 while American and European politicians hold up such examples to bolster their pre-existing arguments about whether to support Kyiv\u2019s defense against Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe issue of corruption in Ukraine has long been highly politicized,\u201d said Mariya Omelicheva, a professor at the Pentagon-funded National War College in Washington, D.C.",
      "Ukrainian \u201ccorruption is almost always co-opted \u2014 either by Ukraine\u2019s supporters or, more problematically, by its adversaries,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is particularly sensitive in the current U.S. political climate, where both parties \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 have used Ukrainian corruption narratives for domestic political purposes.\u201d",
      "There is also a feeling among some Ukrainians that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d focus has allowed officials abroad to act with greater impunity knowing Washington\u2019s hitherto exacting gaze is currently less troubled by world affairs.",
      "\u201cOur international partners, particularly the United States, don\u2019t care anymore about good governance and anti-corruption and reforms,\u201d Kaleniuk said. Washington \u201cfor the last 12 years had a powerful impact on how Ukraine develops, and the U.S. was usually tough on good governance, anti-corruption reforms and developments critical for democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now America doesn\u2019t care about that.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s true Trump historically spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared to accept many of his war demands, in recent weeks he has been increasingly hostile to the Kremlin and signaled a renewed support for Ukraine, pledging Patriot missiles for Kyiv and tariffs on Moscow.",
      "It\u2019s also true that Ukraine \u2014 and Zelenskyy \u2014 have achieved some progress in the corruption fight in recent years. Transparency International, the best known international group that tracks this topic, says Ukraine has steadily improved in its annual \u201cCorruption Perceptions\u201d index \u2014 although it still ranks 105 of 180 countries worldwide.",
      "Nevertheless, domestically there are plenty of Ukrainians alarmed at what they see is a negative direction of travel when it comes to corruption in their country. Though the immediate fight is against Russia, the ultimate battle is for their values of liberty and democracy, supporters say, without which the battlefield struggle becomes pointless.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting for freedoms and for dignity,\u201d Kaleniuk said. If those are lost, \u201conly Russia will applaud.\u201d",
      "Alexander Smith and Freddie Clayton reported from London. Erin McLaughlin from Washington, D.C., and Anastasiia Parafeniuk and Daryna Mayer from Kyiv."

      "LONDON \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres has made no secret of her new British life, posting social media clips of sheep charmingly trotting into her luxury rural home while she mows the lawn of the sprawling estate, her trademark hair now natural and undyed.",
      "On Sunday she confirmed for the first time that she moved to the United Kingdom permanently for one reason: the election of President Donald Trump in November.",
      "\u201cWe got here the day before the election and woke up to lots of texts from our friends with crying emojis, and I was like, \u2018He got in.\u2019 And we\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019re staying here,\u201d she told an audience at the Everyman Theatre in Cheltenham, central England.",
      "After her long-running talk show ended amid allegations of workplace bullying, DeGeneres, 67, bought a home in England\u2019s picturesque Cotswolds region with her wife, \u201cArrested Development\u201d star Portia de Rossi, 52.",
      "With its honey-colored stone, lush greenery and chocolate-box villages, tis 800 square-mile haven is home to a slew of celebrities, including David and Victoria Beckham, music mogul Simon Cowell and supermodel Kate Moss.",
      "It was initially meant to be a transatlantic bolt-hole, she said. But asked Sunday whether Trump\u2019s election cemented the move as permanent, she answered an unequivocal, \u201cYes,\u201d in comments the theater confirmed as accurate Monday.",
      "\u201cEverything here is just better,\u201d DeGeneres said, lamenting the state of her homeland.",
      "\u201cI wish we were at a place where it was not scary for people to be who they are. I wish that we lived in a society where everybody could accept other people and their differences,\u201d she said. \u201cSo until we\u2019re there, I think there\u2019s a hard place to say we have huge progress.\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for a response to the criticisms.",
      "DeGeneres also referred to moves by the Southern Baptist Convention to endorse banning same-sex marriage and overturning a Supreme Court ruling legalizing it nationwide.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to literally stop it from happening in the future and possibly reverse it,\u201d she said. \u201cPortia and I are already looking into it, and if they do that, we\u2019re going to get married here.\u201d",
      "She also addressed the demise of \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" after 19 seasons, almost two decades and more than 60 Emmys after staff members complained of a toxic workplace environment.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a direct person, and I\u2019m very blunt, and I guess sometimes that means that,\" she said with a pause, \"I\u2019m mean?\u201d",
      "The theater's CEO, Mark Goucher, said in an email that it \"was a huge privilege to meet her and have her at The Everyman. Our door will always be open to our new neighbor.\u201d",
      "DeGeneres is not the first person to have toyed with leaving America's increasingly polarized social and political landscape.",

      "In early February, days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, a poll of 2,000 people by Talker Research found that 17% wanted to leave in the next five years, with the top destination of choice being Canada; 69% of those respondents said they didn\u2019t like the direction the country was headed in, and 65% said it had become too toxic.",
      "Trump has previously given short shrift to potential wantaways. \u201cIf you\u2019re not happy, you can leave,\u201d he said in 2019.",
      "While DeGeneres appears to be enjoying an idyllic rural life, there is some evidence the grass may not be greener on the other side of the pond.",
      "Though the U.K. is often vaunted for its universal free health care, public transportation network and lack of mass shootings, it actually performs worse than the United States on a raft of quality-of-life indices measured by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which tracks such data.",
      "Out of 40 countries in the OECD, the United States ranks 10th in the \u201cBetter Life Index,\u201d which rates nations on everything from housing and income to life satisfaction, community and work-life balance. The U.K. is 14th."

    "story": [
      "A genetic test may one day predict a child\u2019s risk of obesity in adulthood, paving the way for early interventions.",
      "Certain genetic variants can affect how a person\u2019s body stores fat or make them more prone to overeating. Genetic variation can also predict how well a person will respond to different weight loss drugs.",
      "In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, more than 600 researchers from around the world worked together to compile genetic data from more than 5 million people \u2014 the largest and most diverse genetic dataset to date. They also used genetic data from 23andMe.",
      "From the dataset, the researchers were able to create what\u2019s known as a polygenic risk score, which takes into account which genetic variants a person has that have been linked to a higher BMI in adulthood.",
      "The score, the researchers said, could be used to predict a person\u2019s risk of obesity as an adult \u2014 before they even turn 5.",
      "\u201cChildhood is the best time to intervene,\u201d said study co-author Ruth Loos, a professor at the University of Copenhagen\u2019s Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research. (Research conducted at the center is not influenced by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, though some of the study authors had ties to pharmaceutical companies that make weight loss drugs.)",
      "The findings come as obesity is rising around the world. Rates of obesity in adults have more than doubled globally since 1990, and adolescent rates have quadrupled, according to the World Health Organization. About 16% of adults worldwide have obesity and the situation is worse in the United States, where more than 40% of adults have obesity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics show.",
      "Twice as effective",
      "The new test is not the first that predicts a person\u2019s risk of obesity, but Loos and her team showed it was about twice as effective as the method doctors currently use to assess their patients. That polygenetic score can account for about 8.5% of a person\u2019s risk for having a high BMI as an adult. The new score increased that to about 17.6%, at least in people with European ancestry.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty powerful risk indicator for obesity, but it still leaves open a lot that is unknown,\u201d said Dr. Roy Kim, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s who was not involved with the research.",
      "Based on this score, more than 80% of a person\u2019s risk for obesity can be explained by other factors, such as where they live, what kinds of foods they have access to, and how much they exercise.",
      "The test was not nearly as effective in predicting obesity risk in non-Europeans. It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.",
      "About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.",
      "Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it\u2019s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more \u2014 and more diverse \u2014 data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.",
      "She said the score could offer one indicator \u2014 what high blood pressure is to heart disease, for example \u2014 that could help predict a person\u2019s risk of developing obesity.",
      "\u201cObesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,\u201d Loos said. \u201cFor the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.\u201d Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.",
      "Still, identifying a person\u2019s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.",
      "\u201cBehavioral things are really important,\u201d Kim said. \u201cTheir environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person\u2019s obesity risk.\u201d",
      "How important are genetics, really?",
      "Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.",
      "\u201cEven with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.\u201d",
      "Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person\u2019s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.",
      "\u201cObesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,\u201d said Simonetti, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study.",
      "Simonetti uses a person\u2019s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.",
      "\u201cThey eat but do not feel full,\u201d Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations \u201ctend to have higher weight,\u201d she said.",
      "But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said. The genes that a person inherits from either parent, even if they are not mutations, also determine how a person\u2019s body stores weight or uses energy. Both can play a big role in obesity risk.",
      "Genetic testing is also starting to be able to determine how well certain weight loss drugs will work for a person, Simonetti said, but she added this is just the beginning.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about three out of 80 mutations that we can treat,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are getting better, and the more data we have, I\u2019m hopeful that we are going to do a better job in being more precise in understanding treatment responses.\u201d"
